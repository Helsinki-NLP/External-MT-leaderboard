Munich, 1856: Four maps that change your view of the city
A mental institution where young people meet today.
A tomb chapel, now being dug for the subway tunnel.
Small gardeners tend the land once owned by farmers.
The oldest official map of Munich reveals exciting stories.
It's annoying when maps aren't up to date.
Anyone who's ever had to get upset because the traffic light showed a green meadow instead of a bypass road knows that.
The historical maps of the digital Bavarian atlas, a service provided by the Bavarian State Government's Geoportal, are far from up-to-date - but are therefore very informative.
Especially when you compare it to current online maps.
It will then show how cities and municipalities in the Munich Mercury distribution area have changed since the 19th century.
The digital Bavarian atlas is a patchwork of patches that are not immediately recognizable as such.
The large overview map incorporates more detailed maps of cities and municipalities, known as Urpositionblätter.
These were created between 1810 and 1864 according to the Bavarian Survey Administration and originate from the first survey of Bavaria.
Her client is Napoleon.
The French commander occupied Bavaria from the spring of 1800 during the War of the Second Coalition with Austria.
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographic survey of Bavaria - for military purposes, of course.
Although the French troops finally withdrew with the Peace of Lunéville of 9 February 1801, it was the present-day neighbours who created the idea of a land-wide Bavarian map.
Elector Max IV Joseph pushed the project forward, founding the "Topographical Bureau" - and thus the Bavarian Survey Administration.
The original position sheet for Munich dates from 1856 and can be found on the Internet site of the Bavarian State Library.
The comparison between then and now is most striking in the case of the capital.
The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.
An example is Untersendling, which appears relatively isolated on the 1856 map.
Sendling was incorporated 21 years after the map was drawn up, in 1877, as a borough of Munich.
Today, the underworld is in the middle of the city.
The houses of Untersendlings are concentrated around 1856 along the present-day Plinganserstraße, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the uprising of Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705.
Where the West Park is today, you see nothing but fields - at first glance: when zooming in, a smaller map appears with dozens of lines and numbers: hand-numbered plots from the so-called "original record" from which the property tax was derived.
Small plots are no longer occupied by farmers - but by small gardeners from the "Land in Sun".
A large green area is to the north of Untersendling.
The Theresienwiese, the site of the Oktoberfest since 1810, was actually a meadow in the 19th century - not a concrete desert.
On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.
In the Urpositionsblatt, in the area of today's Au-Haidhausen district, you can read not only the street name "am Gasteig" or the hill "Auf den Lüften" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt".
Yes, here on Auerfeldstrasse, people with delusions were once locked up.
It was there that the Munich County Lunatic Asylum "On the Auer Lüften" was founded in 1858/59.
From 1872 onwards, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden headed the institution - the psychiatrist who is brought in in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.
"He was progressive for his time, for example, ending the inquisition of the so-called lunatics.
He also forbade the staff to use violence against the inmates", says Hermann Wilhelm, director of the Haidhausen Museum, who worked on an exhibition for the institution.
Initially, 280 patients were accommodated, but this was later increased to 500.
At some point, even this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the district icehouse in Haar in 1905.
Since 2006, the Isar-Amper-Klinikum Munich-Ost, one of the largest psychiatric hospitals in Germany, has been located there.
On the grounds of the former Auer institution, young people now meet in the Salesianum in Munich.
The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with training facilities.
To the west is the football field of TSV München Ost, to the east are residential buildings from the 1980s.
In 2015, the children's home "Casa Don Bosco" was built - in architectural style of the original building of the asylum for the insane, which was destroyed in World War II in bomb attacks.
The Marienplatz was listed as the "Mainplatz" around 1856, the Kaufingerstrasse was called "Kaufinger Gasse".
The Second World War also brought a decisive change to the heart of Munich.
Allied bombs tore many holes in the city center in December 1944.
A large one remained until today - at Marienhof.
The English Institute, small commercial buildings and a medieval graveyard chapel once stood at the Marienhof, where the preliminary work and the groundbreaking for the second S-Bahn main line are currently taking place.
The slider compares the old Munich map with today's aerial view and fills in the hole at Marienhof.
A civil rights group has issued a travel advisory for Missouri .
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has issued a warning to people of color traveling to Missouri due to the state's discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
"The NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri, effective August 28, 2017, urges African American travelers, visitors and Missourians to exercise extreme caution and caution when traveling through the state as a number of questionable, race-based incidents have recently occurred throughout the state and are noted here", the group's statement said.
A recently passed Missouri law that makes it harder for people to win discrimination lawsuits, as well as the state's law enforcement agencies disproportionately targeting minorities, prompted the group to issue the travel warning, the NAACP said.
"You have civil rights violations that happen to people.
They are stopped because of their color, they are beaten or killed", Missouri NAACP president Rod Chapel told the Kansas City Star.
"We're hearing complaints at a frequency we've never heard before".
It is the first such warning the organization has issued to a state in the United States.
The group cited incidents such as racist abuse against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died under questionable circumstances earlier this year after running out of gas while traveling through the state and being taken into custody by Missouri police without being charged with a crime.
The Council also points to a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General's office showing that black drivers are 75 percent more likely to be stopped in the state than white drivers.
"The recommendation is that people be aware and inform their families, friends and employees about what could happen in Missouri", Chapel said.
"People have to be prepared whether it's bringing bail money or letting relatives know they're traveling through the state".
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest numbers from the FBI's Hate Crime Reporting Program, which ranks the state 16th in the nation in terms of the number of such violations.
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it harder to sue a business for housing or employment discrimination.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had previously issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the states passed immigration laws requiring local law enforcement to arrest people for immigration violations, which the ACLU believes will contribute to further racial profiling.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but recently, interest groups have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the US.
The pasture fence project is elementary
The Fischerbach grazing fence project is a successful project and will be continued next year.
The CDU members Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac took a picture on the spot.
At the Schwendemann family's courthouse, representatives of the Fischerbach CDU local association met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two MPs.
Markus Schwendemann first gave insight into his farm, where he farms 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, raises 40 dairy cows and the same number of young animals and hosts holidaymakers in five apartments.
The "black forest milk" is for him the only alternative marketing route for the milk of his cows, says Schwendemann.
The table of the holiday guests is exclusively regional.
As he is also the chairman of the BLHV of Fischerbach, he described the grazing fence project as "elementally important".
I can't make a profit on such steep terrain.
The green area is a lot of work, and much of it has to be done with the motor sense.
"We are struggling with the conditions and the topography", Schwendemann stressed.
In 2003, he took over the parent holding and managed it without chemical protection and fertilisers, even though he is not an organic farmer.
For Mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear: 'The municipality has recognised the importance of the pasture fence project and is pleased with the Leader funding.'
The cost of the project is between EUR 3000 and EUR 4000 per hectare.
It is hoped that this will help to prolong the afforestation for a while.
"The greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and are concerned about how to keep their business going", the mayor stressed.
Farmers are often criticized for the support
The grassland fencing scheme enabled a total of 25 parcels of land from 11 participants to be fenced in 2013.
The area of open ground is therefore 40 hectares, which must not be reforested until at least 2023.
Of the total costs of EUR 71 500, half was financed through Leader and a quarter by the municipality of Fischerbach.
The farmers thus had to invest EUR 12 610 in 16.2 km of grazing fence.
"The big advantage is the durability of the fences", explained Schwendemann.
Kordula Kovac stressed: 'You are doing a really good job, without farmers and women farmers, we cannot do anything.'
Peter Weiß was also convinced: "This is where the best food is produced".
The Landscape Directive (LPR) Baden-Württemberg allows for state support for grazing lands.
The goal is to keep the Black Forest open.
The condition is that there is a supporting environment defined by the LPR.
The area to be fenced must also be unsuitable for trawling (incline above 35 percent) and therefore threatened by reforestation.
The Fischerbach 2018 pasture fence project is currently being applied for by eight participants with 24 plots, who want to build a fence of almost 16 kilometers.
The area of the farm is 35 hectares and the estimated cost is more than 112 000 euros.
Nothing is sacred anymore?
Now the Trump White House is taking over the Statue of Liberty
The surest sign of regime change is when they start attacking the statues.
The Americans value this as much as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein in Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he was doing when he took a symbolic axe to the Statue of Liberty in a heated argument with CNN's Jim Acosta about the president's proposals to drastically curb legal immigration.
To be fair, Miller didn't attack the statue itself.
A bunch of boat owners and Liberty impersonators would have lynched him if he did.
But he attacked its meaning, and especially the meaning attributed to it, when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus was added to its base in 1903, 17 years after the monument was completed.
When Miller Acosta scolded, "I don't want to go into a whole thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that lights up the world.
The poem you're referring to was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty".
Miller is factually correct, but as he put it, it's not really about history.
It is about the contemporary response to the stirring words of Lazarus, the only one in which a state invites not just any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "Your tired, your poor, / your oppressed masses who yearn to breathe freely, / the miserable waste of your rich shores".
There has never been a better time to see the "miserable waste" on our screens.
Miller wasn't engaged in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump's U.S.
This conflict over the meaning of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural debate: it's actually a conflict over the meaning of America.
Lazarus and her friends, who were committed to putting their words on the ground after her death, knew very well that they were doing a highly political thing.
The sculpture was intended to show the connections between French and American republicanism by depicting the female embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classic pictorial representation.
Lazarus changed this meaning: In her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract - she has a voice.
And she gives herself a whole other name: Mother of the Exile.
The link between the poem and the picture is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the right wing people have long wanted to change that.
The big-mouthed Rush Limbaugh, a sort of John the Baptist for Trump's coming, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty was not inviting anyone, but rather an early neoconservative bringing the American flame into the night-bound world: "Lady Liberty is going forward.
She's supposed to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch is not to light the way to the United States".
It's quite unusual that Limbaugh came across something here.
The significance of the statue is entirely a matter of perception.
Lazarus' great act of imagination was to see her as she was seen by the exhausted, miserable, but hopeful people on the decks of ships after long and often terrible journeys.
It's really about seeing the world from the perspective of people who are looking for refuge and a chance to improve their lives.
Her statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they need to hear.
And that's not the perspective that Miller and Trump would ever want to acknowledge.
Their torch should not light the way, but ignite the hatred that is their only source of power.
World Cup 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the Great Britain team
Eilidh Doyle recalls a time when only two Scots were on the British team
The UK Athletics Director Neil Black says the 16-man Scottish World Cup squad "will make a massive contribution to the team".
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for London 2017, which starts on Friday.
Black believes that "something special is developing in Scotland" and that UK athletics needs to learn from this.
"We welcome it, and we try to understand it, and we'll keep at it until we find out", Black said.
"I've been talking to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they did.
The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they did.
British athletics: it has something to do with what they did.
And the guy on the corner.
Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it's absolutely brilliant".
Several of the Scottish athletes are medal contenders, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah in the 5,000m, while Eilidh Doyle was elected by the team as team captain.
"Eilidh is rather modest.
"I'm so glad you're here.
"A number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they lived or trained, walked out of the room feeling very proud and very motivated.
The passion and genuine feeling that Eilidh brought naturally was great".
The Commonwealth silver medallist, who will compete in her fifth World Championships in the 400m hurdles, says it is "incredible" that 16 Scots are on the British team.
Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Championships to date was seven, achieved in 1983 and 2015.
The middle distance runner Muir leads the way, setting five British and two European records last year.
She's going to run the 1,500 and the 5,000.
Chris O'Hare, running the 1,500m, is another Scot to watch after a great season that included victories at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers her first World Cups when the only other Scot on the team was Lee McConnell.
The team captain says she is "enormously proud" that many of her compatriots will not only be part of the team but in some cases will also be taking part in the medals and finals.
"The special thing about being a team captain is that she was chosen by the other members of the team, so it was a great honour anyway, but knowing that my teammates voted for me and chose me makes it very special to me", she added.
"Obviously I'm very proud of all the Scots on the team.
It just shows how far we've come.
And they're here as established athletes, athletes who want to get on the podium.
About my speech as captain?
Yeah, I think she did okay.
I was just pointing out that we're very happy in this situation, because we have a home World Cup.
So it's really important to rely on this home support and take advantage of being back in the Olympic Stadium.
I'm gonna get a second chance to go out there and compete and it's just going to be such a great atmosphere out there".
Blocking critics on Facebook: Don't run for public office if you can't stand the heat from voters
The father of our country knew something about bad press.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long for the newspapers to beat him up for everything from his domestic policies to his political principles.
He was a bit of a critic, I'm sure.
But he did not silence his critics.
Because in 1783, Washington said, "Freedom of speech can be taken away - and, dumb and dumb, we will be led like sheep to the slaughter".
Which brings me to Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, who needs to work on being more like Washington.
Hogan's staff has blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinions on his official Facebook page.
And the American Civil Liberties Union sued him earlier this week.
The governor's staff dismissed the lawsuit as frivolous, and online commentary was full of a backlash with "So, what?"
"It's just Facebook", many people said.
But it's important.
And it's especially important when it's a guy like Hogan.
This is a Republican governor in a vastly overwhelmingly democratic state that is amazingly popular.
He has the second-highest approval rating of the 50 governors in the nation.
Hogan is not a reactionary hothead.
He has shown firmness in the leadership of his country and strict adherence to principles.
He was also very adept at using Facebook as a primary means of connecting with his constituents and debuting his hairless head after chemotherapy on his page.
So blocking people who come to the governor's side - which is a public forum that's called official and staffed by people who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan's spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor's actions, arguing that blocking comments was nothing more than moderation.
But it's too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful people whipping up the whip online.
The Post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And these are just real people talking to their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a minister, not trolls.
They all said their comments were respectful, thoughtful, and not profane.
The minister quoted the Bible in his letter and appealed to Hogan's Catholic faith.
Attorney Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hateful, but she was asking about hate crimes.
"I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other current news", she wrote in the comments section of The Post news program.
"I also do not like this idea, when a number of people have a say on the same issue, then they are dismissed by some as a so-called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of concerned citizens".
What the governor's staff called a "concentrated spam attack" others would probably call "spam".
The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It's much cleaner than in the old days, when you would have done the same thing, sending employees to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials or arrest and silence protesters.
But that's exactly what's happening digitally right now.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticized for abusing Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is being sued by Twitter users who have been blocked from his Twitter feed.
One of the first milestones in this matter came last week in Virginia.
The chairwoman of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banned a voter from her Facebook page.
And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU for his use of Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that hard.
In Washington's time, the era of affordable port had an effect similar to the Internet.
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter writers responded to his leadership.
And even then, Washington had anonymous trolls.
The people who used pseudonyms like "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius", and "Portius" all wrote letters to newspapers denigrating Washington's decisions.
Petitions criticizing his position on the Treaty of Amity, trade and shipping with Britain overwhelmed his office, according to historical documents collected from the George Washington Project's online papers.
But he didn't shut them up.
Freedom of speech, dissent and discourse are the foundation of our nation.
And true leadership means accepting that.
Ronan Rafferty is hoping for home comforts at the Renaissance Club .
Former European No. 1 Ronan Rafferty will be looking to settle in for the next three days as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
The Nordire, who led the Archerfield Links to the final round last year before losing to Paul Eales, is linked to the new venue and acts as tournament ambassador on behalf of the club's founder and CEOs Jerry Sarvadi.
"I saw the Renaissance Club being built, and we're seeing it rise to fame with this event", Rafferty said.
"The players will see this course at its best, it's in great shape.
Jerry did a great job when he set up this place.
He's a passionate advocate of this game and proud of his accomplishments here.
This is a great window into this course".
Englishman Eales is looking forward to defending his first championship, despite winning on both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
"It feels really special", said the Southport-born player.
"I was unable to defend the Extremadura Open because it was removed from the programme the year after I won it.
Coming back to this part of the world is magical.
It's a wonderful place to play golf.
The memories of last year come back, and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon to win here last year.
It was a truly special time and one that we will cherish forever".
Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Tour earlier this year after his 50th birthday, is back in action on home soil.
This event will be his first Scottish appearance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"It always means a little more when you play at home", said Orr, the man from Helensburgh.
"You want to do well, but you also feel this extra pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again, and I played solid golf.
I'm happy with how it turned out".
With the trio on the field are former Masters champion Ian Woosnam and Senior Major champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six Scots on the field, the others being Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Admission is free, parking costs £5 per car with one occupant and £10 per car with two or more occupants.

Less lung cancer deaths from secondhand smoke
In the past two decades, fewer people have died from lung cancer due to secondhand smoke.
This is the conclusion reached by scientists at the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) in a study.
"We estimate that 167 lung cancer deaths a year are due to secondhand smoke", said study leader Heiko Becher.
He used his own study on the subject from 1994 as a comparison.
At that time, there were still 400 lung cancer deaths per year in Germany due to secondhand smoke.
The new study is published in the International Journal of Public Health.
Home connections are proving to be very complex
The construction work on Villinger Straße is in full swing and "is somewhat ahead of schedule", says Fred Heinze, the manager of the yard.
The situation in the area of house connections is more complicated than expected, as there is much hidden underground that is not recorded in the plans.
The traffic, which is always hindering the construction work, is a big problem for the construction team of the company Stumpp.
"The ignorance of drivers about red lights and traffic lights is already enormous", reports Heinze.
The road was closed and only regular buses were allowed to pass.
Angelo Caruso, Marvin Kostorz and Tim Kostorz from Stumpp have been busy working on the bridge for weeks.
"The hot days have been quite tiring.
But fortunately, our friend Fritz Matt provided us with cool mineral water", says Marvin Kostorz.
Poverty and Death in the Indonesian Gold Country
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use a stove.
She rarely even uses a pot.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of the Paniai Regency in Indonesia's troubled province of Papua, the housewife usually places a sweet potato - locally called "nota" - directly in the fireplace.
After half an hour, the charred tuber is removed and swallowed with eager, unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the mud floor - she has no furniture - where she also does her daily work, such as washing clothes with cloudy water from the nearby swamp.
A bucket in a roofless room serves as a latrine.
As the youngest of her husband's four wives, she was not assigned any fields.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: Most villagers are unemployed, many drink heavily, and there are soldiers here.
"No one dares to walk around the village after 5 p.m"., she says.
It is a rare glimpse into daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was incorporated in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia, when only 1,026 elders were asked to vote by publicly raising their hands before the occupying forces.
An existing movement for independence against Dutch rule quickly turned against the Jakarta government, which controls the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, with the independent part of Papua New Guinea comprising the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is as remote as it is boring, and the journey includes a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital Jayapura to Nabire and then a five-hour morning drive by rental car.
There is no public transport.
The city of about 19,000 is made up of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences and corrugated tin roofs that have been rusted to various yellowish-brown hues.
Very few Indonesians have made the journey here, let alone journalists and virtually no foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, the Mee Pago Papuans worshipped a god called Uga Tamee.
There were other changes.
"We weren't used to wearing these clothes", says Degei, pointing to her vibrant, hand-woven turban, dark shirt, and light skirt.
"We used to have leaves on our bodies".
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, where 28 percent of the population lives below the poverty line and has some of the worst child mortality and literacy rates in Asia.
But it's also Indonesia's gold country.
The world's largest and most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, owned by Freeport McMoran of Phoenix, is just 60 miles from Paniai, a highland province the size of New Jersey with 153,000 residents.
In 2015 alone, Freeport mined $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper.
In addition, Papua has timber resources worth an estimated $78 billion.
But these riches are a source of misery for Papua, ensuring that Indonesia's powerful military maintains a suffocating presence.
A 2005 investigation in The New York Times reported that Freeport paid local military personnel and units nearly $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 to a single officer.
Papuan demands for greater autonomy threaten these golden geese and they are treated mercilessly.
According to activists, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed and thousands have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969.
Mass killings in Papua's tribal highlands in the 1970s were classified as genocide by the Asian Human Rights Commission.
In the region alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters last year.
"We will lose everything", says a 2016 report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane, which includes reports of atrocities from the previous year, including unlawful executions and torture - rape and electrocution are especially popular, according to another report - and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations.
"It's difficult to count the number of victims because incidents happen every week", says Andreas Harsono, an Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch.
The screws have been tightened as Papua's resources bring an influx of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
The province's population of 3.5 million is 83% Christian, but the demographic trend is changing as Muslim economic migrants come from the populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese warung canteens sell fried chicken and gado-gado, a mixed vegetable served with peanut sauce.
Locals are struggling to keep up.
"The migrants have started selling chicken and vegetables at a cheaper price than the local Papuan market", explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old Paniai resident who moved to the provincial capital Jayapura to work.
"It cost the local Papuans - the Mama-Mama [women] of Papua - their market".
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, promised during his 2014 election campaign to address inequality and human rights abuses in Papua.
The former carpenter secured 27 of Papua's 29 districts - including Paniai - on his way to the presidential palace in Jakarta.
But little has changed in Papua, and today the locals feel betrayed.
"Our hearts are broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014 with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored", You says.
In fact, Paniai hit a low point just two months after Jokowi's inauguration in October.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children were out singing Christmas carols by a campfire in Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers on a motorcycle broke through the darkness.
The frightened children told them to turn on their headlights.
One of the soldiers was offended by her tone and later returned with four soldiers, according to local pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers, who had been drinking, chased and beat the group with their rifle butts, victims and witnesses said.
Then one of the soldiers fired at the group of children.
One child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so badly that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the nearby government commission building was set on fire and things escalated the next day.
About 1,000 young Papuan men, women and children gathered on a football field outside the local police station and military command center to demand justice.
They carried ceremonial hunting bows and performed the Waita dance - running in circles and imitating a bird's song - of the Mee Pago tribe of Papua.
Some protesters began throwing stones at police and military posts.
As the mood heated up, an order was sent to the soldiers via an internal radio: "If the masses resist more than three times, shoot them dead", says an official document from TIME that was not released to local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the head of the Kego Koto neighborhood of Enarotali, saw the imminent danger and called for calm and urged the crowd to return home.
No one was in the mood to listen.
"When I turned around, I was suddenly shot in my left wrist", he told TIME on the porch of his colorfully painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who fired the shot, but he says the bullet came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered here.
"It was crowded, many shots were fired", he adds.
Local man Alfius Youw was shot three times, according to his cousin, who witnessed the shooting.
"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure it was him", said Yohanes, who, like many Indonesians, has only one name, Time, in a gloomy mood.
"I saw he was dead... I kissed him".
Papua's chief police inspector, Yotje Mende, told reporters that his officers were only trying to "secure" her station because it was under attack.
"We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us", said Papua Police spokesman Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo in 2015.
"It's a matter of life and death".
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many more injured.
News of the killings did not reach Jakarta until the next day.
For three weeks, Jokowi gave a passionate speech in Jayapura, expressing sympathy for the families of the victims and vowing to address the historic grievances in Papua.
"I want this case solved immediately so it won't happen again", he said.
In October 2016, Security Minister Wiranto said he would establish an extrajudicial mechanism to address historical human rights violations.
But the excuses started almost immediately.
"Most of the injuries were long ago.
Some were in the '90s and early 2000s.
The point is that we are committed to addressing these violations, but there are processes that need to be passed through", he said.
Then Wiranto backed down when he spoke to TIME in Jakarta on June 5th, saying he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, he said, "everything is regulated by law".
Wiranto, who has been charged by the UN with "crimes against humanity" that claimed more than 1,000 lives in East Timor's bloody 1999 independence vote, said 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua had already been resolved, including the Paniai incident.
Families of the Paniai victims received such claims with fierce disbelief.
"I was interviewed four times in the last three years, but there was no progress", says Yohanes.
"I'm tired of it".
He says that years later, he still lives in fear.
"I'm scared", he says.
"I'm afraid of being arrested by the military, I'm afraid of being shot".
His brother Yacobus repeated the view that the people in Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He says he was beaten by the military after helping bury four of the victims.
"After I buried the bodies, the military came looking for me", he says.
The shooting hasn't stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police opened fire on villagers in Paniais's Deiyai neighborhood.
During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company who refused to take an unconscious man to the hospital, one person died and 17 others were injured, including children.
The man, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on the way to the hospital.
Excited villagers protested in front of the company's field office.
Police said villagers threw stones at officers who responded by firing warning shots.
But locals say the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) started shooting at the crowd, killing one.
"We were so panicked, we were afraid of revenge", says 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and witnessed the injured being rushed here, according to TIME.
"I hid in my house for two days".
The Deiyai Parliament called for the officers involved to be held accountable and for the mobile police brigade to be withdrawn from the area.
Paniai has always been a hotbed of unrest for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development is fueling the discontent of the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes living in the green highlands of Papua.
Many joined the Free Papua Movement (FPM), a rebel army that claims to defend the rights of Papuans by launching sporadic attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders are from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response, thousands of people have been arrested and arbitrarily detained in Paniai in recent years, under the pretext of 'ensuring national sovereignty'.
Some never show up.
Among the people of Papua, Paniai is known as "a tragic, forgotten place".
Poverty increases discontent.
The little rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for the locals.
Bread is just as out of reach.
People here grow everything they eat, mostly nuts and fruits and leafy vegetables.
The agricultural sector is the responsibility of women, who can each cultivate four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
They keep most of the harvest for the family, while the rest is sold at the local market.
Ten notes cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities have grown between the local Papuans and the new migrants who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new air routes to Nabire Airport.
The few jobs available in the region tend to go to the better-educated and wealthier migrants.
Papua has rarely the capital or skills to run its own businesses competitively.
"The young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there are no jobs or money here", says John Gobai, chairman of the Paniai tribal council.
Isolation keeps the world's eyes off Papua.
In addition, restrictions on international media coverage remain tense.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua for lack of coordination with related institutions, despite being given the rare permission to film.
According to Phelim Kine, the deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch, Jokowi's campaign promises to lift restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development have not been fulfilled.
"There are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to cover Indonesia's troubled eastern provinces of Papua and West Papua: visa denial and a blacklist", he said in a statement.
Lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely limited to Papua's immediate neighbors.
In March, six Pacific nations - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the "various and widespread violations" in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.
The same countries have historically supported the OPM.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir denied the group's accusations, telling reporters in Jakarta: "Indonesia is still a democratic system, and there is a free media, so it is difficult to cover up the evidence in human rights cases".
The local people want more foreign governments to take note.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on May 4, locals broke their silence and urged him "We want freedom", according to a source who also attended the meeting but wishes to remain anonymous.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but the Papuan people say they are unlikely to vote for Jokowi again.
"Jokowi is a man of good intentions, but he is surrounded by people who are involved in the Paniai shootings", says Gobai, the tribal council chairman.
He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people, apart from living under the constant threat of a predatory military, are in poor educational and health services.
Gobai says that the Paniai people, like other Papuan people, see their vote for Jokowi as a "debt" that he must pay back.
"They don't need money, they just want justice", he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, families of the Paniai victims carried out a final symbolic act of defiance: the body of one victim was buried on a plot of land directly opposite the police and military station.
They know they may never get justice, but at least they don't let those responsible forget their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed", says Yacobus, his head bowed.
"What else can we do?"
Fire engulfs Dubai's Torch skyscraper for the second time
A fire broke out Friday in one of the world's tallest residential towers in Dubai, forcing hundreds of residents to flee the 337-meter (79 storey) building.
It is the second fire to sweep through the tower, which is also known as the Torch Tower, in just two years.
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported, and there was no direct word on the cause of the fire.
"We slept and we woke up to the fire alarm and the screams of the people.
We ran down the stairs, and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor", a resident who gave his name as George told Reuters.
Dubai's Civil Protection authorities said firefighting units extinguished the fire and cooled the building around 4 a.m. local time (00.00 GMT).
The government said it was working to provide shelter for those affected.
The incident may revive questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high-rise buildings around the world.
An investigation by the management of the Torch building after its fire in 2015 found that most of the damage came from the cladding, the exterior cladding to the decoration or insulation.
In Britain, police said they believe the system of insulation and cladding panels at London's Grenfell Tower may have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in June that killed about 80 people.
No Davis Cup reform: continued best of five
The president of the International Tennis Federation (ITF) has failed at the General Assembly with his big Davis Cup coup.
At the meeting in Ho Chi Minh City, the sport's revolutionary proposal to limit Davis Cup singles to two sets of bets was not supported by the required two-thirds majority.
The five-movement classics, which are often very long but also highly regarded for this reason, are thus preserved in the traditional competition.
63.54% of member countries voted in favour of the reform, thus narrowly missing ITF President David Haggerty's goal.
"We respect this decision but are disappointed that our member nations have not adopted the full reform package for the Davis Cup and Fed Cup.
We need a change to ensure the long-term future of these iconic and historic competitions", Haggerty said.
The Commission will continue to work to improve the application.
The vote had not even begun when, after many objections, the proposal to hold the final at a neutral venue had already been made.
New from 2018 are only comparatively minor details: Thus, the finalists in the Davis Cup and Fed Cup will in the future have the right to host the first round in the following year.
To reduce costs for the organisers, requirements for training places etc. will be eased and players will have to complete fewer official media appointments before the Davis Cup.
More than 1 in 5 U.S. travelers bring prohibited items on board, survey finds
A survey of airline passengers found that more than 20 percent knowingly or unknowingly smuggled prohibited items past U.S. Transportation Security Administration checkpoints, including at least 6 percent who entered the plane while accidentally carrying prohibited knives or other items with blades.
Less than 1 percent said they had been late to discover that they had accidentally travelled with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
The survey of more than 1,000 people - conducted by a jet charter service, Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - also found that younger travelers are more likely to break the rules.
Of those who admitted to knowingly trying to fly something that was prohibited by the TSA, 19.7 percent were millennials, compared with less than 15 percent who were members of Generation X.
The most common items that were deliberately smuggled past TSA agents were food and liquids.
More than 3 percent admitted knowingly carrying knives through security, while 2.2 percent of female and 3.7 percent of male respondents also admitted to intentionally bringing prohibited drugs on board.
The company said it surveyed travelers across the country to find out how many had accidentally smuggled goods through airport security and how many had done so intentionally.
It's no surprise that the people who were most likely to smuggle contraband - knowingly or unknowingly - through security were the ones who flew the most.
However, the company points out that the TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People are often unsure of what liquids they can take with them or how much of it.
So it's no surprise that the bulk of the items seized by the TSA are prohibited liquids.
For a while, people thought the TSA might consider books contraband.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
Elon Musk doesn't care, tens of thousands of Tesla customers are canceling orders.
Electric billionaire Elon Musk likes to brag about the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla "Model 3".
He has so far failed to ensure that some customers have already withdrawn their non-binding reservation.
In addition to the ever-thriving sales figures and even bigger sales targets, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has revealed another, less glamorous figure for the first time when announcing the latest quarterly balance sheet: the cancellations of the new mass market model 3.
Musk had been advertising frequently in recent months with the more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car, which is just beginning to be delivered.
Now Musk admits that out of the total of 518,000 pre-orders, 63,000 have already been withdrawn.
Critics have repeatedly pointed out that these are merely non-binding reservations.
In the event of cancellation, Tesla will fully refund the "reservation deposit" of 1000 euros (1000 US dollars in the United States and 1000 pounds in the United Kingdom).
Currently, 455,000 such non-binding reservations are in place, Musk admitted in a conference call with analysts.
The Tesla CEO does not believe that the cancellation of about 12 percent of all orders so far could become a problem.
His argument: the challenge with ambitious growth targets is not on the demand side, but on the production side.
Last year, Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.
In 2018, we expect to see 500,000 -- all models combined -- in 2020, we expect to see a million.
The demand for it is obvious.
According to Musk, there are currently 1,800 bookings a day.
If you order a Model 3 today, you can expect to see it delivered in the second half of 2018 at the earliest - if Tesla manages to run its brand-new production lines, which have never been tested in practice, without major interruptions and at maximum capacity.
Many experts doubt that this is possible.
But if there are any further delays, the non-binding nature of the reservations could become a problem for Tesla.
Because then the company can't stop dissatisfied customers from running off in droves.
EPA chief Pruitt is stepping down over the delay in Obama-era emissions cuts
A day after being sued by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, reversed his earlier decision to delay the implementation of Obama-era regulations to reduce emissions of smog-causing air pollutants.
Pruitt presented the change as his agency proved more responsive to the needs of state environmental agencies than previous administrations.
He did not mention the lawsuit brought against his former position in a federal court of appeals.
This is a deadline that expired on 1 October for states to comply with the 2015 ground-level ozone standards.
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay compliance by a year to give his agency more time to study the plan and to avoid "interfering in local decisions or impeding economic growth".
Pruitt, who was Oklahoma's attorney general before being appointed by President Donald Trump, has long been a staunch opponent of stricter environmental regulations.
Since his arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved to block or delay regulations that the chemical and fossil fuel industries oppose.
Wednesday's sudden reversal is the latest legal setback for Pruitt's regulatory rollback agenda.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the EPA administrator exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of an Obama administration rule that required oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement published on Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that his reversal of ozone standards would simply strengthen the EPA's willingness to work with states through the complex process of meeting the new standards on time.
"Under previous administrations, the EPA often failed to meet deadlines for implementation and then waited to be sued by activist groups and others and to agree on a deadline for implementation", said Pruitt, who sued the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job.
"We do not believe in court-ordered regulation and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take the law and the authority it gives us seriously".
However, the EPO's opinion said that Pruitt would eventually use his "power of delay and all other powers available to him by law" to ensure that the regulations were "based on sound policy and the best available information".
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive overhaul of the ozone rules.
A bill approved last month is expected to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been put to a vote in the Senate.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that sued the EPA this week, said the group intends to maintain legal pressure.
"The EPA reversal - according to our lawsuits - is a major gain for the health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and the more than 115 million Americans directly affected by the smog that flows into their communities", Schneiderman said.
New York was joined in this case by California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington and the District of Columbia.
Ground-level ozone is produced when pollutants from cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive groups of people and contribute to thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health officials and environmentalists cheered Pruitt's surprising change of course.
"It's disturbing how much pressure it takes to get this sensible step from the person responsible for protecting the air we breathe", said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to fight against the Trump administration's ideological crusade to offer ourselves to polluters and their special interests".
Tumlingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hilarius Church
750 years of St. Hilarius Church: On the occasion of the anniversary of the Bergkirche, a serenade will be held on the old cemetery grounds in Tumlingen on Sunday, July 16, at 4:30 p.m.
Because of its idyllic location and beautiful views of the town, the historic St. Hilarius complex is a popular place to stay.
Visitors to the sixth benefit serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.
The friends and supporters of the village have made the rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village their concern.
Walter Martini emphasizes: "It is a unique village gem".
In 1267, the St. Hilarius Chapel was first mentioned in the Württemberg Book of Records: Count Hermann von Sulz sold "the mountain with the parish church on it to Tumlingen including the Vogei" to Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 marks of silver.
According to the text of the document, on the Tumlinger mountain, in addition to the former parish church, there was also a lord's court, to which the church or the patronage right belonged and not vice versa.
So there were people living there.
As the description of the Freudenstadt district office of 1858 shows, besides the village and the village, which are still visible in the town picture of Tumlingen today, the "mountain" was the third, the dominant settlement core of the village.
Old maps from about 1600 support these historical facts.
The right of patronage arose from the early medieval right of the own church.
A gentleman who built, equipped and staffed a church with a pastor continued to own that church and could also inherit that church.
This included the right to appoint a priest or to propose a new pastor to the bishop.
There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.
The larger of the two broke on Christmas Day 1673.
The newly acquired bell was first rung in 1692, but had to be abandoned during World War II in 1942.
During the Thirty Years' War (1616-1648) the windows were smashed and the bell ropes were stolen.
The roof was leaking.
In 1796, French troops camped near the church.
They broke out the pulpit and the chairs and used them as firewood.
The remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.
Until 1869, the Tumlingen Hilarius Cemetery also served as the final resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.
In 1823, the cemetery was expanded and the Hilarius Church was demolished.
Only the church tower was left standing.
On New Year's Eve 1834, a storm split the church tower and half of it collapsed.
To prevent an accident, the tower was torn down.
Only the tower dwarf that still exists today has been preserved as a witness to the 750-year-old history of the church.
Today, Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem of the "Shopping Retirees" are maintaining the Hilarius plant as successors to Dieter Dockhorn.
As organizers, the friends and supporters of Tumlingen invite you to the sixth serenade on Sunday, July 16 at the old cemetery to the St. Hilarius Chapel.
The programme is designed by the Kepler-Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with contributions by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.
The last word is from Hartmut Romann, the local manager.
The program starts at 4:30.
Admission is from 3:30 p.m.
At the end of the serenade, a reception takes place in front of the cemetery.
"Enjoy a summer evening in the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest", the organizers highlight the fantastic view.
The serenade only takes place in dry weather.
The organizers hope to get many supporters to preserve the historic St. Hilarius complex, which is important for the locals and listeners.
The friends and supporters of the carnival feel a special commitment to the care of the home, as the Serenade organizer Walter Martini confirms.
Association wants to have approval of wind turbines checked
Boisheim defends itself does not see any legal basis for the construction and has therefore turned to the county council.
The association "Boisheim defends itself" has asked the county councillor Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheimer Nette.
It was unlawful.
The association argues that at the time of the approval on 30 December 2016, no wind turbines could have been approved in the Boisheimer Nette, as at that time there was only a wind power concentration zone in Viersen at the city border with Schwalmtal.
Within this concentration zone, wind turbines can be built and operated, but the concentration zone also excludes the use of wind energy in the rest of the city.
The purpose of such zones is to prevent the landscape from becoming "splashed".
The city of Viersen had decided a few days earlier to build a second wind energy concentration zone in Boisheimer Nette by amending the land use plan, but the Düsseldorf district government had not approved it because of a design error.
"The lack of planning law makes the approval still illegal and therefore it must be withdrawn", said Christoph Erkens, chairman of Boisheim Defends.
Current situation: The city council has decided again before the summer break on the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette; a permit from the district government is still pending.
The Commission has not yet received any information on the proposed aid.
The circle confirms receipt of the request.
"The corresponding letters have been received by the district of Viersen since last week", explained a spokesman.
The Circuit takes it as an occasion to reconsider the matter.
However, they are not likely to lead to the termination of the proceedings.
In view of the ongoing proceedings before the administrative court, the district did not want to comment on Thursday on the arguments of the association "Boisheim defends himself".
NEW Re, a subsidiary of NEW, plans to build four wind turbines on a site on the Boisheimer Nette, each 200 metres high.
The company, in which the city of Viersen has an indirect participation, had already signed lease agreements with the owner of the 65 hectare site last year.
The four wind turbines are expected to cover the electricity needs of some 11 400 households - about one fifth of the electricity needs of all the Fourth Estate households.
NEW Re is planning to invest around 20 million euros.
Last summer, Viersens city council gave the green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the Linnich wind farm near Aachen and a stake in a wind farm in Übach-Palenberg in the county of Heinsberg.
Woman dies in terrible accident after car and tractor collide
A terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at about 10 a.m. on the L 333 between Niederwallmenach and Bogel (Rhine-Lahn district).
A woman was fatally injured.
Two other people were slightly injured.
The highway was closed for hours.
According to police, a 17-year-old woman from Bornich drove her car in the L 333 towards Bogel as part of the escorted journey with her 53-year-old mother as an escort.
City and retailers plan "home shopping" weekends
The aim is to help people in the region and in the region to rediscover the shopping opportunities in the city centre in September.
The trade association and the city administration want to use the weekend of September 8 and 9 to lure the inhabitants to the shopping in the city center.
As the chairman of the trade association, Christian König, announced, the "Home Shopping" weekend is intended to make customers aware of what their own city has to offer, apart from the usual supermarket goods.
The plan is therefore to create a market with regional suppliers, similar to the weekly market.
The aim is to present local companies with their training places.
In addition, the central city shops are to invite you to "midnight shopping".
The action is not limited to the inhabitants of the city and the surrounding region.
The Commission has also been asked to provide a list of the activities it will carry out in the field of the environment.
The city administration and the trade association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
The association and the city are now entering a new phase of the attractive city centre project.
These include new offers such as the first 'active day' at the Fountain Festival, including a Sunday open sale, and discussions with all traders and hosts to encourage them to take part.
The concept also includes attractive offers on Saturdays and the exemption of parking fees on that day.
The aim is to develop new or re-exploited customer potential.
This includes spa guests and tourists.
But many locals would have lost sight of the downtown area while shopping.
In the end, everyone would have to help to revitalize the city centre - from landlords to businesses and associations throughout the city.
The problem is to overcome the lethargy that has become widespread, King said in the spring.
Birgit Streich, head of the IHK Centre in Mühlhausen, said that for the first time, five Thuringian cities were taking part in the third national "Home Shopping" day.
In addition to Bad Langensalza, these are Weimar, Sömmerda, Heiligenstadt and Bleicherode.
The day is intended to "promote the appreciation of local trade and to highlight its importance for the common good of our cities", Streich said.
The action, led by the IHK and with many partners, also makes clear that every citizen can influence his or her own direct environment through his or her buying behaviour.
Two dead and several injured in US school explosion
During construction work, there was a gas explosion in the school building.
New people were injured.
A gas explosion in the U.S. city of Minneapolis killed two people and injured nine others, some of them seriously.
According to the fire department, one person was critically injured on Wednesday.
One person died when part of a school building collapsed in the explosion.
A missing person was later found dead as well.
The dead were school employees.
The authorities suspected that the accident was caused by work on a gas pipeline.
During the holiday season, few people stayed in the Minnehaha Academy building.
Trump pressured Mexico to pay for the border wall after leaked phone transcripts
Transcripts of phone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia have been published by The Washington Post.
On January 27, Trump called Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to stop publicly saying he would not pay for a planned border wall.
The president of the United States scolded him for publicly denouncing the wall, reportedly telling him, "You can't tell the press that".
Trump launched his presidential campaign with a promise to build a wall on the southern border of the United States, and vowed to make Mexico pay for the project.
Transcripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also released, revealing a tense exchange.
Mr. Trump told Mr. Turnbull that a trade for the United States to take in refugees who migrated to Australia was "ridiculous", "mean" and "stupid", and that insisting on the trade brokered by the Obama administration would make him look like a "dumb" after he proposed a ban on resettling refugees in the United States.
Mr. Trump ended the call after telling Mr. Turnbull, "This is the most unpleasant call of the day".
Moores Ford Massacre: Activists re-enact racist lynching as call for justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury drove through a crowd in rural Monroe, Georgia, and rammed toward the Ford Bridge in Moore.
Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, could reach the bridge, a group of white men with guns came out to block its path.
The mob leader - a middle-aged man in a pinstripe suit - took a long puff at his cigar and peered through the windshield.
Inside, the inmates were floating in fear.
"We want this n----r Roger!" roared the man.
"Get him out of the car!"
Screams broke the silence as a young black man was pulled from the passenger seat.
Fortunately, this terrible scene that took place on July 22 is only a reenactment.
But then when a noose is thrown around Roger's neck, almost everyone in the audience sighs very real.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have returned to Moore's Ford Bridge to reenact the night two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcolm and George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lynched by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
No one was ever charged with the murders.
"It's really unbelievable that in all these years not a single person has been arrested - even though we see them in our communities, even though we know who they are", said Tyrone Brooks, who helps organize the reenactment.
"It's a stain on a story, but it's a burden on our souls".
Brooks is a 71-year-old former congressman from Georgia and a lifelong civil rights activist.
For him, the reenactment serves as a dramatic call to action and an annual reminder to the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.
"We want justice, we want closure, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we have to get justice", he said.
"We cannot achieve healing and reconciliation until we get justice".
A coroner is laying a sheet over the body of one of the victims of the Moore-Ford lynching on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI files obtained by NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties were suspected in the lynching trial.
But no one was ever charged.
Although the suspects have been at large for decades, civil rights activists say the twin motivations behind the lynchings have always been known throughout the city: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a Supreme Court decision allowed black citizens in Georgia to vote for the first time in the summer primary.
About the same time as the election, according to the FBI, black tenant farmer Roger Malcolm stabbed a white landowner, Barnett Hester, during a fight, allegedly over a woman.
Brooks said the rumor in town was that Hester slept with Malcolm's wife Dorothy and that the baby she was carrying wasn't her husband's.
On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid $600 to free Malcolm from prison, according to the FBI.
He was accompanied to prison by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
But then as they were leaving the prison and approaching Moore's Ford Bridge, a lynch mob surrounded the car.
"It turns out that Harrison was the one who planned and ordered the killings", concludes an FBI report.
"It's also clear that there was a conspiracy between state and local law enforcement, "which not only participated in the killings, "but also eliminated evidence and covered up the identities of witnesses".
Brooks is even more specific.
"It was a suffrage massacre", he said.
"They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community, "If you register and vote, this is what will happen to you".
For nearly a decade, Cassandra Greene has been running the annual reenactment of the Moore Ford Bridge Lynch murders.
Their depiction is vivid, poignant, and rooted in a kind of deep-seated racism that many would like to believe no longer exists in America.
It's hard to watch, and even harder to look away, but Greene said that's the point.
"We don't want to talk about the lynching because then we're confronted with the ugliness of it in all of us", she said.
"But I can't build a relationship with you if you won't listen to me or hear what I've been through".
The rehearsals for this year's production began in June, and on the first day, nearly 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest black - crowded into a room and listened as Greene launched a well-crafted overview of the play.
Wade Marbaugh is co-directing this with Greene.
He's been playing the role of clan chief for years, but he said the role never gets easier.
"I feel dirty because I'm not like that", Marbaugh said.
"But I think it's very important to keep this story alive because we don't want to go back to those times".
Across the room, actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcolm and Barnett Hester, rehearsed their lines.
The play begins with Malcolm yelling at and harassing Hester, angry that he slept with his wife Dorothy.
"I said, n--he, get off my property!"
Rascona is returning fire.
There's a break.
And then everyone (at least all the black actors) bursts out laughing.
Greene is the loudest laughing.
"What?!", said Rascona.
He's alarmed and confused.
Was I too harsh?
"No", said Greene, still giggling.
"I just don't think white people said a -- he did".
"Yes", one of the other black actors joked.
"You just have to hit the hard 'R.'
And that's when the energy shifts in the room, a sense of camaraderie replaces the discomfort.
Everyone's busy getting this right, not just for the game, but for the memory of the four people who were killed.
The scene starts again.
This time, when Rascona says the N-word, he says it sharply and forcefully.
No one is laughing at all.
This repetition ends violently and quickly.
There's screaming, there's shooting, and then there's silence.
A woman dressed in a mourning dress stands over the bodies of the actors and performs Billie Holiday's mourning eulogy "Strange Fruit".
Her voice breaks at every second word.
About a hundred yards behind, a group of about four dozen onlookers wipe their sweat and tears from their eyes.
The audience is almost evenly split between black and white.
A couple from Ithaca, New York, came to see the show, many just coming down the street.
They've all experienced Georgia's oppressive humidity for nearly eight hours as Brooks leads them on a pilgrimage to the Malcolm and Dorsey burial grounds.
Up until this point, the murders have remained anecdotal, but now, standing on the same land where the lynch murders took place, the air feels ghostly.
When the last notes of the song are played, Greene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the body.
Children squat on their heads, registering the fake blood and the still bodies, whispering to each other.
"They're not really dead", a little boy murmurs as if trying to remember.
After a few minutes, Greene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it's over.
The actors throw away the lynch rope and wipe their tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the clan member.
Nick Rascona hugs two of his teammates and then breaks down in their arms crying, the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks through on him.
"It's okay", one of the women whispers.
"We know that this is not in your heart.
You did it for a reason".
Later, the audience joins the actors for dinner.
At a table, a white couple from Atlanta are excitedly chatting about reconnecting with a black couple they just met.
Denise Duplinski struggled to find the words to describe the feeling the performance left behind.
"It's hard to hear these terrible words and actions... coming from people who look like you and who do it because they look like you", she said.
"What really makes me believe that the lynching is still going on", she added, "today it's just called police shooting".
In the same room Tyrone Brooks is holding court at his table, eating and reminding people of civil rights.
He said he's already started planning the show next year.
"The reenactment is inspiring in a way, because it describes the horror of what we have been through, but it is also a moment of learning", he said.
"The thing is, if we don't learn from this, it can happen again.
Those who do not study their own history, who do not know their own history, are condemned to repeat it".
"Twilight of the Gods" reconciled the Wagnerites in Bayreuth
In the fourth part of Richard Wagner's monumental work, director Frank Castorf also uses a colorful, frivolous production set against a gigantic, six-story backdrop.
The filming set (designed by Aleksandar Denic) shows a shabby street corner with the remains of a wall and a donerboode in Berlin, a "plastic and elastic" logo from the GDR era or the New York Stock Exchange.
In front of it is an open Mercedes vintage car, in which the Rhine daughters pose as rocker girls, or alternatively an Isetta.
Stacked oil barrels recall Castorff's theme of money, power and greed that runs through his Ring production.
The three Rhine daughters - sung by Stephanie Houtzeel, Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - harmonize as they did in "Rheingold".
Kess they seduce Siegfried (Stefan Vinke), drag a body in the trunk in Hollywood fashion and give the Krawallo clique.
Stephen Milling sings the beautifully ugly hedge surrounded by the aura of a heavyweight boxer.
The scene where he slays Siegfried is brutal.
Later, Gunther (Markus Eiche) has to believe in it.
The audience thanks the ensemble with a loud applause.
Foster, Milling, Vinke and conductor Janowski are celebrated with a storm, bowing their hands to the Merkel-Raute.
The festival orchestra is being applauded for its first appearance on stage - again in casual clothes in the heat.
The performance of Frank Castorf and his team was eagerly awaited.
If he had to let a loud pipe concert pass him in 2013, there was a great cheer five years later, in which the isolated "boo" cries disappeared.
Festival director Katharina Wagner must have been pleased.
"You can see that the audience has grown together with the 'ring' in a certain way", she said just before the performance of the dpa.
The audience not only made a kind of peace with Castorf, but also grew in understanding of his point of view.
I'm going to make a positive summary.
Max Menge is a volunteer
You'll be working in different locations during your year of volunteering.
Where?
Usually in Steinfurt at the furniture exchange, once a week I help out here in Greven at the furniture bridge.
And I've been working on the school all day.
What's your experience with that?
Crowd: It's a beautiful, broad spectrum that I see here.
I deal with a variety of people, teenagers, refugees, young adults.
You're 26 now, so you're a late-comer.
How's that?
I graduated high school.
And then a civil engineering degree, let's say, successfully dropped out.
I realized for myself that it was the wrong thing to do, and I wanted to do something different, work with people.
And then I wondered what you were doing.
Make a social year, you can get a glimpse, you can see what it's like on the ground, in the focal point, maybe, really.
And did it?
I've had some great impressions.
I'm starting my studies in social work in the winter semester.
I will study dual, probably do a social worker training at the Youth Office Herne and study in Hamm at the technical college.
Is it not unusual to have several different assignments during volunteer service?
Quantity: Yes, it is highly variable.
I guess it all depends on where you do your FSJ.
You can do it from nursing homes to youth work - in all kinds of social work.
I had a lot of variety.
I was also part-time in the OGS, so afternoon care.
For me, that was exactly the right thing to do.
I was able to see my own strengths and see how things really work out.
Different from civil engineering?
Well, this isn't about doing static.
You keep having other people in your head, each with a different story behind them.
Whether it's a refugee, whether it's a teenager who's been taken from his family, you always have to deal with it individually.
That's very interesting.
And you didn't have a fear of touch?
I'm not the type.
It's a field that gives you a lot.
Much love, much kindness.
There are some negative moments, but that's life.
Pearson cuts another 3,000 jobs and cuts dividend to revive business
Pearson said on Friday it would cut another 3,000 jobs and cut its interim dividends by 72 percent as it launched another restructuring programme to overcome the pressure the company is facing.
The reduction in staff, which CEO John Fallon announced for the majority of late 2018 and early 2019, comes on top of its previous restructuring, which has already seen 4,000 job losses.
Pearson announced in May a third cost-cutting programme, a plan to cut costs by a further £300 million ($394 million) to revive a business hit by the rapid move to digital learning.
The company, which sold its stake in Penguin Random House to partner Bertelsmann last month, said its outlook for the financial year was unchanged after growing 1 percent to £2.05 billion in the first half of the year.
NATO soldier killed in suicide bombing
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital Kabul, killing a NATO soldier and wounding several others, officials say.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were wounded, a NATO statement said.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians were also killed in the incident in the Qarabagh district.
The bombing is the latest violence to hit Afghanistan this month - more than 30 people were killed at a mosque in Herat on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
A NATO statement said the explosion occurred on Thursday evening when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by an "improvised explosive device carried by people".
The statement said all the injured are in stable condition and are being treated at the US military hospital at Bagram airfield.
Correspondents say the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh is a major concern for NATO troops in nearby Bagram.
According to the United Nations, at least 1,662 civilian deaths occurred in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, about 20% of them in the capital.
In late July, a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a predominantly Shiite district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they carried out this attack.
On May 31, a massive bombing in the city center killed more than 150 people in the deadliest militant attack in the country since US-led forces ousted the Taliban from power in 2001.
The violence underscores the precarious security situation in Afghanistan as US President Donald Trump considers increasing the number of US troops supporting the military and police in the country.
Correspondents say that the suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government, its policies and in particular in the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
EPO reverses decision to delay smog rule after appeals
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has rescinded a decision to delay an Obama administration regulation that obligated states to curb smog-causing emissions, a day after 15 states sued the agency over the move.
The EPA announced late Wednesday its decision to move forward with the so-called "Ozone Regulations 2015", saying it demonstrates the agency's commitment to working with states.
"We believe in dialogue with and in responding to our government partners", said EPA chief Scott Pruitt in a statement.
Pruitt had announced in June that the EPA intended to delay ozone regulations - which are supposed to measure pollutant emissions in a part of the country to determine where cuts need to be made to meet stricter air quality standards - by a year until October 2018.
A group of 15 mostly democratic states, along with the District of Columbia, filed a lawsuit Tuesday, saying the effort was illegal.
President Donald Trump's administration has tried to roll back a wide range of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda that Trump says is designed to boost economic growth.
However, the efforts have caused a backlash from Democrats and conservation groups who are concerned about the public health impact of higher emissions.
The EPA website says that breathing in air containing ozone "can reduce lung function and exacerbate respiratory symptoms" such as asthma.
Community space
In the end, the decision was clear: if two votes were against, the municipal council of Fluorn-Winzeln decided to establish a community space in the future senior housing complex.
Before the discussion, there is an important piece of information: the purchase contract for the still missing plot has been signed, reports Mayor Bernhard Tjaden.
Although it will still be some time before the land belonging to the church community is in the hands of the municipality, there are now no planning obstacles to the project to be approved by a private investor.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals.
One of the two investors still on the boat has offered to help the community.
On the ground floor, he would provide a living area - about 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace of at least 70 square meters for a special price.
The administration and the majority of the municipal council propose to make such a community space not just a meeting place for the residents of the senior housing, but open to the community.
For example, the word "knit cafe" was in the news.
The decision, which was made last autumn by providing funds for the current budget, is being sweetened by the possibility of support.
The building is in the redevelopment zone.
The creation of a community area would be eligible for 60 percent of the 30 percent, reports Tjaden.
The proposal for a decision, in order to signal to the investor that it is not going to be a burden in this respect, provides for the possibility of both a saddle roof - which is based on the surrounding construction - and a countertop roof - which reduces the height of the rafters and makes the construction more economical.
The Commission has not yet decided on the proposal for a directive.
If it helps, he'll pass the board unanimously.
It's not that easy in the common room.
Daniela Ruf points to the many buildings of her own that are not very successful, but now you have to lean out of the window at the common area, she says: "I have a hard time with that".
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to this effect.
It sees it as a covert subsidy to wealthy people or even foreign investors.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to improve the quality of the water supply.
Mr Staiger's request to split the motion for a resolution accordingly has three votes in favour.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to improve the quality of the services provided by the Member States.
Motorcycle collision: cyclist thrown onto road
An 82-year-old cyclist was hit by a car while crossing the road in Garath on Wednesday and was seriously injured.
According to the police, the 82-year-old Langenfelder had been riding his bicycle on the cycle path of the Schwarzer Weg road at 12:20 am coming from the direction of Hilden.
The senior was trying to cross the road at the foot of the road at Buchholzer Busch.
A female driver driving in the same direction gave him priority.
When the Longfelder drove onto the road, he obviously did not pay attention to the opposite traffic.
He collided with a car driven by a 66-year-old heroine.
The man was thrown onto the street.
He was seriously injured and taken to a hospital by ambulance.
FC Bayern Munich must forgo David Alaba and Thiago in the Super Cup against Borussia Dortmund
The Super Cup will be without him, and David Alaba will have to cancel the match against Dortmund.
With personnel concerns, FC Bayern travels to Dortmund for the first official game of the new season.
Seven professionals are missing for the defending champion in the Super Cup against the cup winner.
The personnel concerns at German football record champion Bayern Munich are getting bigger ahead of the Supercup on Saturday (20.30 hours/ZDF and Eurosport) at the Cup winner Borussia Dortmund.
Coach Carlo Ancelotti has to relinquish David Alaba in the duel with BVB.
The Italian confirmed it on Friday.
The team also lacks Manuel Neuer, James, Thiago, Jerome Boateng, Arjen Robben and Juan Bernat.
For the five defeats in the last six Test matches, Ancelotti blamed the physical condition and lack of balance in his team's game.
"We know we are not in the best physical condition", Ancelotti said, adding: "The most important point is the balance in the team.
The last one wasn't good".
The 58-year-old believes in a performance boost in the first official match of the season.
"Football is also tactics, strategy, personality and motivation.
I have great confidence that my team will display these qualities.
The team is ready.
We want to play smart", said Ancelotti, who expects a "difficult, intense game".
The duel between the two German heavyweights is enthralling the fans.
The game is sold out with 81,360 spectators, the German Football League (DFL) announced on Friday.
♪ Walking in the resin from star to star ♪
The first national "star trail" is to be built in the Harz.
This is planned by the association St. Andreasberg Observatory.
A planetary route has been operating in Göttingen since 2003.
A "star trail" would meet the information needs of many resin visitors, it said.
It combines nature, science, exercise and athletic performance.
The members plan to place signs along the planned route, informing about stars and constellations.
In a first phase until 2018, the association plans "easily accessible installations in five to six locations" in the Upper Rhineland.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to this effect.
The information on the boards is to be supplemented by the Internet.
Therefore, good mobile network reception is important in the choice of location.
The Commission has also been asked to provide a list of the Member States which are eligible for the programme.
Later, the star trail will be extended by train.
"The star trail provides a great deal of information to the viewer, such as about the physics of individual stars", the association explained.
They also learned why stars had different colors or why one star shone brighter than another, even though it was much farther away.
It also tells you which constellation a selected star is in and when it is best seen.
The association has been operating the highest observatory in northern Germany since 2014 in the mountain town of St. Andreasberg.
The location in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six darkest regions in Germany, according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation.
Often the Milky Way and even the Andromeda Galaxy can be seen clearly with the naked eye.
Since 2003, the University has been running a project in the city, initiated by the Planetarium Göttingen, which is similar to the planned star trail.
Starting in front of Gebhard's Hotel on Goetheallee, which forms the innermost part of our solar system, the planetary path with its stelae leads up to Hainberg and the observatory - as well as an "alien" location in Diemarden (commune of Gleichen) with the planet Sedna.
The stellar planets, including the dwarf planet-degraded Pluto at the end point, are arranged exactly one billion to two billion apart.
The earth shrinks to a sphere of 6.5 millimeters in diameter, while the sun, at exactly 75 meters, measures 70 centimeters.
The total distance of the planetary path is a good four kilometers.
While it takes about eight hours for sunlight to reach Pluto, it takes a good hour for pedestrians to reach the Stele of Pluto.
So pedestrians are faster than light in space.
But the march to the next fixed star would take another six months.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discussing a possible showdown.
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who were on a collision course to stage the most exciting under-147-pound boxing match in the near future, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms at ESPN offices in Los Angeles until Garcia, the undefeated World Boxing Council lightweight champion, walked down the hall to greet Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization super featherweight champion.
After Garcia's unanimous victory over former four-division world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday on Showtime, both fighters are members of the top five pound-for-pound list.
Garcia reached out his right hand and said, "How are you, champ?
I wish you luck".
Lomachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday night at 7:00 on ESPN.
When the pair posed for photos, Lomachenko's manager Egis Klimas remarked that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the "perfect order of magnitude".
"I'm a former featherweight", Garcia recalled.
"I've gained weight for Broner, but I'm not that tall.
I'm too small for 140.
I'd like to go down to lightweight.
And he has to move to lightweight and then we fight.
That's what the fans want.
Let's give them this".
Lomachenko agreed with me.
"Boxing needs this fight".
Klimas asked if it should be on pay-per-view, part of a strategy that Lomachenko has to fight with a 135-pound debut this year to set up a date with Garcia next summer (37-0, 30 knockouts) who also has interest in the fight against Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell's winner after their lightweight title fight at the Forum on September 23.
"This fight could be in pay-per-view mode because all the fans have been asking for it", Garcia said, later openly expressing his desire to fight at the network that offers the best financial package.
We're the best.
No other name can generate this kind of attention.
Whenever they 're ready ... "
Garcia said he values Lomachenko as "a huge fighter", and he may be in his fight on Saturday.
But Lomachenko stopped short of generously praising Garcia, saying he thought the three-time champion from Riverside looked "very slow, sorry Mikey... you wanted the co-outs".
Garcia said the focus was on hitting, then boxing.
Both said they could feel the momentum building for their own fight.
"This is the fight that must be fought.
No other fight has generated as much attention and enthusiasm.
I'm more than happy to work on it", Garcia said.
Lomachenko said, "I've been waiting for the top fighters, and this is Mikey.
It's going to be a great fight".
Four injured after a flat tire
In an accident on the A7 on Thursday afternoon, four people were seriously injured.
According to initial information, the driver of an Opel Zafira lost control of his vehicle at about 4:30 p.m. just before the market crossing, presumably after a flat tire.
The car slid right into the embankment, where it rolled over and then lay on the roof in the green lane.
The four occupants - two adults and two children - were partly seriously injured in the accident.
During the first aid to the injured by the emergency services, the A7 northbound was closed for about an hour, after which traffic on the left lane could be diverted past the accident site.
Fortunas Hoffmann: "Three-way chain works better"
Andre Hoffmann hopes that after the 2:2 start to the season against Braunschweig, the optimization of the defensive formation in Aue will bring points.
Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the first game of the season, and with the result, if it had not been for the two opposing goals at 2:2 against Braunschweig.
"It was two goals too many, and we have to be even more careful in Aue", says the Fortuna Düsseldorf defender.
The three-way chain is to be further optimized in the Ore Mountains.
And one free kick after another, the odds are stacked against us.
"For the future, no one will be able to stand next to Michael".
Hoffmann is convinced that his team, even after the experience in preparation, will do better with the three-stringed than with the four-stringed.
"I don't know yet how we will play in Aue", says his coach Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is sure of his thing, "because we have players who can build well in the threesome on the half positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann", said Hoffmann.
"But the prerequisite is that we harmonize even better and we can afford less misplacement in the setup".
Of course, Hoffmann is going to Aue to win the game.
"But if you can call a draw a bad start, I don't know.
The performance could be quite okay", said Hoffmann.
"But if we can get four points on Sunday and focus on the trophy, we can certainly talk about a decent start to the season".
His coach wouldn't have any part of it.
"I don't judge the start of the season until after six to eight games", said Friedhelm Funkel, who doesn't want to talk about an advantage over Aue just because the Saxons' game in Heidenheim had to be cancelled early because of a storm.
"Now they can start the season with a home game", Funkel said, and Hoffmann believes the Aue players might even be a little fresher, since they wouldn't have a tough and complete game like Fortuna against a promotion favourite in the bones.
"But they don't know 100 percent where they stand", says the interior minister.
The Rhinelands are the easy favourites to face each other on Sunday at the stadium in Aue, which is almost finished.
"It's nonsense to wipe them out just because we want to be in the top six", says Funkel, whose record is quite positive after only one loss to Aue in nine games.
"There is no team in the Bundesliga that you have to beat from the start", explains Fortunas' head coach.
"To make such a statement would be arrogant and presumptuous".
And that's not how Funkel wants his players on Sunday.
New results of Swedish Asylum Age Assessment tests published
Recent results from tests on asylum seekers in Sweden who have been subjected to a new medical method for assessing their age show that more than 80 percent of those tested are over 18 years old.
The Swedish Forensic Medicine Authority (Rättsmedicinalverket) started conducting the tests last year.
They are intended to improve the accuracy of age assessment during asylum procedures, following criticism of the Swedish Migration Authority (Migrationsverket) for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were minors.
To date, Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 cases for testing and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from mid-March to 31 July 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were assessed as 18 or older, while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency assessed the person as "possibly 18 or older".
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person was "possibly under 18 years of age".
The tests are only performed in cases where the age of the person is in question.
According to Johan Göransson from the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results are consistent over the past few months.
"We don't see a big difference in the statistics from the past few months, the numbers are pretty consistent", he told The Local.
The high proportion of cases where the person was assessed as over 18 does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker lied about his or her age.
In May, the agency released results from 581 tests and said there were 442 cases that "suggested the person being tested was 18 years or older".
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the 581 published results, it found that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that he would be 18 this year.
The method of medical age assessment, which involves X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI images of knee joints, which are then analyzed by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticized in some quarters.
One skeptic is endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose work involves assessing the biological maturity of humans to see if they went through puberty earlier or later than usual.
"I had reason to think about it, and I don't think that kind of measurement should be used.
Assessing biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't say it for sure, we shouldn't pretend we can", he told Metro.
Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, however, defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, you can say that the risk of misjudging a child as an adult is low.
The greatest risk is when the person is just under 18, in which case it is about 10 percent".
Full on plan
Work on the three bridges on the 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is progressing well.
On Wednesday, a seven-ton concrete section was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance to Lauterbach.
"We are very good at the time, it is going great", says Reinhold Leicht, construction manager at the Department of Roads and Transport at the Government Headquarters in Freiburg.
In April, work began simultaneously on all three bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach that needed to be repaired.
The construction is scheduled to be completed in October and Leicht is confident that the schedule will be met.
The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads over Trombach.
It is a concrete arch bridge, covered with red colored sandstone, and has a total length of 15 feet (4.8 m).
It was built in 1900.
Like the other two bridges, she's aged by now.
In order to ensure stability and traffic safety, the three buildings are now being thoroughly renovated.
The other two bridges cross the Lauterbach.
They're made of red colored sandstone.
Both were built in 1939 and are 12 feet, or 10.6 meters, long.
The bridge at the entrance to Lauterbach has now received on Wednesday morning on the north side a 1.30 meter wide and seven tons heavy so-called bridge cap.
This is a perimeter mount that is also used as a service road.
A 2.20-meter-wide bridge cap is to be installed on the south side of the bridge on Friday.
Then let the paths of the footsteps follow them.
The special thing is that these are finished parts, a patent of the Schramberger company Dizwo.
The other two bridges are already fitted with the patented bridge caps.
The laying of wires through the building in Lauterbach required special sensitivity.
Because there's also a fiber optic cable that many companies are connected to.
The project was informed by leaflets to the residents in advance of the work.
In addition, fish and shrimp had to be caught first.
For the bridges between the Bauhof building and the Sammelsweiher in the direction of Schramberg, traffic is regulated by a traffic light.
For the construction work on the bridge at the entrance to the town of Lauterbach, the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels "Tannenhof" and "Sieben Linden" is completely blocked.
The total cost of the three bridges is EUR 700 000.
The whole thing is funded by the country.
AfD in Gerolstein: Colorful protest at German potato salad
It is not often that parties pull together, but when it comes to the Alternative for Germany (AfD), they come together, which is otherwise difficult to bring under one hat.
The parties represented in the Volkaneifel district council (CDU, SPD, Greens, FDP, FWG, Left) are part of a broad alliance that is peacefully displaying its flag on this day, because the AfD is inviting Rondell to the "great election campaign air strike" in the Gerolsteiner Stadthalle.
And it will be a start for well-known names - like Alice Weidel, who will be the front-runner for the Bundestag elections on 24 September with Alexander Gauland, and the deputy leader Beatrix von Storch.
But those who are already on the spot hours before the event begins do not want to listen to the AfD students, but to demonstrate.
The motto is "The Eifel stays colorful".
The city picnic was originally planned to take place on the Fountain Square under the slogan "All at One Table", but now takes place in the parking lot below the Rondell - and thus right in front of the eyes of those attending the AfD event in the town hall.
A colorful picture that's coming up.
And what really pleases Christa Karoli, chair of the One World Forum and one of the main organisers: "It's great how many people have come together here".
There is music and plenty of food, including a "true German potato salad that the AfD could easily eat", says the woman who brought it.
The police have ordered many officers to Gerolstein, and they are showing their presence especially at the train station, which is only a few meters away from the venues.
How did the AfD get on Gerolstein?
Mario Hompes of the AfD Vulkaneifel reports that he has tried to organize such an event and got the contract.
The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf had first asked in Daun, but there was a refusal, because because of the already built Laurentiuskirme there are not enough parking spaces.
Now the Rondell, Hompes is happy that "we can have such a nice event here".
Looking at the event in the Rondell foreplace, he says: "It is the good right of the people, the main thing is, it remains peaceful".
The same is true: at about 8 p.m. a band will entertain on the Rondellvorplatz, and in the town hall several speakers, including the Rhineland-Palatinate AfD chairman Uwe Junge.
In the hall, there are about 200 people waiting for the top candidate for the federal election, Alice Weidel, and the deputy Federal Chairman Beatrix von Storch to make their speeches.
The police presence is unchanged, but so far, the officers have had a quiet evening.
The AfD event lasts for a little over an hour, the guests in the front room have a longer breath, but even there it is called to clean up shortly after 9 pm.
The police can move in. No special incidents.
Trumpet to trumpet
A rehearsal with the Wolfbach trumpeter Frederic Belli will be held in the series of Haslach Concerts tomorrow, Sunday, at 8 p.m. in the monastery church.
Together with the Bulgarian trumpeter Miroslav Petkov, he gives a concert under the motto "Black Sea meets Black Forest", or "Balkan folklore" meets a classical German education with roots in wind music.
Both soloists have won and been awarded prizes in numerous international competitions and have solo positions in leading European orchestras.
Petkov is a solo trumpeter with the renowned Concertgebouw Orchestra Amsterdam and Frederic Belli is a solo trumpeter with the SWR Symphony Orchestra.
Both are united by a desire not only to transcend the limits of their instruments but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres.
For example, Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like a new suit to the two, Daniel Schnyder's "World Music" merges with Bulgarian folklore, and in the piece "Exchange Suite" by jazz prize winner Nils Wogram, classical, jazz and free playing blend into a fascinating overall work of art.
This is the core of the programme, which was first staged in Freiburg this spring with great success.
The renowned composer Nils Wogram wrote it especially for the two musicians and more: The Haslach monastery church with its special acoustics is deliberately included in the concert.
Kristen Stewart speaks about her bisexuality
"Some people love grilled cheese and will eat it for the rest of their lives.
But I want to try everything", Kristen Stewart openly said about her bisexuality.
"When I take a bite out of grilled cheese, I think, 'Oh, that was cool, what's next?'"
The Hollywood star's most famous relationship was with her "Twilight" co-star Robert Pattinson, who ended up bitterly separated.
Despite this, the brunette actress tells Harper's Bazaar: "I was seriously in love with everyone I dated.
Or do you think I played it?"
After their divorce, Kristen admitted that she was bisexual: "I've always lived in dualism and I've believed in it.
So it's never confused me or hindered me.
I just never liked not being taken seriously".
She said she suffered particularly during her school days, when she dressed like a boy: "Not all girls are typical girls.
That really hurt me.
When I was 11, the kids told me I'd look like a boy.
I felt really attacked, scared and ashamed.
Now I look back and I think, 'Girl, be proud of yourself!'"
She is particularly reluctant to explain her love life to the public: "People expect you to behave in a certain way, and that annoys me.
And some may call me ungrateful, but I don't like having to justify myself in front of the whole public".
The governor of West Virginia announces he's switching parties.
West Virginia's Democratic governor, Jim Justice, announced Thursday night at a rally with President Trump that he would be switching parties.
Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have moved away from me", said Governor Justice.
"Today, I will tell you with much prayer and much thought... "Today, I will tell you as a citizen of West Virginia,
The rally erupted in cheers.
"Tomorrow I will change my registration to Republican", Justice added.
"As a coach, I would say it's time to play a different game".
Mr. Trump promised a big announcement at the West Virginia rally earlier.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia by 42 points, and Justice did not endorse Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who is the only billionaire in the state according to Forbes, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states and inherited a coal business from his father.
It's worth about $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee issued a statement Thursday night saying, "The change of party by Governor Justice is another blow to a Democratic Party that would rather stop us than work to make our country great again".
"With only 15 governments and control of the fewest legislatures in history, Governor Justice's announcement is just the latest rejection of a party that is leaderless from top to bottom and unable to find a positive, unifying message", RNC chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.
Coe praises "honest" Russian apology for doping scandal
World athletics head Sebastian Coe praised on Thursday what he described as a blatant apology from Russia for a doping scandal, but he reiterated that it was not the time for the country to be reinstated in the sport.
During the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World Championships in Athletics, Russia's athletics chief Dmitry Shylakhtin said that his country's ban from the sport was correct and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said he was sorry for "all the athletes who were stripped of gold and silver medals in competitions".
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted to maintain the ban, which was imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"I thought it was a very open response today, a very honest presentation", IAAF President Coe told reporters.
"The whole Council and the whole Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognized in itself that it has experienced some rather hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is reshaped".
Coe said he was also "pleased" that Russia accepted the criteria for its reintroduction.
"I think it was a very constructive day, and I think progress has been made, but Congress supports the recommendations of the task force that this is not the time to re-engage Russia", Coe said.
"We must do everything in the coming months to normalise this situation.
The guiding principle has always been that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the corrupt system", he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes will compete as neutral players at the World Athletics Championships, which begin on Friday in London, according to the strict IAAF criteria.
The head of the IAAF task force, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia still had to meet some of the criteria for reinstatement.
Drug tests are still inadequate and banned coaches are still free to operate, he told reporters in London after a lecture at the IAAF Council.
Mourning for fallen soldiers in Mali
At a memorial service in Fritzlar, northern Hesse, about 1,000 people remembered the two soldiers who died in a helicopter crash in Mali.
The ceremony took place Thursday in the cathedral under strict security.
The German Foreign Minister, Ursula von der Leyen (CDU), did not say anything about the cause of the crash.
She described the two pilots as "experts in their field".
"We bow before this supreme sacrifice they have made in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany", she explained.
The 33-year-old major and the 47-year-old chief of staff from North Hesse had died a week ago on Wednesday in West African Mali.
Their coffins were taken to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a bodyguard of the Bundeswehr brought to the Fritzler Cathedral of St. Peter.
At noon, only the family members said goodbye in the church.
Afterwards, the funeral celebration began with family, close friends, representatives of the German army and politicians.
The Commission has also been consulted on the draft law on the protection of the environment.
Mourners laid flowers, and relatives stood arm in arm at the coffins.
In front of the church, Fritzler and numerous soldiers watched the ceremony on a screen.
The Minister of Defence, von der Leyen, described the soldiers killed as "highly decorated" and "ready for action".
The Chief of Staff had helped to set up the Tiger combat helicopter in Fritzlar and was one of the first six trained Tiger pilots in his regiment.
Volker Bauersachs, commander of the regiment to which the soldiers belong, also stated: "If this occupation could not prevent the crash, then no one could".
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to ionising radiation.
But it is also of great importance "for a country from which we are separated by only two states", she said.
After the funeral, the coffins were taken out of the cathedral.
The German army did not say when or where they would be buried.
Prince Henrik doesn 't want a grave next to his wife .
The husband of Queen Margrethe of Denmark (77), Prince Henrik (83), does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death.
The royal family announced on Thursday.
Traditionally, the Danish royal couple is buried in Roskilde Cathedral.
The sculptor Bjørn Nørgaard had already made a sarcophagus for the two.
The Queen agreed with her husband's decision, the statement said.
It's not clear where Prince Henrik will be buried.
He has no intention of being buried in his native France.
Prince Henrik had never made a secret of his unhappiness with his title.
After his wife Margrethe ascended the throne in 1972, he would have liked to become king.
In 2016, he retired and also laid off the title "Prince's Husband".
Since Henrik did not receive the title and office he wanted in Denmark, he does not consider himself equal to his wife - even after his death, explained Lene Balleby, the chief spokeswoman for the Danish royal family.
The final resting place of the 83-year-old is still unclear.
He does not intend to be buried in his native France, but in Denmark.
He likes the country he's worked for for the last 50 years.
Born Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, son of a French noble family, Margrethe had met him in London in 1965.
He worked at the French Embassy on the Thames.
While his later wife was always receiving expressions of sympathy from the people, Prince Henrik had a difficult time with the Danes during his nearly 50-year reign.
In his autobiography, Henrik wrote about his early years in Denmark: "A few months after my arrival, everything I did was criticized.
My Danish was fluid, I preferred wine to beer, silk stockings to knitted socks, Citroëns to Volvos, tennis to football.
Even for the Gauloises, who I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco and who had the reputation in this country of being the brand of socially critical intellectuals, I could not hope for leniency.
I was different.
I seemed content with this position and not ashamed.
That was two mistakes!"
Prime Minister Weil wants a snap election
CDU and FDP ahead of possible majority in Lower Saxony
The German government has announced that it will be closing its doors to the public.
Because on Friday he voted to dissolve Parliament.
The surprising resignation of a Green MP from her Lower Saxony parliamentary group had thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the official date of the elections to the Landtag, the red-green coalition in Hanover lost its narrow one-vote majority in parliament to the opposition from the CDU and FDP.
The previous Green MP Elke Twesten justified her move by not nominating for the 2018 election in her constituency in Rotenburg (Wümme).
"I see my political future in the CDU", she said in Hanover on Friday.
The CDU leader Björn Thümler wants to recommend to his group that it be accepted.
The CDU and FDP would have 69 seats in the Lower Saxony state parliament, while the SPD and the Greens would have 68.
Until now, the ratio was the other way around.
The new parliament will be elected on 14 January next year.
Thümler said the red-green government must now decide whether it can continue to govern without a majority in this situation.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to the Council, but it has not yet done so.
The CDU Group is expected to decide on its next steps on Tuesday.
The constitution also provides for the possibility of the Bundestag withdrawing the Prime Minister's confidence and electing a successor.
"Our constitution offers several options.
These possibilities must be examined legally", said Thümler.
"All questions will be discussed calmly when they are legally reasonable".
Thümler called Twesten's move "a bit curious".
The politician herself emphasized: "I am not a traitor.
I feel very good".
She described herself as a Black-Green supporter.
The Greens called on the defector deputies to give up their mandate.
"We are of course assuming that she will return her mandate to the Landtag, which she received through the green list", said the country's leaders, Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner.
The Green Group leader Anja Piel said: 'We are extremely sorry about the decision by Elke Twesten.'
It has deliberately decided not to have a debate in the group.
"Even in the absence of substantive differences, we cannot understand this step".
SPD candidate Martin Schulz condemned the move by Lower Saxony's Green MP Elke Twesten to the CDU as a betrayal.
"The behaviour of the former Green MPs in Lower Saxony is not only a betrayal of the electorate, but also a betrayal of the Red-Green", the Social Democrats' Federal Leader wrote on Facebook on Friday.
He also called on the Commission to ensure that the EU's nuclear programme was implemented in a timely manner.
The departure of Twesten costs Red-Green the majority in Lower Saxony.
The politician puts "in her wounded vanity and frustration her personal interests before the good of the country", SPD Secretary General Hubertus Heil criticized.
"It is a scandal that the CDU in Lower Saxony is taking part in this dirty game of intrigue and trying to make political capital out of it".
The CDU leader in Lower Saxony, Björn Thümler, wants to recommend to his MPs that Elke Twesten be admitted to the CDU.
The SPD's parliamentary group leader, Thomas Oppermann, accused Twesten of falsifying the results of the 2013 state election in his personal career.
The CDU was the strongest force in the country at the time, but the SPD and the Greens had a slim majority of one vote in the Bundestag.
The Minister of Agriculture in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from poisonous eggs, Mr Schmidt?
Germany is discussing contaminated eggs.
How could the scandal happen?
How can consumers protect themselves?
The Minister for Agriculture, Christian Schmidt (CSU), gives a speech and an answer in an interview with the Edaktionsnetwerk Deutschland (RND).
Mr Schmidt, how can the consumer protect himself from poisoned eggs?
I can only encourage all consumers to look carefully at the eggs in your fridge and check the stamping.
The Länder shall publish the latest information on the batches of eggs concerned on the consumer protection portal www.lebensmittelwarnung.de.
Affected eggs should be destroyed or returned.
Even though, from what we know at this point, a health hazard is virtually impossible.
Is Aldi now taking the best possible crisis response - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the scout is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture?
Food inspection is the responsibility of the Länder.
Nevertheless, my House has been very active and has been in close contact with the authorities of the Länder since the German concern became known.
All information and risk assessment shall be accessible to consumers.
The trade must ensure, as must manufacturers, that the products sold are fit for the market and safe for human health.
If the maximum residue level of 0,005 mg/kg is exceeded, eggs are not marketable.
However, uncontaminated eggs can be sold and consumed.
This time it's not the companies' fault.
Are producers and consumers in the same boat?
The current state of knowledge does not impose direct blame on the production companies.
Rather, they are faced with economic losses due to allegedly illegal practices by service providers.
As always, there are not enough inspectors in an emergency.
Is it only the staff or is there also a lack of coherent responsibility?
It was the official controls that uncovered the operation.
But the truth is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be ruled out 100 percent.
It is precisely for this reason that a consistent investigation of such events and their transfer to the public prosecutor's office in cases where criminal offences may exist are of crucial importance.
I have already made it clear on several occasions that I expect the responsible authorities to provide a full account.
Is regular alarm in the event of food scandals really necessary?
Consumers have the right to only have safe and marketable food.
When an unapproved insecticide is used in the food industry, consumers are rightly outraged.
The fact that the Commission has not yet been able to provide a complete answer to the question of the financial perspective is a very serious matter.
The Commission has already taken the necessary steps to ensure that the use of the insecticide fipronil in livestock production is not prohibited.
This is something that must be pursued consistently and with great urgency at all levels.
I expect all the competent authorities to clarify the matter promptly and completely.
How football's financial rules affect Neymar's move to Paris
The rules, which aim to prevent unimpeded spending by European football clubs, will not interfere with Neymar's world-record transfer from Barcelona in Spain to Paris Saint-Germain in France.
Some consequences for Paris Saint-Germain are yet to come from UEFA, the governing body that oversees European football, which has the power to ban teams from the prestigious Champions League tournament.
Financial fair play rules introduced by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG will eventually have to prove that Neymar's transfer was financed without major losses.
Barcelona paid 222 million euros ($262 million) to buy the Brazilian out of his contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will be several tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to France.
PSG can certainly get the money loose to sign Neymar and take him to a galaxy of other stars, given the team's funding from Qatar's energy-rich ruling family.
Clubs may spend a lot of money on player acquisitions, but they must counter with legitimate sources of revenue that allow them to break even in their football-related business.
The FFP was conceived by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA president in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs that had taken on huge debts in their quest for success were effectively cheating and risked bankruptcy if banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, FFP shifted its focus from focusing on club debts to monitoring their losses.
The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich originally used at Chelsea in 2003 - buying a club with potential and then investing heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - was to become a tougher affair.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet decided whether the aid is compatible with the internal market.
And although Platini fell out of favour as president in 2015, his UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin continues to campaign to discourage excessive spending.
"FFP is certainly not dead and we will definitely strengthen the rules for the future", Andrea Traverso, UEFA's FFP director, told The Associated Press last week.
Although PSG paid Neymar's buy-out clause in a lump sum, it can spread the amount for accounting purposes over the duration of his contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so the proceeds of the sale for the next five years amounting to EUR 44.4 million can be shown in the financial statements.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 hit PSG with the heaviest sanctions, along with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City.
PSG was fined €60 million (then $82 million), which was later reduced to €20 million - and it was ordered that the squad for the 2014/15 Champions League season be limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25.
UEFA is looking for clubs that might try to outsmart its financial oversight by inflating their revenues through companies linked to the owners of a club.
The Commission notes that the aid was granted in the form of a public contribution to the construction of the stadium.
This is exactly what happened in 2014 when UEFA decided that the value of the PSA sponsorship was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.
It was reported that some of PSG's payments to Neymar could come through payments from the 2022 World Cup organising committee in Qatar.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 have denied that Neymar will become a World Cup ambassador and such a move could be easy for UEFA regulators to figure out.
The current sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be even more vigilant to any attempt to circumvent the rules.
UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG about Neymar's transfer, people familiar with the situation said on Thursday.
They spoke on condition of anonymity to The Associated Press, as they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.
The Commission notes that the French authorities have not provided any information on the financial situation of the two airports.
The accounts for the last financial year are yet to be published.
PSG expect Neymar's arrival to be a boon for sponsorship deals, merchandising and shirt sales.
The association expects sales to increase by at least 30 percent after the signing.
The Spanish league was clearly irritated to see one of the best footballers leave, and they tried to prevent Neymar's departure by claiming that PSG would violate the FFP.
"It is a clear case of 'financial doping' with the club and the state", La Liga president Javier Tebas told the Spanish daily AS in reference to Qatar's ultimate ownership of PSG.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports tycoon, shares La Liga's reservations against a state funding a club.
"It's the consequence of ownership and that has completely changed the whole landscape of football over the last 15 years", Wenger said on Thursday.
"Once a country has a club, anything is possible.
It becomes very difficult to respect financial fair play because you can go different ways or have different interests when one country has such a large player to represent one country".
Swiss is looking for a new shoe supplier
In recent years, Chocolat Frey has been producing chocolate for the Swiss.
Now the sweet cooperation is about to end: the airline is re-writing the order.
Swiss spokeswoman Meike Fuhlrott confirmed a report by the newspaper "Nordwestschweiz" on Friday at the request of the news agency sda.
The Commission notes that the airline has not yet been able to provide any information on the airline's activities.
The products would be checked and quality controlled every two to three years.
"We are very satisfied with the current supplier Chocolat Frey", the spokeswoman said.
Each year, flight attendants distribute about 17 million small, 14-gram-wide red-and-white-packed snowboards to passengers before landing.
The Swiss did not want to say what the costs were.
Industry insiders estimate the volume of orders in North West Switzerland at 1.5 to 2 million francs - the Migros subsidiary has an annual turnover of around one billion francs.
But more important than that is the advertising effect: For a shoe manufacturer, it is a prestigious assignment.
The Swiss won't say how many candidates are in the new tender.
Only Swiss producers are eligible.
According to the newspaper report, Chocolat Frey intends to seek a renewal of the contract beyond spring 2018.
The largest Swiss chocolate producer was not available for comment from the SDA.
The Swiss have been handing out chocolate bars on board since 2006.
Before the Swiss signed a contract with Migro's daughter, Barry Callebaut had worked with Hug to supply the chocolate tablets.
The possibility of placing the logo was introduced by Swiss two and a half years ago when it started working with Chocolat Frey.
The airline cooperates with various Swiss chocolate producers.
On long-haul flights, first-class customers are pampered with delicacies from the Sprüngli confiserie, business class passengers snack on Lindt's Schoggi and Chocolat Frey's Schoggi in the economy class.
Swiss also distributes Schoggi by Chocolat Frey on the short haul, both in business and economy class.
Athletics - discus Olympic champion Robert Harting reaches the World Cup final
The three-time world champion will fight for a medal in the final on Saturday.
His brother Christoph, the 2016 Olympic champion, had failed in the national championship team and could only watch the discus competition from the grandstand.
Also with the first attempt, Polish defending champion Piotr Malachowski, who threw 65.13 meters, qualified for the final.
Nostalgia is in the spotlight in Wet Hot American Summer and Comrade Detective.
This re-run of the story is at once nostalgic for the glory days of the characters of the '80s, for the '90s grunge era (when the frontmen David Wain and Michael Showalter were filming the sketch comedy "The State" for MTV), and for themselves - that is, for 2001, before their stars, like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd, went on to bigger things.
As a cultural artifact, it is both a parody and an embodiment of our Facebook-enabled era of permanent memory.
But as a franchise, it feels like time is running out.
"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not only because of its absurd humor (it contained an original story for a talking can of vegetables, told by H. Jon Benjamin).
By sticking to the core of the gag -- middle-aged actors playing horny kids who grow up -- they still made it impossible to recapture the last part of the joke.
"Ten Years Later", with its adults now playing adults, is less emotionally rooted and its parody is more of a can-do style, including a riff to the '90s stalker movies like "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle".
At one point, a character browses through an Apple Powerbook, some inline skates, and "a bunch of other stuff from 1991".
Many of the core stories are the same.
The lovable Coop (Mr. Showalter), now a novelist, has not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) still hasn't lost his virginity.
And there is another crazy-evil plot involving Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter) who is now backed by George H. W. Bush (a well-made impression of Michael Ian Black).
As always, the field trips are the best part of the franchise.
It's especially fun to watch the ever-young Mr. Rudd show off Matt Dillon's under-lip beard from Singles, whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy now feels like an old fart.
It's the moments of random madness that could fuel this franchise like a kind of recurring "Seven Up!" series until it reaches what I assume is its logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later", whose final scene will show the gang attending the film premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer".
Comrade Detective on Amazon is now reminiscent of another kind of nostalgia: the Cold War revival of "The Americans", the movie "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW" with its East vs. West wrestling iconography.
The comedy, created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka and directed by Rhys Thomas, claims to be a found footage TV series: a Romanian drama from the 1980s with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest who fight for truth, atheism and the path of Marxism-Leninism.
The main roles - a tough-talking Gregor and an idealistic Joseph - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, with dialogue dubbed in English by Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a brilliant idea.
But it's not much more than an idea.
There are some nice gigs to watch (the police spend their time watching chess on TV, like Americans might do with football).
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevigny - makes for a decent game of "Find the Voice".
But Comrade Detective is so committed to the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama -- a murderer wearing a Reagan mask is involved -- that it often plays as one.
Six long episodes, it's dragging on, and the comedy isn't fast or frequent enough.
"Comrade Detective", edited to a shorter length, could better deliver its agitation-prop satire, as Gregor and Iosef keep visiting the American embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two fat men devouring a bunch of hamburgers.
The message to the imaginary communist audience is that Western culture can turn anything into food for a feast.
The fictional Romanian creators were not wrong: we even do it with our own more recent history and with theirs.
Strike against the drug mafia in the country
The police have struck a blow against the Italian mafia in Baden-Württemberg.
On Wednesday morning, numerous objects were searched in the Black Forest-Baar district, in Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, as the Prosecutor's Office of Konstanz announced on Friday.
The 15 accused, aged between 25 and 77, have been arrested and arrest warrants issued.
In addition, officials seized large quantities of marijuana and cocaine, firearms, and several hundred thousand euros.
Two people were arrested in simultaneous raids in Italy.
The two Italian suspects were on German arrest warrants.
The two are therefore likely to be extradited to Germany.
Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the operation.
In total, more than 300 police officers were on duty.
Mafia members are accused of organized drug crime, serious violence, attempted murder, robbery and extortion.
Since the summer of 2016, the Prosecutor's Office has been investigating Constance's organized drug trafficking in southern Germany.
There was a lively exchange between the prosecutors' offices in Constance and Palermo and the investigators of Kripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.
The Grand Operation was therefore accompanied by four officials from Palermo on Wednesday morning.
The main targets of the investigation were Italian nationals with close links to the Italian Mafia.
The gang is also responsible for an incident in Huffingen on May 27 when several shots were fired into a restaurant in the early morning.
The way complains of large gaps in the register of foreigners
"Data of citizens who should not appear": According to one report, the German foreigners' register is seriously flawed.
This leads to some serious errors in asylum procedures.
According to a media report, the Federal Government's Refugee Management Commissioner, Frank-Jürgen Weise, has drawn attention to large gaps in the central register of foreigners.
The Commission has also been consulted on the draft directive on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to ionising radiation.
The register contains 10 million foreign nationals, including some 5.7 million from non-EU countries.
The data are therefore managed by about 600 immigration authorities in Germany.
The Commission also noted that the data were not adequately maintained and that the data quality was not good in some cases.
In individual cases, data from 1921 were found, "of people who are long dead or of citizens who have become German citizens and should not appear in the register anymore".
"Inappropriate data entry can significantly slow down return processes", the report says.
The statistics on people obliged to leave also include EU citizens who would not have to leave at all.
However, such misattributions have led to "a distorted debate about the treatment of those who are obliged to leave", the analysis says.
Meanwhile, the German government has apparently begun to send refugee families with children under 16 back to Italy if they have arrived from there.
This is stated in an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), reports the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung".
The paper states that the BAMF will resume such procedures 'in respect of families with children, except infants and young children, entering Italy as of 1 June 2017'.
Since the end of 2014, this has been virtually impossible, the newspaper said, citing the difficult situation on the ground.
Under the Dublin Agreement, the EU country that reaches refugees first is responsible for them.
If a migrant continues to travel to another EU country, that country can send him back to the country of entry.
The reason given by the Office is that "in the meantime, the capacity for families with minor children in Italy has increased significantly".
Italy had given guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families.
Even the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) considers these commitments to be sufficient.
Other EU countries would also send refugees back under the Dublin Agreement.
The spokeswoman for the Left Party in the Bundestag, Ulla Jelpke, criticised the decision: "Families with children are at risk of human rights violations and a risk to the welfare of children because of the shortcomings in the Italian asylum system".
Second best result achieved
The blood service has already made 220 litres of blood from people living in Oberreichenbach available to other people.
At least among the 12 citizens who were honored on Friday.
First of all, Jürgen Greule, who has now donated 50 litres of blood with his 100 donations.
Traditionally, the community at the community council meeting appreciates the multiple willingness to donate blood.
"It is amazing how our bodies are designed to do this, and we respect the donors who give their blood to strangers, even more unselfishly", said Mayor Karlheinz Kistner.
"A single blood donation helps many people", explained Holger Maisenbacher, the German Red Cross (DRC) director of blood donation, because the preserves are broken down into their components.
That way, three people could benefit from a single blood donation.
At the same time, Maisenbacher reported on the actions being carried out in Oberreichenbach in the spring.
"This year we achieved the second best result with 114 donors", said the DRK district head.
Apparently, the move to the theater a few years ago led to higher attendance.
Even before that, Thomas Bockstadt, Susanne Reichle, Sandra Schöck, Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer were among the multiple donors and were awarded for 50 blood donations each.
Half as many were recorded by Herbert Mair and Dorothee Riexinger, while Tamara Pfrommer, Petra Schleeh, Stefanie Stoll, and Uwe Cousins each gave away ten times 500 milliliters of their life juice.
The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and weakening inflation have dampened speculation of an increase.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain "substantial" as it maintains interest rates on family income amid mounting pressure.
Policy makers on the Bank's Monetary Committee (MPC) voted 6-2 to keep interest rates at 0.25%, with fewer members seeking an increase this month as weak economic growth weakened support for an increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7% and for 2018 to 1.6%, warning that pressure on household incomes would continue, with inflation expected to rise to just under 3% in the autumn.
But she signaled that interest rate hikes would be needed in the coming years to curb Brexit-fueled inflation and she said that credit costs might have to rise more than expected in financial markets.
MEPs also voted to withdraw part of the mammoth economic stimulus package issued a year ago after Brexit.
It will ask for time for the financing plan to provide cheaper funding for banks from February, although it has been said that it is now expected to provide £15 billion more under this system - £115 billion.
Minutes after the interest rate decision, the Bank said: "In the MPC's central forecast, gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak in the short term as pressures on household real incomes continue to weigh on consumption".
On interest rates, it reiterated that "some monetary tightening" would be needed to cool inflation and "somewhat more" than markets expect.
Markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
The Bank stressed, however, that increases would be 'gradual' and 'limited'.
The Bank's downward-adjusted growth forecasts for this and next year are at 1.9% and 1.7% respectively, as against May forecasts.
It has maintained its growth forecast at 1.8 % in 2018.
The pound fell against the dollar and the euro after these news.
The pound fell by 0.5% to 1.31 US dollars and fell by 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The decision is without change after recent disappointing growth figures dampened rising interest rate expectations and GDP rose from 0.2% in the second quarter to 0.3% in the previous three months.
Growth is expected to be 0.3% in the third quarter, although the Bank expects it to recover slightly towards the end of the year.
The latest inflation report offered little encouragement for households affected by rising inflation and slight wage increases, as the tightening will get worse before it gets better.
It added that monetary policy could not "prevent" the fall in incomes in the coming years, but that wages would "clearly" recover by the end of its three-year forecast.
The economy is also being strengthened by rising demand for British goods, which is due to the weak pound, which will partly offset lower consumer spending.
The decision comes a year after interest rates were cut to 0.25% last August following the shocking EU vote that caused the pound to fall.
The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years for this to fully reach prices and the economy.
Prior to the Bank's latest interest rate ruling, calls for an increase in interest rates had increased as inflation increased pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policymakers calling for an increase to 0.5 per cent in July.
Inflation fell to 2.6 percent last month from 2.9 percent in June, although the bank said it was expected to rise again in the coming months.
The Bank said the excess over its 2% target was 'entirely' due to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "With the recent drop in swap rates, the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again as lenders are looking for deals and want to end the year on a positive note.
The market is looking particularly good for those who are closing existing deals and taking out new mortgages, and many with fee-free options and low rates are becoming more popular".
NHS to prescribe controversial HIV drug to 10,000 people
Patients will be given access to "transformative" HIV prevention treatment from September following a High Court battle over funding for the drug on the NHS.
NHS England announced that a pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) taken before sexual intercourse, which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 percent, is now being provided by the NHS through an initial three-year study involving an estimated 10,000 people.
He agreed to finance the trial after the Court of Appeal upheld a Supreme Court ruling last year that the NHS had the authority to pay for PrEP despite claims that local authorities should fund it.
The move announced on Thursday was hailed by NHS England chief Simon Stevens as an "important new intervention", while the National Aids Trust (NAT) called it a "decisive moment".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to allow people to register, with more clinics to follow in October before rolling out across England in April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a sequence of HIV medicines taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission in people at risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before sexual intercourse means that just enough medication is in a person's body to prevent HIV infection.
Such drugs can be taken every day or so, two hours before sexual intercourse.
Those eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transgender people and people with HIV-positive partners who have not been successfully treated.
Clinics will identify suitable participants who agree to the study, including men, women, transgender people and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment.
People living in England and registered with a GP can also register for potential participation at their local participating sex clinic.
The programme will cost £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to supply the drugs this week following an international competitive procurement.
The study aims to assess the full potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence on how it is used, taken up and implemented on a large scale.
Stevens said: "This major new intervention should complement and outpace the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in more than three decades of progress in addressing one of mankind's greatest health challenges".
Deborah Gold, chief executive of NAT, said: "This is a critical moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, when targeted at vulnerable and disadvantaged people, has the potential to change the UK HIV epidemic.
Starting in September, people at high risk of HIV will have access to this NHS-funded trial in England to develop a new tool that is truly individual controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner, which will lead to the improvement of many, many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement".
Ian Green, chairman of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "The priority now has to be to get the trial done quickly across the country and not leave anyone at risk of HIV behind.
Now that the PrEP trial drug is available, we are well on our way to protecting more than 10,000 people with HIV".
Sharon Hodgson, Shadow Health Secretary, said: "The start of the PrEP process is welcome and overdue after months of delays and reluctance by the government to implement.
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and stopping the transmission of this life-altering infection.
This trial brings us one step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that this study is carried out nationwide as soon as possible to protect people living with HIV and that it helps us get one step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society.'
The big life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this tiny Earls Court apartment into a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, downsized from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment in 2014.
It's on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it's proof of the new design that Joanne didn't pack her bags and sell.
"Before that, I lived in a much larger room in Knightsbridge with my ex", says Joanne.
"I was looking for something that matched my price.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and it had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and made her an offer that day".
Since the first visit, the 1,000-square-foot apartment has been completely remodeled.
Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to make the most of the generous ceiling height.
"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.
That was my request", she says.
To this end, she commissioned architecture and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi of Notting Hill to use the 12.5 foot ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne.
The ceiling wasn't big enough to hold two rooms on top of each other, so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine floor to stand in.
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the problem.
"The steelworks are quite complicated", he explains.
"We had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked on top of each other without having to bend over.
It was not just a matter of building a simple platform, but of arranging the steel to the right height for the function above or below".
This arrangement allowed Erfan to place two rooms at full height on top of each other - with much added drama.
For the middle floor, a classic Retrouvius copper window overlooks the glamorous living area.
Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the tone for the program.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.
A short corridor is mirrored at both ends to make it appear longer.
In the kitchen, the mirror feels like a window into another room.
At the entrance, mirrored units provide space for all of Joanne's cutlery and glasses.
By creating a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen when not in use.
Folding kitchens are nothing new.
The special thing about this one is that it's a garage door.
"A little engineering went into it", explains Erfan of the steel-reinforced, upholstered MDF door.
"It's counterweighted, so when you push the door up, it slides very easily".
Thanks to clever use of space and storage, Joanne was able to add an additional 40 square feet, an additional bedroom, and an improved layout.
"At the end of the day, you're going to sell the land - or how your property is valued", Erfan says.
"In a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will step in and perform a calculation based on the size of the floor".
Here they have managed to increase the floor space while using high-quality materials that give the space its luxurious edge.
"The materials are the things you touch and therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home", says Erfan.
"You don't fall in love with the electrical outlets in the walls.
These are important, but they don't play with your heart".
It shows that a home can go from being a standard to something amazing through good design and increased square footage.
In fact, like Joanne, you might choose not to leave.
Brothers fight over a $ 500 million real estate empire
Four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, two brothers find themselves in a feud over one of Victoria's largest real estate empires worth over $500 million.
Former Carlton Football Club manager and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, just three doors from his younger brother Paul, who has taken him to the Supreme Court to have their property and business assets divided.
Paul had been planning to retire from the family business since 2014, but a heated dispute over the separation is taking place in the Supreme Court.
Together with their mother Anna, the brothers own 38 properties worth over half a billion dollars, accumulated since the family bought a store on Smith Street, Collingwood, in 1973.
There, the family founded Westco Jeans, which grew into a chain of 160 retail stores.
It was sold in 1999 for $85 million.
This money was invested in real estate, and De Lutis' portfolio now includes offices in the city centre, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller, and shopping centres in the suburbs.
According to an agreement with her late father, Colin - described by Paul as the "main operator and dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - owns about two-thirds of the company's assets and Paul about a third.
A court filing says that means Colin has assets worth $316 million and Paul has assets worth $176 million.
The division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.
"Colin's proposed subdivisions left him with what I thought were the best properties", he wrote in a first affidavit in 2015.
Last Friday, after several failed mediations, the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place.
The brothers are now also fighting for control of the existing business - which Colin, Paul claims, has excluded him from.
Colin argues that this is not true, but accuses Paul of managing some possessions incompetently.
In an early affidavit filed by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.
"My Italian heritage dictates that family is the most important priority", he wrote.
Costs are rising in the case, with hundreds of pages of affidavits, emails and reports from companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and leading lawyers including Allan Myers, QC, and law firms owned by both sides.
Mrs De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who ran dairy bars and delicatessen shops from the late 1950s and bought a business in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They used the security to buy the Collingwood property where Colin opened the family's first jeans shop.
Colin says he started Westco there when he was "in my last years of high school, when Paul was a little kid (about 10 years old)".
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass on their property to their sons in a kindly way.
"Luigi often told me that he never wanted the brothers to go to court", she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group of companies, with Colin claiming that Mark was paid $10 million and Luke $26 million when they left the company.
Both Luke and Mark, Paul says, "became bitter over the conditions of their financial separation".
Colin has been very reserved, although he was a former AFL board member and, according to a 2015 biography by Eddie McGuire, the TV star's best friend.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.
Only Colin texted back to say, "I really can't say much", because the case was in court.
"It is very, very sad that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and drag our family name through the courts", he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote a letter to the court saying that he had tried to comply with his brother's demands.
"Our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end up in our current argument", he said, adding that he "still hopes for a solution".
By Friday, that hope seemed to be gone.
"Our case will be settled in the courts in the near future", wrote Colin.
Trump's new chief of staff plans to curb the president's media abstinence.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.
If he does, he'll be the first.
Politico reports that the new White House chief of staff plans to restrict the flow of information about President Trump - including news media reports - in hopes of keeping the chief on a more even course.
Here 's a piece from reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When John F. Kelly, the new White House chief of staff, met with senior officials on his first day in office, he presented a major problem in President Donald Trump's White House that he wanted to fix: bad information getting into the hands of the president.
Kelly told staff that information about him should be flowing - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he was given good information".
Kelly's diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet.
President Trump's relationship with television goes back decades - and now that he's in the White House, his TV commercials are still strong.
"When candidate Trump was upset about unfair coverage, it was productive to show him that he was getting fair coverage from sources that were convincing", former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg told Politico in February.
Politicos' Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keeping Trump's Twitter habit in check, according to six former campaign officials, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady stream of praise".
I'll take care of it.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit was ever "under control" is ridiculous.
Maybe these campaign officials know something the rest of us don't - that Trump's tweets would have contained even more fuel if they hadn't intervened.
We'll probably never know about the tweets that Trump didn't send.
If his associates have managed to keep him out of trouble a few times, their efforts have paid off.
But no one has consistently been able to prevent Trump from provoking controversy.
Part of the problem is that people in a White House made up of rival parties are constantly trying to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump with material that may promote their views of the world.
Politico - which is all about this story - reported in May about the preference of advisers to provide the president with dubious information for strategic reasons.
This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
"Trump officials and former officials say Trump can be like a volcano reacting to negative news clippings, especially those with damaging leaks, and that he is determined to find out where they come from.
That's exactly what happened in late February, when someone maliciously gave the president a hard copy of an article from GotNews.com, the website of Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, which accused Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being "the source behind a bunch of leaks" in the White House.
Even though Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter for harassment or for not offering concrete evidence or for making false accusations in the past and then retracting them.
Trump read the article and started asking employees about Walsh".
Goldmacher added that then-Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and White House Secretary General Rob Porter "attempted to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork Trump receives".
How'd that work out?
Kelly tries to do the same thing three months later.
Maybe he'll prove to be a more effective manager than the probationary one, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisors are still striving for influence.
These unchanging factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Most wanted criminals get mail from Europol
Since the address is unknown, the public is asked to help and is hoped for.
Police across Europe are sending (virtual) postcards to dangerous criminals on the run this summer.
Since the addresses of wanted criminals are not known, information is sought and sought from the public.
Europol reported on Friday on the action, which follows the winter advent calendar of the EU Most Wanted.
The experience has shown that many refugees hide in holiday destinations, Europol said.
21 postcards were compiled for wanted criminals from 21 EU countries.
Since 2016, the website www.eumostwanted has been up and running, with over 2.5 million views.
36 of the online searches have so far been arrested, at least 11 of them based on information obtained after publication on the website.
Travelers negotiate a ditch and return to the "millionaire series"
Some of the West Midlands' wealthiest landlords are once again at war with some determined travellers who have negotiated a moat dug by the local council to reclaim a field outside their mansions.
The travelers parked their 20 caravans in a field outside a wealthy street in Solihull called the "Millionaire's Row".
They have brought horses, babies and an army of vans after being thrown out only in May, but without being deterred by a trench dug by the Council to prevent their invasion.
The tactful group found a gap in the defences and pushed their vehicles through an unobstructed section to find a way.
Angry residents have pressed the Solihull Council, which said it was "useless to deal with the problem".
An anonymous resident said: "They moved there on Monday evening after being sent on from Bentley Heath where they threw stones at passersby.
The Council must be forced into action by shame, because it has been useless in dealing with the problem.
The travelers were there in May, moved on and are back now.
More arrived last night, probably more today".
She added: "Birmingham City Council knows how to handle this by giving long lectures to protect their parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I'm not happy to continue to pay my community tax if the council can't even stop it".
A resident who did not want to be named said: "It is ridiculous, we just saw the last round of these travelers, only to be robbed by another round.
The numbers have increased this time and a horse has even been seen in the park area".
A spokeswoman for Solihull Council said: "We are aware of an unauthorised camp on the land beyond Streetsbrook Road and are working with Solihull Police to take the necessary legal steps to ensure they move on as quickly as possible.
To support our evidence collection, it is very important that as many residents as possible report any antisocial or criminal behavior to the police by calling 101.
This helps to give a picture of the situation in which the court has to consider when we present our case".
Birkenhof is becoming the Waldhotel Luise
The former Hotel Birkenhof is now the Waldhotel Luise.
The house outside Freudenstadtts is currently undergoing renovation and is due to reopen on March 1 next year.
That's good news for the city.
The closure of the Hotel Birkenhof by Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH on 13 April 2014 resulted in the loss of around 30 000 overnight stays per year and also revenue from the health insurance tax.
In the fall of 2014, in view of the dramatic increase in the number of refugees coming to the district, the hotel building was offered to the county council office as a collective accommodation, which caused controversial discussions.
The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by drawing up a development plan to secure the area as a hotel location.
The decision was not without controversy in the municipal council at the time.
But especially Freudenstadt's mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel's location and even then spoke of serious interest in the house.
He should be right.
The Luisenhotels group, headed by Birgit Scherer, has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and plans to convert it back into a three-star plus hotel under the name Waldhotel Luise.
The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt object.
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.
They're called Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.
Containers of construction waste have long been placed outside the entrance of the former Hotel Birkenhof, and the extensive renovation work that is being done is obvious when you enter the building.
The floors were torn out, some of the ceilings were removed, old bathtubs were removed from the rooms.
The entire hotel building is a single construction site.
There's still a lot to do before March.
"It's actually a nice hotel", says Thomas Scherer in an interview with our newspaper.
Everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style.
The rooms will be equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area will be remodeled, new windows will be installed.
The Commission is also proposing to make the necessary changes to the existing rules.
"We want to make a piece of jewelry out of it".
The facilities include a swimming pool, spa and a conference room.
The aim is not to position oneself on the high level of hotels in Lauterbad, but on a high-end downtown level, Scherer emphasizes.
The Waldhotel Luise, with its 60 rooms, wants to be broadly organised, Scherer explains.
The hotel is designed to make individual holidaymakers, groups or business people feel at home.
He has already held talks with OB Julian Osswald and tourism director Michael Krause, Scherer said.
The City's ideas are similar to those of the hotel group.
"We're on the same page".
Asked about the amount of investment, Thomas Scherer did not want to be specific.
He estimates it to be just under a million euros.
The outdoor installations are also being brought up to speed, as is already clearly visible.
A large terrace will be built in a courtyard, which will be accessible from the restaurant, which is public.
Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Freudenstadt is a good market".
Russia: US special investigator calls for grand jury
In the Russia case involving US President Donald Trump, special investigator Robert Mueller is said to have set up a so-called grand jury, according to a report.
The panel has been working on the matter for the past few weeks, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter.
The paper saw the move as a sign that Mueller had expanded and intensified his investigation.
CNN reported that there are already initial subpoenas from the panel in connection with a meeting between Trump's eldest son and a Russian lawyer.
U.S. intelligence agencies have long accused the Kremlin of deliberately interfering in the 2016 presidential election campaign.
Mueller is investigating whether there was collusion between Trump's campaign team and Moscow.
The investigation is said to focus on several men who acted as campaign advisers to the Republican.
Reports are that Mueller was also increasingly scrutinizing Trump's personal and business environment.
The Washington Post reported a few weeks ago that special investigator Trump had personally moved into the center and was investigating the allegation of whether the president may have obstructed justice in the course of the affair.
The main task of grand juries is to examine evidence in potential criminal cases and decide whether to prosecute.
Grand juries are therefore also called trial boards.
They are usually used in larger and more controversial cases.
The procedure is always conducted behind closed doors.
The panel may also be called upon by the public prosecutor's office to summon persons to be examined under oath.
According to CNN, subpoenas have already been issued for Donald Trump Jr. to meet with a Russian lawyer.
The report said that persons involved in the meeting were asked to testify.
They should also provide documentation.
In addition to Trump Jr., Trump's adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner and his then campaign manager Paul Manafort were also present at the conversation.
Legal experts said on US television Thursday night that the appointment shows Mueller is not intimidated in his work and that he wants to act quickly if necessary.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to ionising radiation.
However, the establishment of the panel marks the beginning of a new phase in the investigation and a new cause for concern for President Trump.
Amid the new revelations, the president used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday night to portray the Russia affair as a campaign by his political opponents.
"The Russian story is a total fabrication", Trump said.
The issue gives Democrats a chance to "feel good because they have nothing else to talk about".
His special counsel Ty Cobb said in a statement that he was unaware of the grand jury's formation.
He stressed that the Commission was also usually working in secret.
The White House has been in favor of any measure that would speed up the Special Counsel's work in a "fair" way.
Former FBI Director James Comey has said three times that the president is not being investigated.
There is no reason to believe that anything has changed, the statement said.
But Mueller was only hired after Trump fired Comey.
Because of this expulsion, accusations against Trump had been raised of obstruction of justice.
Comey testified in June before a Senate committee that Trump had asked him to halt the investigation into then-National Security Advisor Michael Flynn.
The president is under a lot of pressure about the investigation.
According to US media reports, the White House was gathering material against the special counsel and his staff.
That's what sparked speculation about whether Trump would want to fire Mueller.
Unlike a congressional independent special investigator like the one in the Watergate scandal involving the late President Richard Nixon, Mueller is in a position where he could theoretically be fired by the Justice Department at the urging of the president.
Several senators from both parties want to prevent such a move.
Two groups of Republican and Democratic senators introduced bills Thursday that would make it impossible to dismiss the special counsel.
Antarctica: A giant iceberg is floating in the Antarctic
In the West Antarctic, a giant iceberg nearly seven times the size of Berlin has broken free of the ice sheet.
This was announced by the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research in Bremen on Wednesday.
The trillion-ton, 2,800-square-mile giant is now drifting north and will likely take two or three years to melt.
At 175 kilometers long and up to 30 miles wide, it is one of the largest ice giants researchers have recorded in the past three decades.
He's not a danger to humans.
Researchers say it is unclear to what extent climate change has played a role in the iceberg's breakdown.
But in all, there has been a series of unusual ice shelf collapses in the region for some 30 years, says a fact sheet from the U.S. Snow and Ice Research Center (NSIDC).
Many researchers believe that this may be related to global warming.
The colossus, now broken up, was previously part of the Larsen-C ice shelf.
Shell ice floats on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.
It thus grows further into the sea and breaks down regularly.
The Larsen-C ice shelf lies south of South America, almost at the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula.
North of this ice shelf, the balance of growth and shrinkage was upset a few years ago.
A complete ice shelf has broken up there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.
There is a good chance that the Larsen-C ice shelf is also in danger, because the front edge has never retreated as far as it is now.
The ice sheet is also under tension and may break if a piece breaks at a key point.
The melting of ice shelves and icebergs does not raise sea levels, for they float on water and ice displaces as much water as it produces after the melt itself.
However, the loss of shell ice means that the glaciers can flow directly into the sea and flow away much faster than before.
This could raise sea levels, but only slightly, says the British Antarctic Survey Research Project (Midas).
The Larsen-C ice sheet is the fourth largest ice sheet in Antarctica, with an area of almost 50,000 square kilometres, according to AWI.
At the crossroads from the mainland, it is up to 700 meters thick, at the leading edge to the open ocean about 200 meters.
It breaks down regularly there.
"Although it is a natural process and we are not aware of any direct link to climate change, the ice sheet is now in a more vulnerable position", said Martin O'Leary of Swansea University in the UK.
"This is the largest retreat since records began", he confirmed.
Scientists are debating whether the Larsen-C ice shelf will grow again or retreat and possibly collapse in the long term, said his colleague Adrian Luckman, adding: "Our models say it will be less stable".
But this development will take decades.
Although these researchers do not attribute the breaking of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, in recent decades a great many ice shelves on the Antarctic Peninsula have broken up.
This long tip of Antarctica extends toward South America.
According to the British Antarctic Survey, the Antarctic Peninsula's ice sheet has shrunk by some 28,000 square kilometers since the 1950's.
The temperature rise contributed to the decline.
The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed by about three degrees Fahrenheit [3.0°C] in the past 50 years, making it one of the areas where temperatures are rising fastest.
CDU wants a housing rate for staff
The CDU is calling for the union to be dissolved in order to become more attractive.
Just before the summer break, the county council waved 41 new jobs in the administration.
More than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in Mettmann.
Now, 17 more trainees have completed their first day of work.
The apprenticeships at the circle are obviously very popular.
Some 620 applications were received for the places to be awarded this year.
The circle still lacks staff to cope with the increased demands and tasks.
There are still 50 vacancies in Mettmann County.
The search for doctors and engineers, as well as general administration personnel, is ongoing.
The CDU now wants to take the initiative in the regional parliament together with the FDP and the UWG and tackle the shortage of skilled staff in the administration.
The administration is to 'develop a recruitment and development plan' at the request of the parties.
The aim is not only to meet short-term needs for skilled workers but also to counteract the shortage of candidates in a future-oriented way.
The overall approach should be oriented inward and outward, show concrete measures for the newcomers and include a training offensive, the CDU, FDP and UWG call for.
That sounds like a good approach.
Because the circle is dealing with personnel problems that were not known before.
Other cities recruit good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.
This is a real competition between public employers.
In addition, there is a high number of employees who leave the service due to illness or old age.
It is high time we took action to ensure that no more jobs are left unfilled.
But Klaus-Dieter Völker, leader of the CDU, goes further than the joint motion.
He recently caused a big surprise at the regional conference when he publicly questioned the cost of staffing and stunned the other parties.
Völker wants all possibilities to be examined to enable a person to withdraw from the municipal employers' association.
"If we do not find a satisfactory solution in the short term, the county administration should work with the unions - perhaps in cooperation with the county towns - to achieve a house tariff", says Völker.
The CDU is trying to pay the employees and civil servants better than the public service wage bill actually provides.
The salaries are currently strictly regulated, and increases or more money are only available if you move to a higher level based on years of service.
The tasks of the circle have, however, grown in recent years.
Only a few weeks ago new rooms had to be set up to accommodate employees for the new prostitution protection law.
Not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers, the county councillor Thomas Hendele and the district director Martin Richter have a problem: they have too little staff.
Italy toughened up its response to NGO migrant rescue boats
Italy has warned NGOs that use rescue boats to rescue migrants in the Mediterranean that they cannot continue to do so unless they comply with new rules for their operations.
"If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue to work", said Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa.
Minniti's warning came a day after Italian authorities seized a boat belonging to German aid organization Jugend Rettet because its crew had effectively cooperated with traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.
The aid organization, which has been in operation for only a year, refused to comment on detailed allegations by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"For us, saving human life is and will remain our top priority, so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at this time", the organization said in a statement on social media.
"We can only assess any allegations that are currently being made after we have gathered all the information and assessed the situation".
The Italian authorities had been monitoring the Youth Save the Children boat, the Iuventa, since October.
It is believed that his crew takes migrants on board the tubes, which are delivered directly to them by traffickers, and that the smugglers can leave so that the ships can be used again.
At least one such encounter allegedly took place just 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's file, the contents of which were published by Italian media.
The crew is suspected of overstepping the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, which monitors rescue operations in the zone on humanitarian grounds and not for any other reason.
The code of conduct requires boats such as the Iuventa to have an Italian police officer on board to supervise their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue have so far agreed to abide by the Code: Save the Children, MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules were considered unnecessary but acceptable as they would not bring "substantial changes or impediments" to its rescue operations.
Among those refusing to sign is the Nobel Prize-winning organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Minniti said the number of migrants arriving in Italy following rescue operations had fallen sharply in recent weeks, suggesting that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastguard and work with local mayors had borne fruit.
"In the last few days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel", the minister said.
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving those countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
Increases and Trials
Nine bikers from Weiler, the "Berliner Außenposten" and two guest riders met in Wachenheim in the North Palatinate to enjoy trials and sights for four days.
Three friendly guides were available.
The accommodation in the Wachenheim Valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.
The Wachenheim wine and castle festival was a welcome addition.
The first tour led to the Michaelkapelle above Deidesheim, in hot summer temperatures, along the vineyards.
There were lookout points, some on towers, from which one could see far beyond the Palatine Forest and the upstream plains.
In between, there were repeated longer climbs, for which long trials were rewarding.
The second day we went to Bad Dürkheim to the salt works and the popular sausage market.
Again, prospects lined up, linked by "flow" trials and moderate increases.
The last two days have seen a lot of high-altitude forecasts.
Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins, and huts brought welcome breaks.
In Bad Dürkheim, the bikers inhaled healing salt in the open air inhalation room.
Neustadt was also controlled.
After 173 kilometres and almost 4,500 metres above sea level, the group had come to know the Palatine Forest at its best - sporting and cultural.
Console instead of turf - Bundesliga prepares for e-sports
Will sports stars in the future sit in front of computer consoles instead of sweating through wind and weather to fight over the stadium courts?
The fact is, e-sports has long since become a serious business, a lucrative business - including big stars, millions of fans, and huge tournaments with high stakes.
This has been recognised by the first Bundesliga clubs, which are increasingly involved in this area.
The start was made in 2015 by VfL Wolfsburg, later followed by FC Schalke 04 and most recently by VfB Stuttgart, which founded an e-sports department in mid-July and signed two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17.
"We hope to attract a whole new target group of young people to the VfB", says Executive Board member Jochen Röttgermann.
He is sure "that there will be several clubs on this train".
This coming weekend, the FIFA World Football Federation will be organizing the first Interactive Club World Cup in London, in which players from different clubs will compete against each other.
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain and PSV Eindhoven have qualified.
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sports.
The former coach of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen is now a consultant for a virtual football player agency.
"Real football has to deal with the 14-30 year olds in particular, that the young people will still go to the stadium in the future", says the 52-year-old.
And the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets, especially the Asian ones.
With high-profile e-sports players under contract, you could be online in these markets far more often than sending the Bundesliga team to Asia just once a year.
What exactly is this about?
In e-sports, computer games such as League of Legends, Dota 2, Counterstrike and the football simulation FIFA are contested on a competitive level.
Like other sports, leagues have long been established where professionals compete against each other.
And at the 2022 Asian Games, e-sports is already part of the official program.
But is it even a real sport?
For many, the idea is certainly a time-consuming one.
Ingo Frobösé has also been dealing with this question for a long time.
For the professor at the German Sports University in Cologne, e-sports is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that are also found in classical sports - for example, increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.
It also requires cognitive skills, technical and tactical understanding, and quick reactions.
Professional gamers should not only train on the console, but also train their bodies and pay attention to their diet.
"The fit player is a good player".
Frobösé also sees problems: "Doping is becoming an increasingly important issue".
The Commission has also examined the possibility of a new scheme for the provision of information on the use of electronic money.
The scientist emphasises the high integrative effect of e-sports.
The players are traveling internationally, it's like a big global family, there are no intercultural barriers.
A study by the consultancy Deloitte and the German Association of Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts a rapid growth in e-sports.
In 2016, 50 million euros were turned over in Germany, mainly through advertising, sponsorship and large tournaments.
In three years, the company's turnover is expected to be 130 million.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to this effect.
However, e-sports "are nowhere near as far behind established sports like handball, basketball and ice hockey", write Deloitte consultants.
Many countries are already ahead of the curve.
Major markets are Asia and the US, where former basketball players Shaquille O'Neal and baseball star Alex Rodriguez are competing on US Team NRG eSports.
Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher is investing in the eSports betting company Uniqrn.
There is also a lot going on in Europe.
In a Norwegian school, e-sports was introduced as a subject, says Froböse.
In the Netherlands and France, according to Dutt, the football clubs in the top leagues are now obliged to set up an e-sports department.
"Germany is lagging behind in European comparison", explains VfB's board member Röttgermann.
Just falling into nostalgia and glamorizing the old days is no longer enough.
The aim is to preserve the tradition of the association, but at the same time to orient the company to the modern market.
"We live in a digitalised world", says Dutt.
"You can't just stick to football and everything stays the same".
Poisoned eggs - The egg alternatives to cooking and baking
The scandal over poisoned eggs has now affected almost all the federal states.
Aldi South and Aldi North have responded and withdrawn all eggs from sale throughout Germany.
Only eggs that have been shown to be free of fipronil should be placed on the shelves.
Michelle Carter convicted of writing lyrics urging Conrad Roy to commit suicide.
A Massachusetts woman was sentenced to two and a half years in prison for encouraging her boyfriend to commit suicide by texting and calling her.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will serve 15 months of her sentence behind bars and five years on probation.
Carter was convicted in June of the manslaughter of Conrad Roy, who took his own life on July 13, 2014.
Roy's father said at the hearing on Thursday: "My family is inconsolable.
My son was my best friend".
Carter was allowed to remain free until appeal.
She had faced a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her lawyers argued that both she and Mr. Roy suffered from mental illness.
Dressed in red pants and a cream-colored blouse, Carter stood there with tears in her eyes, hands folded and eyes downward as she was sentenced.
"Your actions killed Conrad Roy", the prosecutor told the court.
"She ended his life to make her own better.
She has not taken responsibility", she said.
"She showed no remorse".
But Carter's lawyer said it was a "terrible circumstance that she deeply regrets".
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz said he had not found that her "age or maturity or even her mental illness had any significant influence on her actions".
A prosecutor read a statement from Roy's mother, Lynn Roy, who said that "there is not a day that goes by that I do not mourn the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I handle everything, and I try to be there for his sisters despite all the pain we'll carry with us for eternity".
Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, testified that she was "haunted" by the realization that she would never attend her brother's wedding or be an aunt to his children.
"Not having the one person I've been with every day since I was born is a pain I'll carry with me for the rest of my life", she said.
This case seems to set a legal precedent, since there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to encourage another person to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 when Roy was found dead in a vehicle in 2014 from carbon monoxide poisoning.
The case drew national attention after Carter's text messages revealed that she had encouraged him to end his life.
"Hang yourself, jump off a building, stab yourself, I don't know, there are many ways", she said in several messages she sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family.
In the moments before he killed himself, she wrote, "You have to do it, Conrad", and "All you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy".
Judge Moniz said that Carter was seeking attention by Roy's death and ordered that she be allowed to profit from the case through some sort of press.
The case has divided the legal opinion.
Among the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted in 2007 of murdering her British roommate in Italy before being acquitted two years ago.
Mrs. Knox, 30, wrote in the Los Angeles Times: "Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not prison".
Joshua Kimmich: Learning from the new mini-lamb of FC Bayern
It's no coincidence that Joshua Kimmich was named captain of the Audi Cup.
FC Bayern is confident that the Confederations Cup winner will have a great season - extra motivation can't hurt.
There was something different about his seat in the cabin, which Joshua Kimmich saw immediately, even though the extra garment was very, very small.
But since neither Philipp Lahm nor Manuel Neuer were visible on the second day of the Audi Cup, he took the band he was assigned.
"The coach didn't announce it", the Confederations Cup winner said after his first stint as Bayern captain.
Well, the score could have been better than the 0-2 against SSC Naples.
But the sign from Coach could mean that to Kimmich.
It was not the eight-year-old Arturo Vidal who had been chosen as the leader of the C-Eleven, which consisted of youth players, debutants and recently retired professionals.
You know, sugar is best given to people you trust, people you want to keep in a good mood.
So whoever's been chosen to succeed Lame could use a little extra motivation.
Kimmich confirmed: "That's what you want as a player: to take responsibility".
On Wednesday, the 22-year-old was flying across the field as a mini-lamb.
Back right, that's his position now, the white ribbon on his arm did the rest.
And overall, Kimmich looked like the guy who could handle the helm best in this starting lineup.
He gave orders, tried to guide the untrained troop.
He had the eye for the whole thing while many others were busy with themselves.
Vidal by overplaying his lack of fitness (barely succeeded); Renato Sanches by using the performance of the Asian tour (also only partially succeeded); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle by not being noticed negatively in their first appearance in the Bayern shirt.
Well, that worked out pretty well.
Süle ran alongside Kimmich, Rudy in front of the defense, both acting sovereign.
The well-known Napoli Storm often had a hard time, and Süle also tried to build up a few times.
His colleague Rudy admitted that the result was "not what we had hoped for".
But he also showed a decent performance at his debut.
"I was chosen for this style".
How unusual this Bayern world is for the newcomers, you saw after the game.
Rudy, for example, did not give one or two interviews in the catacombs, but probably six or seven.
Kimmich said goodbye after a few cracking statements behind the backs of his new teammates.
There he heard an interesting sentence from Süle: "What is going on here, I have already noticed.
With Bayern, you just have to win every game".
At least he doesn't have to teach the new guy that anymore.
Alaba is motivating women
David Alaba believes in the success of our women
Austria's most famous footballer has just before the game, tweeted and wished the ÖFB ladies all the best.
The Bavarian legionnaire is a club mate of ÖFB captain Schnaderbeck and feverishly with our ladies.
The tweet from the Austrian footballer of the year and Champions League winner should be a special motivational injection.
The famous Bavarian duffel could be useful to our ladies.
Businesses satisfied with minister of Rhineland-Palatinate: the economy praises the pace of knowledge
The relationship between the country and the regional economy was often irreconcilable when Eveline Lemke (Greens) was Minister for Economic Affairs in Rhineland-Palatinate.
This is evident after more than a year of the new Minister for Economic Affairs Volker Wissing (FDP).
Chambers and companies from the region are talking about a change in economic policy - and at the same time blaming the former minister.
Frank Natus, chairman of the Trier Business Association (VTU), says: "Wissing is catching up to the wishes of the economy, which have all been blocked by Lemke".
The biggest change Natus sees is in infrastructure policy: closing the gap on motorway 1 between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the country's priority list.
The Ministry hopes to have a planning process in place this year and to have the building permit in place by 2021.
The western bypass of Trier, which is one of the most urgent needs of the Federal Transport Route Plan, also plays a role in the plans of the country.
The aim is to put the line into operation in December 2020, says ministry spokeswoman Cornelia Holtmann.
The Commission has also been involved in the preparation of the draft budget for the European Investment Bank.
The Chamber of Commerce and Industry (IHK) Trier is seeking, as suggested by Wissing, a Rhineland-Palatinate label for wine in order to boost sales in supermarkets and halt the trend of declining German wine exports over the past decade.
The IHK also praises Wissing for being open to people who want to start their own company.
The Chamber of Crafts Trier sees the new master bonus as an additional incentive for young apprentices, says Managing Director Matthias Schwalbach.
The award is of EUR 1000 for passing the master's examination and EUR 2500 for graduates who become self-employed within ten years of completing their master's degree.
The list of homework assignments for the country is still long.
The planned road construction is a matter of quick fact-finding, but the country lacks the necessary staff, says Jan Glockauer, chief executive of the IHK Trier.
Of the 56 new engineers Wissing intends to recruit at the national Mobility company, only 29 are employed so far.
The IHK calls for more contracts to be awarded to external offices.
Christian Baldauf, a CDU group member, refers to the Court of Auditors' calculations that the country invests more than 20 million euros less in 2017 and 2018 in maintaining national roads than proposed.
Frank Natus also expects a country's concept of how it will address the shortage of skilled workers in the region.
The Commission has also been concerned about the lack of progress in the field of broadband.
In 2016, regional companies had rated their network provision in an IHK survey at only 3,4.
They complained about blocked Internet connections and outages.
The former Minister of Economic Affairs Eveline Lemke, on the other hand, is currently out of politics and still sits on the supervisory board of the wind power company Pro Wind.
The Green Group left Lemke in April to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe - where it had already left again after four months because of disagreements.
Audi to replace 850,000 diesel vehicles - carmakers face backlash
A day before Audi's announcement, BMW said it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW chairman said the company believes "there are smarter options than driving restrictions", referring to European cities - including Munich, where BMW is based - banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it would modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.
None of the companies described the undertakings as recalls.
European car manufacturers have strongly promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emission rules.
But the nitrogen oxides emitted by diesel engines are considered carcinogenic and can cause asthma.
The costs for car manufacturers to install systems to neutralize the exhaust emissions of diesel vehicles are also increasing, making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of coddling the powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem.
The companies are trying to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen, which used so-called off-road devices that could regulate emissions to comply with regulations when a car was tested but reversed under normal driving conditions.
In the United States, several Volkswagen employees have been charged, others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics at Audi's engine development was arrested in Germany.
The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and therefore not protected from extradition and could be prosecuted in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was involved in German criminal investigations into Volkswagen after authorities accused Audi of installing a system to circumvent emissions regulations in Europe, and an inquiry focused on the United States was expanded.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet received any information on the existence of a market failure in the Union market.
This message has the raft on Saturday on the Isar
The city wants to protect the Isar.
To help the visitors of Isar, a raft will sail through Munich tomorrow Saturday with a special message.
If you go to the Isar again on Saturday, you'll see a big raft between Flaucher and Reichenbachbrücke.
And this is no ordinary raft with Isar tourists.
The building department wants to clarify.
On the raft, you can see a large transparent screen.
It shows a garbage dump.
The start of a publicity campaign to appeal to Isar visitors.
The motto "True love is ... " is intended to raise awareness of the Isar as a wild river worth protecting.
The float has been running on the Isar since last summer and this year there are further actions and measures to achieve a more respectful and environmentally conscious behaviour.
Mordillo's knob noses and the laughter of suffering
Mordillo was for a time one of the most published cartoonists, and his character's tuberous noses are his trademark.
Even at 85, the Argentine still draws and works on a film.
His message: Laugh, "because there's too much suffering in the world".
Guillermo Mordillo was born on August 4, 1932, the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.
In his early years as an artist, he worked as a greeting card artist, which frustrated him.
"The happiest day of my professional life was the day I lost my job", he once said.
After stations in Lima, New York and Paris, he achieved his breakthrough at the end of the 1960s: with the publication of his cartoons in "Paris Match" and then also in "Stern" and other leading magazines around the world.
Even in China, Mordillo found many fans.
Time and again, the artist drew inspiration from cities.
Large, round Mordillo figures are tampered with in drawings of the Leaning Tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London, and Red Square in Moscow.
He says that he still sits at the drawing table early in the morning and works almost ten hours a day.
Through calendars, puzzles, books for adults and children, T-shirts, stuffed animals and watches, his funny characters continue to find widespread worldwide distribution.
He has also been working on a cartoon and a TV series with his characters for six years.
The main character in "Crazy Island" is a giraffe - Mordillo's favorite animal in his drawings - who has a thousand-foot man as his opponent.
For the first time, his characters speak in the 3D film, which is scheduled to be released in 2019.
"I don't know exactly what they're going to say, it's weird for me", Mordillo says.
The script isn't written by him.
So he's more into the TV series, which, like his original cartoons, is wordless.
Lavinia from Provence threatened by climate change
It has become a symbol of Provence in southern France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change.
The drought-like conditions and disease-carrying insects are causing the lavender to decline, causing great headaches for scientists and farmers trying to find solutions.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the CRIEPPAM agricultural research institute in Provence, said: "The lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in recent years, which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in the autumn.
This has an impact on the shelf life of lavender.
There is also a small cicada, a microbe that transmits dwarf cicadas, and in very dry weather there are many of them".
And there's a lot at stake.
Lavender oil is not only a delight for vacationers, but it is also in great demand for perfumes and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said, "Instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers, we have smaller ones, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.
So we have fewer parts with essential oil".
Solutions considered include better water distribution and slowing evaporation from the soil, but also spraying the plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and developing varieties that are more resistant to drought.
The town of Geisa in the Thuringian Rhône celebrates its 1200th anniversary this year.
The highlight of the festival is this Saturday and Sunday with a medieval festival.
In the city centre, you can find shops, clubs, merchants, vagrants or a camp for farm servants.
The murder of a journalist highlights the growing threat in Mexico
The staff of the weekly newspaper Riodoce usually meet on Wednesdays to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in Sinaloa state caused by organized crime, corrupt officials and relentless drug wars.
But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about safety.
They were told that it was important to change their routines.
Two high-ranking journalists discuss what feels safer: take their children, who were the target of a 2009 grenade attack, into the office or leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on a board at the front of the room: enemy, neutral, ally.
They ask reporters to suggest names for each column - no proof needed, perceptions and gut feelings are enough.
There are drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of being on the payroll of the government or cartels, a catalog of criminals who are making Mexico's chaos dangerous.
There is no rest from the violence, and while the bodies are piling up across the country, more journalists are doing it: at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012, 589 are under federal protection after attacks and threats, and so far this year there have been at least seven deaths in seven states.
Among the latter is its editor and inspirer of Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist", Valdez wrote in one of his many books on drug-related violence.
His absence is deeply felt, although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez showing his middle finger with the word "Justice" hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building.
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, the trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor's office was established in 2010 to handle the cases of journalists, it has only opened two criminal proceedings, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.
As with most of the thousands of murders linked to drug trafficking and organized crime each year, the killers of journalists are rarely brought to justice.
At Riodoce, they still insist on dealing with the violence in Sinaloa, even though they are inconsolable and even though the terrain is now even more treacherous.
Without information on the killers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security is of little use, says Ibarra.
"It's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop", he says.
"Until we know the why, we'll distrust everyone".
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the state capital of Culiacan.
He only managed to drive a few blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men, forced out of his car, and shot 12 times, presumably because of the newspaper's name - which translates to "Twelve Rivers".
The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left behind a wife and two grown children.
Rumors tend to fly free in Culiacan.
But on the subject of Valdez, there's virtually nothing but silence.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the country's bloodiest battlegrounds as rival factions battle to fill the vacuum.
It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa, every day, someone or several people are shot in the street or that the cemetery is full of ornate, two-story mausoleums for drug lords that are bigger than many houses for the living.
Forget for a minute that there is a state of "quiet" when only one cartel controls the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trafficking routes to the United States.
Despite this and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, is torn with guilt for not being able to protect his friend.
He believes two misunderstandings contributed to the murder.
First, in February, there was the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel factions at war with Guzman's sons.
This publication may have angered the sons, as suspected gang members bought up every copy of the magazine as soon as it was delivered to newsstands.
The second mistake was not forcing Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after another newspaper had been seized that had published the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be here.
He was a senior reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he teamed up with five colleagues to start Riodoce and sold $50 stakes.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to do journalism without encountering the drug problem", Bojorquez said.
In time, the newspaper gained a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.
Reporters loved to publish hard-hitting investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication that allowed them to read stories that no one else dared cover.
Eight years after Riodoce was founded, it received the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Prize for its coverage of Latin America.
That same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award from the Committee to Protect Journalists for his courage in pursuing the Mexican drug story wherever it led.
He voluntarily admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to live on", he said at the time of the CPJ award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa "is a way of life", he said in an interview with Rompeviento TV last October.
"You have to do the job that you have to do as a journalist - either that or you play the fool.
I don't want to be asked, "What did you do with so many dead people... why didn't you tell me what was going on?"
The Riodoce team misses Valdez, the fun bird who could curse like a dockworker, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trusted his routine.
He'd always wear his hat.
He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar across the street from the office, and sit at the same table.
Now they ask, was his love of routine his downfall?
His death has also forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their job and stay alive.
"They don't like you messing with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret airstrips" to move drugs.
"These things were not allowed", said Bojorquez.
The result is, even in the best of times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.
Trust your own instincts.
If it smells bad, stay away from it.
The trouble is, said Riodoce editor Andres Villarreal, that "smell is a sense that can be fooled... and then the thing with Javier happened".
The old rules, he and others say, no longer apply in Sinaloa - just as they do in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states, which are home to a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where Riodoce employees were meeting for security training, suddenly no cell phones were allowed, days before it was revealed that spyware sold exclusively to governments was being used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two policemen sought shelter from the 104 degree heat in the shade of a tree.
They were tasked by the state government to protect Riodoce's offices in a four-story building in a middle-class neighborhood of Culiacan.
Half-jokingly, some of the reporters wondered if these officers were among the 50 percent of police officers the governor himself described as untrustworthy.
It's been months since reporters have been in the mountains where the drug gangs are de facto in control.
For this week's issue, Riodoce looked at three main stories.
There was the murder of the brother of the famous former boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had a government spending exposé focused on the governor's hometown.
And there was a group that carried out a kidnapping in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the DA's office.
There was no official word on who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was advised when it came time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite spot of drug dealers and authorities.
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who belonged to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which dominated all political levels for almost a century.
Recently, several PRI governors have been accused of high-profile corruption cases.
Villarreal asked the reporter to cover previous incidents at the restaurant, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military raid.
Only a few months earlier, readers would have considered Valdez's column the best source of information about the kidnapping.
"We would have known what happened earlier", said Villarreal, 46, nicknamed "El Flaco" for his slender build.
"Now all channels of communication with our sources are broken".
Valdez's office was turned into a storage room for signs and stickers protesting the killing of journalists because the staff became something they never expected: activists on behalf of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed some signs and went to the prosecutor's office the next morning to protest another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Michoacan.
A burnt body was discovered and officials say, based on DNA testing, it's his.
Throughout the country, journalists have become more vocal, writing "SOS Press" on sidewalks and buildings in organized protests.
On that day, Director Bojorquez is away in Washington, D.C., trying to rally international support for justice in the Valdez case.
In a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after Valdez's murder, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and having them killed for telling the truth.
She has since asked for her to be reassigned by the government, because she's worried that her anger has violated her objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were "surrounded" by organized crime, government officials involved in it and an indifferent society.
In his latest book, "Narco-Journalism", he wrote that reporters are killed not only by drug gangs, but also on the orders of politicians and security forces who are under the umbrella of organized crime.
The media watchdog group Article 19 has attributed more than half of the attacks on journalists to police and officials last year.
"In Mexico, you die because they want you to shut up", Ramirez said.
Obviously, the murders are a deterrent.
No one forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
Her body was found with a note allegedly signed by the Zetas cartel: "I'm here for my reports".
A computer keyboard and headphones were next to her severed head.
Some branches have opted to close, like El Norte newspaper in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the murder of its correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others continue, as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the murder of their director in 2004.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with an editorial on the front page titled "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled their home countries or even the country.
It's a painful decision.
It's hard to find work in exile, and they're still watching the streets, looking for dangers.
And sometimes they get hunted, as apparently happened to photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 along with four other women in a Mexico City apartment three months after escaping from Veracruz.
For those who stay behind and keep working, it's a daily dance with risky choices.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that the drug trade scares him.
"Mexico is going to hell, and that's why I became a reporter", he said.
At midnight last Friday, when the last issue was already finished, the editors of Riodoce were sitting on the sidewalk outside the office drinking beer when suddenly all their phones started buzzing.
A series of shootings with rival gangs and security forces near the seaside resort of Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.
The war escalated further, as promised by a series of cartel messages in the region.
From the edge of the cliff, they posted the news on the Riodoce website via mobile.
The cover had to be changed the next day.
Sirens are wailing nearby - another shooting in the area.
Bojorquez glanced at the policemen on guard to see if they were ready.
If they were afraid, they didn't show it.
Beneath the huge portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible to all of Sinaloa, Riodoce's staff followed in his footsteps.
"How can you even think of closing", Bojorquez said, "when on the same day Javier was murdered, the intern asked me to send her out to cover the street".
Dinosaurs used camouflage to evade their enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue, though a frightening one.
Now researchers have discovered that the first findings of the incredible rhinoceros of a Canadian miner have been so well preserved that experts have described it as the "Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs".
It was so well preserved that they could even tell that his scaly skin was reddish brown - and they said it had had something of a "troubled past".
The report in the journal Current Biology called it "the best preserved armored dinosaur ever found and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world".
The fossil is a newly discovered species of nodosaur that lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
Its incredibly well-preserved condition has baffled researchers, who describe it as "really remarkable"
According to reports in National Geographic, the armored herbivore is the best preserved fossil of its kind.
It was found by Shawn Funk while digging at the Suncor Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada on March 21, 2011.
He came across something that seemed out of place from the surrounding rock and decided to take a closer look.
The fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
They spent the next six years uncovering the wild animal inside the 2,500-pound [1,100 kg] lump of earth.
After all this hard work, the finished product is now ready to be revealed.
"If you blink a little, you could almost believe it was asleep", said lead author Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is on display.
"It will go down in the annals of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs".
Researchers have found that this herbivore, although covered in armor and resembling a walking tank, was likely threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs.
The heavily armored dinosaur used a red and white cloak to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as counter shading, which is also used by many modern animals.
This would have allowed it to blend in better with its environment and avoid its enemies, experts say, suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.
The 110-million-year-old creature from the Nodosaurus family made headlines for the first time in May and is now on display at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers have now studied the wild animal, naming it Borealopelta markmitchelli after museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours carefully uncovering it.
The amazing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armor on its body.
They discovered the counter shading, a common defense method in the animal kingdom, which means the top of the creature was darker than its underside.
Although the counter-scattering is common, the results are surprising, since the size of Borealopelta far exceeds that of the animals alive today.
It suggests that the dinosaur was hunted by enough pressure from carnivorous dinosaurs that evolution favored the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival.
But most modern animals that use countershading -- think deer, zebras, or belts -- are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey, which signals that this nodosaur was in a real fight for survival.
"Strong predator behavior on a massive, heavily armored dinosaur shows how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the Cretaceous must have been", Brown said.
Chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the dinosaur's skin was reddish brown.
Scientists continue to examine the animal for clues to its life, including its preserved intestinal contents, to find out what it ate as its last meal.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, it fell into a river and was swept out to sea, where it sank to the bottom of the sea on its back.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as southern Florida is today, and rivers and oceans were probably much more inland than they are today.
"This nodosaur is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved scaly skin, but it also retains three dimensions and the original shape of the animal", Brown said.
"The result is that the animal today looks almost exactly as it did in the Early Cretaceous.
You don't have to use much imagination to reconstruct it, and if you just squint a little bit, you could almost believe he's sleeping".
The Cretaceous was a time when giant theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs that stood on two legs, roamed the Earth.
Although the king of them, Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of its fearsome ancestors.
Among them is the acrocanthosaurus, a 38-foot-long [11.5 m] monster that weighed six tons.
The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta sank into the sea after death and was mummified in mud.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk while digging at the Suncor Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada on March 21, 2011.
According to the museum, it is the best preserved armored dinosaur in the world, including skin and armor, and is complete from the snout to the hip.
The creatures averaged about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
It contained two 20-inch-long tips sticking out of his shoulders.
Researchers believe that the armored herbivore swam across western Canada until a flooded river washed it into the open ocean.
But the dinosaur's underwater burial preserved its armor in exquisite detail.
The fossilized remains of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the skin remains still cover bumpy plates of armor along the dinosaur
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of preservation is as rare as a lottery win.
The more I look at it, the more confusing it gets.
Fossil remains of the skin still cover the bumpy plates of armor that support the animal's skull.
His right front foot is on his side, his five fingers are spread upwards.
I can count the scales on his sole.
In the storm: mass car crash on A8: Many injured
A major accident on the A8 on Thursday evening: almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass car crash.
There are numerous injured, miles of traffic jams and gaffers.
On the motorway Stuttgart-Munich (A8) about 20 people were injured in a mass car crash late Thursday afternoon.
According to initial information from the police, about 17:00 between the junctions of Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (Landkreis Aichach-Friedberg) during a thunderstorm, almost 30 vehicles, including probably trucks, collided with each other.
The exact number of injured was not initially known.
The injuries were mild to moderate, a police spokesman said.
A large number of rescue vehicles were at the accident site.
The A8 towards Munich has been completely closed.
In the direction of Munich, a traffic jam of about ten kilometers in length formed.
A reporter from AZ reports that there were also massive obstacles on the opposite lane - caused by numerous gaffers.
The fire department took note of the license plates of the drivers, who now face heavy penalties.
Shortly after 18:45 a second accident occurred on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.
A car and a truck had collided.
A rescue helicopter was en route to the crash site.
German Railways: Group tests "comfort check-in"
It's a moment almost everyone has experienced: you're sitting in a train and you're sleeping, not knowing.
Or you're just in the middle of your work and you have a brilliant idea.
And then, poof.
The driver comes in and wakes you up unkindly or pulls the passenger out of the middle of the workflow.
I'm going to the ticket office.
But the days of interruptions are soon over.
The German Railways is currently testing driverless ticketing.
You just confirm by phone that you've taken your seat and you're depreciating the ticket.
A test run is currently underway on two lines.
"If the offer comes in, we'll expand it.
It is expected to be available on many other long-distance routes in Germany early next year", said a railway spokesman.
"Comfort check-in" is what the railroad calls the unmanned ticketing.
However, to use them, you must meet certain requirements: You need a smartphone or tablet.
And you have to have booked a ticket online - which most passengers already do anyway.
You also have to have bought it through the railway's app, DB Navigator, which is the most convenient way to book a ticket anyway.
And last but not least, you need a seat reservation.
Because the way the convenience check-in works is you get on the train, you look up your ticket under "My Tickets".
The test customers will then see a button for electronic de-evaluation.
The train crew will receive a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and has taken the reserved seat Y.
When the train attendant arrives at the ticket office, he knows that there is a passenger sitting there with an already devalued online ticket.
So you can keep sleeping, keep working, keep quiet.
The "check-in" has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train - which in turn is to benefit the passengers.
"If you want to travel without being checked by our train attendants, simply check in to the DB Navigator yourself.
This allows passengers to make their journey time on the train more personal", says Michael Peterson, Marketing Director at DB Long Distance Transport.
Secondly, "and our employees have more time than ever to respond to individual customer needs".
Those who travel often on trains know that, along with delays and missed trains, ticket checks are one of the biggest annoyances.
Because often you, and in any case one of your fellow passengers, do not have all the documents you need to redeem online tickets.
Either the credit card or the ID card or some other document that you have to show is missing.
The result is endless discussions between train attendant and passenger, which leads to bad mood in the compartment or large area and delays in checking one's ticket, and in the end takes the driver's time to take care of other concerns.
Only a small number of test customers can use the new service.
The Commission has not yet received any comments from the interested parties.
Other train numbers on the same line have not yet been released.
How an activist came to know the answer to the question, "Whose Streets?"
On August 9th, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to her core.
Just one day after arriving in New York City, the St. Louis native was sitting on the bed of an Airbnb apartment she rented and scrolling through Facebook on her phone.
She stumbled across a post from someone from high school.
"Police just killed an 18-year-old kid, and he's still lying in the street", it said.
Confused that no one else had posted the information on her feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with the handle @TheePharoah was constantly retweeted on her timeline.
The St. Louis area rapper was about to tweet live the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body lying on the street, and it would stay there for four hours.
"This is crazy", Ferrell thought to himself.
But death was nothing new to her and her community.
She hung up her phone to return to tweets about people on the Canfield drive later that evening.
There were photos of the police band and people screaming and a man claiming to be Brown's father carrying a sign that said, "Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!"
She was watching a live feed of a police officer standing in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, she said, another officer unloaded his rifle and shouted, "I'm gonna kill you... animals all".
"That's not common", Ferrell recalled her statement.
"This is not the kind of murder we're used to, and we can call it typical".
At that moment, I felt a chill.
I was angry and I cried".
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 11 p.m., she picked up her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two of them would head to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson over the next three years is the subject of a new documentary, "Whose Streets?", in theaters starting October 11.
It's a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resilience, told from the perspective of people who live in the community and filled the streets demanding answers.
As Ferrell drove to Ferguson with her daughter, who was wearing a floral dress and a matching crown, the two discussed a conversation they had had countless times before that morning about the black experience and the black condition.
"Remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe in?" she remembered what she said.
"We're going to Ferguson now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and it wasn't right.
I couldn't take her", Ferrell said later.
"What happened today is a culmination of what happened in the past.
She needs to know it and see it and be raised in it.
It has to be well developed, not only activism and organization, but also knowing the different layers of black experience and black constitution and what we have to do to become free, to free ourselves.
Even though I'm lucky enough to give her an experience where she personally doesn't experience blatant racism, she's no different than the next black woman's child.
I feel I'd be doing her a disservice if I kept her away from it".
The first stop when they arrived in Ferguson was on South Florissant Road, a place across from the police station that became a campground while activists waited for the possible non-indictment of Officer Darren Wilson.
There, Ferrell and her daughter connected with a local business owner who was making lunch.
They prepared bags and helped to distribute them to protesters.
Slowly, a new kind of activism began to take shape for Ferrell.
"My activism has changed completely since August 9", she said, noting that as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was president of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food equity and health inequities in black communities.
"I had no experience in organizing.
It's all come through".
Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-directors, during an evening demonstration.
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to "document" what happened.
A question popped into Ferrell's head: "Do you want to document or are you trying to find a story you can exploit?"
This skepticism has been fueled by countless cases of people, often white, in a community that has benefited from their pain and resilience.
As Folayan explained in a recent interview, "We had heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson didn't have their voices centered, and we wanted to do something different".
Folayan had previously worked with then-co-director Damon Davis, a local artist known for his activism around death row inmates.
His commitment brought Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other locals who followed the team of Whose Streets? in the years after Brown's shooting.
"This documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us.
"That was the main thing for me, how these people are portrayed, because that's how I'm going to be portrayed".
The goal was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - to show that the movement is "not about a messiah leader, but a community coming together", Folayan said - she proved to be the most outspoken participant in the film.
As a result, documents from Whose Streets? show surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life as she falls in love and marries her wife.
"I felt naked", said Ferrell, laughing as she saw the finished product for the first time.
"But I've learned that in this work, in humanizing black people, there has to be a certain vulnerability".
Furthermore, Ferrell's story repeats the role of black gay women in the broader Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement who influenced the 2012 murder of black teenager Trayvon Martin in the social media movie "BlacklivesMatter" identify as gay.
"Black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement as a whole", Ferrell said, "and so we're constantly fighting on different fronts.
Black, gay women have to bear the brunt of everything".
Folayan agreed to note that "the movement is really being sustained by black women and many black women".
However, she insists that "this is not an affirmative type of action" in which Ferrell was chosen as the heart of the film because of her identity.
"She was the person who stirred up that energy", she said.
"It's no coincidence that she was at the front lines, "because a life at these crossroads as a black, gay woman is so much at stake.
You can feel their energy through the screen".
Now, the news cameras in Ferguson are long gone, but the racial ties between the community and the police continue.
Ferrell is on probation for two and a half years for blocking a highway during a demonstration.
She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls home as "a mess".
Yet she clings to a song and feels committed to that memory since she took to the streets in Ferguson three years ago.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It's our duty to win.
We must love and support one another.
We have nothing to lose - except our chains".
From "dream" to "magnitude": TV viewers discuss the bit gallery
The Bit Gallery is moving people, even though it's far from finished.
But the idea of a shopping mall at the southern end of the pedestrian zone has divided the population into supporters and opponents since it was first presented in 2009.
It's hard to be cold about it.
The issue is also discussed on our Facebook page "People's Friend Bitburg".
While some say to the Bit-Gallery: "That would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be really cool" (Nicole Schausten), from the other side comes: "Don't need a human" (Siggi Betzen) or simply: "Greatness!" (Lars Scholz).
While advocates of a gallery are counting on it to attract more customers to the city, which will benefit the other shops, opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will bleed out.
The gallery is planned to be built on the same site as the Farmers' Market Hall, where 13 direct marketers will be selling their products.
When the construction starts, it will be over.
The gallery's creators want to integrate a market hall into the new building - towards Beda Square with the possibility of sitting outside.
Simone Zimmer: "We have been shopping at the farmers' market almost every week for many years.
Mostly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the peasant women.
We also discovered the butcher shop for ourselves.
We would like to see a chance to maintain this offer during and after the gallery is built.
They're in other cities, too.
The Kleinmarkthalle in Frankfurt is particularly interesting".
Gerd Densing: "Whether direct marketers settle in a market hall in the gallery depends on the amount of rent.
But it is not likely to be so low for the new project".
Eva Kilic: "Why shopping malls in Bitburg?
Whether it's clothes, shoes, drug stores or supermarkets, I find that superfluous.
There's enough of that in our town.
You can see how many shops are empty here, some for months and years.
But since there is not even a proper weekly market here, it is all the more important that we at least keep the market hall.
The product is fresh, mostly offered directly by the producer and is inexpensive.
As you can see, shops in a shopping centre are rented only by larger companies, because the rents there are often not affordable for a retailer.
It is a pity, because there are almost no specialty shops and what is left of them will probably disappear".
Wolf Fandel: "I don't think a shopping centre with a market hall is a good fit.
And the gallery doesn't fit in with Bitburg.
Most importantly, where will the farmers' market be during construction?
The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long term, if the Bit Gallery actually comes along.
Or will the ghost Bit-Gallery be able to drive all the businesses out of Bitburg before then?"
George Marquet: "This is just not going to work.
And a shopping mall that's empty is not needed.
I think it would have been better to promote a real farmers' market instead of this gallery.
But thanks to the many, I think, pointless construction projects in Bitburg, there is no room for a farmers' market.
If the farmers' market hall is destroyed, another piece of culture will disappear".
A fitting analogy: an artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning 's DNA .
In the center of the room at the Fridman Gallery in New York, you can see many faces - white, black and brown, almost imperceptibly similar - hanging from cables in the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from cheek puppets and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the clips from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former intelligence analyst was serving a 35-year sentence for leaking classified diplomatic messages through the WikiLeaks website.
The new exhibition, which opened on August 2, is called A Becoming Resemblance.
It's the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline combined her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a trans woman and groundbreaking dissident whose conviction was overturned by Barack Obama when he was just three days into office.
Dewey-Hagborg, by algorithmically analyzing the DNA that Manning extracted and creating 30 portraits of what someone with this genomic data might look like, has created a sharp, if somewhat intellectual, commentary not only on the formability of DNA data -- the many ways it can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations -- but also on identity.
Manning, who was born Bradley Edward but has been open about identifying as a woman since her adolescence, was convicted in 2013 on 20 charges, including six violations of the Espionage Act, computer fraud and theft.
Her image was suppressed by the prison, so much so that there was only one photo -- a grainy, black and white selfie of Manning visibly uncomfortable in a driver's seat wearing a platinum blonde wig -- that she was associated with.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg was just coming off the huge success of her 2012 project Stranger Visions.
In it, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts like cigarette butts and gum by extracting DNA from the waste to create a picture of what these people might look like.
That's when she got an email from a newspaper magazine.
"They interviewed Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article", Dewey-Hagborg explained at a press preview of the new exhibition.
And she couldn't be visited at the time and she couldn't be photographed, so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to do a DNA profile.
The artist and her imprisoned muse became unequal correspondents, exchanging several letters over the course of two years.
They even created a comic strip, "Suppressed Images", illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which predicted a future where President Chelsea would change her mind and she would be able to see the exhibit in person.
The fact that Obama would actually demand Manning's release just days after the book was published after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas was a welcome kind of happy reunion.
There's something profound and powerful about the opening of the exhibition as Donald Trump wages a war against government informants and against transgender troops to find new, tweety ways to further inflame the rigid divisions he was supposed to be fixing.
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things, she said that "Things happen for a reason".
In an artistic statement written on the gallery wall, Manning, with her oversized signature below (the "i" in her family name is a heart), called for an end to the "automatic fragmentation based on gender, race, sexuality and culture".
On the opposite wall is their mitochondrial DNA sequence -- a thousandth of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.
Dewey-Hagborg hoped that by including the 200 letters (or nucleotides, according to the artist's highly developed scientific lexicon) she could show how amazingly similar, at least biologically, we all are.
"What people will hopefully take away from this is that our genome doesn't care about who we are and how open to interpretation genetic data is and how subjective it is", said Dewey-Hagborg, whose 2007 video work Spurious Memories is also on view.
"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so that's 30 of those stories".
The last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in a separate room, is a page from the aforementioned comic novel.
She shows Manning emerging from the United States' disciplinary cells like King Kong with a pay phone in her hand.
"If they don't hear you, they've won".
"So never shut up".
"It came straight from a letter she wrote me", said the artist, who greets from Philadelphia.
"I still get goose bumps when I talk about it".
Manning has not yet seen the exhibit in person, as predicted in the comic book, but if she does, she will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks, by her own genomic simulators, swarming like hordes of protesters.
This was also targeted, like everything in the exhibit, right down to the size (5" 2, Manning's stature) where their genetic haplogroups were written in pencil.
"In the past I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd", Dewey-Hagborg said of the portraits.
"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea, like the movement that was behind her liberation".
A professor at Northwestern University and an employee of Oxford University wanted for murder .
A nationwide manhunt is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee of Oxford University who are wanted as suspects after a man was fatally stabbed in a luxury apartment in Chicago.
On Monday, arrest warrants were issued for Wyndham Lathem, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56, on murder charges for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, according to Cook County Circuit Court records.
The documents say Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after multiple stab wounds.
A community alert system released by the Chicago Police Department says the body was discovered on July 27.
Officers received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza apartments and found the victim with multiple injuries to his body.
Cornell-Duranleau was pronounced dead at the scene, and detectives are investigating the stabbing as a homicide as police actively search for the two suspects, officials said.
Lathem has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, the vice president of university relations, said in an e-mail statement that Lathem was now on leave and barred from entering the Northwestern University campus.
"This is now a criminal matter that is being investigated by the relevant authorities, and Northwestern University is cooperating in this investigation", Cubbage said.
Warren is a senior assistant treasurer at Oxford University.
A spokesman for the university and Somerville College said in an e-mail statement that "we are in contact with the police in the UK and are ready to assist the US investigating authorities in any way possible".
The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and wanted him to turn himself in.
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department, Anthony Guglielmi, said he urges the suspects to turn themselves in to authorities.
"The police have an idea of where she is, and our efforts to locate her are intensifying", Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities are helping to find the suspects.
Guglielmi said police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building who had just received a mysterious tip that something had happened in apartment 1008.
The police described the scene as very cruel.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident also took place on July 27.
Security cameras confirmed that Lathem and Warren were in the building.
"We believe Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship", Guglielmi said.
The Grand Plaza management team issued a statement to residents: "Police are currently working on the timeline and background of the victim and are investigating a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident".
"We will finalize the WADA roadmap in the near future" - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it would not be long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) for the re-establishment of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) would be implemented.
'At a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the roadmap, RUSADA has been granted the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD.
The WADA roadmap has been updated in this regard", Mutko said on Thursday.
The PM commented on the second part of WADA's Code Compliance Roadmap, which outlines the criteria for the reinstatement of RUSADA and was recently published on the organisation's website.
Mutko says it contains nothing that could cause Russia to worry.
"Everything has been announced, everything is being implemented.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future", he added.
However, one of the criteria listed states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the WADA-approved investigation by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren into alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sport.
In this regard, Mutko said: "We are conducting the investigation because our anti-doping system has admitted a mistake.
All measures have been implemented.
But there were no government programs, and we will not admit to something that does not exist".
Mutko's words were in line with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of Russia's independent anti-doping commission.
Speaking to Russian outlet RSport earlier in the day, Smirnov admitted past problems in Russian anti-doping organizations, but added: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one intends to accept this report unconditionally", Smirnov added.
In November 2015, following the doping scandal, RUSADA was banned by WADA from conducting doping controls in Russia.
However, it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
After visiting the organization's headquarters in Moscow in July, WADA Director-General Olivier Niggli stated that RUSADA was "moving in the right direction" to be reinstated.
Aldi won 't sell eggs for a while .
This was reported by the groups of companies.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to ionising radiation.
As of now, only eggs that have been shown to be negative for antifungal agents containing fipronil should be supplied to Aldi.
Aldi wants to create clarity and transparency for its customers.
The startups that will help your company not become the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure your employees' happiness at your e-commerce startup, but the polls didn't work.
The answers were often vague, unhelpful, or, worse, misleading.
And even if you promised anonymity, some workers didn't trust the process.
"There was just never consistency and objectivity", said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-commerce hair care company Madison Reed.
She called in outside help.
A new breed of human resource start-ups is growing to help companies figure out how their employees feel.
By building and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it enables companies to conduct surveys, target specific groups and demographics, provide employees with anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases allow whistleblowers to bypass C-suite executives and contact the board directly.
"You now have tools like Strava and Fitbit to track your health, but where's the Fitbit for your business?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and chief executive of Redwood City startup Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Errett said she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint.
In addition to Snap surveys and surveys of specific teams, it provides a company heat map that shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which executives have low approval scores - so you can dig into why.
Companies are coming to realize that they need to stay on top of workplace culture so they don't become the next Uber to be embroiled in scandal, ever since a former employee posted a blog post describing an environment of harassment where those who spoke up were punished.
For startups like Glint, this desire for a complete overview is a lucrative business opportunity.
The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could be worth more than $118.7 billion by 2020, according to financial technology website Let's Talk Payments.
Denver, Colorado, startup Convercent, which helps companies prevent and detect bad behavior, saw a surge in interest and activity earlier this year amid the Uber case in bad credit.
Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently signed up as a client.
Like Glint, Convercent lets companies send customized pulse surveys, collect confidential real-time answers, and view heat maps of your problem areas.
It also provides an anonymous texting hotline for employees to report misconduct.
And when the CEO is involved, complaints go directly to the board.
"The court of public opinion has caught up with the regulators", said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercent.
When a company is found to be mistreating or behaving unethically, it can face costly consequences through consumer boycotts, employee turnover and lawsuits, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations, has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters.
In the past, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email address for the company headquarters, file a formal complaint, and hope that it would be taken seriously.
It was often an intimidating and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesday's general counsel, who said there was no good way to follow up on employee complaints.
Now that the company is using Convercent, problems that were previously hidden from executives who were in offices in cities or states - like discrimination, harassment or unfair practices - can be identified and addressed more quickly.
"I can get closer to this holistic, 360-degree view of the experience of employment", said Vitrano, who heads the Risk Management Group at Ruby Tuesday.
"And we protect our shareholders from employment litigation".
Companies began to take ethics, values and employee engagement more seriously in 2002 after accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed over ethics violations in the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.
But it took until social media got its way that companies realized they couldn't stop their dirty laundry from going online.
"Before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy", he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service, and charge the companies recurring fees for using their products.
It's a business model and an opportunity that's been embraced by venture capital investors who have backed both startups.
Convercent received $10 million in funding in February from firms such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, bringing total capital to $47 million.
Glitter secured $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners and brought its total funding to $60 million.
These investments come as little surprise, given the interconnected nature of business, culture and venture capital.
There is a growing body of research that shows that today's employees expect more from their jobs than ever before.
In competitive markets like Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are just stakes.
Employees want to feel that you are accepted and valued and that you are giving your time to a company with a positive mission.
"When people are happy to be in a company, feel that their voices are heard, and that the work you do is worthwhile, then they feel more committed to making that company successful", said Nina McQueen, vice president of global benefits and employee experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors get returns when their portfolio companies are doing well. Companies are doing well when employees are committed and engaged.
When third-party analytics tools promise to increase employee engagement and commitment, it's no wonder you'll find support.
The data on employee engagement are important according to the experts on workplace culture.
But the data is useless if the managers of a company do not take action.
In fact, when a company asks employees for their feedback, they may have an expectation that change is coming.
And if change doesn't happen fast enough, or not at all, it can breed disappointment and demotivate employees.
"If you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you have to be prepared to have 4,000 conversations", said Russell Raath, president of consulting at business management firm Kotter International, which has seen companies rely too much on data collection.
Because if you don't follow, people are going to ask, "Did you really hear me?
You'll take care of it?
And who you don't care about, why should I?"
Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly employee surveys, was able to take action the same day a problem was reported about Glint, Errett said.
And after gathering feedback from frustrated employees, she was able to reorganize multiple teams within the company through the speed of decision-making and quality of communication, and add communication training to address the problems.
Ruby Tuesday is always giving the company new insights into the employees, and it hopes that in the long run, this will lead to better employee retention in an industry known for high turnover.
"If you are not committed to creating a culture of transparency, you will lose people", Vitrano said.
"And when you lose people, you lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you're going to lose business.
The NCAA eliminates the two-day practices and makes a long day for the Bruins
It's getting close to 11:00 p.m. and a bunch of UCLA football players are chatting on one side of the team's new practice fields on campus.
Some have taken off their jersey parts and show their backs full of sweat from the first day of training camp.
For a good portion of the team, these idle minutes are a lunch break.
Players enrolled in summer courses will return to their final exams after three hours of practice before returning to the Wasserman Football Center at 6:30 a.m. the next morning.
"This is a real treadmill for the boys for the next three days", Bruins coach Jim Mora said just before Monday became Tuesday.
The NCAA eliminates two-day practice to ease the players' load, and it actually extended their days -- at least until the final on Friday.
That's why UCLA's first three practice sessions are scheduled to start at 7:15 to accommodate the players' already packed schedules.
The tradeoff away from the two days is more than one day when the Bruins postponed the start of camp almost a week after last season and held practice during summer school for the first time during Mora's six seasons at Westwood.
They're scheduled to practice through August 18 and 20 before the start of formal preparations for their September opener against Texas A&M.
Mora said he supports the NCAA rule change, even if it adds another point to the players' busy routes.
"We put this enormous burden on them for three or four days, and it is very challenging", said Mora.
And they just pushed through, they keep going, they're great people.
I think once we get to Saturday and we have more time, it's going to be really great".
UCLA will end its practices once the camp is over, which, given the clear lines of sight of its fields from an adjacent parking lot and the adjacent Luskin Center, a high-end hotel that's already been bombarded with footballs that cleared a net behind a goal post, will not be an easy task.
Bruins players are scheduled to occupy the hotel starting this weekend, but Mora admitted there could be a problem once those rooms are available during the season.
"We will use our security", said Mora.
"This is a real problem, and it's not far-fetched to think that people would rent a room there and then set up to record an exercise there.
If you have the video tape of an exercise, it's a pretty good deal.
But we have security there, and we have security in parking lot eight.
We'll make the best of what we have.
I'm not too worried about that.
We have a plan".
Facebook wants to step up fact-checking in the fight against fake news
Facebook plans to send more potential fake news articles to third-party fact-checkers and then display their results below the original post, the world's largest online social network said on Thursday, as part of its efforts to combat so-called fake news.
The company said in a statement on its website that it will start using updated machine learning methods to detect possible false reports and send them to fact-checkers who may view the results of the fact-checking from the original article.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news, which many believe also influenced the 2016 US presidential election.
The issue has also become a major political issue in Europe, with French voters being flooded with false stories ahead of the presidential election in May, and Germany backing a plan to punish social media networks if they fail to quickly remove hateful posts as they did before the September election there.
On Thursday, Facebook said in a separate statement in German that it was launching a test of the new fact-checking in the US, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to knowing which stories are being challenged by third-party fact-checkers, people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share", Sara Su, product manager for Facebook News, said in a blog post.
She added that Facebook will continue to test its "related article" feature and is working on other changes to its news feed to reduce fake news.
Creating a comic book: A castle in English history
In its more recent past, the small Scotney Castle was featured in a Squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scotney has lived through 700 years of turbulent history from his comfortable seat in the Bewl River valley in Kent and has now become the inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mop-haired Yorkshireman with a penchant for historical documents.
"I find it so beautiful to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years", he says wistfully.
"What a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand".
'A Castle in England' spans the period from the Middle Ages to the Edwardian era, documenting the families that lived in Scotney, each story illustrated by a different emerging British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It's not Rhodes' first book to be based on an archive: he wrote Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories in 2014, a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he found unexpectedly emotional.
"I was just reacting to the thumbprint on the page of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700s who worked for the Jacobins", he says.
"That's his thumbprint!
And letters always smell like smoke, because back then, people would light fires for the light.
For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has the effect of being there.
I love archives, you know?"
For someone who is so battered with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and Arts Council England and lived in a castle for almost four months ("To be honest, I overestimated my welcome greeting a little bit") all this seems too good to be true.
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, sifting through the archives, and studying the castle's many treasures and curiosities, such as the mounted hyena heads on the walls and the bottles that had been in the ditch for centuries.
He wandered through the grounds and ruins of the old castle and talked with landscapers, gardeners, and sometimes even with the artists who worked on the illustrations for his book.
Then, at night, he drank "whiskey and started writing".
Scotney's intimate history is relatively unknown, as the National Trust did not gain full access until 2006, when the last heiress, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the staff had just begun to take care of the archive, which he described as "hundreds of years in which aristocrats said, 'Oh, throw it in the attic.'"
Diaries, letters from the time of the British Empire, maps showing who owned what: "You might think land disputes would be boring", says Rhodes, "but there was a birch tree that the two families fought over.
Guys, let it go!"
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to delve into English history on a broader basis, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the Peasants' Revolt of 1381.
"There is a record of a riot that took place in the castle in 1380, in this book entitled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex'", says Rhodes.
"The peasant uprising started in this area and I thought an uprising was a good start.
Maybe the two are connected?"
Other stories are firmly rooted in the castle's history - like 'The Priest', which tells the story of the Jesuit priest whom the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or 'The Smuggler,' which depicts 18th-century smuggler Arthur Darrell staging his own funeral by filling a coffin with rocks (a discovery made only years later when his coffin was excavated).
The Darrells are Rhodes' favourite Scotney family: "The gentlemen seemed to be quite the crooks, going into debt and spending money on things they couldn't afford.
Other generations of Darrell men solved their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of good-looking guys with a talent for soliciting heirs".
After his time at the castle is over, Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences.
He spent two weeks in the Finnish wilderness writing a comic novel about Elämänmäki, the site of an early 20th-century sanatorium that has since been reclaimed by nature.
But Scotney has a special place for him.
"I was sad to leave again", he says.
It was like, "Oh, now I have to deal with the fucking life again".
Campaign launched: over 300-year-old chapel of the Virgin Mary in Rhöndorf veiled
The city of Bad Honnef launched its campaign to introduce a new umbrella brand on Friday with the covering of the 301 year old St. Mary's Chapel in Rhöndorf.
Until Thursday, Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz want to keep the logo and slogan secret.
The campaign will culminate in a celebration on the island of Grafenwerth at the end of August.
"Too good for us.
Or?", the campaigners have been asking on posters at the Rhonddorf Chapel since yesterday.
"We don't really think so (of course!)", they write on their website, which was launched yesterday.
"But we're using this measure to get your attention.
And to make it clear that some things are better than they seem.
We are firmly convinced that as citizens of Bad Honnefer we know very well the beauty and attractiveness of our city".
The action is about more than "just" a logo and a slogan, it said.
"We need to formulate a unique promise, one that gives the city a distinctive, unique selling point".
It is, after all, in competition with other municipalities.
A medium five-figure sum is the cost of the city of Bad Honnef's new umbrella brand and campaign.
Turkey's military reforms - Erdogan's fear of the army
The Supreme Military Council (YAS) holds a meeting in Ankara in early August each year on retirement and promotion in the officer corps.
Same this week.
At first glance, this seems like a normal process.
But nothing is routine in the Turkish military a year after the coup attempt.
The meeting was no longer held in the General Staff building as before, but in the Prime Minister's office.
The Council also adopted a resolution on the situation in the former Yugoslavia, which was adopted by the Council on 14 June.
That left the civilian population in the YAS outnumbered.
The government is pulling the strings in the military.
The President of the Republic of Turkey, Mr. Aliyev, has been appointed by the President of the Republic of Turkey on the basis of the results of the elections in May.
Since the failed coup, President Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals.
Over 10,000 soldiers have been removed from the army - mostly for alleged links to the movement of exiled preacher Fethullah Gülen, whom Erdogan sees as the mastermind behind the coup attempt.
486 people who are alleged to have been directly involved in the coup attempt have been on trial in Ankara since this week.
The day after the coup, Erdogan had already described the coup attempt as a "gift from God" as it gave him the opportunity to "completely clean up" the armed forces.
But does Erdogan really have the army under control?
At the end of February, the newspaper "Hürriyet" published an article entitled "Discontent in the Military Headquarters".
The General Staff is concerned about the growing "Islamization" of the army, which is manifested, among other things, in the lifting of the headscarf ban on female soldiers, the newspaper said.
The major cleanup of the army and security forces will continue.
In mid-July, Erdogan issued a decree dismissing 7,395 more civil servants, including 2,303 police officers and 546 soldiers.
It seemed that Erdogan had tamed the military.
Generals were once considered the real masters of the country.
Three times they staged coups, claiming to be the guardians of the secular order.
After his election victory in 2002, Erdogan gradually pushed back the power of the military, not least by invoking the reform requirements of the European Union.
Former officers say Erdogan is deliberately pushing for an Islamization of the armed forces.
In the magazine Vocal Europe, an unnamed officer who sought asylum abroad for fear of persecution after the coup attempt warned that the Turkish army would be "full of extremists and Salafists" in a few years.
If that is true, such a development could not leave NATO cold.
The European Union is not a party to the treaty.
The leadership structures and operational capabilities are "weakened", NATO diplomats say.
Washington is changing the rules for the green card.
There will be a new U.S. immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card, President Donald Trump said, quoted by the media.
It provides for a reduction in legal immigration to 50,000 a year, stricter requirements for obtaining visas for temporary work permits and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and endorsed by the president.
The bill is to be discussed in both houses of Congress.
"This bill will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers, and will do so by changing the way the United States issues green cards to citizens from other countries".
The bill will prevent chain migration and replace the current system.
This new application process will benefit candidates who speak English, who have the financial means to support themselves and who demonstrate skills that will benefit our economy", Trump said, as quoted by US media.
Ministry wants to renovate track for racetrack shuttle
The future of the racetrack has been the subject of constant debate in recent months.
The construction of the runway for the tourist railway is to begin before the end of the year.
According to the Ministry of Transport, construction work on the track is to begin this year to ensure the long-term future of the racecourse.
"With the decision to continue to order and refurbish the Ilmenau-Rennsteig, the country is committed to this link, which is particularly important for tourism", said Transport Secretary Klaus Sühl on Friday in Erfurt.
He estimated the cost of repairing the line at about EUR 2.5 million.
Of this sum, the country would take over 75 percent.
The contract, on the basis of which the shuttle will be ordered by the country in the future, is currently being finalised, Sühl said.
The Ministry and the South Thuringian Railway as operator have already agreed on the technical details.
"This is the way the timetable, the vehicles used and the quality standards are negotiated", Sühl said.
The planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be for a period of 11 years.
The Commission has therefore decided to initiate the procedure laid down in Article 108 (3) of the Treaty.
The Rennsteig Shuttle is a railway connection between the railway stations Ilmenau and Rennsteig, which is especially popular with tourists.
In the past few months, a pilot operation has been carried out to test whether the route is used by enough people to make regular bookings in the future.
The route is also very dilapidated in some parts.
The rise of sex robots is real, and we should be worried
Just when you thought 2017 couldn't get any crazier, a new report on the technological advances in sex robots comes out.
Yes, as a matter of fact.
Sex robots are a big deal right now.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharkey, emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at Sheffield University and co-founder of the FRR, we need to start taking their rise seriously.
Customers can choose the robot's eye color, nipple shape and nail type.
"People make fun of them, but companies deliver a lot of them, and we're going to see them a lot more", Mr Sharkey said when his new report was published.
Modern sex dolls have evolved from inflatable partners to robotic silicone skin that feels warm, with conscious human reactions that are achieved through artificial intelligence.
The user can also "customize" his robot to suit his beliefs, selecting everything from the color of the robot's eyes to the shape of its nipples to the type or color of its fingernails.
But it gets even more disturbing because many robots have the "personalities" that would make a Stepford woman look progressive.
Modern sex dolls have evolved into robots with silicone skin.
The RealBotix robot, for example, allows its users to customize their robots to the features they find appealing, such as shyness.
And then there's the Roxxxy Gold sex robot developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities like "Frigid Farrah", which gives the impression of shyness, and "Wild Wendy", with an "adventurous" personality.
"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is as close to your personality as possible", the True Companion website says.
So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.
She has her moods during the day, just like real people!
She may be tired, obsessed with conversation, or she may be "in the mood!"
There are many disturbing aspects to this rise of sex robots - not least because they are replacing real human relationships - but the submissive female qualities, the allusions to rape when you step one step closer to Frigid (here: reluctant) Farrah, are the most disturbing.
On his website, True Companion compared Roxxxy to a vibrator, but for men.
"If women can have a vibrator, why can't men have Roxxxy?" the website says.
However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy.
Their emergence and increasing sophistication point to something darker and deeper in our culture, a retreat from the ideal of gender equality toward a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition.
Most men will not, of course, keep sex robots, and while the FRR is gaining in popularity, they are still temporarily on the fringes of consumer culture.
But what leaks from the fringes can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of the times we live in.
And a lot of people aren't weird or offensive until the free market gives them permission to be.
There's a certain overlap that these sophisticated sex robots are emerging at a time when women's rights are under threat around the world, when there's a president in the White House who's bragging about sexually assaulting women.
The most chilling aspect of the television series 'The Handmaid's Tale' is not the graphic images, the curved bodies and the gouged out eyes, but how realistic this vision seems.
The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but right now it doesn't feel like a big leap.
The goal behind these sex robots is to create a physical resemblance to real women as realistically and technically as possible (although with porn star proportions).
Their builders want them to feel human, to mimic the movement of a real body.
But, to be specific, when it comes to their "personalities", the robots do not represent real women.
You can't just break up with your partner or walk away.
They have no mediation or background, nothing that suggests independence or anything that might interfere with the imagination of total submission.
In other words, they are pleasant slaves.
Or to put it in the 2017 idiom, maid.
Trump's big accomplishment?
He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of common sense .
It's become a Trump-era wisdom that the political divisions that have polarized the American electorate have also divided families in the small elite.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, newspapers in the United States were offering advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump's voting relatives.
We all supposedly work hard to get our filter bubbles to burst.
Less noticed is Trump's power to bring families together.
I mention this because my cousin, a left-wing poet living in Chicago who has long been involved with the Republicans in our family, visited me in New York this week.
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican family she's fought for decades over politics, is suddenly and strangely on the same side.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to this effect.
The left has been strengthened by Trump, but the disruptive effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.
When we talk about "normalization" and Trump, we're referring to the chilling possibility that one day his aunts won't repel us.
But there is an even more frightening long-term scenario, where Trump "normalizes" right-wing Republicans who suddenly appear to be the epitome of rationality compared to his standards.
I find myself now-a-days plagued by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's hilarious version of the crazy - the dog on the roof of the car, the 14 percent income tax (but at least we knew what his tax return looked like) - both of which, in comparison to Trump, do indeed seem to be very minor offenses.
If Trump leaves, the next Republican nominee only needs to be mentally healthy to qualify as a measureless improvement.
When my cousin was in town, we took our kids to the carousel in Central Park, the largest of the carousels in the New York City Park Department, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need caffeine.
The horses are enormous, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder -- all the clowns are growling and the animals are twisting to look over their own shoulders in fear -- extremely dark, and the clicking music conveys this in a strange way.
So many city clichés disappoint: the views of tall buildings get old, the skylines become too familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city doesn't live up to the dream.
Thirty-five years later, and I'm still not quite over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is in fact not a Swiss cottage - the theme pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage doesn't count - but a major roundabout in north London.
But the Central Park carousel is still a weirdly magical experience, because two two-year-olds, an 11-year-old and two women in their 40s can go on it and all have a great time.
If I could have rated the carousel, I would have given it a full score, but luckily, no one asked.
On the other hand, I was forced to rate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars at a department store this week before I could even get my credit card through.
The coffee shop on my street corner is the same, plus the option to match the rating with a 15% tip - this to buy something over the counter.
This not only slows down what should be a neutral exchange, but also puts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none is needed.
The poor woman in the store stood there, grinning apologetically, while I tiredly tried to hand her my five-star credit card.
Oscar Pistorius moved from prison to hospital with chest pain
Pistorius has left prison for a second visit to the hospital.
Last year, he was hospitalized for treatment of cuts to his wrists, which prison officials said he suffered after a fall in his cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after prosecutors appealed a first-degree murder conviction.
He killed Steenkamp in the early morning hours of Valentine's Day 2013, shooting her multiple times through a toilet door in his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed he thought his girlfriend was a nocturnal intruder hiding in the cabin.
Prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal this time against Pistorius Appell's six-year prison sentence, which they say is too lenient.
The National Law Enforcement Authority said it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the appeal could be heard this year.
Pistorius is in danger of getting a 15-year sentence if prosecutors succeed.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
When farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
The last of the Blumberg schools were the fourth-graders from Fützen and Epfenhofen dismissed for the holidays and to the secondary schools.
Three of the dismissed students will go to high school, four to a regular school.
Headmistress Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Biesental town hall in Epfenhofen on Tuesday evening.
As a symbol of the school leaving, the 29 students of the four classes, led by Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder, chose a young eagle that grows up in the chicken coop, but is then released into the wild.
The cheerful crowd performed a musical called "The Eagle in the Chicken House".
Farmer Arnold found a strange egg, and had it hatched by his hens.
Instead of a chicken's eye, a little eagle came out.
But the eagle's hopes of turning him into a chicken were dashed. He spread his wings on a high mountain and disappeared.
Then, in the classroom of Yvonne Frank, the third and fourth grades performed a chicken dance.
The hens danced with the young goosebumps, carrying cylinders to bet.
The eagle stands for integration, said school principal Angelika Sitte.
The young animal is different from the other young animals (chickens), but it is part of them.
But he'll never be like a chicken.
He was destined to be free.
She wished every fourth grader to feel accepted in their new school.
The following were words of thanks to the colleagues, the former headmaster Michael Müller, who always intervenes in case of classroom shortages, and the parents' representatives.
The chicken time is over, class teacher Sophia Schumacher explained.
She was reluctant to let her students go after two years of teaching, because it was a really great time.
Finally, she could count on the fourth graders.
At the end of the day, all the students played a song about summer and holiday.
The children were overjoyed.
Eight first graders have already registered for the new school year.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians have been arrested for illegal camping in Greece, the Foreign Ministry said, quoted by the TV.
On the morning of 1 August, a group of illegal campers, including the two Bulgarians, were arrested by the police in Sithonia.
They were released the same day while an investigation is ongoing.
The Foreign Ministry reported to bTV that the Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have tightened control over the free camp and are imposing heavy fines on anyone found staying in a place not intended for this purpose.
The controls will continue throughout the season.
The Ministry said the court can impose a fine.
Software update for diesel vehicles: What those affected need to know now
How exactly does the software update take place?
Do diesel drivers have to participate in the campaign?
The most important questions and answers in summary.
At the Diesel Summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for a total of some 5.3 million cars.
They are intended to improve the exhaust performance of cars in the Euro 5 and partially Euro 6 emission classes.
Euro 4 diesel or worse are exempt.
Anja Smetanin from ACE Auto Club Europe has this to say:
Is the new action mandatory?
No, the software updates we negotiated are voluntary.
"The previous mandatory updates only applied to vehicles with cheating software", says Anja Smetanin.
The Federal Motor Vehicle Agency (KBA) has ordered their upgrading.
How and when will customers be informed about updates?
The manufacturers have announced a rapid implementation in the coming months, but have not yet given a precise date.
Daimler has asked to write to all concerned.
If an inspection is due anyway, it will be done within its framework.
How long should the overall rearmament take?
"Hard to say", says the methane.
This depends on the commitment of the producers and on political pressure.
"Because we have seen that carmakers have not yet taken voluntary action on the environment".
How long do you want the update to take?
The conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop.
It might be more time-consuming to get an appointment.
What do drivers do who don't drive BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group?
The ACE advises waiting.
It is likely that foreign manufacturers will follow suit, says Smetanin.
Is there a threat of a massive fall in the price of Euro 4 cars?
The ACE is afraid of that.
But especially in the regions where driving bans are threatened.
In rural areas, there are no losses in value for older diesel.
ACE advises waiting for a sale.
LL Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award
The Kennedy Awards gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington.
The first awards show under President Trump promises to be political.
One of the laureates won't come out of protest.
LL Cool J (49) is the first rapper to receive one of the coveted awards of the prestigious Kennedy Center.
The cultural institution announced on Thursday that this year's honorees include singer Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68), choreographer Carmen de Lavallade (86) and TV producer Norman Lear (95).
The awards ceremony will be held in early December.
Traditionally, US President Donald Trump will host a reception and attend the ceremony with his wife Melania.
The award-winning Lear, who is known for his progressive TV series, has already announced that he will not be attending the gala.
He told the New York Times: "This presidency has chosen to completely neglect the arts and human rights - even to withhold funding - and that burdens me".
Estefan, 59, said she would use the conversation with Trump to clarify her position.
The Kennedy Center, named after former President John F. Kennedy, is the largest cultural institution in the U.S. capital.
Previous winners include Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, Robert De Niro, George Lucas, Tom Hanks and Sting.
We make the city liveable
Roland Wacker, Haslach's city architect, is retiring next year.
The vacancy is already open - but suitable candidates are scarce.
Wacker has been a city planner for 31 years.
And he still enjoys his work, as he said in the press conference.
He tells of the varied but challenging tasks that await his successor.
At the same time, he is surprised that no application has so far met the requirements.
The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer as soon as possible.
This should allow sufficient time for training, subject to the regular notice periods.
Since Haslach acts as a lower building authority for the administrative community, the applicant must have a certificate of completion.
Because that's the function the city wants to keep anyway.
If it could no longer fill them in, the citizens would have to go to Offenburg for advice.
But the city and itself value proximity to the public, says Wacker, who reports a good working environment and a good atmosphere between the authorities and citizens.
In more than 30 years in office, Wacker has accumulated some important projects that he can look back on with pride.
"We're making the city liveable", he says of the building department and its employees.
But there are also a variety of projects on the agenda for the future: the transformation of the former Hukla area and the Niederhofen car park have begun.
The Kinzig bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is being renovated, and the stadium renovation is still a topic.
The latter alone will fetch around 1.5 million euros, "if we do it right", Wacker estimates.
"All in all, great jobs await my successor.
It's fun to work here".
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to ionising radiation.
Haslach's own yard and garden can be used for a lot of things.
"You can move around a lot", says Wacker, and the design of the green spaces is often praised by citizens and visitors.
Since the old town as a whole is protected as a historic monument, it is important to "keep an eye on what fits in" when new buildings are approved, the outgoing city architect emphasizes.
The city planner has a great responsibility.
He's a builder, "I'll end up running everything over my desk".
He can count on long-standing staff for support and coordination: Markus Neumaier (high-rise construction) has been with the company for ten years, Manfred Schöner (underground construction) for 15 years.
Wacker also wants his successor to stay for a long time: "We are looking for someone who really identifies with the job and wants to stay".
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to ionising radiation.
The city of Haslach has stated that anyone wishing to inherit Roland Wacker should have a degree in engineering or a bachelor's degree in architecture and have good knowledge of building and planning law.
The Municipal Building Office is responsible for civil engineering, building management, land acquisition, administration of municipal property, municipal workshops with building and urban gardening, and the Lower Building Authority, including monument protection.
Bicycle thrown on wires: South railway line closed
According to the police, the previously unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway crossing in the area of the Leobener Straße (B116) on the lines.
These were so badly damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped.
Investigators are looking for two male perpetrators and have been searching for them since the wee hours of the night.
Witnesses had seen a pink scooter and a bicycle driver near the scene.
"This is far more than a prank", said ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch.
The perpetrator or perpetrators would have put themselves in great danger and also put train traffic at risk.
In addition to the damage to the locomotive and the equipment, the delayed minutes and the cost of the replacement trains, the perpetrators could also be subject to penalties from railway customers.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to ionising radiation.
The damage was repaired on Friday afternoon and the southern railway line was able to run without obstacles.
Almost ten passenger trains were out of service on Friday morning, two of them for long-distance services.
Freight trains were not out, but they were late.
According to ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch, about 200 meters of overhead lines had to be replaced.
Insulators and masts were also damaged.
Red meat, dairy products, and chocolate may help relieve inflammatory bowel disease
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare to your digestive system.
But a new study suggests just the opposite: A diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
The incurable condition, which affects about 1.3 million in the United States and 300,000 in Britain, causes stomach cramps and bloating, recurrent or bloody diarrhea, weight loss, and extreme fatigue.
While sufferers are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at the University of Washington found that the essential amino acid tryptophan from proteins helps to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant gut.
The lead researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells patrol the gut to ensure that harmful microbes hiding in food do not enter the body.
Cells that are capable of causing inflammation are replaced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissue.
If the balance is too much in the direction of inflammation, inflammatory bowel disease can result.
In experiments, a type of tolerance-promoting immune cell was found in mice that carried a particular bacterium in their intestines.
And the bacteria needs tryptophan -- one of the building blocks of proteins -- to make the cells look like they are.
Professor Colonna said: "We have established a link between a species of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their diet, the more of these immune cells they had".
He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a tryptophan-rich diet promotes a more tolerant, less inflammatory gut environment, if the same system works in humans.
Postdoctoral researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan was studying a type of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found that one group of study mice had these cells, but another group of the same strain, but housed separately, did not.
She speculated that the difference had to do with the gut microbiome of the mice -- the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The gut DNA of the mice was sequenced, and they found six species of bacteria that were present in the mice with the immune cells, but missing in the mice without them.
So mice were raised in a sterile environment, so they lacked a gut microbiome, and they didn't develop these types of immune cells, and they got L. reuteri, and the immune cells developed.
To understand how the bacteria affected the immune system, the researchers grew L. reuteri in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - to immature immune cells isolated from the mice.
The immune cells evolved into the tolerance-promoting cells.
When the active ingredient was removed from the liquid, it was found to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism known as indole-3 lactic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice's food, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when they halved the tryptophan levels, the number of cells dropped by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that humans have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether tryptophan byproducts from L. reuteri develop cells in humans as they do in mice, but defects in tryptophan-related genes have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
She said, "The development of these cells is probably something we want to encourage, because these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the gut.
Potentially, high tryptophan levels in the presence of L. reuteri may lead to an expansion of this population.'
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United have hired a "genius" with Nemanja Matic
Manchester United have signed a "genius" with Nemanja Matic, Jose Mourinho believes, after the midfielder made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening.
Chelsea's £40m signing started with a 2-1 win in Dublin, the final pre-season game before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid starts on Tuesday, and impressed in the keeper role as the likes of Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira marched on at will.
However, Matic had been ruled out of the Blues' pre-Asian tour and managed only 45 minutes, which Mourinho admitted he needed to improve before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time, but his experience, his intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football", Mourinho said.
"We're going to help him be ready sooner rather than later".
Alongside Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also started at the Aviva Stadium as Mourinho formed his starting XI for the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wanted three more new commitments, but he insisted that the club had already done a "fantastic job" of fulfilling three of its four priority new commitments.
"To get three out of four, I thank the club", he added.
"I'll be happier if they get four out of four for me, but they've gone to a lot of trouble".
Boeing "paints" Dreamliner into the sky
The American aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the silhouette of a Dreamliner in the sky.
The pilots took off from Seattle, Washington, but the filming started in Marquette, Michigan, and it traveled in the shape of a Dreamliner across the United States, which is several thousand miles.
The operation lasted 18 hours and one minute.
On the radar screens, it was the shape of a Dreamliner.
The whole thing was a test run for new engines.
Boeing had done this kind of advertising before.
So the number "787" and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky.
Another low for Martin Schulz - Hannover, we have a problem
The wind is turning: when Sigmar Gabriel was still SPD leader, Social Democratic prime ministers always looked with a certain concern at Berlin before elections.
No interference from the party headquarters, no headwind from the federal government - that was the main wish of the candidates.
Since Martin Schulz has been in charge of the party, things have changed radically.
Since then, the staff of the Willy Brandt House have been watching with growing horror the events in the SPD-ruled state capitals.
What Schulz has gotten from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described with headwinds.
It was a low blow.
One by one.
The German Federal CDU sees the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony as a general signal against coalitions of the SPD and the Greens.
"This shows once again that the Red-Green coalition simply cannot govern reliably", said CDU General Secretary Peter Tauber to the German news network RND.
The surprise resignation of a Green MEP has plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the parliamentary elections, his red-green coalition lost its one-vote majority to the opposition from the CDU and FDP.
The Green Party's executive director, Michael Kellner, has called on the renegade Lower Saxony Green Party MP, Elke Twesten, to resign.
The change to the CDU is a clear distortion of the will of the electorate.
Elke Twesten must immediately return her mandate", the Greens' federal executive and campaign leader told the Edaktionsnetwerk Deutschland (RND).
"This can't be true", sighs an SPD candidate when the new job announcement reaches the party headquarters on Friday morning.
Stephan Weil, SPD minister-president of Lower Saxony, is without a majority in the government after the transition of the Green MP Elke Twesten to the CDU.
It is the tentative culmination of a series of major and minor crises in the SPD's state associations.
And no one knows what's coming next.
The misery began with the unexpectedly clear defeat in the Saarland election in March.
A blue eye, nothing more, the comrades calmed down at that time.
After the elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia, everything will be different.
And that's what happened - and it got much worse.
The defeat in Kiel put the SPD in a state of confusion, the Düsseldorf split smoothly destroyed the party.
The comrades worked hard to get back together in the weeks that followed.
Then, just as they had regained their courage, the G20 summit from Hamburg came.
And with it came the next low blow.
Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD leader, lost his Nimbus that weekend because he was sitting in the Elbphilharmonie while his city was burning.
And because he did pretty much everything wrong in crisis communication after that that you can do wrong.
Since then, Scholz has been fighting for his political survival.
So now we have Stephan Weil.
The Lower Saxony prime minister has long been criticized for the VW emissions affair and his role on the supervisory board.
I got a bad score on the survey.
Nevertheless, or perhaps because of this, Weil has been trying more and more in recent weeks to make a statement in the Federation.
The former mayor of Hanover's desire to expand his power in Berlin was not hidden from comrades in Martin Schulz's circle.
They let him because they were promised by Weil a stabilization of the party.
Now the exact opposite could happen.
Because the party dispute of the Lower Saxony Greens is not really the fault of the party.
And not even Schulz.
In the meantime, the comrades are trying to keep their own ranks closed.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to this effect.
"It is intolerable and damaging to democracy that Mrs Twesten puts her own career interests above the interests of everyone else", says Matthias Miersch, head of the party links in the SPD parliamentary group, to the Editorial Network Deutschland (RND).
The Commission has also been asked to provide a list of the Member States where the Commission has been able to provide information on the situation in the country.
The logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to ionising radiation.
"Four years ago, the will of the electorate was clear: the people made Stephan Weil prime minister", says Oppermann, who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as the leading candidate in the Bundestag election, the RND.
"Now the personal career thinking of a future CDU MP is distorting the election result", Oppermann continued.
He demanded to have the background checked.
I want to know if there has been more or if there have been further commitments from the CDU in Lower Saxony.
Aid for local centres III
Those who want to renovate their old house will soon be able to get support from the country.
The Commission has decided to grant the aid to the following projects:
At the beginning of the information event, Schindler gave a review of what had happened so far.
Since 1991 reception areas have been established.
The Commission notes that the aid was granted for the construction of a new terminal building in the area of Baden-Württemberg.
The Commission notes that the aid was granted for the construction of a new terminal building in the area of the former Gdańsk airport.
The Commission has also been asked to provide a detailed description of the measures taken to ensure that the new buildings are not destroyed.
On 4 April, the government office in Karlsruhe informed the public that a rehabilitation area III would be created.
The amount of the grant is EUR 833 333, of which EUR 500 000 will come from the Land and the remainder from the Municipality of Receiving.
How is a regeneration area created?
The Commission will investigate where the "really old" houses are.
It is also important whether there is any interest in the area being renovated.
If necessary, the territorial boundaries could then be moved again.
The STEG was represented on Wednesday evening by Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel.
Mr Keller presented the contents of the Federal-Länder programme "Social City", under which the renovations would then be carried out.
The programme focuses on the revitalization of inner cities, the improvement of living and working conditions and the maintenance and expansion of infrastructure.
The measures would be carried out on a site-by-site basis, i.e. per plot.
The development area would then be defined by statute.
The period of granting of the support shall run from 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026.
The first step, however, is to take stock of the area by September and to give the persons involved in the area a questionnaire to fill in.
The decision on the statutes should be taken in November or December if possible, so that the renovation work can begin next year.
Pietzschmann then explained that each municipality must carry out the aforementioned preliminary examinations.
It is a matter of assessing urban development problems and deciding when and to what extent to repair them.
The land is then also entered in the land register as a renovation.
Pietzschmann herself will come to Receiving and get a picture of the situation, she promised.
The project was a success story, Gotzel stressed, because of the involvement of the participants.
This is why there will be questionnaires sent to citizens by post in the coming weeks, which can be completed after the summer holidays.
The yellow questionnaire is the 'Building and Land Form', which includes information on the condition of the buildings and the plans for renovation.
The grey questionnaire, the 'Budget and Housing Form', provides information on the size, distribution and occupants of a dwelling.
The blue 'operations form' shall be completed only if commercial premises are operated in the building.
However, it should be noted that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding.
In addition, new construction measures are not eligible.
Schindler also stressed that the distribution of funds was based on the "winderhound principle" - first come, first served.
You cannot "save" funding for later.
The final part of the programme was a series of photos of the "Centre II" project, which were shown to make the renovation tasteful to the audience.
British inventor sets himself a microchip to move his hand into his home and car
A British inventor is the first in the country to be fitted with a microchip to open his door, enter his office, and even start his car with a hand gesture.
Steven Northam, 33, had implanted the tiny chip between his thumb and index finger and now offers the service to businesses and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company BioTeq.
He teamed up with Dr. Geoff Watson, a consultant anaesthetist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure that the implant procedure was performed to medical standards.
The technology is similar to a microchip implanted in cats and dogs and takes only 30 seconds.
Mr Northam's firm also wants to change the locks on houses and cars to be compatible with the chip, all at a cost of £300 a lock.
The married father of one now has technology installed in both his home and his BMW Z4 that starts when his hand is at the wheel.
The White House's advertising costs the taxpayer thousands.
The White House's decision to fly a Navy helicopter to the South Lawn for an event highlighting American manufacturing last month will cost taxpayers up to $24,000, according to military figures leaked to TIME magazine.
The green and white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One when the president is on board, was the centerpiece of the July 17 White House event featuring American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials toured products from all 50 states.
The Connecticut-made helicopter was on display alongside a Maine yacht, a Wisconsin fire truck and a Mississippi forklifts.
The White House Military Office requested the helicopter's presence in a fragmented order, or FRAGO, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to records from Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for operating the helicopter.
"I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility", the commander of HMX-1 wrote to his superior, the deputy naval air commander, on the eve of the event.
The message indicated that the helicopter arrived on the South Lawn for the event at 3 p.m. on July 17 at approximately 7 a.m. and stayed until the lawn was cleared between 6 and 9 p.m. that evening.
The memo adds that if the departure from the White House were delayed, a second crew would be needed for the return flight due to the limited hours of duty.
The original flight crew was with the helicopter during the event, while the unit's security personnel remained on the ground with the aircraft during the time.
The records provided to TIME did not make it clear whether a second flight crew was ultimately needed.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using government property for political purposes.
Records indicate that HMX-1 asked if the event could violate the determination.
"One question we asked was whether this was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case", the commander wrote.
"Sounds like you're locked up", replied the deputy commander.
The White House has declared the "Made in America" event an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.
But even official events have political overtones.
At the event, the president gave a push for health care reform that was underway in the Senate and he touted efforts to curb government regulation.
The use of the aircraft, known as Marine One or Air Force One, for politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are obliged to use it for travel.
But requesting their use only for a photo op is unusual.
Trump conducted an investigation in February when the presidential plane was taxiing in the background of his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account is full of posts complaining about his predecessor's use of the presidential plane.
"The White House is excited about the Made In America show - which features products from all 50 states made by American workers with American materials", said White House Deputy Press Secretary Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 crews frequently conduct training flights in the Washington area and the South Lawn to drop the US president at the White House with precision inches.
When Trump was in Germany for the G20 summit in early July, HMX-1 performed 58 training landings at the White House.
The flight for the "Made in America" event was part of the flight crew's training needs for the month, an official said.
Helicopter units flew an additional 11 hours that day for "non-presidential support missions".
The White House said taxpayers didn't take the burden for any of the other props that were unveiled at the event.
A Sikorsky spokesman said the company was not involved in the display of the helicopter on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not maintain budget records for the presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
However, according to the US Department of Defense's FY2017 hourly rates, the DoD reimbursement rate for the VH-3D is $24,380 per flight hour.
Unit records show the plane's flight time as 30 minutes from the Marine Corps Air Facility home base in Quantico, Virginia.
The White House argues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is far below that rate.
"To determine the cost to taxpayers on the basis of estimates for the refund rates is highly misleading", Walters said.
"These estimates include personnel, maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual budget".
The Commission notes that the Commission has not provided any evidence that the measure is compatible with the internal market.
At the time, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter for the event.
"The idea is to showcase things that are made in America this week", Spicer said.
"And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud to contribute to our national security, and I assume that hundreds, if not thousands of people depend on it.
And I think, like most Americans, we're all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans worked tirelessly to build.
It is of course appropriate to emphasize this".
It was unclear if Trump was interacting with the helicopter as he entered his tour of the South Lawn for the event, but he was sitting in the driver's seat of a fire truck.
In the White House, Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky and joked with the media about his own fleet of company products.
"I know Sikorsky very well", said the President, "I have three of them".
TC BW Neuss faced with a difficult task
The leader of the Second Tennis League is the third place in the table, Suchsdorfer SV.
TC Blau-Weiß Neuss will play against third-placed Sechsdorfer SV in Kiel from 11 a.m. tomorrow.
Despite five games of still perfect record, the top scorer of the Second Tennis League has regained his sense of reality.
Team leader Marius Zay has respect for his opponent.
"This is a compact team, always playing in a very similar formation.
I think the team is very good especially in the back".
The main reason for the class and stability of the village of Suchsdorf SV is the import from the far north.
"Their Danes and Finns can even refer to stakes in the Davis Cup.
And they are also strong in doubles", says Zay, referring to Harri Heliovaara (Finland), Andre Göransson (Sweden), Sören and Esben Olesen, Martin Pedersen and Andreas Bjerrehus (all Denmark).
"This is going to be hard for us as always.
You need a good dose of luck".
The New Zealand team is almost ready for the trip to the far north.
His debut for the blue and white could be Maxime Janvier.
If the Frenchman who is currently active in the Challenger tournament in Biella, Italy, fails to make it to the Bundesliga match, Zdenek Kolar (Czech Republic), who is playing in the tournament in Liberec, Czech Republic, will make his first appearance this season.
The Chilean Hans Podlipnik-Castillo, who has never been beaten, was on the ball with the Belarusian Andrei Vasilevski yesterday at the ATP tournament in Kitzbühel.
He was to be in Kiel, however, along with Botic Van de Zandschulp, Niels Lootsma (both from the Netherlands) and Belgian Julien Cagnina.
After his two victories last Sunday against the club at the Alster, Máté Valkusz could also get back in the team.
If it's not enough for the 18-year-old Hungarian, who was still number one in the junior world rankings in January 2016, someone from the coaching staff around Marius Zay is filling the squad.
How America Can Harm the OMV
Donald Trump didn't seem very happy when he signed the law to tighten sanctions on Russia on Wednesday evening.
"In its haste to pass the law", he said, Congress has wrapped up some "unconstitutional provisions".
The reaction from Moscow was also as sharp as expected, and even Brussels foamed against the US push.
The draft law, after all, provides for punishing European companies that help the Russians build gas pipelines to the EU.
Investors have been worried about the situation since then, as OMV, a Russian company that co-finances the construction of Russia's Nord Stream 2 pipeline, has joined other European firms.
The threat is immense.
The Commission has also been asked to provide a detailed description of the measures taken to combat the illegal fishing activities.
In fact, Donald Trump himself would have to bring the sanctions to life by executive order.
He has 12 weapons to choose from.
The press has been looking at which ones the corporation could defend against and which ones could really hurt it.
Without Pablo Escobar, the Cali Cartel is thrust into the spotlight in the hit Netflix series
Despite the second season of Narcos revealing Pablo Escobar's killer, the Netflix series is far from over.
Seasons three and four have already been confirmed by the streaming service, the first one received its first trailer and featured the show's latest villains.
With season three, the DEA has turned its attention to the world's richest drug trafficking organization: the Cali Cartel.
Led by four powerful godparents, they operate "like a Fortune 500 company" with only more government bribery and violent action.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is its head, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) commands the Mexican connection, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) is located in New York.
In the newly released trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, the guy who invites American and Colombian law enforcement to support the war on drugs.
Other new actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos will begin on September 1st.
The city is hiring 46 kitchen assistants
The city is organizing the kindergarten lunch again.
With a fixed contact for the kids and a team assignment.
In the city day care centers, the clock is ticking backwards.
The city of Krefeld will take over the provision of food in the city's day care centres (Kitas) on 1 September.
For Sonja Pommeranz, deputy head of the Youth Department, this is good news: 'We were all very pleased.'
Cooking continues outside the home: a caterer takes over this task and delivers freshly cooked food chilled.
The city operates 46 day care centres in the Krefelder area, 44 of which provide children with a hot meal at lunchtime.
Last year, 2,800 children each sat at the tables, and the need is growing steadily.
"Meanwhile, it is not just children who are cared for 45 hours a week who eat lunch in day care", explains Pommeranz.
"The offer is also valid in the 35-hour day care if children stay until 2pm".
46 parttime workers will be on kitchen duty from 1 September: they will heat the food delivered, add salad, raw food and fruit, portion the meal individually, serve the food, clean, rinse and clean the kitchen.
"The employees are permanently assigned to a day care centre", says Pommeranz.
The size of the institutions - there are two groups as well as seven - determines the number of hours.
"The kitchen assistants are now firmly part of the nursery team", says Pommeranz with satisfaction.
"This will help them to be more involved and make it easier for kindergarten teachers to implement educational concepts".
Because that's what it's all about: healthy eating and cooking lessons.
"Let the children help prepare the food".
The direct linkage of the kitchen power to the team makes sense.
And for the kids.
"You have a known strength in the nursery, a person you know, and not constantly changing people".
This continuity is important for the children.
The cleaning of the nursery rooms - which was previously the task of the kitchen staff - will be carried out by special cleaning staff.
This variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has not only the charm of improving the quality of the kitchen service but also the charm of being the most economical for the city in comparing the cost of self-management and outsourcing, the press office said.
And that's despite the fact that 46 part-time workers are being recruited.
"But these hours are not as important for the 750 or so people in the education sector", says Sonja Pommeranz.
Afghan democracy depends on women's political role, says UN
Elections can only be representative if all members of society, including women, play a role, the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, acting head of the UN mission, said that hundreds of women will be running in the provincial council elections, with three women running for the vice-presidency and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters being women.
"The role of women cannot be overstated", he said in a statement on Wednesday.
The Commission has already made a number of recommendations to the Council and the Council on the implementation of the European Union's action plan for the environment.
Afghan provincial council and presidential elections will be held on 5 April.
The Taliban have issued threats against an election process coinciding with the transition of international combat operations to an advisory role.
This year's elections will be the first time that power is peacefully transferred from one democratically elected government to the next.
Haysom said a strong role for women will further strengthen Afghanistan's democratic success.
The Independent Electoral Commission of Afghanistan reports that 1.2 million women are registered out of a total of 3.6 million registered voters.

Men try to rob a 13-year-old girl
Two young men, aged 19 and 23, were said to have tried to rob a 13-year-old girl on Thursday.
According to police, the men approached the 13-year-old girl, who was with friends on Kolpingstrasse, at about 2:55 p.m. because they wanted to use the girl's cell phone.
The 13-year-old boy refused the request and went on with her friends.
One of the perpetrators then tried to grab the girl's cell phone and necklace, but failed.
Without any loot, the duo fled.
The two young men were later arrested by the police.
The investigation is ongoing.
GMB's concern about investment in the McVitie plant in Glasgow
A union wants to reassure managers of the McVitie biscuit manufacturer of their long-term commitment to production at their Glasgow plant.
GMB Scotland said the company was silent about the future of investments at the Tollcross site.
More than 500 employees work at the factory, which produces hobnobs and rich tea cookies, among other products.
McVity's owner Pladis said he's invested more than £5 million in the last few years.
He added that employees and union representatives would be "the first to know" if their jobs changed.
In a letter to the company's branch manager, GMB Scotland McVitie's asked for 'concerns that financing for the modernisation of production lines is not being advanced'.
GMB Senior Organiser Drew Duffy said: "The fact that we cannot get clarity from the General Site Manager on the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross deeply concerns our members.
Generations of families have worked here and the workforce is highly focused on the local community and the Greater Glasgow area, an important pillar of decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social deprivation.
Therefore, from the perspective of jobs, wages and prosperity, and against the backdrop of Brexit, rising living costs and chronic production decline, the East End of Glasgow is in dire need of a thriving manufacturing presence at McVitie.'
A spokeswoman for Pladis said: 'The branch manager at Tollcross received a letter from GMB Scotland just yesterday and the company will respond directly as we appreciate the continuing commitment from employees and union representatives.
We had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross two months ago, where some issues were openly discussed.
We discussed with our employees that, like all companies operating in a highly competitive and uncertain economic climate, we are constantly reviewing our business - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - to remain competitive.
She added: 'Over the past few years we have invested more than £5 million in our Tollcross site, particularly in production lines and operational improvements.
We fully recognise the legacy of Tollcross as a production site and should our operations at the site change, the employees and their union representatives will be the first to know".
Did PSG warn Barcelona about Neymar three years ago?
The La Liga side may regret their interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not relent in their pursuit of Neymar after making a £189 million offer to trigger his release clause, but did they warn Barcelona three years ago about the world record-breaking robbery?
The sensational approach has heated the summer transfer window as the Ligue 1 club is set to break the world record by more than double the previous mark, with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United for £89m last season.
After his retirement, Neymar becomes the world's most expensive player and the highest paid professional athlete in the world.
Barcelona are angry about the way Neymar has forced his way out, although a source close to the Catalan board insists the club has always done its best to look after him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the world of football warned about this prospect by the PSG president three years ago?
When Manchester City expressed interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a stern warning for any club that wanted to sign one of PSG's best players.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we will be in opposition to them, we will contact their players", Al-Khelaifi said.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to sign one of our players, there will be consequences".
Barcelona seems to have crossed that line, with the Spanish club expressing interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the Italian international to leave under any circumstances, and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of their price offers for Neymar.
Scooter overturned and damaged
In the night of Friday to Saturday, an unknown assailant deliberately overturned a scooter parked in front of property number 30 in Königsfelder Straße, causing damage to the vehicle's lining of over 200 euros.
Police Schramberg, phone 07422/ 27 01-0, requesting any leads.
Police are looking for witnesses to an accident on the B215 between Stolzenau and Leese.
Because a car was coming toward him in his lane, the driver of a VW Touran had to dodge and touch the control panel.
On Thursday evening, the 34-year-old from Rehburg-Loccum was driving his VW on the B 215 from Stolzenau towards Leese at about 7:55 p.m.
In the Stolzenau bypass area, he was met by a car in his lane and had to turn right.
The Touran driver touched the control panel.
The car was damaged.
The driver of the oncoming car, a Mercedes Benz, had overtaken a truck and continued on without taking the accident seriously.
According to the victim, it may be a good thing that the Mercedes driver did not notice the accident.
Police are now asking witnesses to the incident and the driver of the vehicle responsible to contact Stolzenau Police Department at 05761 / 92060.
Interview: "Domsparzen report clears Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger of his guilt"
The Regensburg Domsparzen report on the abuse cases exonerates Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger.
That is what author and historian Michael Hesemann says.
The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburg Domspatzen is still provoking discussion.
Christian Weisnder, a spokesman for the reform movement We Are Church, told the German Press Agency after the publication that he expects an apology from the former bishop of Regensburg and current Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller and from the cathedral chaplain Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of retired Pope Benedict XVI.
It would be a great asset to the reputation of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger expressed their deep regret for their own failures or their then-false assessment of events.
The Vatican newspaper "Osservatore Romano", on the other hand, criticized the "double standard" in reporting violence among the cathedral sparrows.
Regarding the Regensburg attacks, no one doubts that they are "disgraceful and shameful acts" that should be punished and prevented in the future, but what is striking is the "degree of media manipulation", says author Lucetta Scaraffia, a historian and member of the Italian National Bioethics Committee.
"The habit of calling the Catholic Church the source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to accept it as normal", Scaraffia writes.
Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis also said in an interview with the Bavarian Radio: "You like going to church and that's a found food".
She also noted that in her youth "beating was a normal educational tool" "to deal with naughty children like myself".
She felt it was unfair to apply today's standards to earlier decades, because the world had changed.
In connection with the reports of the abuse cases, the Pope's brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared.
Quite wrong, says author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote with Ratzinger the memoir "My Brother the Pope" (translated into 12 languages).
"I have to protect Georg Ratzinger", says Hesemann, "because none of this had anything to do with him", he evaluates the results of the final report.
What exactly is in the 440-page report submitted by the lawyer Ulrich Weber, who was commissioned by the Diocese of Regensburg to investigate?
A total of 547 Regensburg Cathedral sparrows were victims of sexual abuse between 1945 and the early 1990s, 67 of them with a high degree of plausibility.
The final report says of Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "In summary, then, it can be said that in many cases, forms of physical and psychological violence were used by the cathedral chaplain R.
Especially when the students were highly emotional, the punishment for them could be more severe.
Nevertheless, it is striking that, unlike many other defendants, many victims appreciated R.'s general humanity and therefore, in many cases, even in spite of the violence, associate positive memories with him".
In the interview, Hesemann explains why he believes the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburg Domspatzen relieves Georg Ratzinger of his responsibility.
Mr Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "Incidents of violence against those under protection among the Regensburg Cathedral sparrows" gives a contradictory picture of the cathedral chaplain Georg Ratzinger.
For one thing, many students highlight his "humanity".
On the other hand, he also appears as a choleric and perfectionist who often became a handyman when a cathedral sparrow did not perform musically.
As his biographer, what do you think of this final report?
Michael Hesemann: If you go through the entire 440-page report from front to back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger even appears in it.
It is only eight pages long and it clearly absolves him of any suspicion of complicity or knowledge in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.
The violence at the preschool also occurred outside his sphere of influence.
At best, he may be accused of being too late to learn or of not taking the first hints seriously enough.
The cathedral grammar school where he worked was perceived by virtually all respondents as - quite literally - "salvation", "heaven", and "a better world".
So too, the vast majority of Georg Ratzinger's students give a very fine testimony, describing him as "warmhearted", "lovely", "sincere", "competent", and "compassionate", as an extremely good-natured teacher who regularly provided the boys with cakes, cookies, and candy, and who was "always overwhelmed with grapes from children".
Only a minority complain of his perfectionism and high emotionality, which have led to angry outbursts.
He admitted years ago that he not only banged chairs and threw the key chain on the floor, but also slapped and pulled too many naughty boys by the hair or ears. He deeply regretted it and apologized.
To his credit, however, such parenting methods were widespread in the 1960's and 1970's, among parents and teachers alike.
Do you know of any other methods of punishment?
Of course, I think any of us born before 1968.
I too experienced this in a secular school, a state high school.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to this effect, and I am sure that the Commission will be able to do so.
You wonder if it's not more to do with his fame and his role as Benedict XVI's brother that many media outlets are now jumping on him.
The Bavarian Pope is still being worked on by many who have never understood him.
The truth is that the report absolves Georg Ratzinger in every respect.
The report has been widely reported in the media on the subject of abuse among the Regensburg sparrows.
Does the final report also charge Georg Ratzinger with any involvement or knowledge of sexual abuse?
Michael Hesemann: Obviously not.
None of the 67 victims of sexual assault claim to have confided in the cathedral chaplain.
Even the parents weren't informed.
"I never dared to talk to my father or mother about it", one sufferer said on behalf of the others, "it was all very embarrassing".
The real problem with educating about sexual abuse was, and is, that most victims are silent out of shame.
If they did not confide in their parents and siblings, they certainly did not confide in a choir director who was a colleague of the perpetrators.
How do the Domspatzen students rate Ratzinger's role in the abuse cases?
Michael Hesemann: One student interviewed put it this way: "As for sexual abuse . . . I don't see . . . any case where he [Georg Ratzinger] alone had timely information and could have stopped the perpetrator.
I think it's... it's really absurd to think that boys open up to him more than their parents, boarding school administrators, trusted teachers, etc.
Talking to him about sex is unthinkable".
The report concludes that 'the fact that the pupils and/or their environment concerned confided in advance to him could not be confirmed in the investigation'.
So as far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger must be cleared of any involvement.
It is not possible to accuse him of not having prevented or brought him to justice.
There is no reason to associate his good name with these heinous crimes, as has unfortunately happened in some cases.
The media have reported extensively on "excesses of violence" among the Regensburg Cathedral Sparrows.
The former chaplain of the cathedral, Georg Ratzinger, is accused of "looking the other way" in the report.
Does he have to live with that?
Michael Hesemann: That's the big problem, that in the coverage, everything was mixed and matched into a huge mix of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere in the middle, Georg Ratzinger.
But that is exactly what is wrong with the report.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to this effect, and I am sure that the Commission will be able to do so.
The report also covers incidents since 1945, including four decades during which Georg Ratzinger was not choirmaster.
The whole terrible school-based beatings, the cases where boys were being bullied and abused by sadistic teachers and suffered horribly, all took place in the kindergartens in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions must have prevailed.
But Georg Ratzinger, the chaplain of the cathedral, had nothing to do with them, for he did not see the boys until they were already in the cathedral grammar school.
At that time, as most witnesses point out, the subject of "preschool" was taboo.
One was just happy to escape it and enjoyed the much better treatment and, for many, even "paradiselike" conditions.
What was different about the Cathedral Sparrow School?
Michael Hesemann: There was discipline, but there was no sadistic violence.
And so did Georg Ratzinger, who concluded that "many victims appreciated R.'s general humanity and therefore, in many cases, even in spite of the violence, associate positive memories with him".
At best, it's a charge of looking the other way.
But despite all efforts, the report could only identify two periods in which he was informed of conditions at the preschool.
The first time was in 1970/71, when he was just starting out and did not want to hear about the school he was not involved in and was in charge of, and then again in about 1993.
Georg Ratzinger consistently shut his ears to the conditions?
Michael Hesemann: No, because back in 1989, he wrote a letter to the principal of the Cathedral Sparrow School, which the report even reproduces.
In it he warns them "that the practice of spanking in preschools will continue".
The Commission has already taken a number of measures to combat the problem of the use of the euro.
This was, of course, at a time when there was legal clarity, when beatings were long since banned in Bavaria.
Before that, they were in a legal gray area, as we all know.
It was also difficult for him to assess where the persons concerned might have exaggerated or dramatized and where the permissible limit had really been exceeded.
But you can't say he was always looking away.
That's just not true.
It was not until 1980 that the punishment of school beatings was officially abolished in Bavaria.
Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis argued that it was unfair to apply today's educational standards to the times.
How do you see it?
Michael Hesemann: We historians are talking about the "trap of anachronism", the danger of judging the past by today's moral standards.
The princess is right.
But this is not true of sexual abuse, which has always been abhorrent, nor of the acts of violence and cruelty committed against innocent children in preschool, which go far beyond what was common then.
This is all very terrible and I'm glad it's finally being worked out.
But at the same time, I have to protect Georg Ratzinger, because none of this had anything to do with him.
His means of discipline and punishment, spanking and pulling at the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.
When corporal punishment was then prohibited, he also strictly adhered to it.
What picture of his Regensburg days did Georg Ratzinger reproduce in his conversations with you for the book "My Brother the Pope"?
Did the subject of beatings come up?
Michael Hesemann: Well, the book is about the life of his brother Joseph, who is Pope Benedict XVI, told from his perspective, and the sparrows played a minor role.
I'm not hiding the fact that he was a strict regiment.
But it must be said that without this perfectionism, without the demand for unconditional discipline, it would have been hardly possible for him to transform the hitherto more nationally known Regensburg Domspatzen into a world-class institution, true cultural ambassadors of Europe and its musical tradition, who toured twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).
With cookies and candy alone, you can't make a rebellious boy into a great singer and you can't beat success in any field, but always discipline, passion and self-control.
What kind of person did you see Georg Ratzinger as during the discussions about your book?
Michael Hesemann: Working on the book and beyond, I really got to know Georg Ratzinger very well and I experienced him again and again as a wonderful, humorous, fundamental, deeply religious, kindhearted man who you can't imagine would hurt even a fly.
I regularly hear how many former parish priests, 23 years after his retirement, still keep in regular contact with him, visit him, read to him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of their family.
So those who still do not forgive him for being harsh with them are clearly in the minority.
Most of the Cathedral sparrows are grateful to him today for enriching their lives and bringing them closer to the world of music.
And that he was always a good, fatherly teacher -- a strict father, sure, but also a loving, respectful person that they still look up to and actually adore.
And again, please, be very clear: all that is being accused of is parenting methods that were on the agenda at the time.
We can be glad we've moved past that time.
But it's highly unfair to make a man, just because he's prominent and has an even more prominent brother, the media scapegoat.
The evil intent behind it is all too obvious.
Because the report that just came out cleared him.
Now decency would command a 93-year-old man who has earned great merits and without whom no one outside Bavaria and perhaps even Germany would know the Regensburg Domspatzen, to finally leave him alone.
