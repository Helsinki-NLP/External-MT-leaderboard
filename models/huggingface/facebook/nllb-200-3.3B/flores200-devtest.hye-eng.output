Despite the fact that an experimental vaccine is known to reduce the mortality of Ebola, no definitive drug has yet been proven to be a match for the treatment of the current infection.
One antibody cocktail, Zmap, initially showed promise in the field, but official studies have shown it to have less benefit than the death-prevention trial.
In the pathology and laboratory drug trials, ZMAP served as a control measure, meaning that scientists used it as a baseline and compared three other treatments with it.
The United States Gymnastics Federation supports the United States Olympic Committee's letter and recognizes that the Olympic family has a clear need to promote a safe environment for all of our athletes.

Not only does this confirm that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, which is a widely held theory, but it also provides details that fossils in general cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
According to scientists, the feathers of this animal were brown at the top and purple or orange at the bottom.
The invention also provides insight into the development of bird feathers.
Because dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed feather base called a feather tail, but have the other features of feathers - spiky whiskers and beads - researchers have suggested that feather tails were probably the result of a later evolutionary development than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or display. The researchers suggest that although this is a young dinosaur tail, the specimen shows an adult feather rather than a tadpole.
The researchers suggest that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows the adult plumage and not the tail of a chick.
A car bomb exploded yesterday morning at the Gaziantep Police Station in Turkey, killing two police officers and injuring more than 20 others.
The governor's office said that 10 of the injured were police officers.
Police said they suspected suspected Daesh (ISIS) militants as responsible for the attack.
They found that the sun operated on the same basic principles as other stars, that all the stars in the system were motivated by their light, by their rotation, and nothing else.
The luminosity and rotation are used together to determine the Roseb number of the star, which is related to the flow of the plasma.
The lower the Rossby number, the less active the star is in terms of magnetic repulsion.

And he said, "We're going to try to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by the per capita GDP by 2020, based on the 2005 level".
He did not specify the number of cuts, saying they would be based on China's economic output.
He urged developing countries to avoid "dirty first, clean second" in the old way.
He added that they should not, however, be asked to take on responsibilities that are beyond their developmental stage, responsibility and capacity.

The work that was done was largely theoretical, but the program was written to promote observations of the Milky Way.
The interaction the team was looking for would be due to the gravitational forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the Moon exerts its gravitational pull on the Earth, causing tidal currents, the Milky Way exerts its pull on the Milky Way.
Scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter.
According to this theory, most of the dark matter around the galaxy is in the form of a luminous cloud surrounding the galaxy, and is made up of many small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll has discovered an extremely drug-resistant strain of tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
In one of the interviews, he said that the new variant was "very, very worrying and alarming" due to the very high mortality rate.
Dr. Mol believes that some of the patients may have been infected with the virus at the hospital, and at least two of them were hospital nurses.
In a year, one infected person can infect 10 to 15 contacts.
However, the percentage of multi-drug resistance in the entire TB population remains low, at around 6,000 of the 330,000 people infected in South Africa at any given time.

In France, voting is traditionally done with simple technology: voters are isolated in a voting booth, put a pre-printed ballot paper in an envelope, and indicate the candidate they have chosen.
Once the official verifies the identity of the voter, the voter puts the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voter list.
French electoral law is quite strict on the coding of references.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can verify that there is no envelope at the beginning of the voting, and that no envelope has been added to the ballot except for those envelopes that have been properly counted and allocated to voters.
Candidates can send representatives to be present in person at each stage of the process.

In the women's sitting group, four skiers failed to finish their race, and in the giant ski competition, 45 of the 117 skiers failed to finish the race.
The Madhya Pradesh Police has recovered and returned the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Chief Inspector DK Aryan said: "We have arrested five men who raped a Swiss woman and have returned her cell phone and laptop".
The names of the accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhutta Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police superintendent Chandra Shekar Solanki said the accused had come to court with their faces covered.
Although there were three people inside when the car hit it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services removed the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was first taken to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was later transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoyan has been in the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court on charges of murdering his son.
He was in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but any witness evidence could have been tampered with because his image had been widely published.
Generally, this is common practice in the UK, but Scottish justice works differently, and the courts consider the publication of the photos as potentially prejudicial.
Pamela Ferguson, a professor at the University of Dundee, says that "journalists are putting themselves at risk by publishing photos and other material of suspects".
The Crown Office, which is overall responsible for prosecutions, told reporters that no further comment will be made, at least until the indictment is filed.
According to the leak, the document will address the border dispute: Palestine wants the borders to be based on the pre-1967 borders of the Middle East.
Other topics reportedly discussed included the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel demands a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years after the signing of the agreement, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to leave such a presence for only five years.
In the additional pest control test, the fire was subjected to direct control by the rangers, as the test was monitored and its effectiveness was evaluated.
In partnership with the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Sporting Archery Association of Australia, qualified volunteers were recruited as part of the Sporting Archery Association's hunting program.
According to Mike O'Flynn, who is the acting director of the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Service's Zbosyggi Conservation and Heritage, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation underwent comprehensive safety and training.
Yesterday, the new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council swore Martell into office.
It's the fifth Martelli Express mail in four years.
Last month, the Presidential Commission recommended the resignation of the former Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelli's response to the massive anti-government protests that began in October.
The failure to hold elections has occasionally been the catalyst for violent protests, some as far back as 2011.
There have been about 60 reported cases of iPod heating malfunctions, resulting in six fires, with four people suffering minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents involving the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported 34 more cases of overheating, which the company called "unimportant".
The ministry had called the delay in the Eppley report "really regrettable".
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 am local time (09:19 GMT on Friday night).
The Northern Mariana Islands Office of Emergency Management said there were no casualties in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no sign of a tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman held Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in the Philippine capital of Manila.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six people have been confirmed dead so far.
Six prisoners, including children and adults, were released earlier, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers then took the place of an old woman who needed a bathroom.
The Liggins followed in their father's footsteps and chose to become doctors.
She trained as a midwife and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Oakland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to study preterm births in her spare time.
His research suggests that maturing fetal lungs can be accelerated by administering a single hormone.
Sinhua reported that government investigators recovered two black boxes of flight recordings on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of extremes. My first boss. Luna died on the night of the two moons. Just as special as she was. A strong woman".
Dustin Goldstein Runnels noted that Luna was as crazy as me... maybe even more so... that he loved her and would miss her... hoping she was in a better place.
In a poll of 1,400 people before the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic have increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard, during her 2010 federal election campaign, insisted that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34% of those polled share this view, they want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
In the last survey, 29% of respondents believed that Australia would become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believed that Australia would never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was due to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and the triple jump at the Commonwealth Games, but due to her injuries, her fitness was questioned.
He was unable to take the necessary pills to manage his pain because they are forbidden by the games.
Curtis Cooper, a professor of mathematics and computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number known on January 25.
Several people by early February had confirmed the discovery using various hardware and software, and it was announced on Tuesday.
The comets were probably the source of water supply to the Earth along with organic materials that could form proteins and support survival.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed, because comets collided with the Earth many years ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his administration earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He described the gossip as "political rhetoric and stupidity".
He is expected to run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, will allow airplanes to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel every year and reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology, as opposed to the older ground-based radar technology, to allow air traffic controllers to pinpoint aircraft with greater accuracy and give pilots more accurate information.
No additional transport will be introduced, and no overground trains will stop at Wembley, and onshore car parking, vehicle parking and other transportation facilities are inaccessible.
Concerns about the lack of transportation increased the likelihood that they would have to play the game behind closed doors, without team supporters.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the formation of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although it is thought that this process took much longer due to the cross-breeding between Darwin's endemic serinose, a medium-sized terrestrial serinose, and the unfertilized cactus serinose, serinose coniorostris.
Gold can be given any shape. It can be rolled into tiny shapes.
It can be pulled by a thin metal wire that can be wound and stitched. It can be rolled up or folded into a sheet.
It can be made very thin and inserted into other metal. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books called illuminated manuscripts.
This is called the chemical pH. You can use the red pumpkin juice as a gauge.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical composition is.
The pH level in a chemical compound is indicated by the amount of hydrogen (H in pH) ions.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have their electrons disconnected from themselves (since hydrogen atoms are made up of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powder masks together and then with clean, wet hands, squeeze it into a ball.
The moisture in your hands will react with the outer layers, which will be ridiculous and create a kind of shield.
In Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro, almost every house has a toilet connected to a complex system of sewers.
Remains of plumbing systems have been found in houses in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece.
Bathrooms were also found in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, the baths were sometimes part of public baths, where men and women would be in the same place together.
When you call someone who's thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
In space, the satellite receives the call and responds to it almost instantly.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket, and scientists in space use telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
To put a satellite or a telescope in space, you need a 100-foot-long, giant rocket.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The greatest thing the wheel has done is provide us with a faster and easier means of transportation.
It has given us the train, the automobile, and many other means of transportation.
Most of them are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to horns and deer.
And finally, there are many small cats (including free-living domestic cats) that feed on many more small prey, such as insects, rodents, reptiles and birds.
The secret to their success is the idea of the wormhole, each cat having a specific job that keeps it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of all cats, living in large groups called prairies.
Priders are composed of one to three blood-related adult males, with which there may be more than thirty eggs and a brood.
The female sex is usually more closely related to each other, being a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion predators appear more as wolf or dog packs, the animals are remarkably similar in behaviour to lions (but not other big cats) and are also very lethal to their prey.
A well-developed athlete, the tiger, can juggle (not so well, admittedly), swim, jump long distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong man.
The tiger is in the same genus (genus panthera) as lions, hyenas, and jaguars, and these four are the only cats that can purr.
The tiger's roar is not like the lion's full-voiced roar, but more like a phrase of rattling, roaring words.
The ocelot preys on small animals, and when possible, it will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Almost all the animals it hunts are relatively small.
Scientists believe that the ocelots track and locate their food by scent, sniffing the ground for all the places they have been.
They have excellent night vision and are also very stealthy. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending in with their environment and then attacking it.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) separates from the main population from which it originated (for example, if they move across a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island so that they cannot easily return), they will always be in a different environment from their previous environment.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics and different adaptability than what was required before to be a strong competitor.
The native population hasn't changed at all, they need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as new populations begin to adapt to their new environment, they become less and less sympathetic to the other populations.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will become so different that it's not possible to call them the same species.
We call this process "specification", which simply means the formation of new species.
Plants create oxygen, which humans breathe, and they inhale carbon dioxide, which humans exhale (which is what gets the air out).
Plants get their food through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our homes from plants, we make our clothes from plants, most of the food we eat is plants, and without plants, animals cannot survive.
The Mozazaza was the top predator of its time, so it was not afraid of anything but other Mozazaza.
Its long jaws contained more than 70 sharp, charcoal-like teeth, with an additional row at the top of its mouth, meaning that anything that cut into its path could not escape.
We don't know for sure, but it could have had a forked tongue, and its diet included lizards, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it could even be a cannibal.
It attacked anything that entered the water, even the giant dinosaur, Tyrannosaurus Rex, nothing to it.
While most of their food will be familiar to us, the Romans carried exotic or unusual animal items, including wild boar, amber, rabbits, and a species of mammal called the sleeping beaver.
Another option was that while the poor men and women ate their bread sitting on the chairs, the rich men would have banquets where they would sit together eating their meals.
Ancient Roman cuisine could not include foods that had arrived in the centuries before from Europe, America, Asia.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cacao, and no ancient Roman ever had turkey.
The Babylonians built a great temple for each of their gods, which was considered the house of the god.
People made sacrifices to the gods, and priests tried to satisfy the gods' needs through rituals and celebrations.
Each temple has an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary, which can only be entered by priests.
Sometimes, to form part of the temples, special pyramidal towers called "ziggurats" were built.
The top of the tower was a sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, home was not so important.
Most of the Jewish family's life was spent outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard, shops were open shelves facing the street, and stone was used to build houses.
There were no large forests in Canaan, so the wood was too expensive.
Greenland is sparsely inhabited. Norwegian chroniclers note that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and when he traveled further west, he discovered it and named it Greenland.
But regardless of its discovery, the Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Although each country was "Scandinavian", the people, kings, customs, and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland were very different.
If you've seen the movie "The Treasures of the Earth", you might think that the treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
But it's not true. Despite the fact that it says something on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
The words on the back of the Declaration of Independence read: The original Declaration of Independence ∀∀ dated July 4, 1776. The text appears in italics at the bottom of the document ∀∀.
While no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that the large scroll document was previously in storage (measurements are 293⁄4 long 241⁄2 inches wide).
So it's possible that the notation was added as a direct trademark.
The Normandy landings and subsequent battles liberated the north of France, but the south was not yet liberated.
It was ruled by the Vichy French, who were the French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the occupiers instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies conquered southern France, the invasion being called Operation Dragon.
In just two weeks, American and French independent forces had liberated southern France and were turning their attention to Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a fairly large group of people living and cooperating together -- a society.
Civilization is derived from the Latin civilis, meaning civilization, which is related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-port, and also somehow defines the dimensions of society.
City states are the prototypes of nations. Civilized culture implies the passing of knowledge between several generations, long cultural traces, and the equitable distribution of information.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving any relevant historical evidence and thus are not recognized as proper civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the Thirteen States first formed a weak central government, with Congress as its only component under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, and since there was no national executive or judicial body, it relied on state governments, which often refused to cooperate in order to enforce all its laws.
It also did not have the power to override tax laws and tariffs between the provinces.
The articles required unanimous consent from all the provinces before they could be amended, and the provinces did not take the central government so seriously that their representatives were often absent.
The Italy national football team is the second most successful team in the world, after the German national football team, and the 2006 FIFA World Cup champions.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, wrestling, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the Northern regions, with Italians competing in international games and the Olympic Games.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), making it the 7th largest island in the world.
Because of its group of islands, Japan is often referred to as the Archipelago.
The origins of Taiwan date back to the 15th century, when European sailors passing through recorded the island as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a reorganization of the local cultivation of the spinach crop and employing Chinese laborers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) forces took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, and in 1885 Taiwan was proclaimed a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after the defeat of the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which governed the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Three Window Room.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of what they looked like.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu was restored, and the restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most commonly used format for still photography in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size near the end of the analogue film era.
It's still made today, but more importantly, its width-to-height ratio is inherited from the digital camera image sensor formats.
The 35mm format is actually a bit confusing, 36mm wide, 24mm high.
So the ratio of the sides of this pattern (divided by twelve so we can get the simplest ratio of whole numbers) is, as we say, 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. the APS family of formats) are equivalent to or close to this ratio of sides.
The much-trampled and often-mocked rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamics by keeping the order size in the picture.
It states that the most effective part of the main theme is the intersection of lines, which divides the image vertically and horizontally into three parts (see example).
The Catholic Church, rich and powerful, was under control at this point in European history.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity has united European nations despite differences in language and customs.
Its supreme universal power affected everyone from the king to the common mortal.
One of the basic tenets of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's funds are specifically for that purpose.
The central structure of the church was in Rome for about a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether this dogma had been preserved.
Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy has been effective in cutting off the supply of vital military and civilian goods, even though this blockade violates universal international law, enshrined in several international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain had been cutting off international waters to prevent any vessel from entering the entire ocean, endangering even neutral shipping.
Since there was a limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its submarine fleet's unlimited military operations.
During the 1920s, the dominant approach of many citizens and nations was the approach of pacifism and isolationism.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, countries wanted to avoid a repeat of the situation.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a position with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with four cents, a book of poems, and a guarantee from Charles Batchelor (his former employer) addressed to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of representing the different periods: each dynasty or dynasty in China was considered a separate dynasty.
It was also a period of unstable states divided between each dynasty. The most famous of these was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
This period was marked by fierce warfare between many nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was the bloodiest era in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying in a struggle for the highest seat in the Great Palace of Xi'an.
There are a number of social and political influences, such as the introduction of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the state belongs to the people rather than just one ruler.
Furthermore, after the revolution, professions were open to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same goes for the military, because instead of the rank-based military hierarchy, they were now based on size.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed representatives of the working class in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond this worldly life, and for meditation he often visited a cave on a hill known as the 'Hira', 'Nur', or 'Light'.
The cave, which has survived for centuries, is a vivid illustration of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Perched atop one of the northern mountains of Mecca, the cave is completely cut off from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find, even if someone knows it existed.
The view from the cave is limited to the beautiful sky and the surrounding mountains.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World that is still standing.
The Egyptians built the Great Pyramid in the third century B.C.E. It is one of many great pyramids built in honor of the dead pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau of the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, or the Giza Necropolis, contains several pyramids (the largest of which is the Great Pyramid), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor the Pharaoh Khufu, while many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wife and family members.
The upper arrow is a V-shaped, while the lower arrow is a square with a closed edge or a square with no bottom edge.
Top means you start at the top and pull the bow, and bottom means you start at the slide (where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
A high-pitched bow usually produces a softer sound, while a low-pitched bow is louder and more firm.
You can use the pencil for your own notes, but remember that the printed humiliation signs are there for musical purposes, so usually you have to take them into account.
On 6 October 1789, the terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie Thérèse, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged four), and the King's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forced to flee Versailles to Paris following an attack by a group of market women.
They returned to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and threatening the queen and the king.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open the window of their chariot wide.
One of the crowd, at one point, waved the head of the royal soldier killed at Versailles before the terrified queen.
The cost of the US imperialist war to take over the Philippines was paid by the Filipinos themselves.
They had to pay taxes to the US colonial regime to cover most of the interest and costs on the bonds that were placed on behalf of the Philippine government by the Wall Street banking structures.
Of course, the profits from the long exploitation of the Filipino people would be the main achievement of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that contributed to the formation of the order.
The period in which the events occurred is usually called the Early Middle Ages, a period in European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, terminating approximately in 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of practical ideas, from technological drive or technological imperative to the very idea that human destiny is driven by fundamental logic, linked to scientific laws and other manifestations of technology.
Most of the commentaries on technological determinism share two main ideas: that technological development itself follows a path largely outside of cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has impacts on societies within rather than socially conditioned.
For example, the motor car inevitably leads to the development of roads.
But a nationwide road network is not economically viable for just a small number of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The mass use of cars on the road also leads to a high number of accidents, which in turn leads to the development of new techniques in the health sector to treat injured bodies.
Romanticism is a major element of cultural determinism, seen in such writers as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the Romantic context, geography shaped individuals, and over time, the customs and culture associated with that geography grew; these, being in harmony with the environment of society, were better than arbitrary laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, so Constantinople was seen as the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
As the epicenter of the Persian Empire, it became prominent around 400 AD and lasted until about 1100 AD.
During the twelfth century, its status declined, especially due to the fact that the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silk objects and spices, which were worth more than what the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this time that the fashion capital of Constantinople became Paris.
The Gothic style flourished in the 10th, 11th and 14th centuries.
Early dress in the East was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture.
However, thanks to the slow communication channels, styles in the West could be 25 to 30 years behind.
At the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style, and one of the great achievements of that time was the use of buttons to secure clothing, which was a result of the Crusades.
The goal of subsistence farming is to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Agriculture is a simple, often organic system that uses seeds specifically preserved for an ecological region, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple methods to maximize yields.
Historically, many farmers were engaged in subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel ignored by social norms, and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Ethnicities may vary by age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The qualities that define a particular subset may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of ethnicity often communicate their membership through the use of distinctive and symbolic style, which involves novelty, cliché, and misuse of terms.
One of the most common methods used to show the importance of socialization is to observe a few unfortunate cases of children who, having gone through neglect, misery and intentional abuse by adults, were not socialized by adults as they grew older.
Some of these children have been abandoned by humans (usually their parents), in some cases due to the rejection of severe mental or physical injury by the parent.
Wild children may have experienced cruel exploitation or trauma before being abandoned or fleeing.
Others are believed to have been raised by animals, some said to have lived on their own in the wild.
When a feral child is raised by a non-domestic pet, he exhibits behaviors (in physical terms) that are almost entirely similar to the behavior of particularly wary animals, such as his fear or indifference to humans.
While coding courses are supposed to make learning easier and more fun, code engineering is a step in that direction.
Code re-engineering is not a teaching method, but rather an aid to support individuals who are going through a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Woodpeckers can be both virtual and real, but in other words, a teacher is a form of woodpecker, but so is the man with the little briefcase in the Microsoft office.
Virtual logs are integrated into the software and are designed to ask, prompt, and explain procedures that might have been difficult for a student to handle on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, from neglect to abuse to even exploitation.
No child should grow up in an environment that does not provide for them, care for them, and educate them, and yet there are still some.
We believe that the foster system is a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.
The adoptive family is supposed to provide for all the needs that were not provided for in the home from which they were removed.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and in-person communication.
The peculiar nature of the Internet leads to additional standards in terms of usage and satisfaction.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are suggested as important motives for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
Amy and McCord also considered "personal engagement" and "ongoing relationships" to be new motivational perspectives (1998) when they studied audience responses to websites.
And imaging has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial expressions that last a few milliseconds.
In particular, they claim that you can tell if someone is lying by correctly interpreting microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his "The President's Speech", pointed out how people who have a disability to understand speech due to brain injury are still able to accurately assess honesty.
He even suggested that animals, like domestic dogs, could have this ability to interpret human behavior.
20th-century research showed that there are two kinds of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds a new gene, and selection removes it from the list of mutations.
Separation and recombination confuse the changes between the two compounds in each generation.
On the savannah, a primate with a digestive system like a human's has a hard time meeting its amino acid needs with the resources available to plants.
And failure to do so has serious consequences: stunting, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most accessible plant resources would be proteins, which were available in leaves and legumes, but like us, primates have a hard time digesting them unless they're cooked.
Unlike animals, such as ants, termites, and termites, the food of termites is not only easier to digest, but also provides a high protein content, containing all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, we shouldn't be surprised to learn that our ancestors solved their protein problem in much the same way that chimpanzees do today in the savannah.
Sleep disruption is the deliberate process of waking up during your normal sleep and then falling back asleep shortly after (10-60 minutes).
This can be done quite easily by using a relatively quiet alarm clock that will bring you to consciousness without waking you up completely.
If you're sleeping, you can put the alarm clock on the other side of the room, which will make you get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options based on biological rhythms include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, the famous urine) before bedtime, which causes a person to wake up and urinate.
The amount of inner peace is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in the body and in the soul.
The lower the tension, the more positive the force is towards life.
Anyone can get an education. The only thing that is stopping us from getting it is our own stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but was spread through the Mahayana path of love and the many techniques of Indian yoga.
At its core, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, it's a combination of Kundalini yoga, mindfulness and the path of all-encompassing love.
In Kundalini yoga, the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and meditations.
The core of Tibetan meditation is divine yoga, and through the visualization of various gods, energy pathways are cleansed, chakras are activated, and enlightened consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to the alliance of the USSR and the United States. At the end of the war, systemic, procedural and cultural clashes forced the countries to abandon the agreement.
Two years after the war ended, the former allies became enemies, and the Cold War began.
It was to last for the next 40 years, and the replacement, the real armies were to fight battles from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences had been broken and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian front.
However, these plans were thwarted almost overnight when the Soviet Union's Red Army of approximately 800,000 troops entered and created the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other bilateral and multilateral international agreements.
Using ships to transport goods is the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods across the oceans.
The Navy's job was to ensure that your country could maintain the ability to move its people and goods, while at the same time preventing your enemy from moving its people and goods.
One of the most recent and notable examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign during World War II. The Americans were trying to transport people and supplies across the Atlantic to help Britain.
Meanwhile, the German navy, using mostly submarines, was trying to close the passage.
If the Allies failed, Germany would probably be able to invade Britain, as well as the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were first domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran about 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to preserve them to make milk, hair, meat and bone easily accessible.
Domestic goats were usually kept by herds that grazed on hillsides or meadows, often followed by goat herds, which were typically children or adolescents, as were the more common herders. These breeding methods are still used today.
The footpaths were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the carriages were only made of parallel wooden boards, they allowed the horses to pull them to reach higher speeds and to pull larger loads than on the relatively uneven roads of the day.
Railroad spikes were introduced early on to hold railroad tracks in place, but it gradually became clear that the tracks would be more effective if they were covered with iron from above.
This became standard practice, but the iron in the wooden wheels of the wagons caused more wear.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first all-iron lines were introduced.
The first known vehicle was walking, and humans started walking upright about two million years ago, with the appearance of Homo erectus.
Their ancestors, Australopithecus, did not typically walk straight.
The dinosaur specialization was found in the fossils of Australopithecus between 4.9 and 2.8 million years ago, although the coelacanth may have walked on two legs as far back as seven million years ago.
We can start to live more environmentally consciously, we can join the environmental movement, and we can become activists to reduce future suffering even to a certain extent.
It's just like symptomatic treatment in many ways, but if we want more than just a temporary solution, we have to find the root of the problem and we have to root it out.
Clearly, the world has changed dramatically because of humanity's scientific and technological advances, and the problems have been compounded by overpopulation and the unrestrained lifestyle of people.
When Congress passed it on July 4, a handwritten copy signed by Speaker John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thompson was sent to the John Dunlap Printing House a few blocks away.
Overnight, 150 to 200 copies were made, now known as the Dunleaf wide-sheets.
On July 8, the document was read publicly for the first time by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9. One example arrived in London on August 10.
Today, the 25 Dunlop Lines that are known to still exist are the oldest extant examples of a document. The original manuscript has not survived.
Today, many paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive today. We call them birds.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
But there's a lot of talk about birds that are still being compared to dinosaurs.
They have spines on their legs and claws, they lay eggs and they walk like tyrannosaurs on their hind legs.
In fact, all computers in use today are based on information processing encoded in binary digits.
A binary number system can only have one of two values, like 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits, or bits, if you use computer language.
Symptoms, such as vomiting, are common enough to be difficult to diagnose.
The best indicator of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of a drug or toxic economic chemicals.
Check the label for the first aid instructions for the particular poison.
The term medium is used by entomologists to refer to this group of insects in an official sense.
The term comes from an ancient familiarity with woodpeckers, which are insects that are highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Killer insects and woodpeckers are sedentary, adapted to live in the burrows or habitat of their host.
There are about 400,000 reported cases of multiple sclerosis in the United States, which suggests that it's still the most common neurological disease among young and middle-aged people.
Cerebral palsy is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
The study found that women are twice as likely to have a master's degree in science than men.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interests or that of their child.
These couples can choose an adoption plan for their child.
In adoption, the parents who gave birth to a child give up their parental rights to let another couple adopt the child.
The main purpose of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method.
But it's not just an experiment, it's a test that uses questions to disprove one or more of the possible hypotheses, and observations also guide scientific research.
Philosophers and naturalists focused on classical texts, especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views have been accepted in all fields of science, including psychology.
With the decline of Greek knowledge, the West was cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many have observed that the repetition of physiology and behavior is often highly dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles and the creation of endogenous cycles by biological interactions.
Periodic rhythms, which are not merely responses to external periodic signals, have been documented in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue to rotate freely even in the absence of external signals.
Hershey and Chase's experiment was one of the main suggestions that DNA is a genetic material.
Hersh and Chase used phages and viruses to implant their own DNA into a virus.
They did two experiments, labeling DNA with either a radioactive phosphorus phase or a radioactive sponge from a phase protein.
Mutations can have a number of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the part of the genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells are embryonic cells.
Only embryonic cell mutations can pass to children, while other mutations can lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people who want to visit nature sites to enjoy the scenery as well as the flora and fauna.
Examples of activities in the area include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and visiting parks, as well as studying information about the ecosystem.
For example, visiting, photographing and studying the orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people drive from small suburban towns to their workplaces, meeting others on the way who have jobs in the same towns they just left.
In this fast-moving suburban train, everyone is somehow connected to and supports the private car-based transportation system.
Science now says that this massive carbon economy has diverted the biosphere from one of its stable states that has supported human development for the past two million years.
Everyone is part of society and uses transportation systems, and almost everyone has complaints about the state of transportation systems.
You don't hear this level of complaint in developed countries about the quality of water or the collapse of bridges.
Why are transportation systems such a source of complaint, why do they fail every day? Is transportation engineers not professionals? Or is there something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow studies the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interaction with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because it's impossible to predict driver behavior 100 percent.
Fortunately, drivers tend to keep a fairly consistent distance, so the flow of traffic tends to have some reasonable consistency, and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better represent the flow of traffic, we have correlated three main parameters: 1) flow, 2) density, and 3) velocity.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and operation of road structures.
The ants were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly helped them to avoid enemies more easily, to forage for food, and to find mates more efficiently.
Most midges have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back along their body.
This gives them small spaces to hide from a wide variety of predators.
Today, the only insects that can't fold their wings back are the butterflies and the orbicon.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some thought that he was right, but many thought otherwise, that the solar system, including the sun (and even the other stars), revolved around the earth.
That makes sense, because the Earth doesn't seem to be moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest river on Earth, and the largest river on Earth, and it carries more than eight times as much water as the second largest river on Earth.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, stretching six miles in some places.
The Amazon is the source of 20 percent of the world's ocean-flowing rivers.
The Amazon River is 6,387 kilometres (3,980 mi) long, and it is fed by thousands of smaller rivers.
Although stone-built structures survived until the Old Kingdom, the Pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in size and technical excellence.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their ancestors, which were by then over a thousand years old.
With a population of about 800, the Vatican City is the world's smallest independent state and the least populous.
Vatican City uses Italian for its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also a common language used by many of the country's working people, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
The Vatican City is the seat of the Roman Catholic Church.
In the ancient world, people knew about the existence of basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper, because these were naturally found in nature and were relatively easy to mine with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything was made up of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in the same sequence) ̋ solid, liquid, gas and plasma, ̋ although he also suggests that they are transformed into new materials ̋ to form what we see.
Forms are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Remember, there are many elements on the periodic table.
So, the elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals, and of course there are metals like silver and gold.
You can also have compounds that include small amounts of nonmetallic elements, like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, and all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that a trillion of them would fit in just the end of this sentence.
So when the pencil came along, it was a good friend to many.
Unfortunately, as more new ways of writing came into use, the pencil became less used and lower in status.
People are now typing messages on computer screens without ever having to go near a pen.
One can only guess what the keyboard will look like when something new comes out.
The fission bomb works by the principle that energy is required to combine a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like a heavy cart spinning up a hill, splitting the nucleus again, and then releasing some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to separate with little or no pressure.
The surface of the moon is made of rock and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The outer crust is about 70 kilometers thick on the nearer side and 100 kilometers on the farther side.
It's thinner in the water and thicker in the mountains.
There could be more eruptions on this side because the outer crust is thinner, and it's easier for the lava to get out onto the surface.
Content theories focus on finding out what makes people tick or what makes them tick.
These theories suggest that humans have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as we mature.
These theories are about finding out what makes some people want to do the things they do, and what environmental factors make them do or not do certain things.
The two well-known theories of content are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-way action theory.
There are two general behaviors that can occur when managers start to take on their former peers: One end of the spectrum is trying to be one of the "first guys" (or "first girls").
This type of leader has difficulty making decisions that are not favored by the people, implementing disciplinary actions, performance appraisals, allocating responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, a creature is transformed into an unrecognizable individual who feels that he has to change everything the team has done and do his own thing.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behavior often causes friction between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as regular teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often act as a contact person for their immediate physical team.
They often have more autonomy than regular team members, because their teams can meet in different time zones, which can be confusing to their local leadership.
The presence of a real 'invisible team' (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The invisible team is the leadership team to which each member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why should an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of establishing an educational organization? One of the goals of applying the concepts of organizational learning to practice is innovation.
Creativity and ingenuity can be shown when all the resources available in the functional departments of the organization are used efficiently.
As a result, the process of an organization working together to overcome a barrier can lead to a new process of innovation that will serve the needs of the customer.
Before any organization can innovate, leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as a culture of shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Engel (2006) explains the Continuity Approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neural data provides physical evidence to theoretically approach cognitive research, so it narrows the field of study and makes it much more precise.
The interplay between brain pathology and behavior is helping scientists in their research.
It's long been known that various types of brain injury, trauma, disease, and tumors affect behavior and alter certain mental functions.
The rise of new technologies is allowing us to see and investigate the structure and processes of the brain that we've never seen before.
This gives us a wealth of data and material to build models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although AI has a strong science fiction connotation, it is a very important branch of computer science that deals with behavior, learning, and smart device adaptation.
Artificial intelligence research involves training machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include monitoring, scheduling and scheduling, the ability to diagnose and answer customer questions, and handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
These things become separate branches of science that focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are now commonly used in economics, medicine, engineering, and military fields, as they have been created in several computer and video game software applications.
Field trips are a big part of any course, and very often, a teacher would like to take his students to places that you can't go by bus.
Technology offers a solution through virtual field trips, where students can look at the museum's cultural artifacts, visit aquariums, or admire wonderful art while sitting in their classrooms.
Sharing the excursion is also a good way to reflect on the trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year, students at Bennett High School in North Carolina prepare a website for their trip to the state capital, and the website is updated every year, but the old versions are kept online as a registry.
Blogs can also be useful in improving students' writing. While students often start their blogging experience with poor grammar and spelling, the presence of readers fundamentally changes this.
Since students are often the most critical readers, the blogger struggles to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging also "makes students more aware of the world around them". The need to satisfy the curiosity of the audience inspires students to be smart and curious (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that encourages collaboration and encourages students to expand learning beyond the traditional school day.
The normal use of blogs can empower students to become more analytical and critical. By responding more actively to online materials, students can define their positions in the context of other people's writings, as well as their own perspectives on specific issues (Orrovec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital, and is adorned with art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
To the south are Niagara Falls, and to the north are the natural beauty of Muskoka and the surrounding area.
All of these and a few other things make Ontario what is considered by outsiders to be a model Canadian city.
Large areas further north are sparsely populated, and some are almost uninhabited deserts.
To compare the population, which surprises many, there are more African Americans living in the United States than there are Canadians.
The East African Islands are in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is, of course, the largest, and in terms of wildlife, a unique continent.
Most of the smaller islands are independent states or attached to France and are known as luxury holiday beaches.
The Arabs also brought Islam to these countries, and it has come a long way in the Comoros and in Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered a sea route from Europe to India.
The region is bordered on the north by the Sahel, and on the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is advised that any woman traveling should state that she is married regardless of actual marital status.
Wearing a ring is also beneficial (not necessarily the one that is too expensive).
Women need to realize that cultural differences can result in what they would consider an assault, and it's not uncommon to be followed, held, and so on.
Be firm in your rejection of men, and don't be afraid to speak your mind, whether it's a cultural difference or not, okay?
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and the Phoenicians, Romans and Merenids used it as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, only to abandon it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Darou le Badia, and Spanish traders who established trading bases there renamed it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in Morocco.
It's not hard to find places in Medina that sell traditional Moroccan items such as savory dishes, pottery, leather goods, nargile and a huge variety of charms, but this is for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the easternmost part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Nyiragongo volcanic eruption destroyed Gom, covering most of the city streets, especially the city center.
While Goma is reasonably safe, any visit outside Goma should be examined to understand the state of military operations that are ongoing in North Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for the exploitation of the Nyiragongo volcano, chasing some of the most inexpensive mountain gorillas in Africa.
To get around Goma, you can use a boda boda (motorcycle taxi). The usual (local) price for a short ride is ~500 Congolese francs.
Combined with its relative untouchability, "Timbuctoo" was used as a metaphor for exotic, distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, but despite its reputation as a tourist attraction, it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger, due to the threat of desert sands.
Daenerys Lewis was one of the main stops on the PBS special "Wonders of the African World".
The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the country, because it has more of an Arabic than an African feel.
The Kruger National Reserve (KNR) is located in the north-east of South Africa and stretches east along the border with Mozambique, north to Zimbabwe, and south to the Crocodile River.
The park covers an area of 19,500 square kilometres (11,500 sq mi) and is divided into 14 different ecoregions, each supporting different branches of wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's major attractions and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all national parks in South Africa, there are daily maintenance and admission fees.
It can also be profitable to purchase a Wild Card, which gives access to various parks in South Africa or to all of the South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is a major tourist attraction.
The parade of buildings that make up the skyline of Hong Kong resembles a glittering grid, made visible by the presence of water in Victoria Harbour.
To see the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the other side, the Kowloon Falls.
The main urban development of Hong Kong Island is densely populated along the coast of the mainland, in reclaimed land.
This is where the British colonists observed theirs, so if you're looking for evidence of this place's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are considered the world's largest mangrove coastal belt, stretching 80 km (50 mi) from the coastline across the interior of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The forest inside the Indian reservation is called the Sundarbans National Park.
But the forests are not mere mangrove swamps; they include the last remnants of the mighty jungles that once covered the Gangetic Plain.
The Sundarbans area covers 3,850 square kilometres, of which about one third is covered by wetlands.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary, and there are an estimated 400 Bengal royal tigers and some 30,000 rhinos in the area.
Buses depart from the inter-city bus station (along the river) throughout the day, although eastbound and Jakarta/Bumtang trains depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since the buses on the tour are often crowded, it is recommended to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Many areas are served by small Japanese shuttle buses that are comfortable and durable.
Taxies with a fare are a quick and convenient way to visit nearby places such as Paro (No 150) and Punaha (No 200).
The Oiapoque River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oiapoque River and connects the city of Oiapoque, Brazil, with Saint-Georges-de-l'Oiapoque, French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 83 meters, its length is 378 meters, and it has two rows of 3.5 meters wide.
The vertical cleft below the bridge is 15 metres. Construction was completed in August 2011, it was even closed to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational by September 2017, when the Brazilian toll road is expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most significant indigenous group that lived in what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters engaged in subsistence farming.
The Chaco region was inhabited by other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Guaicuru and the Paguá, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
The 16th century Paraguay, formerly known as the "Great Empire of the Indians", was created by the conflict between the Spanish conquistadors and the indigenous Indian tribes.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
When Asunción was founded in 1537, Paraguay was able to largely retain its original character and identity.
Argentina is known as one of the countries with the best polo team and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the Las Canitas Polo Grounds.
On other days of the year, smaller tournaments and matches are held here.
For information on where to buy tickets for tournaments and polo games, see Associação Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falklands Pound (FKP), which is equivalent to the British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the islands' only bank, located in Stanley, across from the Westland Company store.
The British pound sterling is generally accepted anywhere in the islands, as are Stanley credit cards. United States dollars are also often accepted.
Credit cards may not be accepted in remote islands, but British and US currency may be accepted, check with the owner beforehand to see what payment method is acceptable.
It's almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so change your currency before you leave.
Because Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer in the northern hemisphere, and winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropical zone, and temperatures above +30 C are common in the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively cold, with temperatures rarely dropping below zero, but the wind and humidity combine to make you feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no specific wet and dry seasons; roughly the same amount of rain falls throughout the year.
Although most animals in the park are used to seeing people, wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the management of the reserve, you must maintain a minimum distance of 100 yards from bears and wolves and 25 yards from all other wildlife.
As obedient as they may seem, bison, reindeer, moose, bears, and almost any large animal can be attacked.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they didn't keep a proper distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them their space.
Also, bear in mind that bears and other wild animals are attracted to the smell, so avoid having or preparing food that smells bad, and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, and it's on the island of Upolu, and it has a population of less than 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of an infamous naval drought in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to leave the port.
All but one British ship was lost, and about 200 Americans and Germans were killed.
During the independence struggle organized by the Maoist movement, the supreme leader Tupua Tamase Lolofi G was assassinated as a result of peaceful rallies in the city.
There are many beaches in Auckland because of the two ports on either side.
The North Shore Beaches (North Harbor District) is on the Pacific Ocean coast and stretches from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are all safe sandy swimming beaches, and most have shaded areas that are provided by pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are on the Waitemata Harbour in the upscale suburbs of Midtown Oakland, Michigan Bay and St Helens.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with lots of different shops stretching along the coast.
The main local beer is Number One, a simple beer but with a pleasant and refreshing character. The other local beer is called Manta.
There are many French wines to have, but New Zealand and Australian wines can be better consumed.
The local water from the well is perfectly drinkable, but if you're afraid, bottled water is easy to find.
The concept of 'coffee with milk' is foreign to Australians. Short black is espresso, cappuccino is served with high-sugar (no froth) and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is even by Belgian standards, and the fruit juices are expensive, but they taste great.
Most underwater cave expeditions are year-round, and injuries to underwater rock from any of these causes are very rare.
As a parent, follow the instructions of the authorities, obey all signs, and pay attention to safety signs.
The Ark-shaped medusa is found near beaches and riverbanks between October and April in the northern part of 1770. They can occasionally be found outside these periods.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack people. Many sharks are afraid of people and swim away from shore.
Sea crocodiles don't just live in the ocean, their primary habitat is the riverbanks north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives travelers peace of mind that they will have a place to sleep when they reach their destination.
Travel agents often make deals with specific hotels, although you can also book other forms of accommodation, such as camping through a travel agent.
Travel agents typically offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, or even a combination flight and hotel package.
They can also keep a reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or to get other documents (such as a visa) for the place you have chosen.
Although any changes and inquiries should be first discussed with the travel agent and not directly with the hotel.
For some festivals, the vast majority of visitors choose to camp in the venue, and many visitors consider it a vital part of the experience.
If you want to be near the concert, you have to get in early so you can beat the tent to the music.
Remember, even if the music has ended on the main stage, there may be parts of the festival that will continue to play until late at night.
Some festivals have camping areas for families with young children.
If you decide to cross the northern Baltic in winter, check the cabin mounting, because going through the ice causes quite a terrible noise to the most affected.
Sailing to St. Petersburg also includes entertainment in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from entry visa requirements (check conditions).
Usually, casinos go to great lengths to make guests spend more time and money. Clocks and windows are mostly missing, and the exit is difficult to find.
They usually have special offers of food, drink and entertainment to keep guests happy and inside the building.
Some places offer alcoholic drinks in the house, but drunkenness clouds judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone who is going to drive in high altitudes or over mountain passes should be aware of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snow-covered roads, the contact is low, and you can't drive like you can on bare asphalt.
In the case of a snowflake, a lot of snow can fall and cover you in a very short time.
Visibility may also be limited by snow or ice on the car windows, or by snow falling or melting on them.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are natural in many countries, and traffic is basically continuous all year round.
Safaris are probably the biggest tourist draw in Africa and the destination for many visitors.
The term safari is widely used for overland travel to observe the spectacular African wildlife, particularly in the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and elephants, tend to get close to the machines, and standard equipment allows them to get a good close-up view.
Lions, leopards and tigers are sometimes shy and can be seen best with binoculars.
A bushwalk safari (also known as bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking or bushwalking) involves either a few hours or a few days of walking.
The Paralympic Games will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Several events will be held in other locations in Japan.
Tokyo is the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, having done so in 1964.
If you have booked your tickets and accommodation for 2020 before the announcement of the postponement, you may face a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of the end of March, all cancellations due to the coronavirus have not been extended until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled to take place.
Tickets for most events are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, while regular tickets cost 7,000 yen.
Many hotels have a sink and a sink table that can be rented even if there is no one in the room.
If you do not have a comb or if you do not like wearing comb socks, you may want to try a combing machine.
Be careful not to overheat the piece (which can cause a rash, or in extreme cases, a burn).
There are different ways to purify water, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some places, boiling water for a minute is enough; in others, it takes several minutes.
Filters vary in their effectiveness, and if you're concerned, you should consider buying your water from a reputable company with a bottle cap.
Travelers may encounter pests that are unfamiliar to them in their home environment.
Bed bugs can spoil food, cause irritation, or worse, cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves or dangerous animals that can harm or violently kill people are not usually classified as pests.
Duty-free shopping allows you to buy goods free of taxes and excise duty in certain locations.
Travelers to a country with a heavy tax system can sometimes save a lot of money, especially on items like beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most dangerous driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, often passing through isolated deep-forest terrain.
If you're not used to driving on country roads, keep your feelings to yourself: the bumps, the narrow lanes, and the sharp turns are prevalent.
The speed limits are much lower than the previous and subsequent sections, 35 to 40 mph (56 to 64 km/h), and it's more important to stick to them than anything else.
Interestingly, cell phone service is much stronger here than in many other parts of the trail, like the Pennsylvania Wilderness.
German pastry is quite good, and in Bavaria, quite rich and varied, as is their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastry is popular, apple pastry is made all year round, and cabbage and salsa are fresh in the summer.
The popular cookies often go well with a cup of strong coffee. The cookies are often served with a small amount of water, and the fruit is often served with a sauce.
If you want a small but filling pastry, try what is known locally as a Berliner, a Pfankuchen, or a Krapfen.
Curry is a dish with herbs and spices as its main ingredients, made with either meat or vegetables.
The cartridge can be either dry or hot, depending on the amount of liquid.
In the Mediterranean regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly added to curries; in southern India and a few other near-continental regions, coconut milk is commonly added.
With a choice of about 17,000 islands, Indonesian cuisine is a catch-all term that encompasses the wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
But when used without further qualification, the term generally means food that originated in the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine is characterized by a simple, spicy array of dishes, with the predominant Javanese flavor additions being peanuts, black pepper, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various flavored spices.
The poles, which hang on either side of the camp, protect the rider's legs.
They provide greater stability for the rider, but may have safety concerns, as there is a possibility that the rider's feet may get stuck in them.
If a rider falls off a horse but his foot is caught in the bridle, the horse may kick him if he escapes. To minimize this risk, a number of precautions can be taken.
First, all the riders wear shoes with a high heel and a smooth, fairly narrow, inlay.
Then some poles, particularly British poles, have safety rails that allow the pole to hang from the pole as the falling rider pulls it back.

Skiing dates back to at least the 17th century, and the first recreational ski club was opened in Australia by Norwegians in 1861.
Backpacking is also called a long-distance ski trip, ski trip, or ski expedition.
It is associated with Alpine-style skiing or alpine climbing, but these are not usually included, as these are done in rough terrain, and require much stronger skis and shoes.
Think of a skiing route as a kind of a skiing route.
In the right conditions, you'll be able to cover somewhat more distance than walking, but it's very rare that you'll be able to gather skating speeds on prepared trails without a heavy backpack.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it has many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling to many countries would mean applying for visas and passing passport checks several times.
But in this sense, the Schengen zone works like one state.
As long as you are in this zone, you can usually cross the border without going through passport control again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you won't have to apply for a visa individually in each of the Schengen countries, saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what is made to be antiques, and some tax agencies classify items over 100 years old as antiques.

Craft items can be defined as antiques, even though they are newer than similar mass-produced products.
The breeding of northern reindeer is an important source of livelihood for the Sami and surrounding culture, and trade is also important for many other professions.

Trans people don't have to expect to be scanned in the pre-op phase, and their privacy and dignity are protected.
Reverse currents are the backflow of waves that form on a beach, often after colliding with a reef or similar object.
Because of the underwater topography, the backflow is concentrated in a few deeper sections, and in deep water, a strong current can form there.
Many deaths are the result of exhausting attempts to swim against the current, which may be impossible.
Once you're out of the current, swimming backwards isn't as hard as it used to be.

Finland is a major seaport. The country of the thousand lakes also has thousands of islands in its lakes and offshore archipelagos.
You don't necessarily need a boat in the archipelago and the lakes.
While the offshore islands and the largest lakes are indeed big enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even motorboats provide a very different experience.
In Finland, sailing is a national pastime, with seven or eight people on each boat.
It corresponds to Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but is quite exceptional in the rest of the cases (for example, in the Netherlands the ratio is one in forty).
Most of the Baltic's most memorable sea voyages feature a long stop in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can visit the historic city for two full days, returning and sleeping on the boat at night.

The obvious way to fly first or business class is to spend a lot of money for that privilege (or better yet, to get your company to do it for you).
However, this is not cheap; in practical terms, you can expect to pay up to four times more for business class than economy class and eleven times more for first class.
In general, it doesn't even make sense to look for discounts on business or first-class seats to get from point A to point B.
Airlines know very well that there are certain core groups of travelers who are willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and conveniently, and they charge accordingly.
