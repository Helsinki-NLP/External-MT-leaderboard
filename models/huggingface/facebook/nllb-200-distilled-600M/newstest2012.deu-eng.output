No release for Tymoshenko by Parliament
The Ukrainian Parliament today rejected the proposal to repeal the paragraphs on which opposition leader Yulia Timoshenko was convicted under a new amendment to the Criminal Code.
The new arrangements, which could have paved the way for the release of the imprisoned Prime Minister, were rejected by the Members at the second reading of the request for a reduction in the penalty for economic crimes.
In October, Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for allegedly entering into a disadvantageous contract with Russia over the purchase of natural gas.
The judgment is not yet in force and the appeal of the convicts is due to be heard in court in December.
Timoshenko himself calls the ruling a political revenge on the regime and even in the West the trial raised suspicions of the court's bias.
The motion to remove Paragraph 365 from the Criminal Code, which condemned the former Prime Minister, was supported by 147 Members.
226 votes would have been required to approve it.
Libyan victory
The history of the Libyan liberation struggle or Libyan rebellion already knows its losers.
Muammar al-Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
Now it's just a matter of defining the winners.
As is the custom in this region, Islamists win the elections, the question is just which - the moderate or the radical.
The National Transitional Council recognized the customary law of the Sharīʿa, of which we now have a certain idea with God.
Libya would be a crime-free country, because for stealing, you cut off your hand.
Women should also forget about emancipation as quickly as possible, execute any apostates, and so on.
Instead of a single dictator, the society of rival tribes will be united by the Koran.
In short, there will be an order in Libya that is hardly imaginable and, above all, hardly desirable in this country.
- our lifestyle is not the only one and, objectively, probably not the best, and it would hardly suit the Libyans mentioned.
So it's rather strange that Muslim fighters even get help from unbelieving dogs.
Their excuse may be the fact that NATO air strikes were not directed by some general from America, but by Allah himself, whose omnipotence was praised after every successful strike.
The winners in Libya?
We were just taking part in a shootout, serving the interests of Islam, and our politicians got away in the person of a political ally's dictator, without any benefit.
After the recent and bad experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq, we preferred to see Libya as a military occupation.
This is a concern for the local people, namely the expulsion of the Crusaders.
But even without occupation, will the oil companies get the black gold at a ridiculous price?
The West can hardly boast for a moment of its selflessness in protecting human rights.
Unless the Shariahs destroy them.
The beginning of a new era of crisis
France and the rest of Europe are the focus of investors.
On Tuesday, a statistical storm broke through Europe.
The individual countries published their figures on their GDP for the third quarter.
The Czech economy stagnated compared with the previous quarter, while Germany and France declined.
The bond market is breaking all records today.
The investors are not only looking at Greece but also Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
The statistical offices of the Eurozone, Germany, the Czech Republic and several other European countries have published their preliminary forecasts of economic development in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP was expected to grow by 0.5%, while France's grew by 0.4%.
Both countries corrected their data for the second quarter, when Germany recorded higher than originally expected growth (growth of 0.3% instead of the forecast 0.1%), while France admitted a slight decline of 0.1% (original data only spoke of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent in the third quarter of this year compared with the previous year.
However, the GDP stagnated compared with the previous quarter and the trend of slowing economic performance was confirmed, according to the Statistical Office.
So the results are worse than the analysts predicted.
The main events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% in the third quarter of this year compared to the previous year, but stagnated compared to the previous quarter.
According to preliminary and seasonal data, the German economy grew by 0.5 percent in the third quarter.
The euro area as a whole and the EU saw growth of 0.2% between July and September compared to the previous quarter, which is in line with analysts' expectations.
The Greek economy shrank by 5.2 percent compared to the previous year.
The yield on its 10-year government bonds rose to 28.45%.
The yields of Italian and Spanish government bonds rose to their critical limits.
Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium and other countries are also beginning to feel problems...
The yield on Czech government bonds remains below 4%, even as the situation in the region deteriorates.
In Germany, voices are ringing, the ECB being the creditor of last resort.
The Czech Republic qualified for EURO
In Montenegro , they won 1:0 and now celebrate their qualification for 200 million .
The football selection has overcome the toughest task of the entire season!
Thanks to a well-placed goalkeeper Čech and a magnificent goal by Petr Jiráček, she won 1-0 in Montenegro.
With a great deal of luck, the Czech football has thus been able to defend its luxurious advantage over its home games and will once again be playing in the European Championship.
IHNED.cz followed the ascent in a detailed report.
Little excitement in the first half and a huge portion of luck in the second.
The Czech national team also won 1-0 in Montenegro thanks to the weakness of the home team, a brilliant Czech and the hero of the day, Jiráček, and thus bought their ticket to the football world cup.
The Czech team's precise defensive play also put the Montenegrin side under more pressure in the second half.
The lucky birds of the game were Damjanovic and Vucinic, who shot two huge chances.
The Czech national team will also be involved in the European Championship next year thanks to an excellent Petr Čech. It is also pleasing that the national football team will receive a prize of some 200 million.
From the first few minutes, football was played quite ferociously.
The two teams combined in a long, long way, and so the game was played mostly around the midline.
The pressure from the home team remained in the second half and the large penalties were successfully repelled by the Czech defense.
Iranian students are willing to die for their country's nuclear program.
They formed a living sign.
Several hundred university students have created a living sign around a nuclear object in Iran.
With this gesture, they wanted to demonstrate their support for their country's nuclear program before a possible Israeli attack.
The students had prayed outside the facility Tuesday afternoon and then announced the deaths of the United States and Israel.
A few hundred students at the University of Isfahan in Iran on Tuesday made a living sign around the Isfahan nuclear technology center, where uranium is processed.
They wanted to show that they were willing to protect their country's nuclear program, even with their own lives if necessary.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) recently noted in its report that Iran has apparently not given up on its nuclear weapons efforts.
Israel is also talking about a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
Students had prayed at the entrance to the complex at noon and then announced the deaths of the United States and Israel.
In the event of an attack intended to paralyze Iran's nuclear program to the fullest extent, the Israeli press said the nuclear enrichment plant in the target would also be located in the center of Isfahan.
The menu of a fat kid: He doesn't eat breakfast and he eats sausage for dinner
More than a third of children aged 9 to 13 are overweight, with 9 percent of all students and 5 percent of all children being overweight.
Recent surveys have shown that obese children are mostly from families with unhealthy lifestyles.
This shows once again how important the environment in which a person grows up and the examples around him are for healthy development.
On the tables of obese children, sausages are up to half as often on the table as in families where normal-weight children live.
More than 19 percent of the overweight children had potatoes for dinner the day before the "Obesity is no accident" education campaign.
In families with fat children, sports are not a favorite activity, but they are also a concern for the majority of students today - only 15 percent said their parents have time for active exercise at least once a week.
Survey of 900 children
The survey was conducted at the end of the school year last year and involved almost 900 children from primary schools across the Czech Republic.
This was the second year of the 'Obesity is no coincidence' campaign, supported by the General Health Fund and Unilever.
So far, more than 12 thousand pupils from 4th and 8th grades have taken part in the project.
Unhealthy diet and lack of family activity are key factors that are responsible for the alarming increase in the number of overweight or even obese children.
"For example, only half of the children surveyed reported eating breakfast, lunch, and dinner five times a day - a key requirement for a healthy diet", says one of the survey results.
No breakfast and no sausage for dinner
Experts point out that even relative small things, such as the family's regular breakfast time, are important for a child's healthy development.
In the Czech Republic, however, only 23 percent of the families eat breakfast.
And in most families, everyone eats breakfast on their own.
The worst was the finding that one in ten families does not have breakfast at all.
Breakfast is considered the cornerstone of a healthy daily diet.
The survey showed, among other things, that in families with overweight children, unhealthy potatoes are much more common.
And almost everyone - regardless of weight - drinks sweet lemonade every day (70 percent)
While more than 40 percent of children surveyed do exercise, less than half of their parents do - just 15 percent.
Make your own menu
Another part of the survey allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to draw up their own meal plans based on their appetite and opinion.
"What Czech children between 12 and 15 years old prefer in terms of nutrition is far from the ideal of a healthy diet.
Among her favorite foods were many meals of flour, meat, and, of course, sweets.
"The high popularity of sweet lemonades is particularly alarming", the final report of this survey stresses.
At lunch, the main course, doughnuts were just ahead of poultry.
The children hardly liked legumes at all, and the popularity of fish and vegetable dishes for lunch was very low.
Return to Health
But at the same time, the survey also showed that children are willing to change their eating habits when they are given the right information.
"The control group of respondents who completed the questionnaire following the completion of the 'Obesity is not a coincidence' lecture saw a significant shift in preferences towards healthy eating principles in many cases", the results of the project stated.
This was the case for a moment, for example, in the sweet limos, where many children began to prefer ordinary water.
The children also crossed the questionnaire with much more poultry or fish as the main dish of the day and were willing to eat fewer buns or sweet foods.
Professionals say a stylist must be a good psychologist
In the introductory article on how to learn stylists, I had a little bit of a complaint that this was a little too much material for the start.
I had no idea what was coming.
Lectures by three industry professionals, the dress of problematic figures and a seminar on how "on the spot" works.
It's supposed to get worse.
The closer the examination gets, the more information and practical tasks we have to face.
But even if the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, it's still full.
This time we debated with Director Alena (not a single man takes part in the course) how to attract a woman who does not have an ideal figure.
And most of us are.
Some have a very short neck, others a very young figure with no proper curves, and still others are sloppy.
It is the stylist's job to visually cover up wide shoulders, extend the neck, or create the necessary curves.
We also got tips on how to dress a woman like Jennifer Lopez -- with big boobs, wide hips and a thin waist -- pretty and figurative without being too provocative.
For example, if the difference between waist and hips is so great that the skirt or pants really don't fit, you should at least get a custom cut.
I'm sure you won't regret it, because clothes that fit well are simply priceless.
In such a custom-made skirt, you feel much better than in a stick that always slides up and down, falls down the waist, etc.
Young figures, in turn, can afford to wear clothing with wrinkles, underpants, applications, embroidery or raffles.
With all this information and all these types of characters, I'm glad I have a whole week to get it all in my head.
And yet I'm afraid that given the homework that's on it, it's almost impossible to do.
Each of the students was assigned a celebrity to design appropriate outfits - day and evening clothes.
We should take into account the current appearance, the fashion style of the corresponding star and its figure type.
I'm supposed to be "dressing" Miranda Kerr, who you may know from the Victoria's Secret campaign.
I'm cheering inside, because it's much better for me personally than, say, Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who has gained a hundred pounds lately (well, that's a bit exaggerated), or even the young Selena Gomez.
The clothes are to be cut out of magazines or searched the Internet, printed, and then graphically edited.
The mood board, as the whole result is called, is then to express our very personal style and our relationship to graphic design.
It's very important to think about the graphic side of styling.
The stylist not only attracts the models physically, but also designs the so-called product page in the journals (according to specifications, e.g. trend handbags, coats, etc.).
This is what Mario Kameník, a stylist and designer, told us.
But not until Sunday.
That means a stylist needs to have a good overview.
The Saturday lecture, which included information on the types of figures, was immediately spiced by three industry visitors:
by the stylist Jan Pokorný, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jacob reminded us that fashion is an illusion and that a stylist should be able to take advantage of this.
And a skilled stylist can work with a single piece of clothing in a whole different way.
The magic word is "variability".
So you can wear a trenchcoat, like you usually do, over jeans, like a T-shirt or coat, but you can also wear it on the naked body, put your heel shoes on it and wear it as a dress.
Just squint the sleeve or collar up and the whole look looks different.
"Play with it", he stressed.
But the advice that struck me most was: "First you must know the rules perfectly".
"Only then can you hurt them", Jacob said.
I finally understand why we have to pack all these lessons, what you can combine with what, and why, even though you often see something completely different in fashion magazines.
Not to mention fashion shows.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I now know that a stylist must have prepared far more clothing than he ultimately photographs.
So for a fashion story with 10 pages, you have to be prepared to style at least 15.
And also that the clothes in the photo, combined with other accessories, sometimes look very different than they do in reality.
So all of this is what you have to look for when you design the outfit.
That image and style sometimes make up half of success, Jan Pokorný also confirmed to us.
All you need to do is look at Madonna, a not-so-brilliant singer whose image and marketing have made her a world star.
In the Czech Republic, the services of a stylist are more reserved.
Even celebrities often consider this to be money thrown out (the main thing is that bringing something that looks like me is secondary).
And if any of us are getting styled, then we should expect that he or she is likely to force us to a completely different size than he or she actually needs.
Then you just have to google to see for sure that the tabloid press is saying the celebrity has gone up or down, etc.
Jan and Mario told us on Sunday not to believe that a stylist needs to focus on fashion and then "build" the outfit.
He's got to communicate with the people he's working with, and he's got to be a skilled psychologist.
I'm not going to judge people without being insulted or agreeing with their opinions.
"If some manager orders us to look at her closet and add some pretty stuff, we can't just empty her out of the closet and say, 'Oh my God, that's terrible.'"
"You have to find at least some commendable things to recommend and contribute to", says Mario.
He also showed us in a very concrete way what a so-called "plate bag" must contain.
So, this is a bag that you can button on your waist and carry all the properties you need.
In addition to clear objects such as scissors, hair removal wipers or safety needles, it also contains utensils such as a nylon thread (which helps the stylist photograph products such as handbags or hats), special clips to rub the back of the clothing if it is too large (no needles or other staples to prevent the fabric from breaking) and, of course, sewing.
But so that we could not only listen but also try something practical, we learned how to properly glue shoes.
Even when you're taking pictures in a studio where the floor is flat, you can damage the shoe soles, let alone the outside.
We're sticking and sticking...
You can't even touch your shoes with a scissor, so you don't damage them.
So you really have to be smart.
Mario delighted me by praising my "creation" without limitations.
I'm not exactly a strong man for that skill.
All of this was just a fraction of what we heard on the second weekend continuation course.
One thing I've come to realize is that professional styling is not a child's play.
V Need for Speed: The Run - the illegal race across America
The Commission
The original carefree ride is transformed into a series of completely avoidable dilettant mistakes for routine early shift travel.
The ambitions were largely met, but what good was it if obviously no one wanted to do a little more?
Even before it hit the stores, the new episode, "The Run", raised high expectations.
He promised to move the long-running Need for Speed series back to a new dimension, and in the playable demonstration examples, it didn't actually seem to be just one of many action racing games.
We were also curious about the way the adapted passages, where the main character gets out of the car and continues on foot, work out.
But as you're used to with NFS, the end result is much different than you expected.
- Certainly, it is a decent arcade race, but overall the game is diminished by some superfluous errors that have been present in this series for some years.
So it's not really a mistake anymore, but rather a sign of a basically incomprehensible laziness of game developers.
The adventure is starting very well.
First, you're introduced to the story, whose main character Jack has some personal character problems; the only solution seems to be to participate in an illegal race across America.
In San Francisco, on the West Coast, you get on the wheel of a car, with the task of being the first in New York.
The basic idea is a number of interesting elements.
The entire route is divided into ten stages and more than fifty individual races.
This means that each race is run on a different track and that each stage takes place in a different, sufficiently different and interesting environment.
You don't get the impression that a game will offer the same thing over and over again.
Some environments are still quite beautiful to look at, although the technical level of the graphics does not exceed that of the earlier parts of the series.
So nothing moving.
But traveling through the desert, through autumn landscapes, or up high through deep snow landscapes is visually very pleasant.
Occasionally, unusual elements bring a little variety to the individual races.
In the desert, for example, a desert storm surprises you, which severely limits your vision.
In the mountains, you have to be careful not to get swept away by an avalanche.
In addition, the individual races are well built in one after the other.
A few, but enough.
One time you try to beat the prescribed number of opponents (in principle a classic race), then you have time to catch up (classic race against the clock), then you expect another personal duel with a single opponent.
And the police are also involved, trying to ruin the whole thing.
One of the newest passages is where Jack leaves the car.
It's more about some interactive animation where Jack is running from someone and the player has to help him by pressing the right button at the right moment.
So nothing complicated.
It is surprising, however, that there are far fewer such passages in the game than would be expected (concretely probably only three).
In the end, this is more of an advantage, because at least this element has no chance of becoming boring - it is one of the elements that make the game more varied in the context of the above.
The driving model follows in the footsteps of the previous parts.
That is, from today's point of view, while it does not rip trees off, on the other hand, you could not say it would be bad.
If you're looking for realistic simulations, you'll have to look elsewhere.
But a racing car with action will still be very well suited to the local model, although it could be better than the competition.
Until then, everything is fine.
Real problems don't come up until a certain amount of time.
Unlike the driving model, the collision model is not quite OK.
You can hardly expect a game like this to calculate complicated deformities and collisions, but if you have a pretty good idea of how the car is behaving before you hit an object, obviously, not everything is fine.
Typical example: When you overtake or pass by cars that are in the opposite direction, you may easily "push" the other car in some places, but in other, almost identical situations, you may get into a crash and spin wild pirouettes.
Or the cart will go to waste.
Thanks to the restart system, it doesn't matter anymore, but it's always annoying.
The restarts are solved this way: if you have total damage or land far off the track, you throw the game back to the last clue point of the track.
- Only in every race you have five rebounds.
When you've used them, everything starts from the beginning.
So the restarts are more like a tool, in case something doesn't work, but you shouldn't rely on it.
But sometimes even restarting doesn't help, because nothing else helps but to memorize the critical section.
It's extremely unpleasant that the same things often happen in the same places.
For example, some curves must be followed in a very specific way, or you simply cannot follow them.
In other places, you will always encounter civilian cars in the same configuration, whether you arrive first or fifth, five seconds early or a minute later.
This is especially annoying in situations where you see the opponent passing in front of you playing two opposing cars, but by the time you get there, the cars are already in such a position that you have to drive around or brake them.
And it doesn't matter when you get there, because everything is designed to be so close to your nose.
The competitors have other advantages.
There are a few places in the game where you're always overtaken by the same opponent at the same place and again here regardless of the timing.
The craziest part is that this is the end of the game on the long bridge, which you pass in the opposite direction.
The opponent must obviously outrun one of these guys.
And then, when he's in front of you, he takes your view, so you start driving your car a few times.
- Of course, you want to make the game more exciting and exciting, but that intent is so obvious that it quickly deprives you of the joy of the game.
And that's a shame, because despite the simpler driving model, the game is actually quite entertaining and sometimes so full of action that you almost don't know where your head is.
And basically, no matter what the "guilt" is -- the concept of 50 unique routes, the arrangement of the races in a way that no boredom can occur, or something else entirely...
Another unusual idea is the change of car during the race.
The gas stations on the track should not be overlooked, as this is where you can change the car, although in most cases the car you have right now is enough.
The cars are divided into three categories.
The sports cars are well suited for urban areas, the powerful American limousines for straight highways and exotic super sports cars for technical trips, for example on the slopes in the mountains.
Hand in hand with the game story mode is also the task mode (challenge) - the races in the individual locations known from the story.
Not only medals, but experience points for your own profile, which is common to the tasks (challenges) and history.
To get to the higher driver level, you need to open up different objects: from the car to the background for the profile.
This is also linked to the online Autolog function, which compares its own results with those of other players and also provides additional collective functions.
One of the other unintelligible carvings is a situation in the final race of history.
This is where you get to a subway tunnel by car, where you can ride along the tracks in the dark.
On the Tacho, we see figures between 150 and 200 km/h (by my way), but suddenly a subway comes from behind and runs a road to scrap.
I think we're gonna have a long debate in our editorial office about whether this was a game designer blackout or whether the authors think we're that stupid.
The technical side is not overwhelming but at least the overall visual impression is quite appealing and brilliant here and there.
And what's even more annoying is that at some exciting moments, the frequency of image repetition slows down, and sometimes it's quite dramatic.
This is particularly true in accidents involving a larger number of participants, where continuous FPS is of no use.
The soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In an effort to reach a younger audience on a broad scale, a soundtrack was created "something for everyone" - but who buys such a game because of the music?!
The overall feel of Need for Speed: The Run?
If the game hadn't been reduced by the above-mentioned totally unnecessary errors, we could have said with the breast tone of conviction that The Run is the best piece of NFS in recent years.
But that's how the game looks unfinished.
It's a great pleasure in itself, but you should be prepared to see this error in the eyes with the power of airport lights.
Concert of the "Students of the Silent Revolution" with ensemble singers of Charles University
For the third time, the Festival Festa Academica is offering the celebration of the World Student Day with the anniversary of the Velvet Revolution and music.
During the festival, the choir will perform in the twenty professional and higher education choirs.
The festival will focus on the two concerts on 17 November.
"Charles University has a big stake in the festival".
"The choir of the Faculty of Education and the Faculty of Humanities are also present and the festival committee is chaired by the Rector Václav Hampl", said the head of the organising team, Jakub Čaloun.
The highlight of the festival is the public concert of professional choirs, which will take place on 17 November from 2pm on the square in front of the National Technical Library in Dejvice.
The programme features the composition of the famous Czech jazz musician Karel Růžička "Celebration Jazz Mass".
In the evening, the concert "Students of the Semantic Revolution" (Studenty sametu) takes place in the gallery rooms of the Volkshaus in Vinohrady, where university choirs, including those of the Charles University, perform.
Festa Academica aims not only to celebrate World Student Day in dignity and commemorate the 22nd anniversary of the Velvet Revolution, but also to present choral music at the highest level to the public and to promote the creative cooperation of young people.
The main organiser is the Association of Czech Choirs in cooperation with Johannes-Kepler Gymnasium.
The whole event was sponsored by Bohuslav Svoboda, the mayor of the capital Prague, and Václav Hampl, the rector of Charles University.
The festival will take place from 16 to 20 November in Prague and Pardubice.
In addition to festival concerts, the programme also includes numerous music meetings, student events, matinees and other events.
For more information, please visit the festival website www.festaacademica.cz
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a directive on the protection of workers' rights.
The Czech Republic has a reputation for being a negative and Eurosceptic country.
'The Treaty of Lisbon has made the balance between the institutions felt.'
I never expected such a hard war to break out".
"It will take five or six years for the tide to settle and for everyone to get used to their new role", Milena Vicenová, Czech Ambassador to the European Union, began her lecture at the Faculty of Law.
She showed how seriously she takes the motto "Comprehensible and open about Europe" in the first part of her talk, in which she managed to describe the EU institutions and their relations in such a clear and understandable way that she could have envyed so many lecturers at the Faculty of Law at Charles University.
Mrs Vicenová also commended the new permanent President of the Council of Europe, Herman Van Rompuy:
"At first, criticism was high that he was too unnoticed - a gray official who was not fit for such a role, but I must say it took everyone's breath away from how well he took the matter.
"He is a man who can listen patiently to and communicate with 27 Member States and who has clear ideas about how the EU should proceed.
The new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy was then stated as an answer to the question: Who is the European Union? What number should I call?' as an important step towards a consensus and better readability of EU policies towards countries such as China or India.
No one wants to ban us from our oil refineries
Mrs Vicenová also dedicated herself to the agenda on which the European Union lived, lives and is committed to living in the near future.
The Czech Presidency of two years ago was a success.
The Czech Republic has overcome the financial and gas crises and also hosted the Eastern Partnership Summit.
The fall of the government during the presidency was described as a major negative that had seriously damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU is currently busy.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to the Council and the Commission to ensure that the Commission is able to take action.
And the seven-year EU budget has yet to be approved, which makes the matter much more complicated, especially given the current economic situation.
Whether it is a slim and sparing budget, which sectors are given priority, which countries are more and which are less supported - all this is on the agenda now.
The ambassador also recalls her own slogans when she came to Brussels: "Understanding Europe".
"If I don't like something, it's creepy abbreviations, foreign words, and technical jargon that nobody understands.
How can I as a citizen know whether Brussels is really curved or whether it is making up round cucumbers and bananas of different sizes or whether it is actually trying to ban the quargel?
She would have liked to have used the EU's soil to get more Czechs into European institutions.
Europe of two or different speeds in view
The EU ambassador said the Czechs are reputed to be Eurosceptics, who perceive the negative rather than the positive sides of the issue.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals for a directive on the protection of workers' rights.
This is due to many factors, including the reluctance of our candidates, their inability to write letters of motivation and, last but not least, the weak support of the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech presidency, it also highlighted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group, the V4.
"Believe me, when a Pole or a Hungarian comes to me and a Slovak is nearby, the Frenchman next to me says, 'Hey, what are you doing, sticking your heads together - is that your V4 again?' and makes a pretty acidic noise.
Mrs Vicenové said that the EU expects to have tough rules on budgetary policy in the future.
It is a very real European federation, but it sees the concept of a Europe of two or even different speeds.
"We have the eurozone countries and the countries outside the eurozone.
"We have the Schengen area and we already have the institution of enhanced cooperation".
"For the first time, it was said that only those countries should cooperate who want it and those who do not want it should stand quietly aside".
"There will be more and more such institutions, which will ultimately lead to a strong 'Europe of Various Speeds'", expects Ms Vicenová.
In this respect, it also appreciated the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuyes in the implementation of the principle that all issues with an impact on the whole EU must be discussed by all Member States and not only by the euro area countries.
The story of the fire:
IBM innovator enters the second century of its existence
If you wanted to find a word that would be the most accurate description of IBM's strategy, it would probably be the word "longevity".
To the general public, IBM is synonymous with technological revolution, known as a modern company, even though it's been around for a century.
The foundation for this longevity was laid by its first head, the visionary Thomas J. Watson.
He was already using the slogan that countless global problems could be easily solved if people were willing to think a little bit.
His slogan "Think!" became the trademark for the future giant's life (and at the same time the title of the company's internal magazine, which IBM began publishing in 1935).
This was also the basis of the corporate culture that Watson prepared thoroughly.
"For us at IBM, this long-term thinking is a continuous movement toward the future.
IBM survived and succeeded for a whole century because it remained true to its principles and was not afraid to change everything else around it.
This allowed us to transform technology, business and society throughout our first century.
We hope to create even more in the next hundred years", said Samuel J. Palmisano, the company's current director, on the occasion of the anniversary.
A well-thought-out system
Watson was already providing social care to his employees in the 1930s, similar to the way that the entrepreneur Baťa in Czechoslovakia did: IBM people were among the first American employees to have paid leave, insurance from the entrepreneur plus elegant uniforms as work clothes and a well-thought-out pay system for the best newcomers and merchants.
IBM's long-term relationships with its customers are equally sophisticated.
The company was brilliant in talent promotion from the beginning - one of the first companies in the world to eliminate all discrimination - and was able to choose accordingly.
In line with this anti-discrimination strategy, the current plan is to replace Palmisan at the helm of IBM next year by a woman - Virginia Rometty.
She has been with IBM for 30 years, and has been the Chief Operating Officer, Marketing and Strategy Officer.
IBM has been doing so-called online brainstorming in recent years, which has created many future strategies and innovations.
No wonder - there are enough ideas, because the company employs almost half a million people.
A reputed institution
Their unshakable position in business guarantees the company a strong image both inside and out.
"From the beginning, IBM was more of an institution than a technology company", said Harvard Business School professor and author of a book on IBM, Rosabeth Moss Kanter, an economist.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps solve business problems with technology", added George Colony of consulting firm Forrester Research.
As the company itself points out, there is a difference between being present in the market or shaping it directly through that presence.
IBM -- known in the states as Big Blue because of its logo -- has grown into one of the largest companies in the world in a century.
It's one of the most versatile technology companies ever -- IBM develops hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting and consulting services in an incredible product range -- from servers to nanotechnology.
Of all the American technology companies, IBM holds the most patents, and five of its employees have won the Nobel Prize.
His most famous inventions include ATMs, credit cards, financial swaps, barcodes, and even the floppy disk.
With a market capitalization of approximately US$220 billion, IBM was the second largest technology company this year (after Apple), surpassing Microsoft for the first time since 1996.
The Look Forward
Not all products and innovations were to the tastes of today's customers - unfortunate were, for example, the experiment with their own operating system OS/2, the online service Prodigy or even the computers IBM PC jr.
"Business is about moving forward, so you can't emotionally attach yourself to the past", says Samuel J. Palmisano.
So IBM has no problem building its foundations on different platforms -- and if they don't work, they'll leave it behind.
Unlike Microsoft, which basically stands and falls with its Windows operating system.
The Commission has also adopted a number of proposals for a new framework for the implementation of the programme.
The largest share of IBM's profits is in services, with software and hardware accounting for one fifth of each.
In 1990, hardware was the most represented, accounting for more than 50% of the total.
Since 2000, IBM has sold $15 billion worth of low-income assets, but at the same time, it has invested $58 billion in the purchase of promising technologies.
IBM continued to invest in these investments after 2008, when the recent financial crisis swept the world like a storm for the first time.
Here too, IBM remained true to the legacy of its first CEO, Thomas J. Watson, who increased his investment in the midst of the great global economic crisis.
So far, it seems that IBM is surviving today's crisis unharmed.
IBM shares have risen 120 percent since 2008, and net profit has been growing steadily.
IBM's corporate motto is: Everything can be changed - only values can't.
This is why we can expect this flexible giant to overcome the next crisis.
IBM history: From the cheese cutter to spaceflight
IBM, founded in New York City a hundred years ago, had a rather complicated name at first - Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
It was not until 1924 that the name IBM was adopted - originally a trademark for a branch in Canada and South America.
The foundation stone for the later IBM company was laid by the merger of four companies, whose history dates back to the 1980s.
They had technology such as the famous flashcards to record the start and end of work.
The architect of this new company was Charles Ranlett Flint, who also served as chairman of the supervisory board until 1930.
And it was Flint who hired the head of the competitor firm, Thomas J. Watson, to help him run the company.
This leader even put the founders of IBM in the shadows - Watson's ideas are the basis of the company's unbeatable culture and identity to this day.
Watson ran the company until 1952.
IBM, as the name suggests, began manufacturing and distributing all kinds of machines for commerce - from sausage and cheese cutters to cash machines.
In the first four decades Watson ran the company, he doubled its sales to nine million dollars and the company gradually expanded to all continents.
Watson was so indispensable to the company that he sat in the chair for forty years before his son, Thomas Watson Jr., took his place.
Under his leadership, IBM began work on artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the 1960's, IBM engineers and computers helped NASA fly to space - to Mercury and Saturn, and in 1969 to the famous manned moon.
Meanwhile, in 1964, IBM developed the first computer family with the same computer architecture - the IBM System/360 series.
A classic PC that set the computer standard of the time was introduced in 1981 as the IBM 5150
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, but on the other hand, it bought the consulting stake in PricewaterhouseCoopers and entered fully into the business of consulting and high value added services.
The strategy that IBM has been paying off for the last three years is the concept of a "smart planet".
It is the intention to use technology wisely in areas not even planned, for example to improve the situation in transport and urban administration.
In the commercial sector, IBM recently introduced the "Smart Commerce" platform, which is designed to help retailers manage the entire commercial cycle.
IBM also has a strong history in the Czech Republic.
As early as 1932, IBM established a branch in what was then Czechoslovakia - the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, IBM ČR also operates a strategic outsourcing centre in Brno.
The Central and Eastern Europe Centre is located in Prague and is also home to a world-class research team that deals with voice recognition technology.
Darina Rychtářová about her unfaithful husband:
Iveta, you can keep this donkey, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Rychtářová (53) says - now it's over!
After her husband Josef Rychtář (53) became her lover from Iveta Bartošová's protector (45), Darina still had hope that Joseph would wake up from his pink dream and come home.
But now the patience is finally over and she has set clear rules for the rest of her life.
"Josef can come home, but not more than my partner", explained D. Rychtářová.
When Darina Rychtářová offered refuge to singer I. Bartošová in her own house, she probably would not have dreamed of seeing her husband.
When Iveta moved to Říčany after 30 days, Joseph immediately accompanied her.
Yes, he even publicly confessed to her.
In time, Darina resigned, even as if she wanted to reconcile with her unfaithful husband - but now she finally gave him the pass.
Rychytář doesn't care who his wife sleeps with
If Rychtář Iveta Bartošová should leave in the future, he will certainly not be welcomed at home with open arms.
"He's the biological father of my dreams, and if he wants to end his days in our shared home, I won't chase him out".
"But not as a beloved, lost old donkey, but as a human being to whom I still have certain ties", Mrs Rychtářová said, but she also said that she had already separated from him emotionally and insisted on mutual decency alone.
The fact that Darina locked the back door for him is something Joseph has been treating with dignity.
"I respect my wife's decision".
"I'm staying with Iveta, nothing will change".
"My wife wants a paper marriage, and I respect that".
"The company is running, I'm taking care of the repairs, the garden, the land, I'm doing the shopping".
"I talk to Darina quite normally, but we don't share the bed", said J. Rychtář (to the paper) Blesk.
If Darina wants to find a new love, he doesn't want to stop her.
"We don't sleep together, so I don't care if she has a boyfriend or who.
I realize that this is my fault, I fell in love with Iveta, and that's why I take all responsibility.
The worst female villains, how are you?
When men are asked to name some typical female vices, they are promptly shaking up some.
Dear women, do you recognize yourself in the following lines where we're going to have a few unseated reviews again that make men bleed in their veins?
Purchasing
Does your husband accuse them of being shopkeepers?
Do you have to buy at least one hatcher a week?
You like to go shopping and you can get a little more at the promotions?
Then I guess your case is really a weakness.
Some women are at least aware of this and try to keep their shopping cravings under control.
But just to think, what woman can stand to walk around a clothing store looking for a good-looking outfit and not try on everyone in the cabin?
While shopping is a hobby for most women, for men it is often hell.
Think about how many times you've told your husband you'd rather stay out...
Constant Dissatisfaction
"Am I not too fat?"
"I should lose at least five pounds - should I start jogging or doing gymnastics?"
"Do you even like me?"
Do you think this is familiar?
- You did?
Then you're probably one of those women who's really obsessed with how they look.
This does not mean that you should let go, but many men are allergic to the constant complaining of their wives about their appearance.
The stronger sex agrees - with the increasing frequency of complaints, women are becoming more intolerant.
Order and Cleanliness First
It's a fight against windmills.
Clean windows, wipe tiles and dust, tear the tub - and do this at least twice a week.
Are you mocking your partner for trampling on clean tiles with dirty shoes again, scolding the children for the dirty washbasin just torn off, and for the fingerprints on the glass door in the living room closet, where polishing is so hard?
If you suffer from this kind of deviance, you should know that nothing is to be exaggerated and that family life is not about order and cleanliness.
This immeasurable spirit of purity can ultimately also damage mutual relations and, above all, the peace of the family.
Stitching
"Dirty gym pants come in the laundry basket".
"Are you sure you want to wear your old socks again tomorrow?"
"You can't just throw a wet towel on the floor".
If your partner is subjected to such a prank, do not be surprised that it will upset him.
Of course, that's not a bad idea. They just want everything to be in order.
If men knew this, then women might not have to do so much to get around.
The Commission shall adopt implementing acts in accordance with Article 21 of this Regulation.
Some women like to clap and chat, and then they get spanked or even slandered or you make alliances.
Women are focused on relationships now, so they like to go through things like who, where, with whom, how, and why.
Well, each of us women has a little harmless gossip and crap in store.
Hand on heart, that's a woman's thing.
But this is not to be confused with gossiping, the most rude of calibers, who have nothing and no one sacred, who probably despise everyone around them and who pose a significant danger, especially to women's collectives.
Jagr and Voráček helped Philadelphia win with their assists
Jaromír Jágr, an ice hockey player, was a big part of Philadelphia's 5-3 win over Carolina on the ice in the NHL game on Monday with two assists, making him the most productive Czech player in the NHL.
In both cases, the 39-year-old ice hockey star was seen as a benefit to Claude Giroux, who added an assist and was named the best player of the game.
Jagr's team-mate Jakub Voráček also recorded two assists in the same game.
After the game, Jagr told reporters he had predicted a big night for Giroux.
"Even before the game, I tell him he's gonna get a hat trick today".
I kind of felt that way".
"Sometimes a feeling like this comes over me", explained Jágr, whose action led Giroux to score a goal on the first shot of the Flyers.
A little later, the second hit also had a "Czech track".
Voráček won the Puck behind the Hurricanes' goal and presented it between the circles to the successful Maxim Talbot.
A second before the first third was played, Patrick Dwyer scored a short-hand, but the second third was then returned to the Flyers.
Specifically, Giroux.
In cooperation with Jágr, he scored his third goal, after which Wayne Simmonds directed his shot to the fourth goal.
"I love playing with him".
"I don't want to say he's the best player in the league, but he's definitely one of the best three", Jagr said.
"I never thought I'd end up playing hockey with a player like him".
"I'm very happy about that".
"I'm cutting my game to myself".
"All the years in the NHL, my teammates have been playing me and now the game is over", Jagr smiled.
Carolina made the game more dramatic - with the hits of Tuoma Ruutua and again Dwyer, who made his mark from a penalty shot, came to a goal.
Matt Read avoided any further complications, however, in which he was successful in overtime two to one.
"Pronger was a great player in our zone".
"He caught the puck, I took a ride and (Read) moved to more distant posts".
"I tried to meet him and I'm glad it worked out", Voráček described the last hit of the match from his perspective.
With this victory, Philadelphia took the lead in the Eastern Conference.
Montreal Czech defender Jaroslav Špaček injured himself in a game against Buffalo and was ruled out in the second quarter due to an upper torso injury.
The Candiens also gave their experienced Beck an unbeaten lead in the penalty shoot-out of 2:3.
One of the penalty shots could not be converted by Tomáš Plekanec.
More than the points lost, the home team's coach was probably hurt by the high disease-related failure in the defense - they finished the game with only five defensive players.
"This is bad".
"We ended the game with only one experienced player, the rest were young players".
"But there is nothing we can do about it", said Jacques Martin.
"We had one wave of attack after another and we had nothing to fight back".
"We should have made the game easier and pulled the puck out of our third".
There were still reserves here", said P.K. Subban, one of the defensive players.
Czech goalkeeper Ondřej Pavelec defended thirty shots from Tampa Bay and thus contributed decisively to the 5:2 victory over Winnipeg.
Five different shooters took part in the Jets' goals, which ended a five-game losing streak.
The trend in travel prices since 1989
Until 1989, there were only five authorised state travel agencies in the then-CSSR: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
The travel agencies at the time sold mainly to travel to the socialist Eastern Bloc countries, and only selected travellers were allowed to travel to the West.
And so Czech tourists traveled to the Baltic Sea (the German Democratic Republic - the GDR), to the Soviet Union (Sochi on the Crimean peninsula on the Black Sea), to Bulgaria and Romania on the Black Sea, and to Hungary on the Balaton.
A slight exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when travel to Yugoslavia was also allowed, when Yugoslavia took a pro-Western route and therefore travel to Yugoslavia was severely restricted.
A great paradox of the socialist era was that even citizens of the Eastern Bloc (and thus Czechoslovaks) were not allowed to travel freely within the framework of the socialist countries.
For example, if a citizen of the USSR wanted to travel individually to Poland or even to the Soviet Union, he would need a so-called invitation letter, otherwise individual travel would not be possible.
Even then travel agencies offered to travel west, but then you had to buy giant snakes or sleep in a sleeping bag in front of the travel agency, or at least have "good acquaintances" in the travel agency.
It was still a long time ago.
The so-called currency promise - the condition for leaving for the West - was only given to "politically reliable" people - the others were not allowed to travel at all.
The Czech currency was not a freely convertible currency, so without a currency guarantee it would have been impossible to raise the funds (Western currency) needed for a trip to the West.
So far most Czechs have spent their holidays inland, and it is no wonder that the Czechs have bought countless weekend homes and dacha - a habit that continues to this day.
The 1989 revolution was followed by a Czech travel revolution.
While until 1989 a holiday in the GDR or Bulgaria was the norm, the Czechs spent 4.5 million of their holidays abroad in countries around the world last year.
A huge paradox that is no longer well understood today is the fact that until 1989 one could not travel to the most popular holiday country of the Czech Republic - Croatia - because it was part of Yugoslavia.
As early as the 1990s, the foreign exchange requirement in neighbouring Western European countries was abolished, leading to a huge wave of short visits, especially to Vienna, Austria and Germany.
The Czechoslovaks simply could not get enough of their travels to the West for a long time, everyone wanted to be there for at least a few days.
The Czech holidaymakers who went to Paris slept in tents in the park, because who would have had the money to stay in a hotel or a boarding house?
A typical feature of Czech travel abroad at the time was a suitcase packed with cans, beer and sausage, etc.
Another important milestone was the introduction of the freely convertible Czech crown - after decades our tourists were finally able to freely buy Western currency.
Our standard of living and thus our average wages increased, which marked another important moment in 1997.
The increased demand for travel led travel agencies to start regularly preparing charter flights after 1997, making flights incredibly cheaper than in the past, thanks to the possibility of negotiating discounts.
By the end of the 1990s, the Czechs, with the exception of the United States, had already made currency-free payments with all the highly developed countries of the world, making travel even easier.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-assembly travel came in 2000, when the first direct charter flight to an exotic country was made to Thailand due to high demand.
Since then, direct charter flights with Czech passengers have taken place annually in remote sunny countries; this year, 12 exotic destinations are flown directly from the Czech Republic.
The 100 Tsd. Czechs travel to exotic countries every year!
Another important moment in the epoch that marked our "post-revolutionary" development came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the United States lifted the visa requirement for Czech tourists, making our country definitely one of the most developed countries in the world.
In 2008, for the first time, Czechs spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in their history, they spent more than CZK 15 per person for a single holiday including the cost at the resort.
The General Assembly is to find a new chairman - again a pledge is threatened.
For almost five months, Czech football has had no president and there is a threat that Ivan Hašek's successor at the helm of the Czech Football Association (FAČR) will not be known even after the extraordinary general meeting in Nymburk on Thursday.
The Commission has not yet decided on the electoral procedure.
And without it, there is no vote on the three potential successors.
Three interested parties want to manage Czech football - Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
In June, Hašek resigned from his post, having urged his colleagues to agree and find a strong personality who could lead football in the future.
- It was only in the era after Hašek that the old quarrels broke out again between the two chambers of the Federation, which cannot agree on a common candidate.
This was clearly demonstrated on 16 September when the new chairman was to be elected.
The delegates to the General Assembly had come to the House of Representatives in the Smíchov district of Prague for nothing, because the negotiations were not successful and the vote itself was not the only issue.
The Commission has not yet decided on the basis of the draft budget, but it has already decided on the basis of the draft budget.
On this single point, at least partial agreement was reached, which was also supported by the recommendation of the Institute of State and Law, which considers that representation on a proxy basis is not appropriate.
The dispute over the electoral procedure, however, continues.
The Committee on Budgets has also failed to clarify the matter, and its meetings - regular or extraordinary - are in principle nothing else on the agenda.
Even though the views on the election changed a few times, the neuralgic point remained the same.
The question is, how do you go about the third round to avoid a collision?
"The point of contention is whether to proceed in accordance with the statutes or whether to find a completely different model", said Dušan Svoboda, one of the three vice-presidents of the FAČR, who represents professional football in management.
According to the statutory model, the candidate who receives the highest percentage of support in the chamber for which he is running wins the third round.
Mr. Mahren is reportedly ready to compromise that the candidate who gets the highest number of votes from both chambers wins.
The Czech side, on the other hand, insists that the winner of this percentage vote shall receive at least a two-thirds majority.
"Then the two precedents have no meaning at all, this mode would call into question the whole two-chamber concept", Svoboda understands the objections of the Maharish side, who would prefer not to overturn the electoral code but to vote according to a valid constitution.
Surprisingly, Tomáš Paclík agrees with this, even though it is clear that the constitutional order of elections is most likely to be opposed by Pelta.
"My wish is that the vote be as broadly as possible according to the constitution".
"So that no nonsensical alternatives are devised, as at the last General Assembly", explained Victoria Plzeň, who is running for the first time and who has been particularly clear in her comments against Pelta.
Pelta is optimistic.
He believes that the new chairman will be known in Nymburk and that the candidates will also work constructively together in the future.
"The possible qualification of the national team for the football world cup today would certainly help to calm the minds".
"When football is on the euphoric wave, the willingness to cooperate is also greater", says the Jablonec official, who brings the greatest experience from all three adepts, both at professional and regional level.
Rajchl is more restrained.
"I hope that we can reach an agreement, but the situation is unfortunately mixed".
"This is not a matter of the Bohemians and the Moravians, but there is some effort to 'correct' the rules for their own purposes".
"Therefore, a new blockade at the General Assembly is not excluded".
"I hope, however, that common sense will ultimately win", Rajchl said.
- Only time to agree on all sides is running out.
Some negotiations are supposed to take place directly in Montenegro, but who knows if the football general will be complete by the qualifying match.
The charter plane, which was to fly to Podgorice, among others, with Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl, could not take off in Prague this morning because of a technical failure, and so a feverish search was underway for a replacement variant on how to bring part of the executive committee to the site of the barrage match.
In the end, the meeting at ministerial level, which is supposed to take place on Wednesday, is likely to be decisive.
Josef Dobeš, Minister of Education, Youth and Physical Education, would have liked to have moved the divided parties within the country's largest sports federation to a compromise.
The main thing at stake is government subsidies, the credibility of Czech football and the upcoming general meeting of the Czech Sports Council, which is to give a new direction to Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclík is going into the race for the presidency because he sees no suitable candidate
If Tomáš Paclík, the head of the Pilsner Football Association, had been able to make a strong candidate before the extraordinary general meeting, fulfilling all his expectations of the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR), he would not have engaged in the struggle for this top position at all.
"If there was a good candidate, I would fight for him and not get elected".
"But in the current situation, it was not possible to find such an adept", said Paclík ČTK.
The main reason for Paclík to go into the duel with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchl is to prevent the alleged favorite of the election, Pelta, from reaching the top of the FAČR.
Mr Paclík also stressed that if he wins, he intends to serve as chairman for only one year, i.e. until 2013, the date of the ordinary general meeting.
In the position of chairman, he would have liked to have seen an experienced top manager who is not too involved in football.
"I spoke personally with some of the people in question".
"I can hardly believe that some people told me they didn't want to identify with Czech football at the moment.
"I wish I had changed those views", he said.
Most of all, Paclík is said to be disturbing Pelta's connection with Pilsner County Football Association president Roman Berbr, a man with a controversial reputation who is seen behind the scenes as a powerful lobbyist with the ability to influence delegate votes at major meetings.
For this reason, it is unacceptable for Paclík to have Pelta as chairman.
"If he won, the current state would be preserved and the Czech football would not progress at all".
"The support of Berbr, a clever businessman, was twice as bad for football", Paclík stressed.
He also points out that Pelta's name was linked to telephone conversations to investigate a corruption case some time ago, but that the Pelta was found to be unpunished.
"I don't know what prestige a Pelta victory should bring to football".
"And how would we stand in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA", said said said said said Paclík, who sees his earlier statement, "he will sell the Pilsner football club if Pelta becomes chairman", but already sees it a little more calmly.
If Paclík wins the election on Thursday, he can imagine a future cooperation with Pelta.
Another candidate, Rajchl, who Paclík supported before the October general meeting, ended in a fiasco, also feels the same way.
"He (Pelta) would be the first one I'd go to".
"He has great abilities".
"I could imagine him as the head of the national team".
"But I don't think he's capable of running the association as manager".
"I don't get caught up in things I don't understand", said Paclík, who in September caused a sensation after the dismissal of the arbitration commission with Luďěk Macela at the helm, who replaced Dagmar Damková.
Paclík himself claims to feel fit for the role of the union president.
And he's been a leader of Pilsen since last summer, which, with his support, celebrated its first league victory in May.
"I have the power to change the football environment and to contribute to a certain cultivation of it".
"To limit the influence of certain interest groups that tend to influence disciplinary and appeal commissions, which endures even in disgusting situations", said Paclík, who does not hide his antipathy to, for example, Spartan leader Daniel Křetínský.
He considered strengthening relations between the FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee as one of his priorities, with the help of which he would lobby the top politicians to get more money from the lottery tax into the sport.
"This is one of the most important things the new chairman should be concerned with".
"When it comes to taxing gambling, as the political parties declare, I understand their argument, but they also have to be clear about where the money goes", he said.
Paclík also does not consider his association with the Pilsner club to be a handicap, although he himself stresses that the chairman of the FAČR must be "over-partisan".
Pelta is linked to Jablonec, Rajchl to the Prague Dukla.
"That's not exactly ideal".
"It makes no sense to transfer my shares in the Pilsner Club to a third party in a hypocritical manner and then return after a year and a half", Paclík explained.
Pelta promised new statutes of the FAČR which would rule out a future situation of conflict.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association, one of the candidates for the presidency, Miroslav Pelta, promised that if elected, he would make a strong case for the FAČR to get new statutes that would rule out future disputes over the electoral procedure from the outset.
The Jablonec official is confident of the Nymburk hearing ahead of Thursday and believes that the election campaign will certainly be defused if the Czech election is successful.
Pelta had already promised before the September election that if he were elected he would focus on the national team and raising funds.
He decided at the last moment to participate in the election before the last General Assembly and so the two-month break was to help him defend his ideas about football management and present it in a broader context.
"People at all levels are dedicated to football, they are impatient and therefore expect the chairman to be known on Thursday".
"He feels it's high time the association is run by someone", says the man, who is mainly associated with the Jablonecer club but who also worked for many years at Sparta and on the executive committee.
He also believes that he has sufficient experience to manage Czech football.
He is convinced that the euphoria that prevailed in the days of Ivan Hašek is responsible for today's problems with the election.
"Unfortunately, regulations were adopted at the General Assembly in June, but they were not as perfect as everyone had assumed.
If they had not allowed different interpretations, we would have had a chairman as of September", Pelta said.
He used the revision of the most important document of the citizens' association as a means of attracting the delegates.
"If I become chairman, I will take it personally and be willing to take personal responsibility if it doesn't work".
"This is a principle without which he cannot be", Pelta claims.
Furthermore, he does not try to distance himself from his opponents.
He had already announced that he could envisage a collaboration with Jindřich Rajchl, which he recognizes for his legal education and he knows well that his opponent would be his first deputy.
Tomáš Paclík also stopped attacking for a long time, which in turn did not leave a dry thread on Pelta.
He has been in football for over a year and can already refer to certain achievements".
"But his attacks were demeaning and many people were shocked by his campaign".
"That is why many now doubt his true character", Pelta told his opponent, who is likely to remain true to his declarations made in September.
He believes that his greatest weapon is knowledge of football from the lowest levels of the game to the national team.
And this should be the flagship of Czech football.
"I would also make every effort to end all affairs - from the Bohemian Cause to the aftermath of last year's corruption scandal".
"I would immediately rush to negotiations with the private and public sectors to ensure sufficient funds for the whole of football", the 46-year-old candidate told ČTK two months ago.
He also promised that his entry into the top flight of Czech football would not mean personal clean-ups.
"I should first have to familiarize myself with the content of the work of all employees", he said, heading towards Strahov, where the long anarchy is understandably a source of nervousness.
Despite the disastrous scenarios that accompany the upcoming General Assembly, he believes that the delegates will not travel to Nymburk for free on Thursday.
"If the only issue really is how to vote in the third round, we'll get over it".
"Football needs credibility and it only gains it back when it finally has a new leader", Pelta said, remaining optimistic two days before the potentially crucial day of his official career.
Rajchl promises that the FAČR will start working hard under him
If the former vice-president Jindřich Rajchl were elected as the new chairman of the Czech Football Association at the general meeting on Thursday, it would seem that many people in the association would be out of the mood.
Rajchl promises to work hard if he is elected.
He wants to introduce systemic changes and make the members of the Executive Committee responsible for individual football areas.
He also promised to solve the Bohemians case, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money into football and otherwise continue the work that the previous president, Ivan Hašek, had started.
"As chairman, I want to dedicate myself to football as a whole".
From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA, to national selection, to professional football, to youth football".
"I don't mean that I want to do everything alone", Rajchl said in an interview with ČTK.
"I am a team player and therefore I want to distribute the competencies of the Executive Board in such a way that each member is dedicated to a certain area".
And I'm going to assign hard tasks to make sure that football is moving forward in every segment with milestones".
Many would not be very happy about it, because instead of just criticizing the work of others, they would have to start working really hard themselves", he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement, I have considered not running at all.
"I'm known to work 20 hours a day".
"But I need to know that it makes sense and that people are behind me who don't just keep throwing buttons between my legs and questioning every step I take", he said, explaining why he hesitated.
"But many people told me that I shouldn't give up because others would".
"This is trust that must not be compromised", he said.
It is also said to motivate him to continue the work he started under Hašek.
"We've done a lot of work in two years, and I don't want to just throw it away".
"Processes have been started, which will probably only be in force in a few years and I would hate to see them stopped", he said, expressing his concerns that if the other candidate - Miroslav Pelta - were elected, the situation could return to the pre-Hashek times.
"I believe in systematic approaches, and that's something Mirek Pelta doesn't bring".
"Behind him are people who would make football so that he's only there for the chosen ones".
I may be accused of a number of things, but not of being partisan".
"I try to be objective".
"I want football for everyone because everyone is fine and not just the chosen ones", noted Rajchl.
He also contradicts the claim that he is only a chairman of the Czechs.
"Even if some people say otherwise, I really intend to do the best I can for the morons".
"For example, it is time to consider whether the league should not be divided into a Czech and a Moroccan section, with the winners then promoted to the first division".
"Then it could not happen that today only three Maher clubs play in the league, which is especially a problem for the young players in Maher", Rajchl says.
Now that the head of the Pilsner Club, Tomáš Paclík, has joined the struggle for the presidency, Rajchl is not afraid to assess his chances of being elected.
"I feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has elected me as its vice-chair and now realizes that clear successes lie behind me", said Rajchl, who also sees the savings of tens of millions of crowns for unprofitable contracts, the agreement of television broadcasts and the negotiations on the Lottery Act as his success.
On the other hand, he blames himself in part for the fact that the association does not stick to a single line.
While he says of Pelta that "he was disqualified from the start to help restore confidence in Czech football", he considers the second rival - Paclík - to be a strong candidate who has something to offer football.
"No one can doubt that he did an excellent job in Pilsen in just one year".
"If elected, he would probably continue the things that Ivan Hašek has started and he would obviously not fundamentally change the staffing of the commissions".
He certainly would not want to turn things in his favor", Rajchl says of his rival.
The most beautiful swimming pools in Europe
Jump to blue
By Julia Stanek
Planning pools in UFO optics, magnificent pools in Budapest: If you travel through Europe, you can experience your blue wonder - and after a city tour or a walk, your tired legs can rest in spruce baths.
A book shows where wellness in the water is most beautiful.
When Iris Meder went on a research trip over the past year and a half, one thing was not to be missing in her luggage: her swimsuit.
Leaning back on the water, she looked up into artfully designed domes, swimming to marble whores waiting for her at the edge of the basin, and marveling at carefully restored youth-style swimming pools.
If she liked a bath, she would take it in her notebook - along with some interesting details about the building's architecture and history.
More than 200 swimming pools were explored in this way by architectural historian Meder - and she now presents them in her new book "Badgefreuden": Folk Swimming Halls in Munich, historic bathing palaces in the Black Forest, "Hardcore-Beton Buildings" in the Taunus.
She travelled through 13 countries to visit the most extraordinary baths in Central Europe: Germany, Austria and Switzerland, as well as places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old German is a true swimming culture enthusiast.
She doesn't have much of a mind for sport, says Meder - only in the water is it different.
The only thing annoying is that swimming fans have to get along with blue tiles and chlorine tanks while joggers can breathe the charming scent of fig forests or listen to the cheerful bird whistle in the park.
"I wondered one day why swimming pools always have to be so ugly", says the Vienna-based midwife.
"So I started collecting beautiful baths".
Water surface doubled architecture
The wellness factor in bathrooms is so great because all the senses are served, says Meder.
And when the builders have worked hard, swimming pools can be a real treat: "Instead of a foot floor, bathtubs have a water surface".
"It is transparent on the one hand, but reflects the beauty of the whole building on the other".
Everything doubles visually: high vaults, colorful tiles, jump boards.
The small-format "Badgefreuden" series of 190 pages provides information on the architectural and cultural history of historic wellness oases, but above all it is a blue leap.
Remarkable specimens were discovered by the pool collector Meder during her research in Hungary.
In addition to magnificent thermal baths, such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi Bath in Budapest, she found a nitrate-rich water in a pristine karst cave (a cave bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) and a thermal bath with pools filled with alkaline water and located in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).
On the other hand, many heated open-air baths in Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views: while you can see the whole city from the Zurich rooftop bath, you can look out at the snow-covered Arlberg in the outdoor pool of a bath in St. Anton - and: There is a window in the steam bath from which you can watch the ski slope.
Perhaps the most extraordinary pool design awaits bathers in Längenfeld: the Ötztal Aquadome looks like a UFO landing right in the Alps.
From three open shells it evaporates in winter, while in the background the mountains of the Ötztal reach the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Not every swimming pool was filled with chlorine.
Many thermal baths smell of sulfur, and the Árpád bath in Békescsaba, Hungary, smells of heating oil so bad that it's hard to believe it's landed in a health bath.
The smell comes from the alkaline, hydrogen-carbonated, almost black, healing water whose flavor sticks to your skin as soon as you slip into the pool - a wellness experience of a special kind.
However, Iris Meder was disappointed in her search for beautiful bathing spots at one place: When she wanted to visit the open-air and sunbathing area in the Czech city of Bad Luhatschowitz, she found a locked area.
The bath designed by architect Dušan Jurkovic in 1902 has since been closed.
As she glanced through the weathered windows of the red-white-yellow youth-style building, she saw weeds growing among the tiles.
The decay was countered by a magical swimming pool in the Black Forest, the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
Three phases of construction have already been completed; not only can you discover neo-Romanesque elements from the time of its construction in 1844, but you can also discover a Moorish hall in the Alhambra style, which was added around 1900.
Since its careful modernization in 1995, the Palais Thermal has been the favorite swimming pool of Iris Meder - not only because it originally came from the Black Forest.
"It's an achievement to merge so many different building styles into such a great unit", says Meder.
In such a palace, the plunge into the thermal pool is obviously a matter of convenience.
Agricultural speculation
Deutsche Bank is shining a light on raw materials business
By Christian Teevs
Is Deutsche Bank giving up its agricultural commodities business?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE information, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to examine the consequences of speculation for the world's poor.
In January, the CEO will want to draw consequences.
The Commission shall adopt implementing acts in accordance with Article 21 of this Regulation.
For the German people, the point is clear: 84 percent of Germans find it unacceptable that banks speculate on agricultural commodities such as wheat or corn, according to a study.
Two thirds of respondents say Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions should quit because it exacerbates the problems of the world's poorest.
This is the result of a Forsa survey commissioned by the consumer organisation Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report that Foodwatch presented in mid-October.
In it, author Harald Schumann shows that global commodity exchanges are driving prices up - and that banks are therefore complicit in the global hunger problem.
The consumer protection campaign is specifically directed against Deutsche Bank's CEO Josef Ackermann, even though large banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley are acting similarly.
Originally, commodity betting was designed to protect traders from price fluctuations.
But now most experts agree that the sugar industry has disconnected itself from supply and demand - and is making profits at the expense of the poorest.
Unlike his US competitors, Ackermann responded to the criticism: he promised to examine the allegations and said no business was "worth risking the good reputation of Deutsche Bank".
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is currently examining the allegations in the Foodwatch report.
The audit is expected to be completed by the end of the year, after which the results will be presented to the Deutsche Bank's Management Board, including a recommendation on how to deal with them.
At the end of January, the Bank's management will announce the consequences.
The Commission has already decided to take a decision on the basis of the information provided by the Commission.
Ackermann is making his own image
Foodwatch chief Thilo Bode welcomed the news but also reaffirmed his criticism of the financial industry: "The betting on rising food prices is a particularly dramatic indication of how ruthlessly banks are damaging the public good today".
Ackermann is now particularly committed as a top bank lobbyist.
"Deutsche Bank must remove from its portfolio all investments where money is used to bet on food prices", Bode said.
"Whether Mr Ackermann is concerned with people suffering from hunger or the reputation of the Deutsche Bank".
Ackermann's insight is surprising at first glance, but it is clear that the CEO wants to give a perfect picture a few months before he leaves office.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the CEO will not be transferring to the Supervisory Board, unlike planned.
By turning away from the controversial agrarian speculation, he could improve his image.
And for potential defeats, he hardly needs to shave his hair - which would have to do with his successor.
One in two would cancel raw materials plants
Foodwatch is trying to keep the pressure on the manager.
So far, more than 30,000 Internet users have participated in the organization's campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey, for which the Forsa Institute surveyed 1,001 people on 7 and 8 November.
Only 11% consider that Deutsche Bank is legitimate in offering investments that bet on food prices.
Many bank customers would also face personal consequences if they learned that their bank was involved in such transactions: one in two would quit any investment where money flows into commodity speculation, according to the survey.
43 percent would advise acquaintances of such a bank, 49 percent would consider quitting their account and moving to another institution.
21st house in Vienna
The moved pavilion
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
An architectural history with highs, lows and happy end: The Austrian World Exhibition Pavilion in Brussels in 1958 won awards, became a museum in Vienna, stood empty and camouflaged.
Now it's reopening as an exhibition hall.
If we are surrounded by modern postwar architecture, clear shapes, glass halls, bold swinging and new building materials, typical of the belief in technological progress, then the Austrian pavilion of the architect Karl Schwanzer for the 1958 Brussels World's Fair is a fitting and famous example.
Schwanz's Pavilion won the Grand Prix d'Architecture for its lightweight and floating steel-glass construction.
The building is still considered a milestone in contemporary architecture.
He made the architect so famous that he also built the Austrian Pavilion at the next world exhibition.
With its legendary BMW four-cylinder house plus a shot-like side-building in Munich, it finally became internationally famous in 1973.
Its pavilion, which was planned as a temporary exhibition building, was erected in the Swiss Garden near Vienna's South Station after the World's Fair, was renovated and in 1962 a 20th-century museum was opened there - the "20th House" was named.
The building was neither spatially nor technically suitable as a museum - no walls for hanging art, no good climate.
Nevertheless, it was used for so long that contemporary art in Vienna got a new home.
Since 2001, the building has been empty and has been falling more and more.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has rebuilt the pavilion, now called "House of 21" and will be used in the future as a museum of contemporary art.
Tuesday night, the Belvedere Museum, which houses the house, opens its first exhibition - a lucky one in every way.
The new start was made by Agnes Husslein-Arco, who became the new director of the Austrian Belvedere Gallery in 2007.
Husslein-Arco, a doctoral student in art history with a distinguished career as a young ice artist, later at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and as founding director of the Museum of Modern Salzburg, continued to push for the conversion of politicians and monument patrons, obtaining public and private sponsorship funds and establishing the use.
In addition to contemporary art, the works of sculptor Fritz Wotruba from the same foundation were to be exhibited, there was to be a café and a bookstore, and an office building had to be built for this purpose.
Strict supervision and small budget
The ideal cast for the implementation was Krischanitz.
Not only because he had sensibly rebuilt and expanded Joseph Olbrich's Secession in Vienna and won the competition, but because he had studied at Schwanz at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion was an "unrememberedly important place" for him where he had been "looking at the exhibitions almost every weekend".
He knew the original design, and he knew the problems of the building, which lost its generosity and lightness when it was moved to Vienna and reused.
The current renovation was a much bigger problem: the building was "an energy dump", says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glass façade were replaced, glass fibre reinforced insulating glass was used and the glass roof was replaced by special safety glass.
Cold-bridge steel bearings have been reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled ceilings have been repaired.
Two basements made room for new use, a lowered light trench between the house and the street provides exposure, a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new building, but still the lightweight Swan Pavilion.
The original exterior doors remain, the house is painted in the old red-brown red-colored red-colored.
And the movie theater is still exactly the same as it was before.
And all this under strict supervision of the Monuments Authority and on a small budget.
"Often, a material had to be found that was good and cheap and also liked by the Monuments Protection Office", says Krischanitz, pointing to a rough floor in the basement.
Despite all the constraints, problems and alterations, the building has remained flexible and light.
The pavilion "which came from Brussels" was difficult, Krischanitz recently said, a typical "drop-in-the-city story".
Such an architecture "always stands in the wrong place" and yet "wants to awaken a right awareness".
In this case, the 21st House is not in the wrong place, however, because it is an urban fortune: the entirely newly planned "Highway Headquarters" with office and residential buildings is being built around the Swiss garden.
And another lucky thing may come up: the 21st House could get reinforcement from another Krischanitz building, because the collector Francesca of Habsburg bought the Berlin temporary art gallery, and as you hear, she's already negotiating with the city for a neighboring location in the Swiss garden.
Rail plans a winter crisis package in millions
The railway has put together a crisis plan to prevent additional outages in winter.
The number of employees is to be doubled.
It costs millions.
In the fight against winter-related outages and delays, Deutsche Bahn is spending over 70 million euros this year, according to a newspaper report.
The report also shows that the Commission's financial position is based on the financial position of the Bank and that the Bank is not a financial intermediary.
This would ensure better availability of vehicles and rail networks even in extreme weather.
The Commission has also proposed that the number of employees working in the field of snow removal on railway installations and asphalt tracks should be doubled to 16,000.
The aim is to rid railway tracks of snow and ice and 90% of the necessary routes of operation within four to five hours.
Two months ago, railway manager Rüdiger Grube warned of delays and outages this winter after a summit with government and industry.
The railway had considerable problems in passenger transport last winter, due to a lack of reserves in difficult weather conditions.
For example, many new regional trains have been waiting for years for approval by the Federal Railways Office.
In addition, there is a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The railway has also been making it necessary for years to have axles of ICE trains checked in the workshop significantly more often after an ICE had an axle break at Cologne Central Station.
Deutsche Bank is paying a million-dollar fine in the US
After the riot over Chief Josef Ackermann, a new disaster comes from the United States: the Deutsche Bank must pay a million fines there.
As if the problems at home were not enough for Deutsche Bank, the industry giant is now recovering its past in the US: the Frankfurt Institute is paying a comparison of 145 million dollars (106 million euros) to settle disputes over the bankruptcy of five major cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
It's about selling mortgage papers.
The NCUA accuses a number of large banks of misleading cooperative banks into buying financial products with false promises that they would have downplayed the risks.
These papers lost a lot of value during the financial crisis and plunged the banks into the deep.
"We are satisfied that we were able to resolve the issue without the parties having to go to court", said a German bank spokesman in New York.
The bank did not admit any wrongdoing in the settlement.
The same applies to Citigroup, which committed to pay $20.5 million.
NCUA Chair Debbie Matz welcomed the welcome of the two financial institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for the US cooperative banks and intervenes in the event of bankruptcy to protect customer deposits.
The NCUA is trying to get the billions of dollars worth of damage done.
The comparisons now made are the first of their kind.
The regulator had also taken over other major banks and sued JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs in the summer.
The mortgage securities in question are so-called mortgage-backed securities.
These are based on home loans.
When the US real estate bubble burst in 2007, it caused a lot of financial firms to lose their way.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the US investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Even though the events have been going on for some years, there is a strong wind blowing against the banks in the United States.
Investors and regulators have made countless lawsuits to obtain redress or to suspect wrongdoing.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has triggered the largest wave of lawsuits.
It accuses 18 major international banks of over-privatizing the two US government-owned real estate investors Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in mortgage transactions totaling around $200 billion.
Deutsche Bank also has to submit a complaint to the FHFA, which concerns several transactions worth a total of USD 14,2 billion between 2005 and 2007.
The Authority requires the Frankfurt authorities to report 'substantial losses', without giving an exact amount.
The Deutsche Bank had rejected the claims as unfounded and declared its intention to defend itself.
Warren Buffett is joining IBM with $10 billion.
Finance guru Buffett is investing heavily in the IT company IBM.
Since March, he's bought more than $10 billion worth of stock.
Until now, the great American investor Warren Buffett had always said he would not invest in IT and computer companies because the long-term development of the companies is poorly predicted.
But now he's read IBM's business reports and changed his mind about investing in the industry.
He had to understand a lot earlier that IBM primarily provides services and acquires computer systems for other companies' IT departments.
Warren Buffett's investment is considered a knight's stone in the financial world.
The IT firm IBM is now entitled to call itself "Sir IBM".
Because Buffett just revealed on the US business channel CNBC that he's been buying IBM stock for $10.7 billion since March.
His investment holding Berkshire Hathaway has thus risen to become one of the largest shareholders of IBM with a 5.5 percent stake.
Buffett said that even IBM hadn't heard anything about the commitment until now.
He praised the management, which had still made decent profits even during the economic crisis.
"You did a great job", Buffett said of the strategy.
IBM has long relied on lucrative IT services such as data center operations.
The 100-year-old computer pioneer also offers software and consulting services as well as powerful corporate computers.
Buffett had been more likely to avoid tech companies until now.
He says he only invests in companies that he understands.
Instead, Buffett went to a freight railroad, lubricant manufacturer, or machine builder.
Its holding company Berkshire Hathaway also owns shares in a number of large companies, including Coca-Cola and Munich Re, formerly Munich Re.
The 81-year-old had taken over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and made it one of the most valuable companies in the world with smart investments.
Yet his lifestyle is modest.
He is therefore a cult figure for countless investors around the world.
His almost unyielding sense of making money earned him the nickname "Omaha Oracle".
After Buffett's investment was announced, IBM's stock rose by 1 percent before the stock market.
Big Blue, as IBM is also known, is worth more than $220 billion on the stock market, making it one of the most valuable technology companies in the world, along with Apple and Microsoft.
But he didn't want to join Microsoft, Buffett said.
Bill Gates, the founder, is a close friend.
The threat is tangible
After the discovery of the "Zwickauer cell", Turkish media have doubts about the German rule of law.
One newspaper even speaks of a "bloody ideology" that is now reviving.
The murders of eight Turkish nationals and a Greek small businessman between 2000 and 2006 had a far-right background.
This news is being met with fear and concern in Turkey and among the German-Turkish population in Germany.
For many German Turks, this is a return to a long-held specter: since the fires in Mölln in November 1992 and Solingen in May 1993, there has been no comparable violence against Turks with a right-wing extremist background.
The fact that Germany is hostile to foreigners was never questioned.
The right-wing extremist network exposed, however, reveals dimensions that are long out of sight.
"Is the bloody ideology alive again?" the Internet edition of the Turkish newspaper Haberturk titled.
The newspaper Sabah, on the other hand, stresses that one of the perpetrators is believed to have been a V-man of constitutional protection, and expresses concern that German authorities may also be involved in the radical right-wing swamp.
The Turkish community in Germany reacted particularly: they remembered the victims of racist violence with a vigil outside the Brandenburg Gate at the weekend.
Only two weeks earlier, the Turkish community in Berlin had, together with German and Turkish politicians, planned a celebration of the 50th anniversary of the German-Turkish employment agreement.
In joyful colors, the two had been portrayed together as a success story.
The reporting by some Turkish media seems like a slap in the face: "Germany's Gift to the Fifties" is the title of an article on the Turkish Internet platform "Haver X", which refers to the background of the murder series.
The German edition of the Hurriyet is also not to be taken for granted.
"It's starting to smell", says the title of Ahmet Külahci's column.
He stresses that people were murdered, that they paid taxes and that their work had made a significant contribution to the reconstruction of Germany.
The police's actions and their subsequent success in the search are discussed in German internet forums with great criticism.
The authors wonder why the German authorities did not think of looking for suspects in far-right circles.
Some of them are rhetorically willing to take drastic measures: "If the migrants continue to be locked up, they will have nothing left but self-defense and armament".
"I think that's the best self-defense".
"The goodness of the enlightenment and the appropriateness of the punishment of the entire network are very much the basis for the internal peace in Germany", writes Selen.
What it means when the internal peace in Germany is in danger was illustrated by the attacks of Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s.
The photo of the Solingen fire is deeply rooted in German and Turkish memory.
Because no other event has shown the Turks living here more clearly that there is a tangible threat, and the Germans that mistrust and distance can lead to rightful violence.
The attacks, however, intensified the We sentiment on the Turkish side.
Do not repeat the mistakes of the past
The Turkish press was particularly critical of the failure of German policy following the attacks: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of the Mölln attacks.
After the Solingen fire, he sent a sympathy telegram to the Turkish president, but was represented at the funeral in Cologne by his foreign minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel then listed in his speech how many taxes the local Turks paid.
It's like a person's value is calculated by the amount of their taxes.
The current reporting by the Turkish media shows once again how deeply the mistrust of many Germans in the rule of law has grown since then.
In addition to the efforts to make a comprehensive clarification and reassessment of far-right terrorism in Germany, this time open words are needed.
The scandal bank of Zurich
The most adventurous bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
UBS almost went bankrupt in the financial crisis and has since slipped from one crisis to the next.
Now let a German judge.
I'm sure Axel Weber hadn't thought of it that way.
After his spectacular departure from the top of the Bundesbank, it was announced in July that he would take on an almost equally spectacular new job in 2013: Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Swiss central bank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative career step.
Axel Weber was publicly pleased, praising Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its newfound solidity, and made friendly comments about future colleagues.
"UBS made the turnaround".
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel".
But in September it became clear that things would be different.
A London UBS dealer had bypassed all the bank's security systems and forfeited some 1.7 billion euros.
UBS CEO Oswald Grübel, a not only Swiss-famous banker, had to leave.
The President of the Board of Directors of UBS has since been considered a hit too - and everyone asks: When will Axel Weber finally come?
It was already known that Weber was allowed to consult the bank from February 2012.
And he's taking over as chairman of the board in May, not until 2013, the bank said Tuesday.
It's going to be hard for Axel Weber.
He is not a banker, but an economics professor and a central banker, and he would certainly have needed a period of integration.
With a stroke he then takes over the responsibility for the strategy of a bank that has just once again proven itself to be the "greatest scandal bank in Europe" for a long time.
Because UBS is huge -- until recently, it was the world's largest asset manager -- and it's been slipping from one scandal to the next for years.
Nothing seems to spare the once proud Swiss bank.
It started in the financial crisis.
By 2007, UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of the quiet and solid, but also exuberant Swiss asset manager had combined her with ambitious goals: she wanted to become a big name in investment banking too.
In 2007, UBS managed more assets than any other bank in the world, with $1.6 trillion.
And on the other hand, it was a leading investment bank in the world's largest banks.
That was impressive.
Hans Geiger, a former banker and later a longtime professor of banking in Zurich, says: "I always regarded UBS as a model for a good bank for my students back then".
"From today's perspective, how could I be so wrong?"
He was so wrong.
In 2007, it was first revealed that something was wrong with UBS.
In the middle of the year, CEO Peter Wuffli stepped down surprisingly, who until then was considered a highly intellectual and equally brilliant banker.
A few months later, they wondered why he had left.
The bank's investment division had been sucked into subprime securities and had to write off billions.
To shore up this, UBS announced a capital increase of SAGE 13 billion.
And she actually found investors for that, but some of them had been sneaking around until recently: an opaque Asian state fund from Singapore and an Arab state fund that was so quiet that nobody even knew its name.
But that was only the first blow.
In April 2008, things got worse.
The bank had to declare new billions in losses, and in 2006 the chairman of the board of directors, Marcel Ospel, who was still the second highest paid board of directors in Switzerland, resigned.
In October 2008, the disaster followed: UBS faced collapse in the financial crisis due to its poor investment and had to be rescued by the state.
The National Bank bought UBS for tens of billions of problematic securities, and the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for a forced conversion bond that allowed it to become a co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was shocked - because she noticed how dramatic it is for a small country to have such big banks.
Finally, the balance sheet total of UBS in 2007 was more than five times the economic performance of Switzerland (see chart).
"Once again, we could not save UBS", says banking researcher Geiger.
The first disaster was followed by the second.
A few months later, UBS capitulated in a tax dispute with America and agreed to release the data of wealthy customers who may have cheated on their taxes with the help of the bank.
It also agreed to pay $780 million in restitution of unjustified profits from these transactions, including penalties.
UBS thus admitted more or less openly that it had helped with the tax evasion.
At the same time, she lost something that had always been her capital in competition for wealthy customers: the nimbus of secrecy.
After the scandal, Swiss banking secrets were no longer the same.
The resignation of the Chairman and the President of the Management Board followed.
And the exodus of customer funds.
The Bank lost credibility in both core business areas within a few months: investment banking through miscalculation and wealth management through tax avoidance.
And just as it got a little quieter again, just as you thought UBS was going to get it right, this unfortunate merchant story follows: A single merchant is looting 1.7 billion euros before the bank realizes something is wrong.
And it's obvious that risk management in investment banking is still obviously not working.
"The Adoboli case has shown that risk control has changed too little", says Martin Janssen, economist and finance professor at the Zurich University Banking Institute.
The chief financial officer of a major German bank is also confident: "UBS's problem is that it is not in control of risk control".
It was precisely the idea of caution that the Swiss bankers had long ago taken to become the custodians of the world's great wealth: no too great risks, no security for money - even if the world collapsed beyond the Alpine Republic.
The Swiss bank vaults had become a symbol of unshakable reliability, as Lindt and Sprüngli were for particularly fine chocolate.
The headquarters of UBS in Zurich still fits the cliché of the reputable Swiss private bank - it's only a little bigger.
The situation is already classic.
The bank is headquartered on Zurich Bahnhofstraße, which leads directly from the main station to Lake Zurich, which is surrounded by the snow-capped peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are luxurious, the rents are among the highest in Europe.
Jewelers like Tiffany's are found here among traditional Swiss shops like Sprüngli's.
For centuries, Swiss banks have resided here: from the National Bank to the Credit Suisse Palace to elite private banks like Julius Bear.
You can enter the UBS reception hall through a heavy rotating door.
Inside, the walls are covered with marble, with thick leather chairs in front of them, and a large "safe" sign next to the bank logo.
UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
This idea of the Swiss bank was rejected by both the Swiss major banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, but eventually, as the head of a small Swiss private bank finds it, it was betrayed.
He prefers not to read his name in the newspaper, because he, like all Swiss bankers, is also doing business with the two big banks.
He believes that UBS has become much too big - especially in investment banking, where the fisheries sector has also spread.
The Swiss have nothing left to say.
"And if they do, they've adapted to the customs of the Anglo-Saxons".
In fact, it was the Anglo-Saxon investment banking that changed UBS, first bringing it high profits and then the debacle: no European financial institution has lost as much money in the subprime jungle as the Swiss giant bank.
On October 15, 2008, the disaster became visible.
"That Wednesday, the government coalition of the small seven-million-square-foot country decided on the largest rescue operation in the history of its nation", writes author Lukas Hässig in his book The UBS Crash.
Up to 68 billion francs, or about 45 billion euros, were allocated by the politicians to save the big bank on the brink of bankruptcy.
How did that happen?
If you talk to Swiss bankers, they see the problem primarily in the size of UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three major Swiss banks merged to form a large group.
A bank was created that was too big for the small Switzerland at the time of the merger and continued to grow.
The two different predecessor banks of UBS complemented each other: a wealthy but dormant bank focused on wealth management in Zurich and a poorer but increasingly internationalised bank.
Suddenly, the international investment bankers came up with a lot of money to turn a giant wheel with.
Two names are associated with this rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, Group Chairman of UBS from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then Chairman of the Board.
"I always thought that Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team", says Hans Geiger, a banker.
"Wuffli, the highly intelligent, modest, who knows a lot about models and statistics, and Ospel, the stomach man who worked his way up from banking to the top".
But Ospel finally relied on Wuffli.
And Wuffli probably made a big mistake in the end: "He thought his models were reality", says Geiger.
"This is a tragic case".
Tragic, perhaps.
Obviously, pride came before the case.
UBS employees clearly remember the executive meetings where CEO Wuffli repeatedly issued the same slogan: "Remove Goldman Sachs from the throne".
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank on earth.
She led the "League Tables", the rankings that documented the success of banks at the time.
That's what UBS was trying to do.
She had already taken some steps.
She was at the top of the currency and stock markets.
However, the consultants hired highlighted a weakness: in international interest rates, in the banking language of "fixed income", there is a huge gap with the largest banks.
UBS has gaps in American mortgage products.
To close this gap, UBS embarked on an adventure that nearly cost her her life.
Hungry for growth, both the bank itself and a hedge fund it founded before it invested in American subprime capital.
It developed into a huge machine that packed and distributed securities on American mortgages, but also kept risks.
Even when other banks have been looking for a way out.
"As early as the summer of 2007, when the U.S. real estate market was in flames, UBS bought there", says banking expert Geiger.
The euphoria is so great, the depth of the case.
One manager after another had to go, but the attempts to clean up were harder than expected.
The UBS posts became the headquarters and remain vacant to this day.
Whoever runs the big bank now has a job that's almost impossible.
He needs to come up with a strategy for a bank that has lost all the obvious business models.
Bank researcher Geiger has already come up with an idea: end investment banking, focus on asset management, return to Swiss roots.
The Bank does not want to go this far.
But investment banking is expected to shrink sharply, so much is clear now.
On Thursday, the new bank president, Sergio Ermotti, will present his future strategy to the world.
The 51-year-old Italo Swiss was actually only intended as a transitional solution when the bank unexpectedly split from its predecessors.
He has now made a commitment to run UBS's business permanently, the Zurich Bank said on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants the investment bank back to the mid-1990s.
He's taking 3,500 places off.
But that's not gonna be enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What's she trying to make money with?
These are the questions Axel Weber is probably asking himself right now.
He says he and his wife will first find an apartment in Zurich.
- Next year.
Fear of recession in Europe is burdening US exchanges
The looming recession in Europe has discouraged US investors by the start of the week.
The change of government in Athens and Rome was without effect.
The decline in industrial production on the continent has stifled hopes of stabilizing the debt crisis.
The general relief from the change of government in Rome and Athens was not a success.
The euro fell against the dollar.
The Italian and Greek glass was half full last week, not half empty - but now the problems were once again coming to the fore, said Mark Luschini of Janney Montgomery Scott.
The sales were mainly financial.
The Dow Jones Standard was trading at a negative 0.6 percent at 12,078 points at the close of trading.
The market barometer fluctuated between 12,027 and 12,170 points during the trading period.
The S&P 500 index, which is the most comprehensive, scored 1,251 points, down 1 percent.
The technology exchange Nasdaq lost 0.8 percent and went out of business with 2657 points.
In Frankfurt, the DAX passed 5985 counters by a minus of 1.2%.
Industry in the 17 euro countries has significantly reduced production and is heading towards the end of the boom.
The statistics office Eurostat reported that companies produced 2% less in September than in the previous month.
And that's what US investors were skeptical about: "We're not an island, we're a dependent", said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
Europe will not be able to break free of recession so quickly, and there are further signs of weakness in banks.
Investment legend Warren Buffett only confirmed this caution: It's not clear yet if Europe is strong enough to do anything to end the crisis, he said in a CNBC interview.
The Commission has already decided to take a decision on the basis of the draft budget.
Instead, Buffett threw a decades-old principle over the top and entered the US tech industry.
His investment of more than $10 billion in IBM supported the traditional company's stock price and led it to initially record a slightly higher rate of 1% against the trend in trading.
The paper closed almost unchanged at $187.35.
Buffett has reportedly paid an average of $170 a piece and now owns 5.5 percent.
His investment firm Berkshire Hathaway's stock price dropped 1.3 percent.
Bank of America shares yielded a significantly higher yield than the market, at 2.6 percent.
The house is making almost all of its remaining stake in China Construction Bank and is collecting $6.6 billion.
The institution intends to increase its capital ratio with the net profit from the business and thus to comply with stricter regulatory requirements.
The aircraft manufacturer Boeing added and thereby limited the losses in the Dow.
The stock gained 1.5 percent after the company raised the largest order in its history.
Emirates ordered 50 long-haul 777 aircraft on Sunday and put the order at $18 billion.
Including options for 20 more machines, the volume is even 26 billion dollars.
At the New York Stock Exchange, about 710 million shares changed hands.
719 values were added, 2281 were subtracted and 79 remained unchanged.
At Nasdaq, 630 shares in plus, in minus 1913 and 82 shares in unchanged turnover of 1.38 billion were closed.
Smart crows are spreading in cities
In many places, seeds are considered "problem birds", but experts say that the highly intelligent animals can no longer be driven from the cities.
Some people like it, others want to get rid of it quickly: Crow has been part of the city for centuries, but in many communities people are increasingly complaining about dirt and animal noise.
A solution to the problem of the "problem birds" is not yet in sight.
The first East Frisian crow symposium was held in the towns and cities.
There, experts from all over the Federal Republic of Germany are advising on possible ways out.
They're looking for alternatives in cities.
The problem in cities was also attributed to the flight of the particularly protected crops: the use of chemicals in agriculture is increasingly destroying traditional habitats.
Hunting, increasing cultivation, and the falling of typical breeding trees made life difficult for the birds.
Crows are protected.
Large colonies with more than 600 breeding pairs are found in Soest, Westphalia, Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen, and Vaer, among others, in the northwest.
In 2005, a controversial project to mass kill crows in the county made headlines.
Critics have described catching animals in bird traps and beating them with clubs as particularly brutal.
"Normal eviction, the displacement, does not bring anything", noted urban and landscape planner Werner Klöver from vacuum.
Injecting nests with water or falling trees often has unwanted consequences, said environmentalist Manfred Kaiser of Lahr, Baden-Württemberg.
"The animals are drifting out, large colonies are splitting up and spreading elsewhere".
The Commission has already decided to take a decision on the following:
"We have to live with them, we can't get them out of here".
Without the surroundings, the problem in the cities cannot be solved, said Mayor Wolfgang Kellner from Voir.
It is conceivable that a combination of harvesting animals from sensitive areas and offering to resettle them elsewhere would be possible.
"Infoboards instead of chain sacks", on the other hand, psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens advocated a completely different approach to animals: "A pimple in the face is the best thing we can endure with confidence".
Jürgens had co-founded the Ascheberger Crow Learning Trail in Schleswig-Holstein, where signs inform about the life of highly intelligent seed crows.
The project is now already accepted by tourists.
Also, regarding the criticism of the birds' noise, Jürgens had his own opinion: "There is a lot of communication, which has a lot to say".
The intelligence and skill of animals are legendary: not only do seeds use tools to get a treat, but they even make their own tools as a tool.
Behavioral researchers at Cambridge University recently tested the intelligence of birds on four seed crows.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to use stones to bring down a scaffold to reach a moth larva.
Without much training, they determined the size and shape a stone must have to let the platform collapse.
In a second attempt, the sharp crows then had to solve a more tricky problem.
In a cylinder that was set up vertically, the researchers had placed a small bucket of mottled larvae.
The bird could not reach its prey with the beak.
However, the researchers had wired them.
All four animals made a hook from it, and then they used it to catch the jar from the tube.
Three of the four seed cranes even did this instantly.
Cristiano Ronaldo is shooting for Portugal at the 2012 World Cup
The hopes of the Bosnians and Turks for a coup remained.
The favourites are Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and Ireland, who are also in the 2012 European Championship.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have all sold out the last tickets to the 2012 European Championship in Poland and Ukraine in the play-offs.
Led by double-winning superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8, 53, Portugal beat Bosnia and Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and made their fifth consecutive European Championship appearance perfect after a 0-0 draw.
The Czech side were defeated by Montenegro in the play-offs by a score of 1:0 (0:0), after the draw (2:0) had already been a clear matter.
Croatia also lost to Turkey 0:0 and Ireland lost to Estonia 1-1.
The following goals were scored for Portugal: Nani (24), Helder Postiga (72, 82) and Miguel Veloso (80).
Former Wolfsburg Bundesliga pro Zvjezdan Misimovic with a converted hand-meter (41) and captain Emir Spahic (65) had shortened for Bosnia twice.
Sena Lulic saw the yellow-red card (54).
Bosnia had already lost to Portugal in the 2010 World Cup play-offs in South Africa.
Portugal took a customary start at the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon.
Ronaldo chased a free throw from about 30 meters to the early lead in the masses.
A good quarter of an hour later, Nani showed his great shooting skills and made it 2-0 from 25 meters.
The Bosnians, who missed the first half hour, had their first clear shot by goalkeeper Edin Dzeko.
The former Wolfsburg player from Manchester City put a headball on the bottom of the latte, but the ball did not cross the goal line (33).
Jiracek is playing for the Czech Republic
Afterwards, the focus was on the referee Wolfgang Stark of Ergolding.
After an attack on hero Postiga in the Bosnian penal colony, Stark decided to go to Swalbe and showed the Portuguese the yellow card (36).
On the other hand, Stark gave a controversial hand meter after an action by Fabio Coentrao, whom Misimovic was sure to turn.
But after the break, the 2004 vice-champion of Europe made four hits clear.
For the Czech Republic, Petr Jiracek ended the last doubts in the 81st minute.
The 1976 European champion is now heading for the European Championship for the fifth time in a row.
However, the team of coach Michal Bilek with the Bundesliga league champions Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1 FC Nuremberg) was also lucky and had to survive a scary second in the initial phase.
Last man Petr Cech with a reflex prevented a possible owner by Tomas Sivok (9.).
Montenegro had its greatest opportunities when the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic shot from the penalty line in the 40th minute just a short distance past the Cech gate.
After the break, the cross-country team had to save the Czechs' already-hit world-class record, and the striker of FC Seoul had again withdrawn (50).
The gate just before the end finally made everything clear.
Turkey has missed the Zagreb football miracle.
Four days after the 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb did not go beyond a 0:0.
While national coach Guus Hiddink is now forced to leave the bench for the 2002 World Cup third, the Croats are happy to be in the fourth round of the European Championship.
In front of 31,000 spectators at the Maxim Stadium, the Turks almost had a dream start.
Selcuk Inan hit the post with a distance shot in the seventh minute, attacker Kazim Kazim could not sink the shooter in the gate.
But after the second of terror, Croatia took over more and more.
Even after the break, the Croats didn't let anything burn.
In addition to Mario Mandzukic of VfL Wolfsburg, who made a place for Dortmund's Ivan Perisic from the 62nd minute, the Bundesliga league players Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) were also in the squad.
Trapattoni is heading to EM
In Dublin, the Irish celebrated their first European Championship in Germany since 1988.
Stephen Ward led the team led by coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who had already secured a pre-selection with a 4-0 win in the innings, in the 32nd minute.
Konstantin Vassilyev (57) was outstanding to the guests.
Ireland pressed the pace from the start, but had to wait until the 23rd minute before Robbie Keane of the Los Angeles Galaxy got his first good shot.
Only at the last moment did the Estonian rear team prevent the possible lead shot.
But it was time in the 32nd minute.
After an unsuccessful defense by quarterback Pavel Londak, Ward was on the scene, pushing the ball to 1-0 over the line.

SAP aims to double the number of employees in China
Europe's largest software company, SAP, is investing billions in China in the next few years and is aiming to almost double its workforce in the country.
By 2015, the Dax Group is expected to have around two billion dollars (about 1.5 billion euros) in cash, the company said on Tuesday.
"We will create additional R&D facilities and recruit employees accordingly", Co-Chief Bill McDermott announced at a customer exhibition in Beijing.
The workforce is expected to grow from about 2500 to 4500 employees.
The number of branches of the world leader in enterprise software will double from five to 10 or 11.
SAP is currently present in Beijing, Shanghai, Guanzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
Approximately 4,000 of SAP's 176,000+ customers worldwide are in the booming country.
The growth plans in China are also an important building block of the Dax Group's 2015 strategy.
SAP intends to increase sales to EUR 20 billion by 2015.
Last year, the Walldorfer family had earned about 12.5 billion euros.
The software provider, which employs 55,000 people worldwide, is now running almost as rarely as ever.
SAP has been active in China for 20 years.
"Now we want to expand our activities (...) " McDermott explained.
"Our goal is to promote sustainable growth in China, supported by comprehensive education".
Mass slaughter at a personal level
With compassion and generosity, Peter Englund's new book "Beauty and Horror: A History of World War I, Told in Nineteen Fates" begins with a long list of key characters that will touch your heart.
Here's a tip for how to do it: Cut this page out carefully and make it your reading mark.
You'll get to know these people very well in Englund's novel, and these protagonists will act as your GPS, as a beacon of light in these few moments when you, like Englund's men and women, are lost in the fog of war and stripped of your illusions.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which decides the Nobel Prize for Literature.
He wrote an unusual book, which he aptly describes as "a work of anti-history".
It contains few big names, important treaties or famous battles, there are few ambassadors, angry reporters, or discussions about tactics and equipment.
He explains that it is not a book about what happened, but rather "a book about how it was".
"Beauty and horror" is almost the war experiences of 20 more or less unremarkable men and women on both sides of the war, from school girls and botanists to mountaineers, doctors, ambulance drivers and office workers.
Some of these people become heroes.
Some become prisoners of war, lose limbs, go crazy or die.
Each of these lives flashes like votive candles in a church, some adding while others extinguishing.
Englund's book is different from the usual history books.
It also corrects the notion that the First World War was only the devastating position war on the Western Front.
"Beauty and horror" travels with expertise through other war sites: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book are being hit by bees, one celebrating Christmas under the pyramids in Egypt, tsetse flies are an unsolvable problem.
This is a moving book from the very beginning.
War is flooding these people's lives like a natural disaster, like Hurricane Katrina smelling like Cordit.
Imagine you're a woman at home with her children and you hear gunfire in the distance.
Who's coming?
Hardly anyone understands what's happening or why this war is being waged at all.
"The missing facts", notes Englund, "were filled with assumptions, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares, and rumors".
"Beauty and horror" follows individuals like Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German sailor.
Her stories were mainly based on memories, letters and other material that had already been published.
Their biographies may be frightening or moving, but they are extremely vivid in the englund of the lost-details collection of little moments.
Many of them are about want and self-help.
In the story of a German schoolgirl, he tells us, "Replacement, replacement everywhere".
"Replacement coffee, fake aluminum, fake radiator rubber, paper bands, wood buttons".
He's telling me more about the substitute food in Germany.
It describes "meat made of pressed rice and baked in hammelfett (and most recently served with a fake wood bone), tobacco made of dried roots and dried potato shells, shoes that were covered with wood".
He noted that there were "837 registered food substitutes that were allowed in the making of sausages, 511 registered coffee substitutes".
Some stories are about honor and bravery.
An American recognizes his own urge for savagery and says of war: "You feel that this is, after all, what was meant for men rather than sitting in a chair, with the evening paper or the bestseller and a cigarette and a whiskey in hand, and acting as if such a facade meant civilization and as if there was no barbarism behind their own strengthened and cramped shirt chest".
Conversely, a British soldier realizes that he is likely to die and no one will take notice or take care of it.
"If you're turning away from the idea of self-sacrifice, you want to think it's in front of an audience", he writes.
Instead, it is as terrible as "a condemned man who was hanged in secret".
Other observations concern the old Europe, which is falling apart, and new forms of terror.
"The conflict became increasingly an economic contest", Englund writes, "a war between factories".
He captures the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the still young century's bestiary": "the word-worn, ideologically convinced mass murderer in a scale suit who slaughters while sitting behind a desk".
People behave in unpredictable ways and there is as much frivolous behavior as heroism.
Englund discusses the soldiers who actively tried to infect themselves with a sexually transmitted disease prostitute in order to escape frontal service.
"The grotesque expression of this can be found in the trade in gonococcal dung, for soldiers bought and lubricated their genitals in the hope of getting to the hospital", he writes.
"Those who were really desperate rubbed him in the eye, which led to blindness for the rest of their lives".
In this translation from Swedish by Peter Graves, Englund's poetry becomes flexible yet unobtrusive and perfectly suits his human task.
In dozens of small scenes, he captures the way war "unleashed forces that were uncontrollable in a unique way: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred".
People are starting to wonder why their leaders are bringing them to battle.
The best books about World War I were mostly falsified, like Paul Fussell's Great War and Modern Memory, or novels like Erich Maria Remarque's Nothing New in the West, rather than extensive history books.
Englund's band is joining an unconventional hall of fame.
His book has the most devastating ending I've ever read in a science book.
I'm not giving it away anymore.
But it's like he took this page of the main characters out of our noses with his book and lit it with a match.
After an early failure, a carefully planned attack
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them wearing helmets.
The decision was made to go from Monday to Tuesday night because there were hardly any people in Zucotti Park at that time.
The operation was kept secret and only a few senior officials were informed.
Police Chief Raymond W. Kelly was among them, and his presence highlighted the fact that the operation was fraught with challenges.
The events of the past few weeks, such as the use of pepper spray against protesters, which violates the rules of the department and has given the owners of the house a huge increase in public sympathy, were not allowed to happen again.
And so the police action to remove the protesters from Zuccotti Park was carried out after two weeks of planning and training.
Officials had prepared these by observing the occupation of other cities.
A disaster drill had been held with a look at Zuccotti on Randall Island.
Officials have stepped up the so-called Chaos training - counterterrorism measures, including the rapid deployment of a large number of police officers - to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training session was held Monday night on the East River side of Manhattan.
The order to move into the park came "at the last minute", said someone familiar with the orders, calling it "exercise".
"The few police officers involved, as far as I know, didn't know it was the Zuccotti Park", said someone who wants to remain anonymous.
"The only people who knew it was the Zuccotti Park were the senior officials of the resort".
One reason for keeping it a secret was a lesson the city had learned.
On October 14, officials tried to clear the park, but backed down when hundreds of protesters gathered after learning of these plans.
Officials from various police units were involved in the operation on Tuesday, including task forces from across the city - hundreds of mobile officers who are usually deployed in high-crime neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly said that during the day, many people come and go in the park, almost like commuters, so 1:00 a.m. is a good time to get in.
"It was appropriate to do this when the least number of people were in the park", he said.
Emergency vehicles with Jupiter lights and speakers were ready for the descent at Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive near the Manhattan Bridge.
The lamps and the pre-recorded messages that came from the speakers seemed to intimidate many protesters.
When the public officials in their bright blue wind jackets entered the park, many protesters simply packed their things and left the place.
Police said no tents would be touched until 1:45 a.m. to give protesters time to pack their belongings.
Other teams of officers were seen gathering in the area to intervene should arrests in the park become necessary.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Paul J. Browne, spokesman for the police chief, said this was done for their own safety.
But many journalists claim that they were prevented from watching the police action in the park, and they said the officials were very rude.
Mr. Browne said that TVs on Church Street on the west side of the park could have taken pictures.
As the police moved westward through the great confusion of the protesters' personal belongings, including suitcases, art trays, and bags of clothes, their city cleaners followed, picking up what had been left behind.
Some protesters who refused to leave were dragged outside, and pictures of them were posted on the Internet shortly after.
A major core of protesters moved near the camp's kitchen area in the center of the park.
Some of them erected barriers and the police continued their methodical arrests.
About 10 people in the camp's epicenter were tied together by their arms.
And two people chained themselves to trees, Mr. Kelly said.
Disaster protection officials were called in to cut them off.
As Mr Kelly said, no arrests were made in the park until about 3:30 a.m.
The evacuation was completed after 75 minutes, according to police.
Mr. Browne said 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of the arrests, he said, were due to "inappropriate behaviour and resistance to arrest".
The most prominent official on the scene was Joseph J. Esposito, the department's chief, the department's highest uniformed officer.
Phil T. Pulaski, chief of the Criminal Division, was also there.
Despite his presence, Mr Kelly "did not lead the operation", as Mr Browne said.
In case they had to access, a second group of officers was waiting on the east side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Street.
Barricades were erected on Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and Pine Street, a block further south.
From these locations, the police could be seen extending the circle around the Zuccotti Park.
In one place, several officials, many of them with safety signs, were seen driving people out.
About 28 people were in the northern circle.
Some of the most violent actions of the night took place in the south of the park.
Around 5 a.m. south of Pine Street, a protester jumped onto the roof of a police vehicle and other protesters blew air from the tire of a police bus.
Somewhere the crowd threw a piece of log.
Eventually, an official and a protestor came to the hospital.
The union of carers will sue the city for redundancies
The union, which represents hundreds of school administrators who lost their jobs last month, plans to sue the city on Wednesday because the layoffs are not necessary and discriminatory because of their inappropriate influence on schools that educate poor students.
The lawsuit is probably the last option the union, District Council 37, still has in its efforts to reverse the redundancies.
Six hundred and seventy-two school helpers, care coordinators and other employees, who were among the city's worst paid employees and lost their jobs in a cheating raid on October 7, described the union leader as political retaliation for last year's denial of access to a health fund maintained by the working groups to close the budget gap.
The authorities categorically rejected this accusation.
At a city council hearing last month, Dennis M. Walcott, principal of the schools, said the layoffs were part of the budget passed in June.
A member of the city council responded by explaining that the budget did not specify that school assistants would be dismissed.
City Council officials 37 said they had and warned the Department of Education of a lawsuit, and there will be a press conference on Wednesday to formally announce the filing of the lawsuit before the Manhattan Supreme Court.
The lawsuit will bring Mr. Walcott and the city's Department of Education as defendants and count eight dismissed workers as plaintiffs, all of whom are black or Latin American women, like most of the helpers who lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the city's Justice Department, said the city did not file the lawsuit and could not comment on their individual claims.
According to a draft lawsuit in the New York Times, the union focused on the number of layoffs in schools in the city's slums to support a class action lawsuit alleging poor schools would have lost more helpers because they were chronically underfunded.
She explains that while there were no layoffs on Staten Island and few layoffs in Upper East Side or TriBeCa schools, 17 school helpers lost in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 helpers were laid off in Districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
Noting the loss of five out of eight school helpers employed at public school 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the lawsuit says: "This is not a neighborhood of concerned parents who can organize donations to capture budget cuts".
P.S.: The 36th District's budget was cut by 3.26 percent this year, and money was lost when the city changed its method of calculating extra funding for every poor school enrollment.
The union also complained that the language of a memorandum authorizing the dismissal of the supervision coordinators had led the heads of the high schools astray.
The memo used the English word "excess" to describe the action, although "excess" in the US usually describes a teacher's move from a school's payroll to a pool of available workers paid by the central office.
"Sixty-six supervisory coordinators were dismissed, not transferred", says the draft lawsuit.
Mission completed, Congress ready to agree on Libya
It looks like the Republicans and Democrats in Washington are finally getting along on the Libyan insurgency.
All that was needed was the success of the revolt, the arrest and murder of longtime dictator Muammar Gaddafi, and the end of American interference.
On Thursday, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee adopted a resolution under which President John Kerry (Massachusetts) along with Senators John McCain (Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Connecticut) praised Libya for its successful rebellion and the U.S. troops for their "courage".
"This resolution honors the brave people of Libya who have begun to rebuild their country", Kerry said.
"It is a confirmation of the support of their democratic efforts by two parties".
The language may sound innocent, but nothing has been easy in the Libyan debate until now.
This summer, lawmakers from both parties and the White House debated whether to vote on a series of resolutions approving or disappropriating the role of the US military in NATO's Libya mission.
In June, Kerry and McCain introduced a resolution authorizing the limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
The bill was rejected in the Senate by a broad marginal group of both parties and did not pass.
But on the same day, this bill passed the Senate, and the House also passed a resolution to cut funding for American operations in Libya.
This has led the US mission to a kind of legislative purgatory -- with a Congress that was angry enough to criticize Obama's actions on the mission, but not angry enough to finally pull the dust off his feet.
Then the uncertainty of the Congress was overshadowed by the events.
Tripoli fell to Libyan rebels in August and Gaddafi was killed on October 20.
The NATO mission officially ended on October 31.
Now the Senate may be ready to act.
The resolution of the International Relations Committee "congratulates the people of Libya on their tremendous courage and extraordinary perseverance in self-liberation" and "commends the men and women of the U.S. military and their coalition partners who support military operations to protect the people of Libya for their extraordinary courage and professionalism".
The resolution also reaffirms the United States' national interests in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya.
Will the new measures be fully supported by the Foreign Relations Board or will they divide the legislatures, as the June law did?
The final version is opposed by Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indianapolis), the committee's top Republican.
Lugars' spokesman said on Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new law.
Capitol said it's up to the Senate to vote this week on a constitutional amendment that calls for a balanced budget, a top priority in almost every congressional term for Republicans and some Democrats.
The measures, led by Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment to the budget or any other area to be voted on in the Senate or Congress.
Other legislators have so far tried unsuccessfully to put their amendments to the vote, although they have tried often enough.
Goodlat's amendment is just one of 68 constitutional amendments introduced to this Congress and covers a wide range of topics.
Some are double - the same law has been introduced to both Congress and the Senate - others just slightly deviate from each other.
There are at least 15 versions of the balance sheet amendment in the Senate alone and another dozen that would "control federal spending".
Some of the laws are also identical, but they give their clients - especially beginners among Republicans who want to polish their resume - the opportunity to boast that they have "written" such a measure.
The Budget Control Act, passed in August, requires both the Senate and Congress to vote on a budgetary balance change.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment.
In addition to the budget, some members want to limit the number of provisions that members of Congress can submit, while the Republican José E. Serrano (New York) wants to lift the limit to two terms of office for the president.
Republican Jesse L. Jackson (Illinois) has proposed a number of amendments that guarantee, among other things, the right to good education and health care.
A change that prohibits same-sex marriage is a recurring proposition, just as an amendment that prohibits burning flags is.
Some legislators also want to allow the repeal of federal laws if two-thirds of the states reject them.
The Members are as eager as they are to propose changes, but they are moving at a different pace than in previous years.
In the 111th Congress, lawmakers introduced 77 such amendments. In the 110th Congress, 66 were introduced.
The pace is waning compared with the early 1990s, when members regularly proposed more than 150 amendments every two years, according to figures provided by the Senate Library.
But they were not much more successful than today.
The last amendment to be added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992, but was actually proposed to Congress as early as 1789.
"Meet but not defeated", Giffords said in the first TV interview after the assassination.
Ten months after a gunman from nearby Tucson shot her during an election campaign, Republican Gabrielle Gifffords (Arizona) appeared on national television Monday night singing alone for the Broadway play "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and said that her desire to recover was greater than returning to Congress.
When she appeared on ABC's "20/20" with Diane Sawyer, she was rushing for words and needed walking help.
The show showed the heavy slow recovery from the damage caused by the bullet that divided her skull, pierced the left side of her brain, and crossed her head from front to back.
Three months ago, she returned to Congress unexpectedly to vote triumphantly for the debt curb.
In her first television interview after the January assassination, in which six people were killed and 13 injured, Gifford smiled, laughed and sang - describing her recovery as "difficult".
When Sawyer asked her how she was feeling, Gifford (41) replied, "All right".
The interview with Gifford and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a one-hour "20/20" special recorded just before the couple's new book, Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope, was released.
The special is following Gifford's recovery since the January 8th assassination.
In the videos Kelly recorded in the first few weeks, you can see her in a hospital bed, with a bald shaved head and a long scarf over her forehead.
She can only lift a finger or two if her husband encourages her to do so.
Months later, Giffords is in a wheelchair, while therapists show her how to perform simple movements.
A head-on.
A cough with the lips.
And then, her first words, "What".
A few days later, Giffords whispers another word, "toast". She wants her breakfast changed.
Videos played on the ABC show show show that music played a major role in Giffords' recovery: You can see the congressmen sing along with the therapists to Cyndi Lauper's "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" and Tom Petty's "Free Fallin'".
In an interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who spends two hours a day in therapy, said she can't remember the day of the murder.
Her husband said he had read Gifford's March 12 newspaper article about the assassination when she interrupted him and asked for the first time about the six people who were killed during the assassination.
The alleged gunman, Jared Lee Loughner, is in a Missouri prison and is being forced to undergo medical treatment while awaiting trial.
"Many people have died", Gifford's Sawyer told us.
"Hard, hard, hard".
During the recovery, his wife, Kelly Sawyer said, said, "I got hit".
"So, I would say, 'Gabby, you weren't defeated'?" said Kelly.
You just got hit.
And you're gonna get through this and you're gonna recover and you're gonna come back stronger than ever.
Troops are more likely to feel pity than respect
The event was a Wall Street gala that raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, frustration and loss.
A hundred soldiers, sailors, pilots and marines gathered around him.
The crowd in black tubs stood up and applauded.
"The soldiers and women were seen as heroes", said David Saltzman, who organized the spring fundraising.
A senior military officer at the gala, who was observed by, among others, the chief of staff and then chairman, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops differently.
"They were introduced as orphans", the officer wrote in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers meant well.
I know that.
But it wasn't respect, really not.
The starkly contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationship between the military and the mostly distant, sometimes admiring American public.
The troops are overwhelmed with praise for their sacrifices.
But praise comes at a price, officials say.
The public is increasingly acting as if they were suffering people in uniform.
"We were no victims", said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and will soon be heading to Afghanistan.
"But apparently the only way to support them is to push us into the role of unhappy souls".
The issue is extremely sensitive for military leaders who do not want to appear ungrateful or at odds with the public they serve.
They also realized that the anger that was felt against the returning troops in the final years of the Vietnam War was far worse.
As a result, there are conversations about compassion in private and in private between war veterans.
After his two sons returned from fighting with the Marines, Colonel A.D. Mark Cancian warned them that people outside the military world could view their service from two different perspectives.
Some would look upon them with a sense of awe as they had defeated rebels and traveled to exotic places.
Others would wonder if a "angry, violent veteran" is hiding under the surface, said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to a prominent position in Washington.
During his job search, he said, he felt that some of the respondents were subtly asking if he was able to withstand the pressure of a demanding post in Washington right after he returned from the fight.
"When you talk about your ministry, you have to resist the negative impressions", Cancian explained to his sons.
The lack of ease of the military is partly due to the lack of interest in the war by the Americans.
Achievements on the battlefield are rarely praised by a country that has little military experience and sees little use in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"We as a nation no longer value military heroism as it was in the Second World War", said Lieutenant General David Barno, a.D., who commanded U.S. forces in Afghanistan.
Instead, the praise of politicians and the public is largely focused on the suffering of a service member.
Troops are recognized for the number of attacks they have endured, the number of friends they have lost, or the severity of their injuries.
The military is facing increasing pressure to crack down on rape
This week, a major hearing is set to decide whether 28 women and men will be charged with non-interference in a rape case before a military court.
If it doesn't, hundreds of plaintiffs are ready for the next hearing.
Colonel Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and 11 weeks pregnant when she was raped by a fellow soldier at night.
It was October 2008, and she was just returning to her barracks in Miramar, north of San Diego, from dinner with a friend when she met a male colleague who was carrying a 12-pack of beer.
He asked if he could accompany her to her room for a drink.
"My alarm bells were ringing", Lyman said.
But the Texan wiped her fears aside.
I thought, "Oh, he's 19.
He's from Texas", she said.
"I wish I'd listened to my gut feeling".
A few minutes after they entered Lymans room, the man stepped behind her, pushed her down, and raped her, she claims.
This week, November 18, Lyman and 27 other current and former military personnel are anxiously awaiting a trial with a historic hearing in Arlington, Virginia, to decide whether a lawsuit they filed against former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will be admissible in court.
The lawsuit alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld did not oppose the widespread rape within the military and violated the constitutional rights of soldiers.
The lawsuit, filed in February by Susan Burke, a Washington, D.C. lawyer, initially involved 17 plaintiffs, but grew to 28 in the following months: 25 women and three men, all of whom claim they were raped or sexually abused by fellow soldiers and that the military failed to investigate, convict or provide adequate justice for the alleged attacks.
Burke says she's following the top military command, because that's where the problem starts.
"The military is hierarchical", she says.
"Who are the individuals who are in a position to eradicate the culture of retaliation?
Burke also says she's contacted nearly 400 other survivors since February, many of whom could be part of future lawsuits.
Their strategy: Instead of all the plaintiffs putting their eggs in a basket, as it were, they will file many more complaints if necessary to keep the pressure going.
The Department of Defense's defense team, led by federal prosecutor Neil MacBride, has filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit.
The court's records, which are available to Newsweek, detail the defense strategy, primarily that the military cannot be charged by current or former soldiers for injuries sustained in the armed forces.
Under a Supreme Court law of 1950, the so-called Feres Doctrine, the government is not liable for injuries to soldiers on active duty.
"The alleged damage occurred during the applicants' military service", the document states.
The Department of Defense has declined to comment on this story.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
If women are still not allowed to serve in combat, the only difference is in the name: modern wars rarely have clear fronts.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of female soldiers are playing increasingly important roles, especially in contacting local women in war zones.
The result: 150 soldiers died between these two wars, two thirds of them in combat.
It's time to modernize the military, Burke says.
And she is not alone in her struggle: three other lawsuits are pending.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans' Legal Services Clinic is preparing a lawsuit against the four major military academies for allegedly promoting an anti-female atmosphere.
The nonprofit Vietnam Veterans of America is filing a lawsuit against the military, focusing on the diagnosis of "personality disorder" that rape victims received in order to be dismissed from service - a common practice, according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati of the Service Women's Action Network, a human rights group.
Her group filed a complaint against the Veterans Administration in December accusing it of discriminatory practices in its handling of benefits claims for individuals who claim to have been sexually abused in the service.
Nine bills were independently introduced to Congress by a mix of senators and representatives from both parties, providing a number of clues.
In 2010, according to the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office, 3,158 sexual abuse cases were reported in the Ministry of Defence.
But most abuses are not reported at all, and the Pentagon estimates that this figure accounts for about 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 cases reported annually.
The report, published in March, also examines prosecution rates: In 2010, 20 percent of military cases went to court, only half as many as civil cases.
The plaintiffs in Burke's case describe their attacks as just the first in a series of dreams.
In Lyman's case, she reported the alleged rape to the military police less than an hour after the robbery.
That night, she says, she was asked 11 times to tell the details of her rape to a whole bunch of cops, doctors and commanders.
She had a rape set and her attacker's blood, which came from a cut on his arm, was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was questioned by a judge during that hearing, asking about the sex she had with her boyfriend before the attack.
Six persons testified as character witnesses on behalf of the alleged offender, who was ultimately acquitted.
"I remember the day the verdict was read", says Lyman.
"I thought the pains were gonna start.
"They took me to the psychiatric ward, and I remember coming out and telling my commander, 'That wasn't his procedure.
Lyman was asked to see a military psychiatrist who eventually diagnosed a personality disorder and declared her unfit for service.
In January 2010, she was dishonorably discharged and received no support.
Whether the lawsuit filed by Lyman and the other plaintiffs will proceed is pure speculation, says John Turley, a professor of law at George Washington University Law School.
Nevertheless, he notes: "I think they should move forward".
What stands between them and a judgment is this doctrine, which has been criticized since it was first questioned.
I've been a lifelong critic of the Feres doctrine.
The military is a decade behind because they do not have the same incentive and deterrence that responsibility brings.
He adds, "The odds are stacked against them... but it's important for them to try".
These things will only change if good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing doesn't follow its path, Burke, the plaintiffs' lawyer, will begin with her hundreds of other plaintiffs for future cases.
"We will continue to fight the military in this regard until reforms are made", she says.
Or until we die, whichever comes first.
Walls have eyes: How researchers watch you on Facebook
Before he became the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was just one of many guys who posted their anti-immigration views online.
On Monday, Breivik, who confessed to committing a July massacre in Norway that killed 77 people, had his first public hearing in court.
Although Breivik may have acted alone, he is far from alone in cyberspace: he spent a lot of time in front of his computer until his attack and chatting with some of the millions of nationalists who support far-right groups on social media sites.
After the tragedy of this summer, researchers wanted to find out more about these people.
But how do you find them?
It's easy - you just have to log in to Facebook.
"We found it not difficult to reach them", says Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a recent report by the British think tank DEMOS on digital populism in Europe.
Facebook's concealment of personal data is so encyclopaedic, Bartlett says, that researchers simply have to use the site's advertising tool to pinpoint their desired demographic data with scientific accuracy - just like marketers have been doing for years.
Bartlett's team found half a million fans of far-right groups across Europe and then targeted them with ads, but instead of linking to a new band or diet product, the Adds users were asked to participate in a survey that asked about their educational status, their attitude toward violence, and their own assessment of their future.
Thanks to Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to interview more than 10,000 followers of 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries - without even having to leave their office once.
"It's a fairly new research method", says Bartlett.
Some of the findings are hardly surprising, as online advocates of far-right groups are mostly young, male and angry about immigration.
But in a kind of surprising twist, "those who combine their online activism with offline activism are more rational, democratic, and less violent than those who sit behind their computer screens".
DEMO's work is just one example of how Facebook is becoming a hot new tool in the hands of scientists.
Ideas makers, medical researchers and political scientists use the site to study everything from health issues to societal trends like likes, text messages and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding on average three pieces of content per day, Facebook's "Datensupernova" is generating a research boom that has led to an almost 800% increase in the number of scientific papers with this page's name in the title over the past five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is that you can study people through this site, which you don't normally reach with your clipboard on the street.
"When you tried to interview people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them".
"They had to inform the party first and they would never have been allowed in", says Bartlett.
"Facebook takes all that away - you go straight to them".
Others say the site offers a way to identify and solve social health problems.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues found that students who discussed their drunkenness on Facebook were significantly more likely to drink problematically than students who were silent about it.
Moreno suggests that peer students, like housing counselors, monitor the site and help a student if he posts too many status updates.
"You can't solve a problem if you haven't recognized it", said Dimitri Christakis, Moreno's co-author and director of Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Children's Research Institute in Seattle, Washington Post.
"We have found a way to identify vulnerable children who would otherwise not have been found".
Facebook also constantly taps into the data of its own population.
The site's data team has compiled statistics on relationship status and Valentine's Day, voter turnout in the 2010 midterm elections, and a national happiness index (using primarily data that only Facebook has access to - masters of digital freedom have long known that the site should make its big data trench accessible to others for research purposes.)
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them whether they want to or not, and to play Scrabble with a friend thousands of miles away, you allow the site to release your personal data.
But what if Facebook users become part of a survey they don't even know anything about yet?
While researchers have strict guidelines on how to collect their data offline, everything is allowed online.
"I don't think many users have thought about the fact that a researcher could study their profiles", says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, to a 2006 study examining the public pages of students on Facebook.
"As far as she was concerned, it was all about her and her friends".
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline, there's no guarantee that a research participant is absolutely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know how much of the information in a user profile and in posts is true.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things", Selwyn says.
So, despite his years as a technology researcher, Selwyn still thinks that a clipboard and a pen are the best research tools anyone can use.
"There is no substitute for going out into the real world and talking to real people", he says.
"Social research has to deal with social -- and a lot of social life is still happening offline".
"Cold and inhuman": Anders Behring Breivik appears in public court for the first time
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed to two massacres that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself as a "resistance" fighter in his first public appearance in Oslo.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and a knight of the Norwegian temple", he said in front of a courtroom with more than 500 people.
"I object to the court because you have received your mandate from organizations that support hate ideologies and because it supports multiculturalism".
"I recognize the laws, but I do not confess to guilt".
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue because he "did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform on which to express his views".
For the same reason, he refused Breivik, who had given a pre-written speech, permission to address the relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered police to keep Breivik in custody for another 12 weeks, with him being denied access to the media for four weeks, and said authorities would monitor all visits and all correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the hearing.
Some came in hopes of seeing Breivik in the eye, others wanted confirmation that he was going to stay behind bars.
Everyone was involved with the goal of making it a one-way street.
"I thought he seemed cold and inhuman", one Utoya survivor told NRK.
"It was uncomfortable, but for me, it's a little bit more after seeing and hearing the suspect".
Breivik was wearing a dark suit and a blue tie and seemed calm and professional throughout the hearing, looking journalists and survivors in the eyes as he entered and left the building.
Despite Breivik's bizarre indication that he was part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge concluded that he was not mentally ill and said there was no evidence that he had accomplices.
Some may agree that the July 22 attacks were apparently the work of a single extremist and not a group of radicals.
But does that automatically ease the sorrow and confusion that an entire nation still feels?
"I wish he looked like a monster, but he doesn't", said one victim's family.
"It would be so much easier if he did".
Seven lessons from the late Steve Jobs interview that was shown at a theater this week
After Steve Jobs' death on October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford, highlighting the genius of technology as a great modern inventor.
But what Apple fans may find most revealing in the recently rediscovered job interview, which was dusted off this week before special film screenings in key markets, is how well this creative head has understood business processes and workflows.
He was certainly a designer, a dreamer, and a self-appointed hippie, but he was also a meticulous organizer, a diligent graphic designer -- a man who believed that many executives suffer from "a mental illness", that "a really great idea makes up 90 percent of the work... [but] there's a tremendous amount of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product".
In 1995, Bob Cringely created the TV series "Triumph of the Professionals" about the rise of the personal computer, and he sat with Jobs for over an hour, where they had one of the rare, detailed conversations.
By this time, it had been 10 years since Jobs was kicked out of Apple, and he was already working hard on his new computer company, NeXT, and he was looking forward to the wide adoption of the Internet.
While a small portion of Cringley's interview was used in professional idiots, he says the copy templates of the interview were missing in delivery.
It wasn't until after Job's death that a complete copy of the VHS was discovered in the director's garage.
This slightly revised footage forms the basis for the 68-minute film "Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview", which will hit theaters this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone who's known for disliking detailed interviews, Jobs here seems surprisingly eager to explain his technological philosophies and business strategies.
And incredibly thoughtful.
There are four times in the course of the interview that there are longer breaks between question and answer - 10 to 15 seconds of reflection, in which Jobs clearly balances his thoughts and strives for accuracy.
There are also times when Jobs' perfectionism is revealed when he seems impatient to respond to Cringley's questions and urges him to move faster on topics or side-effects of greater importance.
Before the era of Pixar, iPod, or iPhone, the Lost Interview kind of seems awfully far-sighted when Jobs evaluates what other companies think is right or wrong and represents his own vision for the future of computers.
It's one thing to read posthumous dignitaries of Jobs' career, but to see Jobs here as the ambitious dreamer who is on the leap to greatness is something else entirely, original and inspiring.
He has a vision of how things could and should be.
Shortly after he had done all this, he left and did it.
A quick look at seven remarkable sequences of the Lost Interview:
How he learned to run a business:
"All these years in business, I've always asked, 'Why do you do things?' And the answer you always get is, 'Oh, that's how it's done.'"
Nobody knows why he's doing what he's doing. Nobody in business really thinks deeply about things.
I've noticed that.
Jobs continues to streamline his efforts to streamline Apple's accounting.
Surprised by the way in which costs were recorded - usually starting with "standard costs", which were calculated on the basis of mere conjecture and then adjusted by "deviation" - he developed an automated factory that ensured that business costs could be determined to the smallest extent.
How the Pope was embraced:
Jobs tells us about the Blue Box he built with Steve Wozniak, a device that could sneak into the phone company and have long distance calls for free.
Much has been written about the device, but Jobs' enthusiasm when he describes the Blue Box as an act of self-empowerment is contagious.
He describes how Wozniak and he would test the box by using a toll-free phone, making a call, and then connecting from one AT&T network to another while scrambling through as many satellites as possible.
"We sent stuff half a dozen times around the world, and when you rocked the phone, it came out a minute later on the next phone", Jobs says, peeping.
"We were young and we learned that we could build something ourselves that could control trillions of dollars of infrastructure around the world".
We both, we didn't know much, but we were able to build this little thing that can control a giant thing, which was an incredible lesson, and I don't think Apple would exist without it.
Jobs continues to tell of a glorious move Wozniak and he almost pulled when they called the Vatican in the middle of the night via Blue Box to talk to the Pope while they were doing their best to imitate Henry Kissinger.
Since several members of the Catholic hierarchy were called in the middle of the night to speak with the American diplomat, the two had to laugh before the pope himself answered the phone.
How he fell in love with technology (and unpreparedly called Bill Hewlett):
When he was 12 years old, looking for spare parts to build a frequency counter, he looked up Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called him.
Shortly after her 20-minute phone call, Jobs got a part-time job at Hewlett-Packard for the summer.
"It had a remarkable impact on me, and it was the only company I'd ever seen in my old age, and it shaped my view of what a company was and how well it treated its employees".
Later, Jobs became one of the HP employees who visited the company's research labs in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desktop computer ever made".
He was the size of a suitcase, had a small screen with brown tube, and I fell in love with him.
I would climb up at HP as a teenager and hang on to this machine and write programs for it.
How to improve innovation:
Jobs talks several times in interviews about how to spontaneously invent new products.
Early in his career, when he was building some plates, he was asked by a client to put together the entire computer.
He worked with a payment deadline of only 30 days and had to rethink both the assembly and delivery of the finished equipment.
Later at Apple, he recalls the problems he had developing a computer mouse:
"I remember some argument that was so hard... they shouted at me that it would take five years [to build a $300 mouse] and I got up, went out and found a manufacturer".
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could build for $15, which was incredibly credible.
Large companies that are downsizing:
Long before he revived Apple, Jobs foresaw the ways in which so many industrial giants would stumble upon their visions and lose control of their stock.
"Let's say you work for IBM or Xerox, so you make a better copywriter or printer, what?"
They own the stock monopoly, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, so [it's] these people who ultimately run the business and the product that push people out of decision making.
The product genius that led to this monopoly is being eradicated by people who have no concept of good products versus bad products - crafting is necessary.
That's what happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry.
You could have been ten times bigger, you could have been the Microsoft of the '90s...
You've won the defeat.
Innovation as an art form:
"There's a lot of craftwork between a great idea and a great product... when you develop that great idea, it changes and grows".
You learn a lot about his subtleties.
You have to do some voting, certain things you can't, but electrons, glass, robots, factories.
You have to remember 5,000 things, these concepts, and put them all together...
It's ultimately about taste, it's about trying to unravel the best stuff that humans have created, and then trying to put those things together to make what you do.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal.
We're always shameless in stealing great ideas.
Part of what made Macintosh great was that the people who worked there were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians who happen to be the best computer scientists in the world.
If it hadn't been for the computer industry, they would have created fantastic things in other fields.
Scalia and Thomas dining with health law opponents as the court takes case
On the day the Supreme Court convened behind closed doors to discuss the politically divisive question of whether to hear a challenge to President Obama's health care laws, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, attended a dinner sponsored by the law firm that will see the case heard in court.
The incident took place last Thursday when all nine judges met to discuss the petitions for review.
One of the cases to be dealt with was a lawsuit filed by 26 states against the sweeping health care reform passed by Congress last year, a law that became a hotbed for conservative activists across the United States.
The judges agreed to the hearing, and in fact, a five-and-a-half-hour basic debate is expected in March, which is likely to fuel the 2012 presidential campaign, which will be in full swing by the time the court ruling is announced.
The lawyer who will stand up in court and claim that the law is to be overturned will probably be Paul Clement, former attorney general under the administration of George W. Bush.
Clements' law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that supported the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, a long-established group dedicated to defending conservative legal principles.
Another company sponsoring the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the business associations, the National Federation of Independent Business, that challenged the law.
Another sponsor was pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., which has a huge financial stake in the outcome of the trial.
The dinner was held a few hours after the court heard the case at a Washington hotel.
He served as a member of the House of Representatives from the state of California, and was a vocal opponent of health care reform.
The guests at dinner?
It's nothing new. The two judges have been attending events of the Federalist Society for years.
And that's not against moral standards.
In fact, a judge is exempt from the code of conduct that governs the actions of lower federal judges.
If they were, they would probably fall under Principle 4c of the Code, which states: "A judge may attend charitable events near the law and other organizations, whereas the judge may not be a speaker, guest of honor or guest of such events under the program".
Nevertheless, the extreme proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two of the law firms involved in the case and to a company with a massive financial interest in it was sufficient to alert moral and government activists.
"This startling moral breakdown and code violation punishes the claims of some judges for lying, the court follows the same rules as all other federal judges", said Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause, a civil rights movement in the United States.
"The judges won and dined at a benefit event with lawyers with floating court cases".
Their participation and support of a fundraising campaign for this event undermine any claim to impartiality and are not acceptable.
Scalia and Thomas show little consideration for critics who say they would too easily mix court cases with groups that are guided by the agenda, such as the Federalist Society.
And Thomas' wife, Ginni, is a well-known conservative activist.
The Conservatives, on the other hand, claim that it is Judge Elena Kagan who has a moral problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was attorney general under the Obama administration when the first lawsuits were brought to trial.
Her critics urged Kagan to withdraw herself from the hearing of the case on the grounds of bias, as she was too committed to upholding the law to be biased.
Kagan doesn't make arrangements to do this.
Boeing pulls a record $18 trillion order to land
Emirates Airlines is ordering 50 Boeing 777 twin-engine aircraft with an option for 20 more.
In addition, Boeing is selling six Boeing Dreamliners to Oman Air, a deal worth more than $1 billion.
It's really rare news that a company gets an order for more than 50 pieces of its products.
But it's a big deal if the company is the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co., and the list price for these 50 planes is a record $18 trillion in total.
Equally unusual is Boeing's client: the Middle East, a growing gold mine for future aircraft orders.
In a forecast released Monday, the Chicago-based company estimates that airlines from the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft worth $450 trillion over the next 20 years.
Boeing announced its largest ever order for commercial aircraft, measured by order value, this weekend: 50 two-seater Boeing 777 jets.
The Hammera order came from Emirates from Dubai.
The airline also announced at the 2011 Dubai Air Show that it has an option to purchase 20 more aircraft, which will increase the total list price to $26 trillion.
On Monday, Boeing Oman Air ordered six Boeing 787-8, the so-called Dreamliner, which greatly improves fuel consumption and passenger comfort.
The list price for six of these planes is over $1 trillion.
"This is absolutely positive for Boeing", said Neal Dihora, a stock market expert at Morningstar.
"The quality of these special customers is very high".
Many Middle Eastern airlines are owned by oil producing countries.
So not only do they have the money to pay for the planes, but rather, an increase in oil prices that usually hurts airlines, because that's one of their biggest cost points, is not as bad as the country earns from higher oil prices.
This is important because they are less likely than other airlines to cancel or postpone airline orders when oil prices rise, Dihora said.
"They have a natural hedge", he said.
The order from Emirates confirms Boeing's leading position in the large-scale aircraft market and helps to keep the Airbus competitor SAS in check, which is attacking the A350's dominance.
Boeing's victory at the air show comes four months after Airbus announced it would postpone the launch of the largest A350 that competes directly with the 777-300ER.
The introduction was postponed to gain more confidence after customers demanded a higher payload and reach.
Boeing shares rose 1.5% to $67.94.
Mexican President's sister appears to be losing election in Michoacan
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that drug dealers have supported rival Fausto Vallejo of the PRI in the race for governor.
President Felipe Calderon's sister apparently lost her bid for governor of Muchoacan during the violent state election, claiming on Monday that drug dealers had influenced the race in favor of one of her opponents.
According to preliminary results, Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, the PRI, has won the race for governor in the western state.
"The interference of organized crime throughout the election process and especially yesterday is alarming, not only for Michoacan but for the whole country", Luisa Maria Calderon said in a radio interview a day after the election on Sunday.
"They threatened our candidates, our poll workers... they occupied polling stations, they built roadblocks... and they hired people to vote for [the PRI]".
The PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until it lost the presidency in 2000.
But they are striving for a return and the victory in Michoacan is an important step in these efforts.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have narrowly beaten Claderon, who had led the polls before election day.
Calderon, a candidate of her brother's conservative Partido Acción Nacional PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the candidate of the left-wing Democratic Revolutionary Party PRD, who is currently the governor, came in third, a heavy defeat for the divided and unlucky left leadership in the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to acknowledge the preliminary findings.
Vallejo, former mayor of the capital of Morelia, denies any ties to drug dealers and urges the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacan has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and amphetamines.
It's the homeland of President Calderon, and he chose Michoacan to launch a military-led offensive against drug dealers in December 2006.
The violence is still going on.
A PAN mayor was killed during an election for Luisa Maria Calderon a week before the election and many candidates have withdrawn from the local elections out of fear.
For the PRI, a victory strengthens the party, no matter how disgusting the elections in Michoacan may seem.
The man who is likely to represent the PRI in the presidential race is Enrique Pena Nieto, who congratulated Vallejo from Washington and said, "I think this victory will give us the courage to look forward to next year".
ADB urges Asia to help save the eurozone
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is calling on India and China to help rescue the eurozone in its severe debt crisis in order to prevent a long-term downward trend that will slow the growth of Asia's economy.
Rajat Nag, managing director of the Manila-based ADB, said the world's two fastest growing economic nations must "do everything in their power" to accelerate the recovery of the currency bloc either through the International Monetary Fund or through direct mutual agreements.
He warned the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China) that look "no pain" at the difficulties in Europe, and said that financial support for European leadership and European resources through Asia would help prevent a long-term collapse of the global economy.
"We're all in the same boat".
"So anyone who can help Europe out of this crisis is helpful", he told the Financial Times in an interview on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia may be protected to some extent, but it's not immune".
"If China and India can help, then by all means".
The European Monetary Union has been in a serious debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy's interest costs have risen dangerously and the prime ministers of both Italy and Greece have resigned.
The emerging severe debt crisis in Europe has fueled fears that the global economy could plunge into recession and has led to calls for the leading emerging economies to unite to support the eurozone.
Mr Nag predicted that any support for Asia would be channelled through the IMF, but said that mutual agreements - such as the purchase of EU rescue fund bonds, the European Financial Stabilisation Facility (EFSF) - would give European partners in Asia greater bargaining power.
Anand Sharma, India's commerce minister, said that "India will do everything in its power" to help the eurozone as its economy now suffers from falling exports and the drying out of foreign capital.
"No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent", he said.
"We are facing great challenges and we need to maintain a high level of growth".
"It's not an option, it's a job, because where else can we find work for our millions of young men and women?"
Others argue that developing economies like India have no reason to help the rich Europeans when they themselves face major economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the US, said it would be politically very difficult to sell aid to Europe to the 1.2 trillion people in India, of whom more than 800 million live on $2 a day or less.
"Someday they'll find out that the Greeks retire at 50 and spend their holidays at the beach.
Lee Howell, managing director of the World Economic Forum, similarly asked why India's reserves should be used to keep the numerous and well-paid civil servants in Greece, with jobs in poorly managed, loss-making facilities such as the railways.
Mr Nag said that the crises in the eurozone would have "significant domino effects" on all of Asia.
The ADB forecast for an economic growth of 7.5% in Asia for 2011/year now threatens 'the risk of decline' due to the threat from Europe.
He said vulnerable emerging markets would need to create "crisis plans" to protect themselves from a downward trend and significant capital migration of their words.
Pentagon warnings of possible defense cuts
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta warned Congress on Monday that automatic budget cuts would unnoticedly weaken national security, triggering a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon's halls to war sites in Afghanistan and civilian floodgates.
The Pentagon is already considering $450 trillion in cuts over the next decade, but now fears that further cuts of $600 trillion or more will be needed if Congress fails to reach a budget.
"The impact of these cuts would be devastating to the ministry", Panetta wrote in a letter to Republican Senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said a failure of Congress to reach a budget agreement, which would lead to what is called a seizure, would result in 23 percent overall cuts and a halt to numerous new projects.
"Such a large cut, carried out in such a reckless manner, would render most of our ship and building projects impracticable - you cannot buy three quarters of a ship or a building - and seriously harm other modernization efforts", Panetta wrote to the senators.
"We would also be forced to involuntarily separate ourselves from most of our civilian staff and, as the reduction would be implemented so quickly, we would have to leave civilians with a very limited probability to reach the target".
"These changes would destroy the faith of those who maintain our military and seriously damage our alertness".
The cuts would ultimately hit the combat troops", Panetta said.
"While the seizure does not directly affect wartime quotas in the fight against terrorism, the serious interference with the basic budget would adversely affect the war effort", Panetta warned.
"Personnel positions were cut, which would lead to delays in the recruitment and recruitment oversight that would support the war".
"Staff salaries would be cut, leading to late payments to wartime dealers and disrupting legal and political support".
The two senators responded to Panetta 10 days ago asking for more details about the potential impact of the automatic cuts on the Department of Defense.
"The consequences of seizing the Department of Defense would precipitate a rapid decline of the United States as the world's leading military power".
"We are vehemently against this draconian act", the senators said in a joint statement on Monday afternoon as they released Panetta's letter.
"This is a result we cannot live with, and it is certainly not one that should be forced upon us".
"The seizure is a threat to the national security interests of the United States and should not be allowed to enter".
Whether Panetta's letter and the new Senate warnings will increase the pressure on a budget compromise or increase demands to exempt the Pentagon from cuts remains to be seen.
Panetta has been increasingly blunt about possible cuts, even though he had years of experience with budgeting in Congress and the White House before he came to the top of the Pentagon, and he knows he's facing tough decisions.
At a press conference last week, the defense minister painted a bleak picture of what might be coming -- a military with a shell but no core.
"It's a ship without sailors".
"It's a brigade without ammunition".
"It's an air squadron without a trained pilot".
"It's a paperweight, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without adequately trained soldiers capable of carrying out the mission", Panetta said in his opening speech at the Pentagon.
"It is a force lacking morale and alertness and unable to take on potential adversaries".
"She actually makes you angry".
In an appendix to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta cited new details of how reductions "create significant operational risks: delays in crisis times, conflicts and disasters, serious limitations on our global operational and intervention capabilities, leading to unacceptable risk in future war operations".
And Panetta said that some of the biggest defense projects could fall victim to the shutdown, including those that have already been tested and are already in the early planning stages.
This list also includes the F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a planned new bomber, the next generation of ballistic submarines, the new Littoral Combat Ship and the new ground combat vehicle needed by the Army and Navy to replace the Humvee.
If further development and testing of the F35 were stopped, it would save up to 80 trillion dollars over the next 10 years, but proponents say it's an important next step toward rearmament, so any potential threats from China and other adversaries can be prevented.
How to Disguise a Lie
A look at the current headlines shows how worrying and widespread deception and lying are in everyday life.
The Republican presidential candidate, Herman Cain, is busy getting his hands on the accusations of sexual harassment by several women.
Penn State's management is accused of perjury for allegedly withholding reports that a retired football coach sexually abused a boy.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was heard over an open microphone telling US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.
Lies destroy careers and shake countries.
New York congressman and Internet exhibitionist Anthony Weidner made a fool of himself by circulating denials that were quickly refuted by irrefutable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards is accused of campaign finance violations related to covering up an extramarital affair.
And then, of course, no one who has experienced it forgets the media circus that President Bill Clinton sparked when he lied about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky during his second term in office.
Stories of cheating at school and college exams are common.
There have been instances where teachers have given their students the test answers so that they can perform well on their own performance tests.
Mentors who should teach the opposite send a message that lying and cheating are okay.
How much deception are we experiencing?
Studies show that we lie between 10 and 200 times a day.
But many of these lies are considered to be emergency lies.
Another study shows that strangers lie to each other three times during the first 10 minutes of a meeting.
To detect lies or to "discover lies" is something that is important for every person to learn, for both personal and professional reasons.
Far from a social game, such as charades where the goal is to shout "Have you!" the instigation of a deception is a serious area of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades at prestigious universities that have undertaken extensive research projects, particularly in the fields of psychology and physiology.
One result of the research is that most of the ancient myths about lying have been debunked.
Lies look you in the eye.
They don't always stutter, stutter, red and stabbed.
But this does not mean that these liars are difficult to detect and expose.
A trained liar can penetrate the truth by learning about the structure of the statement, the fine facial expressions, the question and timing.
I've spent several years researching the scientific findings of the ever-growing, comprehensive field of disguise, and it's clear that disguise is a modern skill that's easy to learn and helps us to navigate our complex world, especially when hiring or questioning people or negotiating or managing is part of our professional responsibilities.
Good liars are very good at judging other people, arousing their interest and controlling their own emotions. And they intuitively sense how they are perceived by others.
Research shows that extroverted people lie more often than introverted people, that men lie more often than women, whose lies are more "oriented" - usually to protect the feelings of others - that married people lie to their partners less often than unmarried people (but the lies they tell are usually "fat lies").
We also know that when a person is exposed as a criminal, others feel less guilty about lying to that person.
How do you tell if someone's lying?
First, by observing the normal behavior of that person.
This is called baselining, the starting position.
It provides a reference point for the subsequent evaluation of changes.
Observe the attitude, the laughter, the quality of the voice of the subject.
You should know better when someone is usually tripping all the time, so you don't blame him wrongly for tripping during a meeting.
Then watch for a buildup of noticeable verbal and nonverbal behaviors.
Consider these accumulations to be alarm bells ringing, not evidence of disembodied.
People who cheat may stutter when they try to remember their history, or they may point their feet toward the door or they may lean toward the exit, or they may significantly change their position or show a "relaxation after the interview", that deep, relaxing exhalation and the change in attitude when all the hard questions are over.
Askers often mistakenly signal that an interview is over just to look for that relaxation after the interview.
Also, be careful of the language of your subject.
Scott Peterson's slide is famous for using the past form, claiming that his murdered wife was still alive and sparking a national search for her.
Deceptive people can also use distant language, like, "I didn't have sex with this woman, Miss Lewinsky", or repeat a tricky question throughout.
The most common verbal signs are subtle.
Some people use "qualifying language" when answering a tricky question: "Well... to tell you the truth... as far as I know... from the best of my knowledge and conscience".
This makes the answer more perceptual than factual, often causing alarm bells to ring.
There is no magic to disguise lies, but you can learn skills that make disguise possible.
These skills allow anyone to become less likely to fall victim to fraud, both in private and professional life.
The Commission has also proposed that the Commission should take into account the fact that the Commission has not yet adopted the proposed measures.
A few days after the Obama administration threatened to delay the approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico, angering the unions and at the same time reassuring environmentalists, the pipeline companies are trying to re-planned the project so that they can return to normalcy.
TransCanada said Monday night that it would divert the planned pipeline from the environmentally sensitive area of the Sandhills in Nebraska.
The company announced the decision at a press conference at the Nebraska State Capitol.
Alex Pourbax of TransCanada said that the company remains confident that the pipeline will be finally approved, albeit with a different course.
This came after an announcement from the State Department last week that a decision on a federal permit for the project would be postponed until the new possible course of action was reviewed to avoid the Sandhills area of Nebraska and Ogallala Aquarium, a major underwater supply.
"This is a real step forward", Republican Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, told Fox News.
The new environmental review ordered by the State Department may delay a decision until 2013, after the elections next year, even if officials deny that politicians were involved in the decision.
Obama declared in a written statement last week that the decision was the State Department's responsibility and said he supported it.
The 1,700-mile pipeline was to connect Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would pump 700,000 barrels of oil a day from the province of Alberta to the refineries in Texas.
To do this, the pipeline would have to go through six states.
Environmentalists hate them, but labor markets love them, because they estimate the pipeline will create 20,000 jobs.
But Nebraska lawmakers, who oppose the plan, are weighing down the laws to force a withdrawal from the Sandhills region and the Ogallala Aquarium, a major source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current State Department Environmental Impact Study found that the project had little impact on the environment, but the Energy Economy source said that the Ministry's Chief Auditor requested a separate probe of the audit process focusing on two issues.
One is whether a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was Hillary Clinton's adviser in 2008, is in a conflict of interest.
The other is whether a company that was commissioned to conduct the original study was an inappropriate choice because it is linked to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle is accused of allegedly forcing a toddler to vomit out of fear
A New York family claims that disco diva Patti LaBelle had a drug attack in the lobby of their Manhattan building that would have scared her little daughter so much that she gave in to fear.
The tirade of the "Lady Marmalade" singer made 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so frightened that she suffers from "personality changes, sleep disorders" and "increased fear of strangers", her family said in Manhattan's Supreme Court.
It was November 10 last year when stage manager Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, a kindergartener, and Genevieve were about to take a family trip.
While Kevin Monk was picking up the car, Roseanna Monk, carrying her luggage and Genevieve on her arm, went into the lobby of her building on Riverside Boulevard.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped by the door and dropped her daughter off for a moment.
"Somebody came up behind me and said, 'Do you know what your daughter is doing right now?' I said, 'Yes,' and went to take her back into my arms", she said.
LaBelle warned the pregnant woman furiously.
"She said in an aggressive tone, 'You shouldn't leave your daughter near the door,'" Roseanna Monk said.
"I told her, 'I don't care what you say or think.'"
She got angry and started to slander - she used the F-word and the A-word and became very loud...
She had a bottle of water in her hand and started to pour water from the bottle on me.
She said Genevieve had become hysterical.
"I said to this woman, 'Look what you did to my daughter,'" said the child's mother.
LaBelle rushed to the mother, who was still carrying Genevieve on her arm, and had to be held back by her escort and pulled to a waiting car, Roseanna Monk said.
The baby was screaming so much that she had to give up, she said.
Later, the LaBelle family wrote an apology, but received no response.
LaBelle's lawyer and representative did not respond to calls for an opinion.
The lawsuit is about a non-specific damages, but the family's attorney, Sam Davis, said he's not charging a fee and the family plans to donate the money they get to childhood cancer care.
"We want Patti LaBelle to take responsibility for her behavior", Davis said.
"This kind of behavior is absolutely unacceptable, especially when it is shown to a kindergartener carrying an 18-month-old baby on her arm".
Climate change has slowed the economy
In the first year of Mario López Valdez's government, Sinaloa's unemployment and black labor rose, while foreign investment declined and the economy stagnated.
The year 2011 will be remembered in Sinaloa's economic history. It is the first year that Mario López Valdez, who calls himself the initiator of change and has high hopes for economic growth, is in government. However, as a result of climate change, growth cannot be mentioned, but rather the main economic indicators have deteriorated.
The low temperatures in February not only caused millions of losses in agriculture but also narrowed the state's economic growth and caused a general decline in economic activity of 3.6% in the first quarter. This is mainly due to the historical decline in agricultural development of 31.16%, which slowed down further sectors.
According to a report on the effects of the frost published by the Consejo Mexicano para el Desarrollo Rural Sustentable (Mexico's Council for Sustainable Agriculture), 582 000 hectares of agricultural land were damaged, of which 78.03% were completely destroyed and the remaining 21.07% were partially destroyed, mainly vegetable, corn and chickpeas farming.
The decline in economic activity in the Mexican state from November to November has led to a continuous increase in unemployment. The Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía observed a rapid increase in unemployment in the first quarter, as from January to March 55 053 Sinaloa residents were unemployed, representing 4.53 percent of the working population.
Reduced liquidity
The unemployment rate in Sinaloa in the year is due to several factors.The economist Gerardo López Cervantes, dean of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences at the Autonomous University (UAS), comments that the policies of public institutions indirectly explain the rising unemployment.
"What we are currently seeing is an increase in unemployment, which has to do with several factors, including liquidity losses in the market as a result of the budget cuts passed by the anti-money laundering legislation in Congress, because it is not easy for those who accumulate dollars illegally to make them work for themselves, invest them or use them for anything else", he explained.
Migration stopped
López Cervantes pointed out that the rising unemployment rate is also a demographic factor.
"The number of people who leave the country to seek work abroad, especially in the United States, has declined, both because of the problems of immigration and because it is difficult to find work there too.
Black work
The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloa is even more serious when one considers the high proportion of black labour, which according to INEGI comprises 60.38% of the rural workforce who work without paying into the social security funds.
Unemployment and black work are among the lowest wages in all of Mexico, according to statistics from the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (Mexican Social Insurance Institute) and the Secretaría del Trabajo y Previsión Social (Mexican government agency for labour and social welfare).
The average monthly income of workers in Sinaloa was 5352 pesos as of September, which is much lower than the national average of 7375 pesos.
Decrease in ADI
In addition to the decline in economic activity and rising unemployment, 2011 saw the largest decline in foreign direct investment (FDI) in the last decade. According to the Secretaría de Economía (State Economic Authority), the ADI from January to June amounted to $630,597, a drop of 87.74 percent compared to $5,143,312 in the same period last year.
The Secretaría de Desarrollo Económico del Gobierno (Governmental Authority for Economic Development) recorded a total investment of 17 280 000 pesos in 2011, which was primarily made by companies in the tertiary sector.
The debt
In the face of the economic crisis, the provincial government requested a loan of 3 000 000 000 pesos from the National Congress in July to be invested in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities to revive the economy.
Reactions
The first year of Mario López Valdés's government made it obvious to the company's representatives that he was incapable of governing.
Miguel Loredo López, chairman of the Cámara Nacional de la Industria de la Transformación (Mexico's National Chamber of Manufacturing Industry), said that no effort was made in 2011 to harmonize the views of the different sectors, including the state government.
"The economic activity in Sinaloa was really very poor this year. It is necessary to work hard to recover the land lost this year and in 2012 we have to double our efforts.
Slow economic development
Loredo López said that events such as the freeze at the beginning of the year made economic development difficult and slowed down.
"The low economic flow is the result of several events, including the freeze. One of the main effects is a slowing economy that is not sufficiently in motion to generate an economic dynamic that could generate an acceptable flow of processes, products and services.
Re-defining appeal
Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, President of the Confederación Patronal de la República Mexicana (Mexico's business association) in Sinaloa, said that the state should be encouraged to increase its productivity.
"In general, we have seen that work has been done. We believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term programme to redefine the country's economic vocation and line, because it is important to activate all of Sinaloa's material and human resources", he said.
There 's a lot to do .
The Chairman of Coparmex stressed the importance of developing a future perspective that will guide the government's efforts towards better trajectories.
"I would say that the government has achieved good results in various areas in general. Economic development has progressed, but it is important to develop a long-term programme", he explained.
He stressed that the current state power had made progress in the government.
"There are areas where you can say that the government has taken more comprehensive action. What I can say is that work has been done and the government is aware that there is still a lot of work to do", he said.
Arrested for 8 kg of marijuana
A Navolato resident was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days in jail for possession of eight kilos of marijuana.
The prosecutor's office of the Republic announced that the drug dealer was Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, who was charged with a crime against public health - here the possession of marijuana for sale.
According to the AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I file, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested on 7 June 2010 by the Mexican military while guarding Cipriano Valdez Street opposite guard post No. 80 in the village of El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug dealer was riding in a white van, carrying a black bag in a box in the van and a small backpack in the passenger seat, where the military found eight kilograms and 23 grams of marijuana.
For this reason, the confiscated goods were handed over to the district judge and the convict remains in the execution facility.
Debt for construction works
The social construction for migrants provided for in the Hábitat, Rescate de Espacios Públicos and 3x1 programmes is in danger of not being completed due to lack of funds or only with great delay, Miguel Ángel López Miranda said.
The head of the Urban Development Authority explained that although the construction programmes have already progressed, they are now in danger because the state government has not paid the funds it owes to them, which exceed Peso 11 million for the three programmes.
He said that the total investment in these three programmes was almost 50 million pesos, of which 25 percent was for the state, and that so far only the federation and the municipality had contributed funds to the construction works, so a delay in completion was expected.
"They have to contribute 12 million and although the year is coming to an end, they have not given us a penny, and this, although they should have paid us a part of it in July", he said.
He stressed that under the government of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the State had not fulfilled its obligations and that the municipality had to take out a loan of 7 million at the beginning of his term of office, which was the same amount as the central government had to pay.
"We had already done this in the last legislative period, because the state did not have sufficient economic resources.
Although the State authorities are obliged to pay these funds, he commented that the Minister for Administration and Finance, , was requested to speed up the administrative work and pay the outstanding share as soon as possible.
"They have to contribute almost 12 million dollars, and even though the year is coming to an end, they haven't given us a penny".
The Court approves the transition to digital television in Mexico for 2015
The conversion of analogue to digital signals is one of the most important changes in recent years worldwide.
The Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) rejected the constitutional actions filed by the Senate and the House of Representatives against the Presidential Order, which required the transition from analog to digital signals from 2021 to 2015 to be postponed, due to the absence of eight votes needed to contest the law.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Supreme Court, Juan Silva Meza, felt that President Felipe Calderón did not go beyond his powers when he issued the decree-law detailing the switch to terrestrial digital television.
The decision rejected the constitutional dispute initiated by the Senate, as it did not receive the qualified majority of eight votes required for the court to decide whether it is constitutional or unconstitutional.
The draft lawsuit, drawn up by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed declaring the decree unconstitutional, since the Federal Commission for Telecommunications in Mexico (Cofetel) is responsible for the regulations relating to radio and television, and the decree would therefore be contrary to hierarchical principles and the provisions of the law.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero themselves voted in favour of the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies filed constitutional complaints against the decree.
The Council also rejected the House's complaint without taking part in the debate on the project, which was also the responsibility of Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his contribution, the Prime Minister expressed his disagreement with the arguments of the project, namely that the national government cannot regulate the measures to be taken by public administration by general rules.
"I also do not believe that doing so would affect the independence of the regulatory body". She also recalled that the central government is responsible for planning strategic policy areas, such as the telecommunications sector, for constitutional reasons, because it is the central government that directs the affairs of the state.
The replacement of analogue signals by digital is one of the most important changes that has taken place around the world in recent years, and it is resulting in better use of the radio spectrum, improved signal quality and more channels.
The Commission's proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks of the use of electronic communications, which is the subject of a directive on the protection of workers from the risks of the use of electronic communications, is based on the principle of equal treatment.
These matters, he stressed, "require the action of the whole system, and, according to the principle of economic management by the state, they contain a set of features which place the constitution in the hands of the central government".
She recalled that many countries around the world had already implemented the digital transformation through the government, despite having highly specialized facilities.
It cannot be concluded that the government interferes with the powers of Congress by issuing the contested decree, because the laws passed by the legislature would be respected", she assured.
The possibility of counting ballots in Michoacán individually is being considered.
According to PREP, the difference between first and second place in the election of the governor is just under 27%, with 879 votes out of a total of 6074 still not counted.
The possibility of single counting of ballots is a reality in this year's Michoacán elections, as the first- and second-place difference in the governor's election is almost 27%, with 879 votes out of a total of 6074 still uncounted.
In this regard, the President of the Consejo General del Instituto Electoral de Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that just last November the Electoral Office had adopted a series of rules to harmonize local rules with the reforms of the federal states in electoral matters.
It should be recalled that Michoacán had not adapted his political constitution, electoral law or electoral justice law to the reforms adopted by Congress, so that they did not come into force during this election round.
On 9 November, the Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) ruled on the constitutional lawsuit filed by the local legislature and deemed the State Representative's vote on constitutional reforms to be "inefficient and unlawful" because he had no right to "decide or veto it".
In an interview with María de los Ángeles Llanderal on the possibility of counting the votes individually, she explained that thanks to the adoption of the directives by the Consejo General del IEM, the local electorate could now count the ballots partially or completely.
The results in the minutes do not match; the minutes on the counting and counting of votes are not in the file or are not held by the Chairman of the Electoral Committee or there are obvious errors or changes in the minutes.
In addition, the total number of completed ballots may be counted if there is a difference between the likely winner and the second-placed candidate equal to or less than one percent, provided that at the beginning of the meeting there is an explicit request from the party or coalition chairman, who is the second candidate.
The total number of votes may also be counted if, after the regular count, it is established that the difference between the likely winner and the candidate in second place is equal to or less than one percent, provided that an express request is made by a representative of the party whose candidate has become second, in which case the electoral packages subject to a partial counting would be excluded.
It is worth noting that the elections in Morelia are in the same situation, where according to PREP the difference between first and second place is just under 0.16 percent, although the votes of 129 out of a total of 923 electoral minutes have not yet been counted.
His last will
His ashes will be scattered over the Zapaliname Mountains, the family confirmed.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés were found in Saltillo, his birthplace, this Sunday evening, and a funeral mass and funeral service were held on Monday.
According to family members, the lieutenant colonel's last wish was that his ashes would be scattered over the Zapaliname mountains.
After a tribute, the family of Bacio Cortés returned to the capital of Coahuila, along with the others killed in the accident on a Mexican Air Force plane, who were the closest people to the colonel, and attended the ceremony in Campo Marte.
At noon, the lieutenant colonel's ashes landed in the funeral hall on the Boulevard Nazario Ortiz Garza, where family and friends came.
At 5:30 p.m., his remains were examined at the Saltillo Institute of Technology, and this autopsy was organized by his former college graduates and his American football team, which Felipe Bacio was a member of during his graduation.
"He wanted to return to Saltillo and have his ashes scattered over the Zapalinamé mountains, as he had always told his family and friends", said Sandra Bacio Cortés, the pilot's sister.
She believes that the lieutenant colonel had fulfilled all his dreams and that he had lived his life to the full. "He was a successful man, exceptionally as a father and son, a loving brother, and he always stood up for his family".
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the village of Saltillo very young to enter the Air Force School of Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some could not believe it because they thought he would faint even on a truck, yet he always sought to make his dream of becoming a pilot come true.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembered him as a good man. "He had barely arrived in Saltillo, and the whole family wanted to welcome him, as on the occasion when he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo".
The young man remembers that even at the age of seven he had gone to Zapopan to graduate from his family, so he knows that his uncle died doing what he loved best: flying an airplane.
A final farewell
The honor was bestowed upon the Lieutenant Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Bacio Cortés, under the direction of Governor Jorge Torres López, by the people and government, the Mexican Army of the Sixth Military District, the Mexican Air Force, the head of school and students of the Saltillo Institute of Technology, where he studied in 1985 and excelled both in education and in sports.
Bacio Cortés died a few days ago when the helicopter he was flying crashed, which also included Secretary of State José Francisco Blake Mora and six other people from the same agency.
At 6:05 p.m., the buried remains of Bacio Cortés, a Saltillo citizen, arrived in the front yard of the barracks to be handed over by the funeral company to members of the Mexican Air Force, led by Major Jaime Martinez.
The abandoned bodies were found on a plot of land at Cadereyta NL.
Hours before the find, military officials introduced the media to 11 people who had been arrested in the same town in connection with the organized crime.
Three men were found shot to death in different parts of their bodies and a gunshot wounded in an abandoned finca in the village of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The event took place at the 1.5 km point of the country road from Cadereyta to Santiago at the height of the municipality of El Castillo.
Several passersby saw the door of the country house surrounded by a beige-brown wall rise along a barrier.
When they looked into the house, they found the bodies of three people about three meters further inside, which they immediately reported to the competent authorities.
One was wearing a yellow T-shirt and dark pants, without shoes; next to him was another wearing a white top.
Nearly a meter away was the body of another person wearing a red T-shirt and blue pants.
All three of them were on their stomachs.
According to the information obtained on the spot, the three people must have been murdered in another location, since no cartridge cases were found.
On the wall of the country house are inscriptions that one organized crime gang writes to another, and several shots were found in walls and doorways.
11 people arrested in Cadereyta
The Secretaría de la Defensa Nacional (Secretariat of State for National Defence) identified 11 individuals, including a minor, who were involved in a crime that was mainly committed in the village of Cadereyta and which is linked to kidnappings, murder, halconeo (hunting) and secret burials.
According to the information made public, eight people were initially arrested in the settlement of Los Alveros on 11 November and one prisoner was released.
Three properties and a cell phone were seized, and the detainees confirmed they were members of the Los Zetas criminal group.
On November 12, at 6 a.m., the military found a car without a license plate with two occupants at their guard station in the village of Rancho Viejo in Cadereyta.
When the military inspected the car, they found a long gun, a charger and 18 cartridges.
Later, at 2 p.m. on November 13, one of her accomplices was arrested in the municipality of La Frauda, who tried to flee at the sight of the military.
They're being charged with secret burials in General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
On Wednesday the formation of the new Italian government
The Prime Minister-designate, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to introduce him to the new government which is to confront the crisis that has brought Italy to the brink of economic collapse.
The Prime Minister-designate, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to introduce him to the new government which is to confront the crisis that has brought Italy to the brink of economic collapse.
A statement from the presidential palace announced that Monti, who was appointed on Sunday, would meet with President Giorgio Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm the government formation.
It is expected that he will represent a majority cabinet of technocrats, although it is not yet clear when the new prime minister will take office.
Monti said he would present the results of the talks with the political parties on government formation to the President of the State.
"I want to reaffirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to cope with these difficult times", the former EU Commissioner told reporters.
Monti did not explicitly confirm the government formation, but his comments show that the obstacles have been overcome.
"The frame is now well-packed", he added.
Monti has managed to form a government in less than three days, which is much less than normal, while Italy is struggling with a political and financial crisis that has pushed the cost of debt to unbearable levels.
The new government, led by former EU Commissioner Monti, must adopt a tough austerity package demanded by European politicians to restore the shattered confidence in Italy.
The pressure on Monti to act quickly was further increased by the volatile market situation, which has led to a 7% interest rate on Italian government bonds for 10 years, which corresponds to the situation in which Greece and Ireland were forced to apply for the European bailout.
Emma Marcegaglia, president of the Confindustria Italian industrial association, told the press after a meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government with all our might".
We believe this government is the last chance for Italy to get out of this emergency.
Montis' chances of success were greatly increased by the support of Silvio Berlusconi's PDL party, which was forced to resign on Saturday as a result of the crisis.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts are destined to bring good results", said Angelino Alfano, secretary of the centre-right party.
The support of the PDL, Italy's largest party, is essential because so far many of its members have spoken out against a majority technocratic government currently formed by Monti.
Parliament's support
The new Monti government needs strong parliamentary support to implement the probably unpopular austerity measures.
Resistance to its efforts or delaying reforms could lead to another devastating attack on financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks is also pressing, pointing out that a failure by Montis is a disaster.
Monti began his debates with political parties, trade unions and business associations, as well as youth and women's organisations, on Monday.
The round of hearings is scheduled to conclude on Tuesday evening.
Monti was appointed this Sunday by Napolitano, who has launched an extremely rapid change of government in response to the crisis.
After a brief respite towards the end of last week when it was announced that Berlusconi would step down, the costs of Italian government bonds have reached critical limits again as a result of uncertainty over the success of the new prime minister.
A bailout of Italy with a national debt of 1.8 trillion euros would be too much for the current EU bailout.
Monti said his government must wait until the next elections, which are expected to be held in 2013, despite predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement the reforms rather than prefer the elections.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the major parties insist that it should be made up of technicians only, a sign of their concerns in view of the procedure imposed by the pressure of the financial markets.
Political sources indicate that mutual mistrust and disagreements between the parties complicate the involvement of persons from political life.
Spaniards have more gambling opportunities than the Ticos
Of the 22 players recruited from Spain, ten have over 50 international games on their hands.
From Costa Rica, only one of the 22 recruits has 50 games left.
A huge difference for Costa Rica when the 22 players from the two countries are compared for the friendly match, which will take place at 3:05 p.m. today at the National Stadium in San José.
While the World and European champions, the number one FIFA monthly ranking, can look back on a significant number of Class A qualifiers, the three-colored team only has defender Michael Umana as the only one with over 50 international games.
He reached that number last Friday in the match against Panama (0-2) in Rommel Fernández.
Spanish players who play in the Liga de las Estrellas (Star League) and influential clubs in the English Premier League have the opportunity to participate in numerous domestic competitions (league and cup championships) and high-level European Cups such as the Champions League each year.
In addition, the experience of the Spanish Fury in complicated Euro Cup and World Cup qualifiers has been added.
The Tico players, on the other hand, have few international matches in the Concacaf, which is at the bottom of the FIFA rankings.
We will see the Spanish team pull their last record: goalkeeper Iker Casillas, who last Saturday beat England 0-1 in London, and finished on a par with former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta with 126 games played abroad.
Casillas will play the tricolor team today and Spain will have a new record of 127 games.
Xavi Hernández, player of Barcelona, owns 106.
Casillas and Xavi even received recognition from UEFA last week, along with other members of the Iberian team who had reached the magic number 100: the quoted Zubizarreta with 126 and the midfielder from Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
The number one hundred is also approaching Carles Puyol with 97 games.
He is followed by Xabi Alonso at 91, Fernando Torres at 90, David Villa and Sergio Ramos both at 81, Andrés Iniesta at 62, Cesc Fábregas at 61 and David Silva at 53.
From the Ticos side and close to Michael Umana, left-sided forward Júnior Díaz with 48 games and left-sided forward Bryan Ruiz with 45.
From then on, only five of them came to over 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36, and José Luis López with 35.
The ones with the fewest games.
The Spanish team has fewer than 30 games in total, with Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
From the national team, there are less than 30 games left for Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25, and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest of us are not even close to the 20th century.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, Costa Rica's Víctor Bolívar has only one and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson have not yet made their debut.
Spain's historic goalkeeper is David Villa with 50 goals, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz scored the most goals with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
The quintet included Costa Rica on its twentieth anniversary tour
"Playing in Costa Rica is a dream come true"
In the exclusive interview with Viva, Pearl Jam bassist Jeff Ament says the band is ready to give one of their best shows next Sunday at the National Stadium.
They've been waiting for more than 20 years, but the band assured them that they'll have a dream come true when they play in Costa Rica.
This was confirmed by the group's bassist and co-founder, Jeff Ament, who gave an exclusive interview last week from Brazil to Viva.
The band is on the South American leg of their 20th anniversary tour and on Sunday, the 20th, they'll make their only stop in Central America.
On that day, they will perform at the National Stadium from 7:30 p.m. with the band The X from Los Angeles and Las Robertas from Costa Rica.
You are reading an excerpt from the interview, a full copy of which can be found in the online edition of La Nación.
For your Costa Rican fans, a dream comes true when Pearl Jam plays in Costa Rica: Do you realize what that means for your fans?
Playing in Costa Rica is a dream come true for us too.
This is just the second time we've played in South and Central America, and so far it's been great.
I've only been to Costa Rica on vacation once, and it's such a beautiful country that we're sure to stay there for a few more days.
We're excited to bring our music there.
I'm asking you this because the band's fans are so dedicated, they're experiencing the days before the concert the most intensely.
What do you say to your most enthusiastic fans?
Thank you for being there for us all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica, and thank you for waiting so long, and we're sorry we took so long to get here.
Some people even think your concert will be the biggest show of the year.
Isn't that a little pressure from your visit?
Some of the greatest shows we've done in the last 21 years have been in the last two weeks.
We played a couple of giant shows in Sao Paulo and we hope they've made us fit for this concert in Costa Rica.
We really like playing there.
We love this country, we love surfing and we're fascinated by the jungle, which is why Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you meet Costa Rica and its surf waves?
Many of our friends are surfers, and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo, where the waves are just unimaginable.
My friends have always gone to Costa Rica and Nicaragua to surf, and together with Mexico, these are great surfing places, and that's how we learned about surfing-loving people.
You guys have been doing a lot of gigs on the tour.
What are your plans for the event in Costa Rica?
Since we've never played there before, we're not setting boundaries.
We're going to try to put on the best show possible with a lot of different songs, and we want to play a few songs from each album and give our fans a good, versatile repertoire.
You never repeat your repertoire.
Why? Why?
I think part of the reason is that we have nine records and we can play over 120 songs, and everyone likes a different song, so it's not easy to decide which one we're going to play.
If we put two or three songs in the repertoire that we haven't played in a while, we can better maintain our concentration and they surprise us because they remind us of the reasons why we liked those songs. Otherwise, they could get forgotten.
That makes the show more interesting for us and I think that's why the audience is interested.
This tour is to celebrate your 20th anniversary.
Looking back, do you find it hard to believe your success?
Yes, I totally did.
First of all, I don't think any of us ever imagined playing in a great rock band for over 20 years.
We continue to put our trust in that blessing and find it wonderful to be able to make music together even now.
We like each other and are excited to produce music.
We're lucky to be able to travel to places in the world we've always wanted to visit.
Things couldn't have been any better.
What did it mean to you to have been an active participant in the Grunge's birthday party?
It's always been an honor to be part of this group of great bands.
We're good friends with the people from Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising and quite unusual when a movement arises from a group of friends.
Occasionally, a band comes out of a city, but it's unusual for five or ten groups to come out of the same city at the same time.
We're proud of it and honored to be part of the Seattle group.
Sometimes we still play together.
Last year, we went to a festival with Alice in Chains and in Canada with Mudhoney and we saw Soundgards on their tour, and we're excited to still be friends with them all, and we're honored to be part of this Seattle sound that's been coming up.
It's also very unusual for a band like yours to have stayed with the same musicians for so long.
Yeah, four of us have been playing together for 21 years, and Matt (Cameron) came to us 13 years ago, which alone is way more time than many bands have survived.
First of all, I think we all feel lucky to be alive and we care about each other.
We're all close friends, which is why we've opened up musical avenues that give everyone the freedom to experiment.
We're confident in each other and their music.
Your relationship with fame has not always been easy, but on the other hand, thanks to your success, you could always do what you wanted.
How do you find balance?
The way we've grown up has made it easier for us to find balance.
We're making sure we don't go on tour too often, because it's too easy to get caught up in this game with huge crowds of people who love your music.
As long as you remember that people came here for music, it reminds you that you have to pay attention to music and what it created, without being obsessed with being a famous rock star.
What are your memories of your other project, Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote some really good songs and it was great at first.
We were a band for three years that had never released an album until Andy's death.
We were disappointed that we needed so much time, and we're still good friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who formed the band with us. When I hear a song or see photos, I think about what an incredible person Andy was and how he made me laugh.
He was an extraordinary person, and we miss him.
The local band Las Robertas is responsible for opening the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know her work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose the band for the opening?
Yeah, the production sent us videos from several bands and we liked this band the best, so we're curious to see what Las Robertas has to offer live.
Why do you always change the lyrics of Yellow Ledbetter when you play live?
This is a question for Ed, I have no idea.
He sings it, and I think he sings the first thing he thinks of.
Who influenced you as a bass player?
Of so many+
The first people I think of are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C.J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There's so many of them I could talk about the bassists I like all afternoon.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep the Grunge alive when it's no longer a fashion phenomenon?
I don't think we're all too attached to the word grunge.
When I think about it, I think about the bands I mentioned earlier, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and everyone else who came up at the same time, and if they're still relevant today, I think that's great because it's worth listening to that music, and bands like Mudhoney are making better music than ever.
At first her music was darker, now she's more positive.
Why? Why?
That's interesting, because I think there are a few songs on the new album that might seem a little lighthearted, but there are also other songs like The End or Just Breathe that are classified as very dark songs, even though they have something positive in them.
I was crying when I heard Ed play them.
I think when you get older and something traumatic happens in your life -- for example, when you lose a family member or a friend -- it affects your artistic creation and your music and these two songs clearly embody that for me.
But I also think you can be a happy person and still make dark music.
The following is the list of countries:
Fujimori was hospitalized again for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was admitted to a public hospital on Tuesday to investigate the loss of muscle in his legs, his GP informed.
Fujimori, 72, who served 25 years in prison for human rights violations during his term in office (1990-2000), has several illnesses, including tongue cancer, which has been operated on four times and is under control.
Alejandro Aguinaga, a congressman and his personal physician, told television that Fujimori would be examined for three days at the Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Neoplásicas Hospital in Peru to determine the cause of his pain and muscle loss in the lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that he thought Fujimori could be pardoned for humanitarian reasons, but he did not want to do so because he believed him innocent.
He had four operations for tongue cancer and lost 18 pounds, including severe erosive gastritis, a cyst in the pancreas, kidney stones, high blood pressure, and blood circulation problems in the legs, the doctor said.
Fujimori has been detained since September 2007 in the Dirección Nacional de Operaciones Especiales de la policía detention centre.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the murder of 25 people by the Peruvian Army's death squad, which was operating in secret during his rule.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official decree, led by Uruguayan President José Mujica and consisting of several ministers and businessmen, will begin its visit to Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two countries and discuss political issues in the region.
Mr Mujica is meeting next Wednesday with his Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderón, which, according to the President of Uruguay, will be the culmination of his booked agenda with politicians, businessmen and a meeting with the collective of Uruguayan people living in Mexico.
The meeting of the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara "is suitable for the exchange of information on all policy areas between the two countries", the South American country's presidential office announced on its website.
According to local media, Mujica is seeking Calderón's support over the incident with France when French Prime Minister Nicolas Sarkozy put the South American country on a tax haven list at the G20 summit in Cannes, France.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries that still appear to be a tax haven.
Mexico has been the chairman of the G20, a group of the world's most powerful emerging and industrialized countries, since November and has been in the process of negotiating an agreement on the exchange of tax information with the South American country to avoid double taxation.
The Uruguay Round of the WTO Agreement on Taxation (CTA) is a multilateral agreement between the European Union and the United States on taxation and taxation.
On a commercial level, a free trade agreement between Mexico and Uruguay has been in place since 2004, which has contributed to an increasing exchange of goods between the two countries.
The rope-bearded installer enters the third dimension with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has fought tirelessly for 25 years to save Princess Peach from the clutches of the evil Bowser, but until now he has never fought in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land", he fights for the girl's love in stereo technology.
The game, which is coming to stores around the world this month, was designed from the start to match the features of the portable Nintendo 3DS console, which can be played in three dimensions without special glasses.
"Mario is the figure who has to tell how the stereoscopy works without glasses", assured Omar Álvarez, the head of the Nintendo-specialized press in Spain, at the video game's presentation in Madrid.
Álvarez stated that "Super Mario 3D Land" was "the first video game from Nintendo to be developed from the ground up for this console", because until now, success stories like "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of existing titles.
Nintendo's spokesman stressed that although it is three-dimensional, Super Mario 3D Land is an "affordable" video game that allows for fast, liquid play.
Álvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contained two games in one: the first part is "easy" to catch the less-savvy users.
After that, the experts can spin a second round through the various levels of the game, which are becoming increasingly difficult.
In addition, users can choose in real time between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the downside of action.
This trip of Super Marios to the three-dimensional world also means the figure's return to a portable console, which has not been the case since 2005.
With this video game, Nintendo is winding up the fans of the saga and repeating the recipe for success of the last edition: The rope-bearded installer must overcome dangerous platforms to free Princess Peach.
However, the player encounters news about movements, the environment, disguises, and enemies - and a "playable" Luigi.
Colom guarantees the delivery of Portillos to the United States
The President of Guatemala, Álvaro Colom, announced on Tuesday that he would hand over former Governor Alfonso Portillo to the United States for the conspiracy to launder US$70 million.
The United States' request for the extradition of Portillo ends with the proceedings before the court.
In a press conference, Colom confirmed that his decision was based on the independence of the judiciary and the government, taking into account that a decision-making court had already ordered the extradition.
He stressed that he had not intervened in court decisions during his administration and had granted all extradition requests made to him.
In addition to Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín is being extradited for murder and serious bodily harm, Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
The Colom process is a government act that takes place when all the judicial and constitutional powers to convict the former President of the State (2000-2004) have been exhausted.
According to the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court of Guatemala, Portillo must be extradited if his legal situation in Guatemala is clarified and his human rights are guaranteed.
Portillo was acquitted of the seizure of 120 million Quetzales by the Ministry of Defence during his administration.
Trinijove has helped 6,000 young people who are at risk of social exclusion
The organisation was set up to prevent the marginalization of young people without vocational training.
The first 25 years of the Trinijove social assistance organization have produced important results: in this quarter century, 6,000 young people, threatened by social exclusion, have been helped to find a way out of their difficult situation.
In addition, over a hundred jobs have been created for this social group.
On the occasion of the anniversary, an event was held yesterday in the former Fabra i Coats factory, attended by over 300 people.
Trinijove was founded in 1986 in the Trinitat Vella neighbourhood with the aim of helping young people with low levels of education, unemployment, drug problems at risk of marginalization.
The celebration in Sant Andreu yesterday was attended by many officials from institutions and institutions who have worked with the association for 25 years.
The participation of political representatives from different directions in election campaigns demonstrated the impartiality of Trinijove's work.
In addition to the President of the Generalitat (Parliament of the Autonomous Region of Catalonia), Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, the former Socialist Minister of Education Ernest Maragall and the former Mayor and now left-wing Green City Councilman Ricard Goma attended the celebrations.
The current Catalan Minister for Social Affairs and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the Director-General of the social work of the Sparkasse La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa, also visited the large hall of Fabra i Coats.
Mas stressed that Trinijove was born in very difficult times and that these times are no less complicated, but he added that the work done so far "is a good foundation".
For the President of the Generalitat, Trinijove is an example that knows how to cope with difficult circumstances and gives hope to people in difficulty.
"The economic crisis is nothing new for the association and the work it does", he explained.
The occupied house where giant parties were held was cleared
The owners had occupied 11 of the 13 apartments in the building at 51 Balmes Street (Barcelona).
The 12 homeowners left the building yesterday afternoon without resistance.
Everything indicates that the nightmares of the neighbors of House 51 on Balmes Street have ended.
Twelve people voluntarily left the building they had been illegally occupied in yesterday afternoon, where they had organized huge parties that had left the neighborhood in despair.
After the evacuation, the lock was replaced to avoid a similar situation.
"From now on, the entrance will be controlled", the house manager confirmed.
The tenants, who occupied 11 of the 13 apartments in the building - the rest were occupied - took all the electrical system and part of the water supply, painted the walls and left all kinds of garbage, especially cans of alcoholic beverages.
In the three lower floors, huge parties were held that lasted up to two days, driving tenants to despair.
Next to the building is a nightclub, Balmes 51, which also carried damage.
Its owner, Maria Pantinat, told Europa Press that their business had declined by 80% since the beginning of the occupation.
The owner of the disco pointed out that the owners of the house were making their competition more unfair, for they sold the drinks for three euros, while those in the disco cost 10 euros.
In addition, the owner of the leisure centre had been charged by the neighbours with restlessness, while she said the noise was not caused by the disco visitors but by the owners and in particular by the guests of the parties organised there, which, according to the angry neighbours, have been increasing over the past few weeks.
The manager of the disco explained that the harassment was so great that she agreed with the owner of the building not to have to pay rent for the last nine months.
The Guardia Urbana (city police) also confirmed that it had received more complaints from neighbors in recent weeks.
The president of the PP (Partido Popular - People's Party) in Barcelona's city council, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had last week called for the immediate evacuation of the building and for the problems of civic coexistence and the decline of the neighborhood to be addressed.
He explained that before the summer, only one floor of the building had been occupied, but that in the last few months, the owners had been raiding all floors of the building and almost all apartments, and in some, there had even been thefts.
In this sense, he added, "it is necessary to put an end to impunity and to intervene against the associated actions in the building".
Yesterday, another building in the Nou Barris neighborhood was cleared by the Catalan police.
At 3:30 p.m., police approached Montreal Street No. 35 after receiving a call from a neighbor who observed four people trying to break into the building.
The four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountain?
Apart from the disputes over the fees, the architects agree with the tender.
The municipal tender for the 16 gates is opening up the debate on the importance of Collserola in Barcelona.
In the mid-1980s, at the height of the now defunct Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this administration published its libel against the promotion of Collserola.
The brochure described the mountain as a huge park in Barcelona city.
It's even been compared to Central Park in New York.
With the collapse of the CMB in 1987, the park was again considered by many to be the upper limit of Barcelona, as the capital of Catalonia is one of the few that does not extend north-southwards, but upwards (mountains) and downwards (sea).
The classification of Collserolas as a nature park is based on this idea.
The model was no longer Central Park, but Yellowstone, where wild boars played the role of the yogi bear.
This was the case when the city issued a huge tender in September, consisting of 16 competitions, for additional access stores to Collserola.
No doubt a gate is a reference to the concept of a park.
Either that's the way it is, or someone's planning to put a gate in the country.
The question arises: Collserola, park or mountain?
The tender is not only organisational but also reflective of the city, and is the subject of discussion for all Barcelona architects.
It's already a recurring theme that two members of this old-fashioned caste can draw on when they meet in an elevator.
And this very fact provides the material for one of the rare coincidences between what three Barcelona architects think about it, and some university professors who have applied for the project.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: The tender is appropriate.
For Roldán, it is "necessary" to speak of the "Mountain Front" after the attack on the coast, unless the speech by Ildefons Cerda, about the green apples, has been delivered.
"It should be assumed that Barcelona's largest park is the beach.
Among other things, it's easy to access.
Collserola is more complex", says the architect, for whom the title "Gates of Collserola" contains a "lexical trap": "It is not to be thought of as access to a park, but as a confinement of areas where action must be taken".
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with experience in urban planning, considers the proposal to be an "intellectual challenge" that "carries some dangers".
The risks posed by the "uncertainty of the design of a public space today" in the 1980s, which had its "swinging sound" in the forum.
The first fear is the self-limitation of what can be built.
"To limit something is always to set the next step", that is, to go beyond it.
"New urban planning tools must be considered, because the current ones [in relation to the Plan General Metropolitano (PGM) ] can lead to a real disaster".
Modol, who is more concerned with the question, simplifies the idea that the side of Collserola that goes towards Vallesana "can be understood as a park that does not go towards Barcelona", for purely topographical reasons.
Modol recalls that there is already a study by the Patronat de Collserola which should not "stumble on deaf ears", although he is grateful to the municipality for giving its board the opportunity to participate in this project "from the first moment".
He also notes that the proximity of the mountain to the city is the guideline that allows architects to participate in the debate, although he expresses his "doubts" about whether this technical profile should guide the established multidisciplinary teams ("just the right thing", he says) "we architects should be just a tool".
Bayona points out that the answer to the question in the title of this article is complex because the tender conditions do not provide a global view of Collserola: "16 competitions were organised in cross-sectional terms", he says, "on the Axis Mountains-Sea, but there is no long-term perspective that looks at the whole area".
At least in his case, that led to him taking part in the 16 competitions.
Otherwise, the program and definition of a gate project would collide with that of the architect of the gate next door.
In his view, the city should ensure that the strip directly over the Ronda de Dalt is equipped along its entire length to create a smooth transition between the city and the green areas.
Casino forgives Jonas Larrazábal who is free
After 72 days of silence, the casino agent Red acquitted the brother of the mayor of Monterrey of the alleged blackmail case.
After 72 days in prison, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal is released after the casino Red's attorney has pardoned him before the Second District Criminal Court, which is prosecuting the brother of the mayor of Monterrey for blackmail.
After the Casino Royale attack, Sergio Gil García, the owner of Casino Red, posted a series of photos and videos showing Manuel Jonás, who is allegedly forcing him to pay a sum of money to get the city to approve the secret operation of the casino.
After the criminal complaint, the prosecutor's office opened a criminal case against the brother of the panic-stricken mayor, who was detained for 30 days on 2 September.
After four hours with the official of the Ministerio Público 3 en Delitos Patrimoniales, he was taken to Casa de Arraigo 1 in the capital's Old Quarter.
He remained there for 49 days after a second arrest warrant was issued after the official of the Ministerio Público had rejected the crimes of bribery and organized crime.
On October 19, he was transferred to Cadereyta Prison for allegedly bribing the owners of Casino Red with 1.5 million pesos.
The authorities allowed him to attend the trial as an inmate of the San Nicolás de los Garza city prison.
On October 25, a warrant was issued for his arrest by the secretary of the Second Criminal Court of the district, Jorge Yánez, who found that after nearly two months of investigation there was sufficient evidence to convict Jonas of paying 1.5 million pesos to the representatives of the betting house in return for opening it.
On Monday, the acting governor of Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, asked Judge José Luis Pecina, the mayor's brother, to release him from prison, and he will be released in the next few hours.
During the hearing, Ramiro Arias, the official of the Ministerio Público attached to the court, asked García Gómez if he had remedied the damage and which owner of the betting house had granted his pardon.
In accordance with Case 197/2011, Jonás Larrazábal is free to speak.
After the hearing of the authorised representative of the betting house at about 3.50 p.m. Larrazabal Bretón was immediately released.
The court secretary, Jorge Yánez, drove to the San Nicolás de los Garza city prison to inform Jonas that he had been released and that his case would be filed.
He also informed him of the court order for his immediate release.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome gives details of the plane crash that killed Secretary of State Francisco Blake and seven others.
The Secretaría de Comunicaciones y Transportes - SCT (Secretariat for Communications and Transport in Mexico) informed that the results of the investigation of the accident in which the government secretary Francisco Blake Mora and seven other persons died indicate that the helicopter, with its entire intact structure, crashed directly into the ground without the pilot being able to make an emergency landing.
At a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome,Secretary for Communications and Transport, mentioned that the pilot had confirmed before take-off that the weather conditions were suitable for the flight.
"The fact that the propeller wing was in contact with trees at 25 metres altitude, with the helicopter losing its hull, seems to indicate that the helicopter had several ground contacts".
He also explained that the helicopter was built for 19 passengers and therefore fulfilled all the requirements for the transport of personnel.
He also said that the investigation at the area where the plane landed did not find any helicopter parts.
"The search did not find any aircraft parts elsewhere, the impact affected the entire structure.
The helicopter was built for 19 passengers, so it met all the requirements for passenger transport.
The area has a 7 to 30 degree tilt.
The Commission has also proposed that the Commission should take the necessary measures to ensure that the results of the examination are available to the public.
Gilberto López Meyer, Director General of Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliares (Secretariat for Aircraft and Auxiliary Services in Mexico), assured that the helicopter from the Estado Mayor Presidencial had flown at travel speed and had fallen to a soft slope.
"This information reinforces the assumption that at the time of the impact, it was a normal flight operation".
At a press conference, SCT Head Pérez Jácome listed six relevant points to be taken into account in the investigation:
- The sighting .
In accordance with the flight rules, this was a flight according to the rules of sighting, which means that the crew must have had sufficient visibility during the flight and on the ground.
Weather conditions:
The AICM recorded suitable weather conditions for the launch, and while the flight was moving towards the border between Mexico City and the Mexican state, some deep hanging clouds were emerging.
Selected routes:
It is possible that the team had chosen a lower area with better visibility towards the Cuernavaca Valley because of the clouds.
Point of impact:
The impact coordinates and the last radar recording of the helicopter are consistent, and there may have been no loss of control over the aircraft or deviation from the flight path before the impact.
Dispersion of aircraft remains in a limited area:
The information available to date suggests that the helicopter was hit from a straight and lateral direction.
The pattern of scattered aircraft remains suggests that the helicopter, with its intact structure, was hit by a car.
No sign of fire or explosion:
The remains of the plane are not showing any signs of fire or explosion at the scene.
The latest findings suggest several ground contacts.
On-site investigations have found aircraft parts at an altitude of 9200 feet above sea level, the site is shallow and has a tilt of seven to thirty degrees.
The photos show the sequence in which the helicopter likely crashed.
Some information suggests that the helicopter may have had multiple ground contacts.
After a thorough search of an area beyond the enclosed area at the crash site, no scattered aircraft parts were found, which reinforces the assumption that the intact aircraft structure had crashed into the ground.
MSS announces a research protocol to find the gene for obesity
The Social Security Institute of Mexico is leading a research project to find the gene for obesity in children and adolescents, supported by specialists from the IPN.
The Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social - IMSS (Institute of Social Security of Mexico) announced that it is leading a research project to discover the gene for obesity in children and adolescents entitled 'Genetics of childhood and adolescence obesity' to identify the genetic markers associated with obesity.
Miguel Cruz López, Head of the Unidad de Investigación Médica en Bioquímica (Department of Medical Research, focusing on Biochemistry) at the Hospital de Especialidades del Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI, explained that an interdisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers had been set up.
This team is supported by specialists and postgraduate students at the Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública (INSP) and the Centro de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados (Cinvestav) of the Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN).
The public is invited to participate in the study, and interested parties can come to the IMSS sports fields in the Valley of Mexico, where tests are conducted with children and adolescents every Saturday from 8.00 a.m.
He stressed that the investigation had begun at the Cuauhtémoc Sports Centre (in the west of the State of Mexico) and has been continuing since 8 October at the Nezahualcóyolt Sports Centre (in the east of the State of Mexico).
If the target of 500 to 600 researchers is reached, the study will continue at the Sports Square in Independencia (south of the capital district) and will be completed at the Morelos Stadium (north of the capital district).
He explained that the aim of the study was to identify the factors and role of genetics in the development of obesity and identify risk factors in Mexican children and adolescents for the prevention of chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of World Diabetes Day, he said that the aim was to have 3,000 children and adolescents aged six to 14 years old fill out nutrition questionnaires with the consent and supervision of their parents.
They will also be asked questions about their physical activity and family history of illness to help control risk factors that could lead to diabetes or kidney failure.
It further stated that on those Saturdays, the subjects were measured (weight, size, waist circumference), their blood pressure was monitored and blood levels such as glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors (an attempt to identify genes related to childhood obesity) were determined.
Cruz López stressed that this study would be carried out in the wake of healthcare workers' concerns about the alarming weight gain of young people.
"The health surveys conducted in 1999 and 2006 showed that in just six years the proportion of obese boys increased by 77 percent and that of obese girls by 47 percent, and that overweight also increased dramatically", stressed the IMSS specialist.
He said the search for genetic markers was justified because the genetic history of the population of Mexico was different from that of other peoples.
He stated that an average Mexican is 65 percent Native American, 30 percent European, and 5 percent African, reflected in the genes associated with diabetes and obesity.
He explained that the genetics of obesity are expressed in the inability to burn the excess energy (calories) we take in, so that it is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit to the study participants was a comprehensive examination of the children to determine whether they were overweight or obese.
It would even investigate the presence of dark skin folds in the neck and forearm (acanthosis), which indicate the likelihood of metabolic disorders and pre-stage diabetes.
All information would be kept confidential and the doctors would notify the parents in writing, explaining to the parents all the results of the tests and suggesting lifestyle changes appropriate to preventing illness.
Cruz López explained that there are three basic factors responsible for overweight, obesity, and other chronic diseases: lack of movement, meaning lack of exercise in everyday life, spending most of the day watching television, and using transportation instead of walking short distances.
The high calorie intake, i.e. increased consumption of sugary drinks and carbohydrates (tamask, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) together with high fat and protein intake, and the genetics to be analysed in this research project.
Asphalt from UNAM prevents holes
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry at the University of Mexico, UNAM, develops polymer-modified asphalt to make the mixture more resistant to weather and temperature fluctuations
If the signs from the road surface were taken into account, it would not be necessary to repair nearly 200 000 pits if the rainy season broke out in the Zona Metropolitana del Valle de México, said Rafael Herrera Nájera, a researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) at UNAM University, warning that if the laying and maintenance of the asphalt surface were adequate, the number of pits would be significantly reduced or even completely avoided.
In his talk "Technical Holes", which he gave on the occasion of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory he was responsible for would develop polymer-modified asphalt to produce a mixture similar to asphalt but with greater mechanical resistance at both high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera argued that this type of modified asphalt should be used in areas with extremely hot climates, such as some cities in the north of the country, to improve the behaviour of road pavement and thus prevent the occurrence of pits.
He explained that asphalt - the heaviest part of petroleum - is a hydrocarbon compound, one part of which has a high molecular weight - the so-called asphaltene - and the other part a low - the so-called malthene. Together they give the road surface its characteristic tethelist behaviour.
The asphalt's counting behaviour means that it behaves like a liquid at high temperatures of almost 180°C, at 120°C it is very fluid and at 50°C it is almost solid, while at very low temperatures it becomes brittle.
"This means that the resistance of asphalt on the roads is not uniform, but changes over the course of a day depending on weather conditions and temperature fluctuations", the chemical engineer explained.
The researcher from FQ noted that the streets of Mexico City had a mostly flexible road surface, consisting of six layers of material, the last three of which included asphalt.
Between the top layers is a layer of asphalt, made of small, asphalt-washed stones that are then solidified.
Every single piece of this wear layer was bathed in asphalt.
If the vehicles move on it and forces are generated, this layer allows for a good distribution of forces in the road surface.
"If it were modified asphalt, the forces would be even better distributed", said the chemical engineer.
"On top of the wear sheet", he explained, "a final layer is laid out, the so-called bearing layer, made of tiny stones, that is, sand, which has also been bathed in asphalt.
Since these layers are in contact with the vehicle tyres, they require a greater mechanical force than the wear layer and must cause friction.
The most powerful and distributing of these road surfaces is the bearing layer which also requires a suitable thickness and the material from which it is made must be maintained.
Climate conditions, particularly humidity and temperature fluctuations, are other important factors to consider, above all water", he said, "because they significantly affect the behaviour of the wear layer.
When the terrain becomes wet, water enters the layer and is difficult to get out of it again, causing all the layers of the road surface to soften and, as a result, to form holes.
If a hole occurs", he said, "the cover is first removed, while the wear layer is only affected afterwards. But the damage does not occur immediately, but it is a process that should be maintained at the first signs by appropriate maintenance programs".
The member of the Sistema Nacional de Investigadores (National Research System of Mexico) explained that vehicle loads are another important cause of the occurrence of crashes, so the thickness of each layer of the road surface should always be proportional to the vehicle load and that this should be ensured to avoid frequent crashes.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that there was still a lot of research to be done, for example on asphalt emulsions, which are already on the market in other countries and can be used to repair the holes easily and without applying high temperatures.
What did the candidate del Valle miss to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that influenced Melina Ramírez Serna's failure to win the Miss Colombia crown.
El Valle receives his 14th misdemeanor.
Once again, Valle del Cauca went out empty at the Miss Colombia crown.
This time, Melina Ramírez Serna had to settle for standing on the podium, showing off a silver crown and the ribbon that identifies her as the new Miss Colombia.
The result obtained that night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico took the crown and the cedar, the Departamento has already reached 14 mistitles and Melina joins the Legion of women from Valle del Cauca who had almost held the crown in their hands.
The big question many people ask themselves today is: What was missing?
Because the result was the decline of a great favorite who had shown at every show that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia, and not for nothing she had been chosen as the Queen of Police and the Major Rostro Jolie by Vogue, titles that beauty queens Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro had also won and took home the crown of Miss Colombia.
The first factor that was crucial to the jury's decision to appoint her as first Miss is that she had not convinced herself of the answer to the question "Which book has influenced you the most and why?" that was asked of her by Martín Murillo Gómez of Carreta Literaria Leamos.
The young woman from Valle del Cauca replied to the questioner:
"I read a lot, I believe quite a bit in literature, I think it's a way of civilization, ultimately I think the book that most influenced my childhood, `The Little Prince', is a pretty deeply moving book.
I'm reading a book about universal culture that we should all read. I'm reading a book by Irene Nemirovsky, a Russian, a beautiful book called Suffering.
A response that was not well received, firstly because of the concept of 'civilization' and secondly because it did not explain in detail how each book she mentioned had influenced her.
But after the ceremony, Melina said that she felt calm and happy with the result: "The universe is wise, it happens what it has to happen.
And for all the people, please read a little bit of Little Prince.
Among other things, they say El Valle's favorite is burned out.
A Bogota journalist suggested that the fact that she was the favorite, the one who received all the applause and all the prizes in advance (gastronomy competition Easter, audience vote for best hand-made costume and Reina Madre), "made the other candidates jealous, which stressed the queen, who could not shine on stage".
And you saw that in her first show in a swimsuit on the beach at the Hilton Hotel and in her two elevators at the coronation.
Although she was safe with both of them, she lacked the strength and momentum that the women representing Magdalena and Atlántico showed.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist for RCN's Como en casa, said that Melina's crown as Miss "shows that the candidate who wins the most prizes during the contest will not be queen after all".
And Valle eventually got out of the way of the press, a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury of her interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Contest.
It will have its reasons that two days before the international jury was convened, Lucy Doughty stated that she was looking for a woman who was committed to the social affairs of her country.
"Beauty alone is not enough for a Miss Colombia, you have to look beyond the physical and focus on the social feeling that she had before she entered the competition", she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle had sinned with her defects of dermis and fibrosis, which were noted in her stomach. But this is contradictory, because the jury chose her as a candidate for 'natural beauty' with a healthy body, good eating habits and responsible physical work.
The Queen's coach, Jorge Hernán Orozco, admits that Melina did not have the best body, that there were better ones, "but her problem with the fibrosis in her abdomen, which was hardly noticeable to me, really pushed her score on the last day".
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos of Cromos magazine believes that the fault of the Valle del Cauca woman was the surgical procedures she had undergone.
"The operations are fine, but Valle didn't know how to get them done right.
Her body has never been her strong point, and this place has paid off".
Because of this award, which is being given for the first time by the National Beauty Contest, a cruel prediction was made after the swimsuit was worn, and it was rumored that Raymundo Melina had given a consolation prize to keep her from enjoying the crown.
Whether that's true or not, the fact is that from today, Melina will be entering her reign, not as a queen, but as a princess, a position that will give her the opportunity to represent Colombia at the National Beauty Contest in one of the international competitions.
However, she will go down in history as one of the queens who, despite her overwhelming performance for Cartagena, escaped the crown.
This was the work of the doctor who identified Alfonso Cano's body.
A Lophoscopist from Cali went down in history as the man who identified "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials plays a key role.
On November 4, a Lophoscopist from the Investigative Unit of the Public Prosecutor's Office (CTI) from Cali came in as the man who confirmed the identity of the leader of the FARC (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - Revolutionary Forces of Colombia) by comparing the fingerprints.
Of the seven lophoscopists in the CTI department, this week Eliazar González was on duty, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been involved in criminal investigations for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in communities in Chocó, where he often had to travel for five days in the jungle to reach the location of the bodies he was to identify.
In 2000, he moved to Valle and after completing the required courses, he specialized in lophoscopy, which is the examination of the skin exposed to friction, i.e. the palms of the hands and feet.
During the week of the operation against the so-called Alfonso Cano, Eliazar was instructed to pack clothes for at least three days.
Something big was coming.
On Friday night, he flew from Palmira to Cauca by helicopter.
He knew he had to identify two bodies, and that there was a suspicion that one might be that of the man who led the world's oldest guerrilla, so he had to take the fingerprint sheet of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
However, when he examined the body and reached the site, he could not identify it because of its physical appearance, which was not in the least similar to the images he had seen in the mass media.
He had no beard, was dressed like a local farmer, wore no glasses, and was much thinner.
But fingerprints don't lie.
Armed with a magnifying glass, ink, a plant cell, and a flashlight, Eleazar compared the body's fingerprints to those on the printing plate.
He saw it right, it was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night, this man from Puerto Tejada was responsible for telling Defense Minister Juan Carlos Pinzón that it was actually the head of the FARC.
Searching for traces
For a Sijín datyloscope in Cali, the award given by President Juan Manuel Santos Eliazar González at a press conference on the use of "Cano" was very important.
A lot of people don't know what we do.
Daktyloscopy is an exact science with no error rate, which can be a key factor in solving a crime.
Lophoscopists not only identify bodies, they also support investigations into murder and robbery cases and confirm the identity of the persons arrested.
When they are arrested, many offenders present false IDs or have none.
We'll take their fingerprints and run them through the database.
The researcher told us that he had to tear a piece of wall out of a house in the event of a burglary, because the thief had raised his hand right there when he pulled out a safe filled with jewelry and money.
"Walls are difficult because their surfaces are not suitable for fingerprinting, but in this case we were able to take the fingerprint of the whole hand and identify the offender who participated in several thefts", he recalled.
Fingerprints can also help to relieve or burden murder suspects.
A dead man was recently found surrounded by liquor bottles.
The investigation suggested that a family member might be a suspect, and in fact, a fingerprint on the bottle matched that.
Although this does not guarantee that the murderer is the one, it does link him to the place where the crime was committed.
A CTI datyloscopist explained that "the fingerprints with chemical or physical reagents would be taken from the object".
When they appear, a plant cell or band is used to take them.
After that, the prints are sent to Asif, which is the crime database, or the personal office.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians without ID", explained the CTI expert.
He said that not everything was as it was portrayed in the TV series SCI.
Just as not everything that shines is gold, not everything that you touch is a fingerprint.
But it can still be used if you make a corresponding comparison.
The "outraged" are challenging the authorities in New York
Hundreds of protesters gathered in tents in Zuccotti Square.
Most of the people obeyed the evacuation order and moved to a nearby park.
Members of the Occupy Wall Street movement challenged the New York City authorities that Tuesday when they tried again to enter Manhattan Square by court order after being evicted at dawn and attempting to occupy another seat on the Big Apple.
Hundreds of protesters gathered outside Zuccotti Square, where they had been forced to enter by a court order allowing the "outraged" to re-tend at the site, while another part of the movement followed the evacuation order and occupied a park further north in the city, where nine arrests were made.
"Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp in the square, we will meet in another place and continue the legal battle to return to Zuccotti, with sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations", said Mark Bray, one of the spokesmen for the Occupy Wall Street movement.
Bray explained that the "outrageous" response to the evacuation of their camp, directed by Michael Bloomberg, the mayor of New York, went all the way to court, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order banning the forced evacuation of the square and authorized the demonstrators to leave the camp.
In addition, the "Rebels" occupied a new park located at the intersection of Central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, near the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and is owned by Trinity Church.
They were able to occupy the place for at least an hour, but after that the police arrived and arrested some of the protesters, although Bray cannot give exact numbers.
The organization assured that hundreds of people had gathered at the site, where a detachment of religious leaders had also arrived as a sign of their support for the movement's members and to mediate with the police.
Meanwhile, Zuccotti Square (a privately owned property) remains closed pending a court hearing scheduled for Tuesday to examine the legality of the early morning evacuation.
Some of the protesters driven from the square carried photocopies of the court order and distributed them, even handing them to some police officers guarding the square, which led to "some small clashes", as Bray reported, who indicated that some police officers had beaten protesters.
The court order forbids the authorities to remove members of Occupy Wall Street from the square and to apply "laws passed after the occupation and to prohibit protesters from returning to the park with their tents and other items they had used before".
Mayor Bloomberg told the press that the court order had suspended the reopening of the plaza to public transport and the protesters, pointing out that the city laws did not allow them to re-establish themselves in the place with tents and sleeping bags.
The mayor personally defended the early morning evacuation of Zuccotti Square, which resulted in the arrest of nearly 200 people and was decided because the protesters "violate the law".
Bloomberg explained that he ordered the evacuation because it had "become a place where people did not come to demonstrate but to break the laws and in some cases to harm others", because "some businesses had received threats" and residents feared "their quality of life".
"The morning eviction was disgusting and shows that Bloomberg is basically interested in protecting financial interests rather than protecting the interests of North American workers", the spokesman for the movement added, accusing the mayor of "disrespecting press freedom".
The leaders of Occupy Wall Street said they were considering organizing "big actions" for Thursday, together with community organizations and unions, to commemorate the two months of protests that have already taken place since September 17.
Pamela Anderson is the Virgin Mary in the Christmas TV show
She will be joining Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities on December 1st in the TV show "It's a Russell Peters Christmas".
Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant on Home Improvement, a lifeguard swimmer on Baywatch, rabbits on Playboy, the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee, and now the actress and model on a Christmas show on Canadian television will be the Virgin Mary.
The private CTV channel announced today that Anderson will be joining the crooner Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities on December 1st in the TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" and breathing life into a very special Virgin Mary.
CTV today released pictures of the television program in which Anderson - who also appears with her ex-husband, the "Mötley Crüe" drummer Tommy Lee - is portraying the Virgin Mary with a doll in her lap, which is supposed to represent Jesus.
In the scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian origin who recently served as a host on Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth", appears as a Jesus child.
The CTV Christmas program focuses not only on Anderson and Peters, but also on the Canadian singer Bublé, who married Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires at the end of March, and who is not far from this controversy.
Bublé had recently called North American actress Kim Kardashian a "whore" at one of his concerts in New York.
Japan is reborn after the earthquake
GDP is growing by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and will end the free fall spiral from the beginning of March
Since last March, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed, still recovering from the devastating earthquake that escalated into a nuclear crisis and the worst disaster Japan had experienced since World War II.
The government's initial estimates in Tokyo put the property damage at $300,000, a blow that seems to be weakening despite the difficult global economic situation.
After three quarters of decline, the figures for GDP from July to September finally concluded this chapter: GDP grew by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% at the year-on-year rate.
The value measured in the second quarter, in Japan, the financial year begins in March 2012, is also the fastest growth since January to March 2010.
The recovery can be explained in part by the sale of machinery for the rebuilding of the areas devastated by the earthquake and subsequent tsunami.
In fact, the companies increased their investments by 1,1% compared to a decrease of 0,9% for capital investments recorded from January to March, the first decrease after six months of unstoppable increases.
However, the actual upturn in the Japanese economy is not based solely on Keynesian incentives to use the crisis to build or rebuild infrastructure.
Japan is particularly alert to the development of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japan's GDP.
This variable increased by 1%, driven by rising expenditure on vehicles, travel and leisure.
The Stigma of the Yen
Tokyo has entrusted itself to the domestic market after the yen - the Japanese currency - became one of the "refugee currencies" for investors fleeing the eurozone debt crisis and the bleak forecast for the U.S., a privilege that is burdening the accounts of exporting companies like a gravestone.
With a tougher currency, products abroad are more expensive, a serious problem for a country whose economy is based on the health of the big tech producers.
For example, Toyota and Sony attributed their weak business performance from July to September to the yen's listing.
While markets continue to besiege the peripheral EU countries, the government of Yoshihiko Noda remains vigilant.
"We must pay attention to the ongoing risks, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the effects of flooding in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of the yen", said State Secretary for Economic Policy Motohisa Furukawa yesterday.
The prospects are really not very exciting.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) stated that most Member States had shown clearer signs of slowing economic development in September.
The indicator, which anticipates the turning points of the world economy, showed that the greatest economic powers would have been slowed.
Because it fell four-tenths to 100.4 points in the run up from 100.8 points in August.
The eurozone is even below the 100 mark after falling by eight-tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens is raising doubts again
Papadimos says the austerity measures will be passed, but the Conservatives will not sign a written agreement
With the high risk premiums of the peripheral countries and widespread uncertainty, Greece is also further lost in the maze that emerges from the great European debt crisis.
The impression that the "consensus" of the new Greek transitional government is more a reaction to pressure from Brussels than a genuine conviction of political forces is slowly being proved by facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, yesterday indicated that there were no alternatives to the structural reforms and that the 100 days agreed upon at his appointment may be too short for implementation, the leader of the conservative Nueva Democracia party, Antonis Samaras, assured that he supported the new austerity measures and would not withdraw his demand for new elections on the scheduled date of February 19.
"The most important task of this government is to implement the decisions taken at the summit on 26 October", Papadimos assured yesterday of the opening of a parliamentary debate, which will culminate tomorrow with a vote of confidence for the new government.
The first initiatives are a package of 24 programmes to promote employment, reform the disciplinary law for officials and new measures against tax evasion.
Nevertheless, Samara's statement does not clear up the doubt about his stance: "We have pledged our support to the transitional government, but nothing else".
The conservative leader went too far with his challenge to the EU and the IMF, the body that needs to unlock the 8,000 million that Athens desperately needs, and made it clear that he would not approve of a declaration of commitment to implementing austerity measures.
But the European Commission, still irritated by the impact of the Papandreou referendum, reiterated yesterday its demand that economic aid be not signed unless the new government and the leaders of the main Greek parties sign "a clear written agreement as soon as possible".
The Ministry of Economy spokesman Amadeu Altafaj said that the Troika inspectors would return to Athens "very soon" to discuss with the new government "what is needed for the payment of the sixth installment" of €8 billion, although there is no definitive date yet.
The Greek knot has some strings left.
Queen Sofía: "These are instruments of progress and hope"
The Queen stressed Spain's "dominant" position on this type of financing
Spain 'has achieved a dominant position in the world in the role of microfinance'.
Queen Sofía of Spain recalled yesterday that Spain has become the world's second donor of this international cooperation fund in the last two decades, whose "essence" is that it is an "instrument for social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all humanity based on trust in people".
The Queen inaugurated the fifth World Summit on Small Loans in Valladolid yesterday, convinced that there was "no doubt" that this type of business would be "absolutely essential" to reach the UN's 2015 Millennium Goals and "especially the target of the number of people living on less than a dollar a day, that is, below the poverty line".
Spain "continues to work" to expand the beneficiaries' network "to the ends of the earth and is carrying out this task responsibly", said Queen Sofia, who hopes that the initiatives and contributions that will result from the summit, which runs until Thursday, will guarantee "new capacity and better opportunities for the poorest and especially women" as the main beneficiaries of these loans.
"We have achieved many successes" and "we face many challenges".
The Small Credit Summit is not only a forum for debate but also a platform to promote 'two fundamental objectives'.
The Queen stated that the aim was to have 175 million poor families with access to these financial services by the end of 2015 and that 10 million of these households would cross the poverty line.
The concept of micro-credits in Spain and the rest of the world dates back to the "path initiated years ago" by Muhammad Yunus, whom Queen Sofia considers an "act of justice and recognition".
She described the father of the financial instrument as an "admirable idealist committed to the fight against poverty" and whose work she had known for 15 years when the Queen travelled to Bangladesh to learn about the lending strategy on the ground.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings in Ivory Coast in 1999 and Canada in 2006. All of them "have seen continuous development", the Queen said, whose commitment to this project yesterday earned her the status of "family leader" in Valladolid and "advocate for the poor".
Finally, Queen Sofia concluded her speech by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and to seek solutions to the fight against poverty.
"Ethical Commandment"
Spanish Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez pointed out that solidarity is "an ethical requirement" for the entire democratic state.
In this sense, she stressed that it was a mistake to commit development aid in times of economic boom,because it was a 'lasting commitment'.
Jiménez felt that micro-credit was a "serious and rigorous policy to eradicate poverty" and that the governments of the industrialized countries should now "more than ever" work on solidarity criteria and not allow solidarity to fall victim to the crisis.
For Spain, micro-loans are one of the 'most important forms of development aid'.
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, lauded the "success" of "marginalized" people "who are always in front of closed doors" and "hope" and the Mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed the people in a city that "opens its doors, infected with the spirit of solidarity".
The CDU proposes to elect EU presidents by universal suffrage
The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democrats (CDU) on Monday 14 November in Leipzig was without any real difficulties for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and Chair of the Christian Democratic Party.
The future of Europe was not originally envisaged in the programme but has been strengthened in the autumn, in particular to satisfy those activists who consider government policy towards Greece today and possibly Italy tomorrow too lax.
The proposal for the Presidency of the European Commission proposed by the Bureau was adopted almost unanimously.
Of the 1001 delegates, only nine voted against, while 10 abstained.
The three European finance ministers had no doubt about the several minutes of standing ovation, which was initially held by Angela Merkel and a few hours later by Wolfgang Schäuble, because of their intervention decisions.
The Chancellor's main idea, as well as the petition, is the following: the answer to the crisis is 'not less, but more Europe'.
Not only because Europe means peace, but also because 'nine million jobs are directly dependent on the euro'.
The Chancellor said that "the time has come for a breakthrough in Europe".
This could be reflected in a revision of the Lisbon Treaty to strengthen the European Union's control over the budgetary policies of the euro area countries, but could also be reflected in the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of universal suffrage, 'to give Europe a face'.
But this is certainly one of the proposals adopted by Congress which clearly stood for Wolfgang Schäuble.
It is unlikely that the 47 will quickly agree to this revolution: Great Britain is opposed to the issue, and the leaders of the CDU think they know that Nicolas Sarkozy is of the same opinion.
The milestone has been reached.
The delegates also rejected by an overwhelming majority the proposal to weigh each country in the Governing Council according to the weighting of each economy, which would obviously strengthen Germany's position.
The Chancellor, who was concerned with the climate within her party, therefore reinforced the points of reference to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but she no longer sought to win her Congress at the expense of the "little" or troubled European countries that would immediately criticize the arrogant Germany.
Insofar as the European proposal is concerned with the importance of the 'German-French friendship', Angela Merkel does not call on France to do so.
At least not directly.
Because this reminds us that two centuries ago Leipzig was the center of a bloody battle.
In fact, one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What does sickness report fraud represent?
After family allowances, UMP and the government are now taking up sickness reports.
Nicolas Sarkozy will arrive in Bordeaux on Tuesday 15 November to visit a family aid fund and to give a speech on the ever-recurring theme of the fight against social fraud and economic dependence on the state, which has been repeated since 2007.
In order to accompany this attack, which is based on the attempt to put the economy to the test, but which is no less a precursor to the right-wing presidential campaign, the majority wants to focus on workers' sickness reports.
The government is aiming to introduce a fourth maternity day to take into account sickness reports for private sector workers.
In good German, this means that a sick worker would lose the wages of four days without permission from the specific company, i.e. at least 15% of his monthly income.
A move that threatens to stir up anger, according to the daily Les Echos, would help raise €280 million.
The Commission has also taken a number of measures to ensure that the public authorities are able to take the necessary measures to ensure that the public health authorities are able to take the necessary measures to ensure that the public health authorities are able to take the necessary measures to ensure that the public health authorities are able to take the necessary measures to ensure that the public health authorities are able to take the necessary measures to ensure that the public health authorities are able to take the necessary measures to ensure that the public health authorities are able to take the necessary measures to ensure that the public health authorities are able to take the necessary measures to ensure that the public health system is safe and that the public health system is able to provide adequate information and that the public health authorities are able to provide adequate information and that the public health services are able to provide adequate information and that the public health services are able to provide adequate information and that the public health services are able to provide adequate information and that the public health services are able to provide adequate for the public health services.
While these issues are being discussed, the majority also reignited the subject of fraud, this time with the aim of exploiting the absence of work.
"Controls will be much more important, and they are also to be recovered if required", Xavier Betrand warned on Sunday 13 November in front of the RTL radio station's microphone.
As in other cases, the impact of this reporting on the reality of fraudulent activities in the field of sickness reports seems a little disproportionate.
In fact, it has been continuously monitored and the most successful political offensives since 2002.
The French are no more likely to be sick than people elsewhere in Europe.
But let us first consider the national figures.
According to the National Health Fund (CNAM), more than EUR 237 million in daily payments were made in 2006.
According to the Economic Research and Documentation Institute for Health, daily allowances accounted for 5% of health expenditure in 2008, at EUR 11.3 billion.
This figure was 46% for maternity leave and accidents at work and 54% for sick leave, which amounted to EUR 6.2 billion.
And that's 2.5% of health care spending.
In 2010, the average sickness allowance for French people was 14.5 days, compared with 17.8 days in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting Group.
One average that covers up some differences: another, published in 2007 by Monster.com, a career planning website, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French workers surveyed said they had not taken a single sick day.
Another study, this time by the Health Insurance Institute, shows that 37% of the sickness reports in 2010 were shorter than 8 days; 22% were 8-14 days; 15% were 15 days to a month; 15% were 1 to 3 months; and 11% were over.
Compared to their European neighbours, French workers are therefore no more likely than elsewhere to be unable to work.
A long-term study conducted in 2010 by two researchers at the French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) showed that between 1994 and 2001 the global absence rate (disease or otherwise) fluctuated between 10% and 11% in France, compared with 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
The fraudulent reporting of sickness is a very small proportion of black labour.
The Commission has not yet taken any further action.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 has led to systematic checks on sickness reports exceeding 45 days.
In 2008, the CNAM (Public College of Training of Engineers and Engineers) found that, under 1.5 million checks, 13% of the 285,000 short-term sickness reports received, including 37,050 cases, were 'unwarranted or too long'.
The number of systematically controlled cases of sickness lasting more than 45 days was below 1.2 million, with 11% of cases being 'unadapted or unjustified', which is 132,000.
In total, this represents 169,000 'unjustified' cases per million workers who have filed a sickness report.
A figure which represents only a weak figure compared to, for example, black labour.
According to UMP Member Dominique Tian, author of an expert report on this issue published in July, this represents between EUR 9 and 15 billion in tax profits per year, i.e. more than the total cost of daily allowances, and thus significantly more than the defrauding of the latter.
Papademos: Greece should introduce a new adaptation plan
Greece needs a new adjustment programme to cut its economy.
This was announced by Prime Minister Lucas Papademos in Parliament on Monday 14 November, citing the fact that the Union's 100 days allowed by his government were not enough to complete this task.
"To continue the efforts to strengthen the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new budget adjustment programme", the Prime Minister said in his first public speech at the opening of the debate on Parliament's vote of confidence on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the Euro Summit on 27 October was the new government's 'main task', as the country's involvement in the eurozone was 'on the line', he added.
Accordingly, Mr Papademos planned to reduce the country's government deficit by 9% of GDP from today to the end of the year, after it was 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The right rejects the new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, the head of the right wing, had agreed on Monday to the already approved reductions in an attempt to escape the debt crisis, but predicted that his party would not agree to an additional reduction in spending.
"We will not vote for new measures", he said at a meeting of the parliament of his New Democracy party.
He had agreed to the requirements of reducing the budget deficit and debt and fighting waste, but was hostile to any policy that would halt economic growth.
Olli Rehn, the EU Commissioner responsible for economic and monetary affairs, who had prevented the IMF and the EU from releasing the necessary loan of over EUR 8 billion without a written guarantee from all parties that they would support the planned measures, had replied to Antonio Samaras that his word was sufficient and that he would not sign anything under pressure from Außen.
Euthanasia and accompanying free death must be legalized, according to a panel of experts
Canadians live in denial of death, according to a report by the Royal Society of Canada
The panel stated that governments, healthcare institutions and doctors were working together on pain relief to provide the best pain relievers, including beyond cancer cases.
Canadian society lives in a rejection of death.
Only 9% of Canadians actually agree to talk to their doctor about conditions under which they would like to die and make arrangements to do so.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, involving six experts in a variety of fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
This body recommends that the government amend the penal code to allow for accompanying suicide and euthanasia where this choice is made, especially in patients who are considered to be able to make such a decision.
To begin with, the experts cite a recent survey by the independent EIU, which compared the quality of deaths in 40 countries around the globe.
Although Canada is ranked 10th, the study notes that "medical death care in Canada has created a culture where people are afraid to cut the topic of death".
Medical care or not: 77% of Canadians do not have access to pain medication, according to experts commissioned by the Royal Society of Canada.
And despite the majority of Canadians' desire to die at home, 68.6% of these people eventually die in the hospital.
The highest rate of hospital deaths in Quebec is 86% in the country.
The Commission's proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks of death and of the use of personal protective equipment (OJ L 347, 27.11.1999, p.
But now, according to the experts who have also inspected all those countries whose approach has legalized or decriminalized euthanasia and accompanying suicide, there is no evidence that such decriminalization would involve the practice of euthanasia or accompanying suicide by incompetent or non-consenting persons.
On the contrary, there are far more cases of such violations in countries where euthanasia and accompanying suicide are not legal, as Jocelyn Downie, the report's co-signer, confirmed yesterday in a teleconference.
"Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal".
"Some people in Canada are practicing suicide accompanied, even though it is clearly illegal", explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians support euthanasia
Consider that according to a 2010 Angus-Reid survey, 85% of Canadians already voted for euthanasia, believing that it would help people at the end of their lives to alleviate their suffering.
And 66 percent believe that the fact that euthanasia is legalized doesn't mean that the lives of older or disabled people are less valuable.
As regards those who have already committed suicide with an accompanying person, 41% of respondents believe that they should not be prosecuted.
The report's authors say that the situation is less clear when it comes to maintaining or setting up funds for patients.
The Commission also suggests in its list of recommendations that the criminal law should state that the withdrawal of funds for which a legal refusal was submitted should not be considered criminal.
The panel also calls for health professionals to be trained in respecting end-of-life disposal without fear of prosecution.
The panel stated that governments, healthcare institutions and doctors were working together on pain relief to provide the best pain relievers, including beyond cancer cases.
Finally, the Committee calls for at least consideration to be given to the means of pain relief or life-saving measures already widely used in Canadian healthcare institutions, as they were not intended to reduce physical pain and as much as euthanasia, and they relate to the same procedures.
Reservations of other experts
Some experts in the field of health law have already expressed reservations about the conclusions of the Royal Society of Canada's expert report.
Pierre RA Deschamps, a specialist in health law, called the attitude of the signatory experts 'extreme' among other things, since they set no limits on the practice of euthanasia in patients in the final stages.
"This opens the door to a situation where everyone who is tired of life and over 18 years old is asking another person to help him with his suicide", said RA Deschamps, who had reviewed a summary of the report yesterday.
RA Deschamps also stresses that the authors of the report seemed to place individual responsibility above all other values involved in the social impact of society.
But he says there are "guidelines and commitments in a society".
Margaret Somerville, a specialist in health law, also expressed 'strong opposition' to the conclusions of the report, which she called the 'Pro-Euthanasia Manifesto'.
Margaret Somerville, herself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, particularly doubts the reporting on the absence of abuse in certain countries where euthanasia and accompanying suicide are legal, such as the Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan calls on President Assad to step down
Damascus is accusing a "conspiracy"
Syria is increasingly isolated
The partisans of Bashar al-Assad demonstrated yesterday in front of the authorities of the Auvergne Ministry.
The diplomatic pressure on Syria by Bashar al-Assad, who, however, is resisting it thanks to the support of Russia and is calling for a "conspiracy" against the country, has intensified yesterday.
Two days before the Arab League's exclusion of Syria, the European Union has tightened its sanctions against Damascus, despite Turkey and Jordan, Syria's neighbours, taking a position in favour of President Assad's resignation.
King Abdullah II of Jordan was the acting Arab prime minister who yesterday called on President Bashar al-Assad to 'set up his office in Syria' in which some 40 civilians and members of the government have already been killed.
"If Bashar put the interests of his country at the heart of his life, he would resign, but in addition he should also create the necessary conditions for a new era of Syrian political life", the king of Jordan, Syria's neighbor, said in an interview with the BBC.
The Turkish head of diplomacy, Ahmet Davutoglu, had complained that Turkish mediation efforts against the Syrian regime since the beginning of the year had not been successful.
"Those in the Middle East who are not at peace with their people and cannot satisfy them must go", he said, referring to Syria, the neighboring country to which Turkey is taking a steadily increasingly harsh stance.
The United States, for its part, welcomed the "strengthening of the consensus against Assad and the Syrian regime's machinations" as a result of the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League and countries like Turkey have taken a sharper tone in the face of repressions in Syria", observes Mark Toner, a State Department spokesman.
During this time, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the government have died in the Dar'a region of southern Syria, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights OSDH said.
Two other civilians were killed in "swipe and heavy bombing attacks around Jobar" in the besieged city of Homs, according to the NGO.
At a press conference, Syrian Foreign Trade Minister Walid al-Muallim said the country was "leading towards the end of the crisis".
He has, by the way, reacted strongly to the Arab League's decision to suspend Damascus from its duties, which he considers to be a "dangerous step".
The Commission's proposal for a directive on the protection of workers' rights in the Member States is based on the principle of equal treatment for all workers.
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is currently investigating a "protection mechanism for civilians" and is calling for 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, media and military observers to be sent to the country.
French Foreign Trade Minister Alain Juppé also spoke out in favour of sending UN observers to protect civilians from the regime's repression, which is entrapped in its "paranoia".
A planned new meeting of the League is scheduled for tomorrow in Rabat to discuss the implementation of the crisis response plan adopted on 2 November, but in particular the controversial and expected withdrawal of military forces from besieged cities and the release of detained protesters.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov yesterday called the Arab League's decision "incorrect" to guard against support for possible sanctions against Damascus, even though China had already urged Syria to implement the exit plan.
Italy
Monti calls on the markets to be patient and Italy to be willing to sacrifice
Mario Monti, the future head of the Italian government, has demanded a little more time from the markets to form his staff and implement a program that will demand "victims" to regain the creditworthiness lost during the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former EU Commissioner had held a negotiation with the political parties yesterday before today's meeting of trade unions and workers.
It was his task to convene a cabinet in Parliament composed of relatively strictly external technocrats.
"Monti spoke of an important programme with a number of victims", said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the many smaller parliamentary groups taking part in the talks, after meeting with the sitting Council President.
Gianfranco Fini, the President of the Chamber of Deputies, had said he expected Mario Monti to submit a vote of confidence to Parliament by Friday to ensure that the new government had sufficient support.
The talks will culminate in the presentation by Mr Monti of a cancellation list, which will undoubtedly range from a dozen ministers to the head of state, Giorgio Napolitano.
Mr Monti commented that yesterday's nervousness in the stock and bond markets was taking its time.
In a democracy, there are certain deadlines to prepare a government and a government programme, he stressed, noting that it was "certain that markets will be pleasant and understanding".
The President's order was initially welcomed by the markets, but the unrest has since intensified, particularly after an unexpected decline in industrial production in the eurozone in September.
The acting prime minister was supposed to set up a staff composed mainly of technocrats, although he had stressed that he liked to involve "politicians".
He estimated that the new government should only exist until 2013, the date of the next parliamentary elections.
Mr Gianfranco Fini, the President of the Chamber of Deputies, said the new government should receive a confidence-test from Parliament by Friday.
Since taking up his post, Mr Monti has committed himself to working with utmost urgency to make Italy a 're-protagonist' in Europe.
A spokesman for EU Commissioner Olli Rehn had stressed that'our diagnosis of the Italian economy does not change even with the new government in mind'.
The EU, which is convinced that Rome will not achieve its budget balancing target in 2013 despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, has in particular requested new hardened measures.
Emma Marcegaglia, 'Chief of the Italian Chiefs' meeting on Tuesday in Monti, also insists on the need for economic anchorage, 'since a country with no growth to show can not respect deficit indicators'.
Monti, known for his competence and independence as EU Commissioner (1994-2004), represents a "changing epoch" of Italy after 17 years of "Berlusconism"; the "professor" symbolizes the "trust challenge" and "another Italy", according to the editorial authors.
The big unknown here is the longevity of his staff.
President Napolitano would like to prevent early elections, as Italy has to raise 200 billion euros of government bonds by April 2012.
Russian scientist helps Iran's nuclear program
A Russian scientist, Wyatcheslav Danilenko, helped Iran develop a nuclear-powered explosive device, a US NGO specialising in nuclear risks confirmed on Monday.
The Institute for Science and International Security ISIS is based on the recent report of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents from that UN agency to investigate this scientist.
The IAEA had expressed its "serious concern" last week about a "possible military dimension" of Iran's nuclear programme.
According to a detailed study of the IAEA documents by ISIS, Danilenko, born in 1934, had apparently worked in a Soviet military nuclear center in Chelyabinsk, Ural, for over three decades since the early 1960s and was involved in the production of explosion-generated synthetic diamonds.
In 1989 or 1991, he left the centre to start a company in Kiev that produces 'nano-diamonds'.
The economic difficulties of his company led him to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
Before returning to Russia, he then worked on an Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002.
In its latest report, the IAEA cited 'strong evidence that the development of an Iranian nuclear explosive system' was supported by the work of a foreign expert who was not only extremely experienced in this technology but who, as one member of the Agency said, had spent his entire professional career working on this technology directly on the military nuclear energy programme of his home country.'
Anti-Islamic crime and offenses have increased by 50%
Crime and crimes against Muslims increased by 50% from 2009 to 2010, while other racially or religiously motivated violent crimes, according to FBI statistics released on Monday, have either declined slightly or increased only slightly over the same period.
According to these data, the total number of violent crimes against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, up 49%, while there was a 13% increase in violence against Catholics, a 4% decrease in crimes against Jews and a 14% increase in anti-religious crimes and crimes worldwide.
The FBI reported that the total number of hate crimes rose to 6,628 in very weak cases, including 47.3% from racial and 20% from religious reasons.
"After a slowdown in 2009, it is worrying to see these crimes and crimes rise again", Human Rights First stressed. "The rise in anti-Islamic violence is particularly significant", the organisation added in a communique.
"Human Rights First has long stressed that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crime, should be considered a serious violation of human rights", added Paul Legendre, an official with the organisation.
"The US government can and should do more to combat these attacks", he added, noting that this could be done by improving police attitudes towards 'hate crimes'.
The term "hate crime" is a legacy of the civil rights movement in American federal law.
This legislation was passed after the death of Martin Luther King to punish acts of violence directed against race, color, religion, or descent and now also involve sexual offences.
Twitter is changing the platform and becoming more and more like Facebook
The microblogging website Twitter on Monday introduced changes to the presentation of its platform to allow its users to monitor the activities of those who follow their posts, making the service more similar to Facebook's.
The new 'Activity' tab and a different 'Name' enable a better live reading of the activities of other 'Twitterers', the Internet users whose messages ('Tweets') you follow and who follow your messages.
This allows you to find out whether they allow you to track your messages, whether they subscribe to new posts, favor certain messages, etc.
This new Twitter menu was tested before its general Internet release on Monday, "in August, with a small percentage of users", Twitter spokeswoman Carolyn Penner told AFP.
Twitter was known for its little instinctive functioning, with a somewhat esoteric wording (RT referring to the reference repetition of the contribution of another person). Followfriday pour recommander de suivre un autre utilisateur) faisant le bonheur des initiés, s'ouvre ainsi a public plus large avec un maniement plus comparable à celui des réseaux grand public Facebook et Google+.
The network used specific "Tweets" to debate this innovation.
"This is useless, intrusive and too much like Facebook", @jemb123 writes.
"The activity function will help me to better track certain elements of my flux tweet", declared @dannykronstrom.
Austria
The introduction of a 'Golden Rule' into the Constitution
The government of the Greater Social Democratic/Christian Democratic Coalition, which is in power in Austria, decided on Tuesday to incorporate a "Golden Budget Rule" into the constitution in order to reduce public deficits and also to avoid any degradation by rating agencies in Austria's top credit rating (AAA).
It was the Social Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann who announced this decision in person, although the Austrian public debt is 74.6%, well above the criterion of 60% set by the Maastricht Treaty, but well below the debt levels of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's solvency had not fallen from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay an additional three billion euros of interest every year", argued Michael Spindelegger, Vice Chancellor and Christian Democratic Minister of Foreign Affairs.
Austria is also holding a call at the Brussels Eurozone Summit on 26 October: the Heads of State or Government had demanded that the reduction of public deficits be included in the Constitution by the end of 2012 and that the public account balance be returned to the public account by the adoption of an equivalent law.
The Austrian government's approach to this is similar to the German model, as Germany was the first European country to incorporate such a rule into the constitution.
The structural budget deficit should decrease by 0,75% of GDP each year by 2017, and from 2017 onwards the structural budget deficit of the Federal State should not exceed the 0,35% threshold of GDP, while regional states and municipalities should have balanced budgets.
The objective is to eliminate budgetary liabilities below the 60% criterion laid down in the Maastricht Agreement by 2020/21.
Strong yen
Noda threatens to intervene in the currency markets
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would intervene again in currency markets if the yen continued to rise.
'If we establish excessive volatility' in the yen exchange rate, we will intervene as we did last time,' Mr Noda explained in the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen was again on the verge of reaching historical levels, which the Japanese authorities had forced to intervene on 31 October.
On that day, Tokyo had sold massive yen against the dollar to lower the Japanese currency, which is heading toward a new record against the dollar since 1945.
However, the yen has steadily risen above this level, driven by purchases by investors who view the yen as a 'refugee' in these uncertain times of global economic downturn and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar fell below 77 yen on Tuesday, and the euro slipped below the symbolic 105 yen lattice near the levels that triggered the last intervention.
Before the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was valued at 120 yen, the euro at more than 160 yen.
This Japanese currency fires damages the exports of the archipelago, as it increases the cost of 'Made in Japan' products and reduces the value of income drawn from Japanese companies abroad, as they convert them into national currency.
"Japan is struggling to rebuild after the March 11 earthquake and tsunami that devastated the Tohoku region", stresses Mr. Noda, who fears that this rise in the yen could kill the weak recovery already in its infancy.
The third world power economy gained traction again in the third quarter, with growth of 1.5% compared to the previous quarter, for the first time this year thanks to the rapid growth in exports and consumption of households plummeted by the disaster.
The prime minister, however, estimates that the Yen's rise does not reflect "Japan's economic foundations".
The Bank of Japan (BoJ) has been invited by Finance Minister Jun Azumi to take all possible measures to de-stimulate the yen.
Hirohide Yamaguchi, deputy governor of the institute, however, noted that the BoJ had already taken "appropriate measures", which meant that no further currency relaxation was expected on Wednesday.
At its last meeting at the end of October, the Central Bank increased its government bond purchases by 5 000 billion yen (EUR 47 billion) to cover the 55.000 billion yen (EUR 519 billion) covered by the various purchases of financial securities it had spent to flood the liquidity market.
The euro area:
Interest rates are rising, stock markets are falling
The risk of contagion from the debt crisis is constantly undermining European indicators.
Despite the new heads of government taking office in Greece and Italy and the best growth rates in France and Germany, rates in the weakened countries continue to rise steadily.
The stock exchanges, still concerned about the stability of the eurozone, are drifting a little further into negative areas on Tuesday 15 November.
In Paris, the CAC lost 1.4% at 10 a.m. and fell to 3,064 points.
The tax rate in Frankfurt fell by 0.4%, London by 0.1%.
"Due to the new tensions in the yields of government bonds in the troubled eurozone, global stock markets continue to report some of their recent gains.
"Capitals are nervous and too aware of the risk of infection", explains Terry Pratt, an institutional broker at IG Markets, quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange, which is suffering from a renewed fear of the market participants' capacity in Europe that the debt crisis will continue, closed down by 0.7%.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has turned its eyes to Europe, and trade is moving on a limited variation corridor as long as investors have no evidence that the situation has stabilized", estimates Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This resurgence of concern about the future of the eurozone is hurting the single currency, which continues to decline on Tuesday.
The euro has been at its lowest level for a month and a half.
By 10 o'clock, the European currency was worth 1,3570 dollars, so it was down 0.4%.
According to the stockbrokers, the move came after the CDU, the party of Chancellor Angela Merkel, which met in Congress on Monday, approved a request that provides for the possibility for countries in difficulty to leave the eurozone without leaving the European Union at the same time.
The Italian and Spanish rates are well below the 6% threshold.
The interest rates on loans in Italy and Spain remain very worrying.
On Tuesday morning, the yield on Italian bonds reached 6.85% for 10 years, while the yield on Spanish bonds reached 6.2%.
These tensions in interest rates in the southern countries, but also in France, continue to feed investor fears.
The future Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti called on the markets to give him more time to restore Italy to the situation threatened by debt paralysis.
The new Greek Prime Minister, Lucas Papademos, confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone summit on 27 October was the "main task" of his government.
Spain is in the market for the Sunday elections.
The spread between the German and Spanish 10-year bonds has once again reached a new historic high.
Expecting growth in the euro area
Statistically, France recorded a budget-driven growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, slightly better than the 0.3% forecast.
The Federal Statistical Office INSEE, however, revised the declines in the second quarter, with a minus of 0.1% of GDP instead of stagnation.
In fact, it is the fourth quarter that most worries economists.
Germany, for its part, had a growth rate of 0.5% over the same period.
The first euro area high is expected at 11 a.m. with the EU Commission warning of the risk of a recession.
Energy policy:
Facts Should Overcome Dogma
If there is a subject that cannot be dealt with on the basis of short-term considerations or emotions, it is certainly energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly affect the purchasing power and competitiveness of enterprises.
It is reasonable to hold an election to consider this issue and the position of nuclear energy.
The debate will only bear fruit if it examines the overall economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French should base their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
Although there are 7 billion people on this planet, demographic evolution is driving a doubling of electricity demand by 2050, so a huge proportion of the world's population doesn't have to forfeit a vital element.
At the same time, the scarcity of fossil resources must be mitigated in order to continue to produce electricity sustainably, without forgetting the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, a theme that has disappeared from the ecological debate, in order to combat climate irregularities.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.
Germany therefore remains isolated in its decision to forgo nuclear power.
This is not the case in Belgium, which has decided to find a substitutable source, or in Switzerland, which is planning to build only last generation nuclear power plants.
The United Kingdom, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name but a few, continue to pursue their projects with determination.
The United States, for its part, has decided to add another unit to its park after Fukushima by reopening the Three Mile Island plant, which was shut down after the nuclear accident.
The German model of renewable energy is sometimes cited as a model, but the reality is contrary to the discourse.
The Berlin election will take the form of a rise in electricity prices, an increase in energy dependence on imported gas, especially Russia, and an increase in CO2 emissions from gas and coal plants.
The full extent of these unpleasant effects will be apparent within a few months.
The case of Denmark gives us reason to think.
Denmark is the European leader in wind energy, which generates 30% of its electricity, and one of the largest users of coal and gas, which are used alternately with wind energy, resulting in a 65% and 50% increase in CO2 emissions and electricity prices respectively.
The Commission has already decided to take the necessary measures to ensure that the Community's energy policy is consistent.
In the global economy, energy prices are a key factor in competitiveness and in the stability of industry at national level, and French companies have an advantage because of the cheapest electricity in Europe.
Any significant reduction in nuclear power would therefore lead to a sharp increase in energy prices, which would make the noble statements about the reindustrialisation of our country and the defense of purchasing power an illusion.
Polls showed that this is a price that the vast majority of French people are not willing to pay, as well as resistance to the principle of this source of energy.
Let us now consider that the energy policy of our country has made it possible to create an industry with 125.00 direct and 410,000 induced jobs.
The Commission has also proposed a number of measures to improve the quality of the products and services provided by the Member States.
If France decides to leave nuclear power, a large part of these SMEs will be affected and the annual export of investment goods and nuclear energy of EUR 6 billion will shrink further and further.
What electrician would hire an EPR designed to run for sixty years if the decline of its producer is preprogrammed?
To solve the energy equation, we must admit that there is no miracle tool for generating electricity, just as there is no devil's work.
The low-carbon solutions developed by Areva for the use of nuclear and renewable energy are evidence of the complementarity of energy sources.
The maintenance of the highest possible level of safety is an absolute imperative for nuclear power.
In France we have a security authority that has carried out uncompromising and transparent checks on existing works, such as the construction in Flamanville.
Their working teams, which have made a name for themselves because of their professionalism, are obsessed with the concept of safety.
In the last 50 years, the nuclear industry has seen three major disruptions.
Only one, Three Mile Island, has been operated under normal conditions, with no human or environmental consequences.
In Chernobyl, the drama was evoked by reactor construction and endless human failure.
In Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident was caused by two natural disasters of unprecedented magnitude, which killed tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn from this accident as it did from the two preceding ones.
The EPR is a project which, as a result of this approach and the cooperation of the safety authorities of the French and German operators and constructors of nuclear power plants, enables it to be resilient to such phenomena.
As electrical engineers consider it desirable to build a nuclear power plant, a halt in Flamanville would be a fabulous gift to the competition of Areva and EDF, giving them the freedom to take the lead in the inevitable development of nuclear power.
It is inevitable and legitimate to seek the best energy bouquet for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotions, dogmas and party leaders dominate a debate that determines the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy of Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from many angles - overloading of police, judicial and administrative bodies due to a policy subject to figures, compatibility of this policy with the status of a "land of human rights", as France had called itself.
Recently, the government's harassment of foreign students was a major factor in the weekly news, and the Minister of the Interior had announced (see Liberation of 23 May) that France "needs no foreign talent, masonry or waiters".
But this policy has rarely been analyzed from an economic point of view.
The Commission has already adopted a number of proposals for a directive on the protection of workers' rights.
On the right, the tone was set by Jacques Chirac, who declared in 1976 that '900,000 unemployed, including over 2 million immigrant workers, should not be a problem for a country', and on the left by Michel Rocard, who had stated in 1990 that France 'could not take in all the poverty in the world'.
The only difference is the degree of grossness
In 2005, the fear of the invasion of the national soil by hordes of Polish plumbers was shared by both the right and the left.
Both camps saw immigrants as a burden on the French economy and society.
The only difference is the degree of cruelty one is willing to admit to the immigrant.
Francois Hollande's programme is limited to banalities which suggest that partnership development will enable us to solve our 'migration problems'.
This idea of immigration as a burden, as a problem, may have an impact on the elections, but it is economically costly.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron present in a recent paper summarizing the latest findings on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 p.), there is broad consensus among experts on the positive impact of immigrant influences on economic growth, wages and jobs in immigrant countries.
The Commission has already decided to take a decision on the basis of the information available to it.
The fears about the influence of migrants are based on the idea that they threaten to replace local workers, especially the less skilled, by putting pressure on their wages.
Experience shows, however, that immigrants are in fact much more complementary than local wage workers, as they focus on occupations in sectors that are technically uncomfortable.
The low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that attract little local wage labourers, the more skilled among immigrants work in dynamic sectors where training is not matched by the job offer.
Positive wage effect
Just as a surgeon would have difficulty working in a country where there is a shortage of anesthesiologists, this complementarity between locals and migrants also has a positive effect on wages and the domestic labour market situation.
Giovanni Peri calculated that an increase of 1% in the influx of immigrants would lead to a corresponding long-term increase in real wages between 0.6% and 0.9%.
And this without taking into account the fact that the diversity of ideas introduced by immigrants is beneficial for creation and economic growth (high proportion of American-born immigrants among Nobel laureates; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants also contribute net to social systems, in European countries on average about 1% of total budgets.
For example, the World Labour Organization estimates that a 30-year-old immigrant to Germany makes a net contribution to the public budget (income minus expenditure) of around 150,000 euros on average over his lifetime.
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to bring the missing intersections "with his teeth" to completion by the time he took office.
But these teeth, which were supposed to deter immigrants, did exactly the opposite.
Europe has invented democracy, now it is up to us to rethink European democracy
Democracy is a valuable asset; it is also a sensitive asset.
The European continent should be able to remember who, after its invention in Athens more than two thousand years ago, had overcome the tragedies of the First World War, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the Gulag, but also Francois in Spain, Salazars in Portugal and the Colonel in Greece during the entire 20th century.
Some people may have thought that the exercise of the right to vote was enough, in the most direct way possible, to see democracy once and for all conquer its enemies.
It has been known since Napoleon that "the little one" was a characteristic of the mindset.
The general right to vote, which is the necessary condition of democracy, is not a sufficient condition for this and can become just as well an 'instrument of repression' as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot put it at the time.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, separation and control of powers, education, education, economic and social community spirit, a judiciary.
The crisis in Europe we are in is an economic crisis, but it is also a political and democratic crisis.
The Greek truth-and-false referendum would have had a double explanatory character in this respect: firstly, the need for a strong return to politics, and, on the other hand, the worrying sense of its impossibility, its unnecessity.
This ambivalence should be considered outdated.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle have shifted today, and that the Republican soldiers, or at least most of them, are no longer aiming in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain from the successful national referendum, which was organised according to the needs and in the wrong order.
A free-for-all for the European monarch or a blindfolded leap into the void of nationalist retreat: a terrible choice for the citizen!
We are not talking about the European Parliament, but about the European Parliament.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal - and you don't know where to finish the list - because there is only one crisis, and that is Europe.
It is the whole of Europe, which is subject to the dictates of markets and credit rating agencies, which is suffering from its impotence and lack of solidarity.
It is all of Europe that is humiliated on an international level.
The Commission is concerned about the transfer of sovereignty towards Europe - and it is all of Europe that is losing its sovereignty gradually, and thus each of its associated nations.
The urgency lies in handing back the leadership of the European project to the people's sovereignty.
It is up to the European Community as a whole to reduce its debt burden, free itself from markets and build a future through investment.
The way out of the crisis is a condition for decisions at European level which cannot be taken without total democratic lawlessness and without leading us to ruin.
The Commission has already taken a number of steps to ensure that the Community's financial resources are fully used.
I agree.
But without political integration and a stronger democracy, as it urges citizens, this would be another foolishness and another dead end.
We must take on a new stage in European construction.
In order to create a republic in France, it was necessary to "create" Republicans.
The revolution of interests alone could not afford it.
This teaching will continue to be valid.
We must form a Europe that is more economically integrated.
This can only be achieved by creating a more politically democratic Europe, a truly European people's sovereignty.
We need Europeans to create Europe.
Contactless chip cards are becoming common
The World Chip Card Fair opens its doors in an optimistic manner on Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris.
According to Eurosmart, 2011 was actually set to end with an 11% increase in worldwide sales of microprocessor chips (EC cards, SIM cards and phones), with more than 6 billion units sold.
The most important part of this is contactless technology, which allows payments by public transport or balancing purchases by simply holding the card to a reader.
Compared to 320 million a year earlier, 460 million contactless chip cards are expected to be sold worldwide this year!
Their market share is expected to increase further in 2012 (580 million expected units) and represent over 10% of the global chip card market (6,925 million cards).
Europe is gaining ground on contactless payments after long lags behind the Asia-Pacific region.
Some 26 million Visa cards already have this feature, and 75,000 payment terminals accept it.
In France, the start is rather modest: only 400,000 contactless visa cards have been distributed.
However, consumer markets are steaming up.
Carrefour therefore issued 2.5 million contactless pass MasterCards this year.
In order to move at a higher speed, banks must now equip their customers with these cards.
"Two major French financial institutions have committed to systematically handing out contactless chip cards to their customers in the future", announced Gérard Nébouy, Director-General of Visa Europe France.
Banks are testing mobile payments
But this is only the first step towards the payment method of the future: mobile phones.
A very small percentage of devices are equipped with near field communication (NFC) technology, which is necessary to carry out these transactions.
"They're late".
"But they should at least see a real upward trend next year".
"We expect to sell 80 to 120 million units worldwide in 2012", explains Marc Bertin, Chairman of Eurosmart.
But the banks are taking the initiative.
The Crédit Agricole had announced yesterday the launch of a test run in Caen, which will run from December to next June.
The iPhone of some 200 customers and employees will be equipped with a capsule that allows contactless payment.
BPCE is carrying out a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the Société Générale also announced yesterday that it was preparing to launch a service offering that would allow its customers to pay contactlessly by telephone.
Terrorist front, from the Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the relations between al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The long-standing suspicion of links between the Islamic Maghreb terrorist group al-Qaeda (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram seems to be confirming itself.
On Sunday, Algeria's Deputy Prime Minister Abdelkader Messahel himself confirmed that Algeria had now "acquired certainty" about this.
"The way the two organisations operate and the intelligence services' relations indicate clear cooperation", he explained, without going into more detail.
Paris seems to be doing a similar analysis.
The investigation into the kidnapping of two Frenchmen in Niger last January has brought up interfaces.
Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory, kidnapped by Aqmi supporters at a Niamey restaurant, were reportedly killed the following day at the same time as several of their kidnappers during an operation carried out by French special forces.
French and Nigerian investigators have said they have found several phone chips belonging to the terrorists in the rubble at the site.
The terrorist axis
The analysis of the phone calls conducted leads to several interlocutors stationed in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), investigators are particularly interested in the numbers of two interlocutors: one number leads to a Nigerian who spent a long time in Maiduguri, a town in northern Nigeria that had been the cradle of Boko Haram; the other leads to a man who is considered close to the Aqmi and the sect.
"This is progress, but no doubt more clear evidence is needed before we can talk about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Harem".
"It's possible, though".
"It has been known for years that the sect receives financial and intellectual support from Auwen and that Auwen is increasingly active", says Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, these 'support services' have become increasingly visible, as have Boko Harem's speeches and operations, which now indicate the recruitment of suicide bombers and the use of increasingly complex explosives with the same handwriting as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, starting with Washington, has since pressured Abuja to address the problems caused by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have long considered the group a community of Illuminati that does not need special attention.
Successful
Boko Haram, founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist Iman Mohammed Yusuf - which in Haoussa means "Western education is a disgrace" - is pursuing the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, the merger is rapidly gaining ground.
It is politicising and demanding strict adherence to Sharia law while its affiliated activists fight against the godless central government.
The activists are targeting churches, bars and government agencies.
In 2009, Boko Haram activists were particularly active in their intensified attacks on the commissariats.
The response from Abuja, however, is as usual indifferent.
The army is surrounding the city, counting 800 dead.
The captive Mohammed Yusuf is killed in prison.
As a result, the sect has become increasingly radical and has abandoned its strongholds in the north.
Last Christmas, she confessed to an assassination in Jos that claimed 80 lives, then another in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram was blamed for a suicide bombing that occurred at the security-secured Abuja police headquarters - the first of its kind.
In August, the local United Nations headquarters will become the primary international destination.
The formation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which will lead from Mauritania to Nigeria to Somalia, has since alarmed all security experts.
While Aqmi has occupied Mali and Niger, Somali al-Shabaab operates in Kenya, Boko Haram appears to be a new threat in the center of the continent.
Last week, Alain Juppé, speaking with President Goodluck Jonathan in Nigeria, warned of Boko Harem and was ready to 'give all the clues'.
The world is full of Republican presidential candidates.
Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry are competing in simplification and ignorance about China, Iraq and aiding Israel.
Can a crisis-affected America lead to a complex world with simple, if not simple, ideas?
If you listen to the Republican presidential candidate like that, voters could almost get that impression.
For the past few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and their accomplices have repeatedly made their thunderous statements and statements regarding the traditional Republican focus on austerity.
The Commission has also been able to provide a number of proposals for the implementation of the programme.
The most prominent candidate for the Grand Old Party, Mitt Romney, threatened to bring the Chinese to the WTO and accuse them of currency manipulation, a leading issue in an America that is being fueled by the exodus of entire industries to Asia.
It is a foolish thing to do if this means starting a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former ambassador to China under Obama and the only candidate who seems to have a mature vision of austerity policy, has almost shut himself down over his emotionally flattering demeanor.
He called for a firm but constructive dialogue with Beijing (also Obama's current stance).
But Huntsman is not being heard, because he's stagnant in the depths of opinion polls.
Reagan's image
Romney also promised military strikes against Iran should the sanctions to halt the nuclear program fail.
"If I get elected, I'll order Iran to stop", he had said.
"If Obama is re-elected, they'll get the bomb".
He also promised Israel more military aid and accused Obama of being guilty of commitments to that partner.
The businessman Herman Cain, the second highest-ranked candidate, is showing a shameful lack of knowledge of the file.
He recently called for a counter to the Chinese military threat as Beijing "trying to develop a nuclear power" - and seemed to ignore the fact that China has had military nuclear weapons since 1964!
Governor Rick Perry of Texas, who supports Israel and calls for military action against Iran, has expressed his willingness to use the US military in Mexico to fight drug cartels.
Obama's 2009 ban on using torture against suspected terrorists was also supported by Cain, Perry and Michele Bachmann's candidacy.
You're a long way from John McCain, the 2008 Republican nominee, a major political figure.
Unlike current presidential opponents, Reagan also had simple ideas and despite all this won the Cold War.
They remind us that Obama himself was an amateur and had to pour water into his wine on the issue of counterterrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of his naive double-entry talks with Iran, the premature withdrawal of his 'boys' from Iraq, his indecision in Libya, which also gave him the reputation of weakness.
This hostility is not so unforced, however.
The public is more likely to appreciate the positive national security record under Obama, who turned off bin Laden.
Since Iraq, it has been wary of military interventions that lead to paralysis.
And Obama surprises more appropriately by arguing that America needs to be rebuilt economically to revive its leadership position.
Nord Stream, the new gateway to Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream gas pipeline, which runs on the Baltic Sea seabed and connects Western Europe directly to Russia, has been put into operation.
It is to supply gas equivalent to 30 million households.
The Russian gas giant Gazprom wanted to celebrate this event with glory and glory.
More than 500 invited guests, including four heads of state and government, attended the opening of the new Nord Stream gas pipeline, which connects Russia and Germany directly below sea level, on the Baltic coast last Tuesday, with orchestra and fine-tasting buffet.
The German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte have symbolically taken the wheel of the valve that carries Russian gas into the Western European network.
The new gas pipeline will supply 27.5 billion cubic metres of additional Russian gas per year through a first 1,224 km pipeline linking the St. Petersburg region with Mecklenburg-Vorpommern to Western Europe.
A second pipeline, which will provide a total supply of 55 billion cubic metres of gas - the equivalent of the total French consumption - is due to be completed by the end of 2012.
And you're already putting the possibility of building a third line on the same track.
For Gazprom, the timely and timely completion of this huge construction project is a victory.
The project was highly controversial in Poland and the Baltic States.
The Nord Stream pipeline will enable direct gas supply to Germany, avoiding any cross-country transit (Poland or Ukraine) by land.
The Commission has already decided to extend the period of validity of the agreement to the European Union.
Warsaw, the most involved in the debate, was not afraid to compare the North Stream pipeline with a "new German-Soviet pact" in connection with the alliance between Hitler and Stalin for the purpose of occupying Poland in 1939.
This means that the issue is extremely sensitive from a political point of view.
Western Europe has gained even greater security of supply by supporting this Russian project.
This is at the expense of a decline in European energy, as the project has broken a gap between Western and Eastern Europeans.
Russia has achieved in barely five years its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries that have high gas consumption and are declining gas reserves.
"This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that connects us in an organic way", François Fillon confirmed at the inauguration of the gas pipeline, pointing to the extent to which the large gas contracts are also politically and economically important.
All this explains the broad smile of the many represented Gazprom managers in Lubmin on the gas pipeline.
The construction of this gas line is also an outstanding technique.
The underwater pipeline is made of steel with a concrete liner to protect it from ship anchors.
It rests on the seabed, at about 200 meters.
The construction of the minefields was aided by the avoidance of minefields dating from World War II.
"Either hundreds of mines had to be removed or destroyed with caution", said Jens Müller, a spokesman for the Nord Stream Society.
In addition, increased measures were needed to protect fauna and flora.
The cable is a long metallic snake, weighing as much as 242 Eiffel Towers, and is not interrupted by anything over its entire length: neither valves nor maintenance stations.
A control platform was planned off the coast of Sweden, but the project managers refrained from doing so because the Swedes were not keen on seeing a Russian state-owned company permanently settle at the height of their coasts.
"In the event of an accident, we will close the gas passage in less than a minute", Jens Müller explained.
In the event of a leak, the gas in the gas pipeline escapes into the air.
However, this case is considered unlikely by the designers, as the welding seams have been estimated to have a leakage duration of one per 100,000 years.
State control of the gas transmission line shall be provided by both an underwater robot operated by a seagoing vessel for external observation purposes and a device circulating within the gas transmission line.
It is shaped like a cigar, measures one meter in diameter, is inserted into the inside of the pipe and is moved by the gas pressure.
After three full days of moving through the wire at a speed of 3 meters per second, the device will provide the most accurate information on any metal deformations on arrival.
The gas transmission line was designed to operate for fifty years without even the slightest repair.
The gas circulation is easily ensured by pressure.
This is 200 bar at the entry point, 100 bar at the exit point.
Five companies have joined forces to realize this project.
However, the management remains in the hands of Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares.
The German companies E. ON and BASF are also affiliated (each 15,5%), as are the Dutch Gasunie and the French GDF Suez group (each 9%).
These five companies have formed a business community called Nord Stream, which is responsible for the construction and operation of the gas transmission line.
It is based in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly low.
Gazprom then leased all the capacity of its gas transport to this company on a renewable 20-year contract.
"Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, no matter how large the actual volume of gas is", explained Mr Müller.
The gas pipeline construction was financed by 30% of shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
The total labour costs for both pipelines should be EUR 7.4 billion.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment amounted to 240 million.
The minority shareholders are, however, willing to recover their expenses, as Gazprom alone carries the risk of liability.
The gas pipeline is found on a sandy, pine-forested coastline near Lubmin in the Baltic Sea.
The four and a half metres high valves form the gas outlet.
Sensors measure the pressure, temperature and other metrics of incoming gas before it is transferred to the German gas transmission lines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal has been supplying one million cubic meters of Russian gas per leaking hour.
At full capacity, this would be 3 million cubic meters per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine, a branded notebook.
Moleskine, founded by an Italian company about fifteen years ago, wants to give writing a new style.
It's got a flair for adventure, candlelight hours with writing.
Moleskine's notebook is easily recognizable, with its black, rectangular bookbinding, rubber band, eggshell pages, as it has aged over time.
However, the Moleskine notebook as we know it today was created in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decided at the time to launch a distinguished design notebook.
Maria Sebregondi, then the company's technical advisor, is responsible for the launch of the new product.
The notebook was inspired by an old production technique called mole skin, which refers to a cotton wool, for example, used for upholstery benches.
This type of notebook was in great demand among writers and travelers.
"Moleskine has revived an old and almost forgotten object that was considered an icon of avant-garde artists until the 20th century", explains Maria Sebregondi, now brand manager at Modo Modo.
Success is coming.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% and established themselves with sales of 12,7 million units.
This is far from the usual production of the first years, when only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine crosses the Italian border and is exported to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to create a ghost image of the buyers, as the notebook enthralls business people as well as students and professionals.
Moleskine has the image of cosmopolitan, cultured and open-minded customers.
The small Italian company, which started with 12 employees, now employs over 100 people and has two offices since 2008; one in Milan and the other in New York.
The company sells its notebooks in bookstores, on internet portals such as Fnac, in small boutiques in the city centres and is committed to enforcing its identity.
"We have followed the spirit of the times and their new need for writing, which continues to exist despite the surge in e-mails", explained Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural feature is accompanied by the development of the company Moleskine: recently the brand has launched an exhibition called "Detour (Umweg) ", in which architects and artists exhibit their own notebooks.
In August, the company also launched a leopard-shaped booklet at the Locarno Film Festival.
Moleskine benefited from its success and this cultural spirit of the times and knew how to diversify its products: bags, calendar, filler, computer case... the brand has the full range of items.
A success that puts the borrower on the line: In the fall of 2006, Modo Modo was acquired by investment fund SG Capital Europe, now Syntegra Capital, opening a new chapter in the history of Moleskine.
Why is the unemployment rate of disabled workers so high?
About 19% of disabled people are looking for work.
Today is the 15th Week of Work for the Disabled.
Despite a targeted public policy introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate for disabled people is always twice the average: 19% versus 9% of the total population.
Discouraging?
"No", emphasizes Éric Blanchet, Director-General of the Adapt Association, which organizes the "Working Week for the Disabled".
"The progress made in 15 years is considerable".
"At that time, the unemployment rate was not twice as high, but three times as high".
"Nevertheless, there is still a tremendous amount of work to be done".
However, it must be said that many obstacles remain for the disabled unemployed to get a job.
The elderly are more likely to experience this: 37% are over 50 years old (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% of them do not have a bachelor's degree and there are only 10,000 disabled students among the 2.3 million students with higher education degrees.
Finally, longterm unemployment is also very widespread: 53% of people with disabilities compared to 38% overall.
In short, there are so many criteria that make it difficult to return to work and that are at the heart of the problem, says Christian Grapin, CEO of Tremplin, an association founded in 1992 that helps companies recruit disabled workers.
So much for the actual brakes.
The unspoken remains, the attitudes that are certain to develop but slow to develop.
A study conducted by the IMS Entrepreneurs' Association in April for the journal La Cité indicated that managers surveyed had "a low level of knowledge about disabled people" that was "overrepresented" by "people in wheelchairs, mentally or intellectually disadvantaged".
The result is that private companies with more than 20 employees still have a long way to go to achieve the target of 6% of disabled workers set by a 1987 law.
These figures, which date from 2008, represent a ratio of 2,6%.
"We are now at 3%", reports Pierre Blanc, director general of Agefiph, the organisation tasked with recruiting contributions from companies that violate this law.
The evidence: the number of 'fee paying' establishments decreased, as did the sum of the amounts paid between 2007 and 2011, from 59,000 to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 law, which provides for contributions to be increased, put a strong pressure on companies", explained Pierre Blanc.
"But this improvement also reflects real knowledge, particularly among the large groups of companies".
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of the establishments employing between 20 and 49 employees are handicapped workers, compared with 82% of enterprises employing between 100 and 199 employees.
Hazard: "What a blessing".
Even before they turned their faces to the "Blue Tuesday evening" (20:45), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens had not hidden the pleasure of the friendly game.
It would be too far to say there was a secret agreement between them, but the picture speaks symbolically.
Sitting side by side on the stage of the Stade de France, George Leekens and Eden Hazard would have been happy to make peace.
Five months after his attacking player's temperamental gesture against Turkey, the Belgian national coach had reaped nothing but praise for himself.
"I am very pleased with Eden, his progress and the fact that he is Belgian".
"I want to look ahead", assures the native Liller.
As for the contrast between his performance in club and National Eleven, "It's a unit that justifies everything".
"I'm in Lille all year long, which is not the case in Belgium".
"It's time for me to get to the start".
Hazard will be coming to Saint Denis, bringing in Friday night against Romania in the match against France to finally "glow".
But without omitting the note of "pleasure".
He has been a member of the French national team since he was seven years old, leading his victorious campaigns between 1998 and 2000.
"I have always been supported", he confirmed.
This will inevitably contribute to reinforcing the 'unique' nature of this encounter.
"Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) will be present", he said.
"We just crossed the road".
"To play against them means great happiness!"
Leekens, for his part, kindly let "pride" be anchored.
The pride of a gala.
Proud to confirm that France has once again become a very high-level team, just over a year after the trauma of Knysna.
"Laurent Blanc has done a damn good job", he said enthusiastically.
Although Belgium will miss the next European Championship, the engineer is very likely to share the plane with the Blues (the French national team) ... heading to Brazil in 2014.
"We little Belgians come out big", he stressed.
"We're planning something, the players are ambitious, they're hungry".
"You'll notice that in the upcoming games". The game against France involved.
Portugal is very confident
The Portuguese team under Paulo Bento is very optimistic about the match against Bosnia at 22:00 on Tuesday in Lisbon.
The two teams had not been very specific in their game.
"At the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and above all a happy country".
Paulo Bento has already been to Poland and Ukraine.
He has no doubt that his national team, La Selecçao, for which he has been responsible since September 2010, will qualify for the 2012 European Championship.
For Portugal, this is actually only 90 minutes of happiness.
But there's a match to play and an opponent to serve, and that's Bosnia.
Given the 0-0 game on Friday in hell at Zenica, it seems obvious that the dice have not fallen yet.
Portugal clearly dominated the game for more than an hour, but the team was unable to impress the important stamp that would have taken the pressure off of it.
"This is a good result, but it also carries some risk, as we have not achieved a good result".
At home, however, in their brightly lit Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced to beat themselves in front of an audience that should be equally keen on the game, even if the match was of course advertised as 'very short', optimistic but clear-sighted Bento said.
"We expect a very tight match, but are fully convinced that we can win the upper hand", explained the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have a 50% chance of being in the 2012 European Championship", said Carlos Queiroz' successor.
The draw on Friday in Bosnia forces the Portuguese to score a goal and win.
A draw may be enough for the Bosnians, who also need a goal.
"This is a good result, but it also carries some risk, as we have not achieved a good outcome", Bento regrets.
"We will be playing a team with high technical qualities and players with many individual qualities", he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese had planned to put maximum pressure on the Bosnians from the beginning to 'give them no time to think'.
A good idea, provided that it is put into practice this time.
