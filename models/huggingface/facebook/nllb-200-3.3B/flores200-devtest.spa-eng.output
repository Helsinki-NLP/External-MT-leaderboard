We concur with the USOC's statement that the interests of athletes, clubs and their sports can be served more appropriately if we move forward with significant changes within our organization, rather than with the removal of the certifications.
USA Gymnastics supports an independent investigation that can clarify how the abuse of proportion that Larry Nassa's survivors so bravely described could have gone unseen for so long and accepts any necessary and appropriate change.
The goal of USA Gymnastics and the USOC is the same: to make gymnastics and other sports as safe as possible for athletes to pursue their dreams in a protected, positive, and empowered environment.
During the 1960s, Brzezinski worked for John F. Kennedy in an advisory capacity and later for the Lyndon B. Johnson administration.

In addition to confirming that at least some dinosaurs were feathered, an already widely held theory, it also offers specific data that fossils usually do not, such as their color and three-dimensional structure.
According to experts, this animal has a brown plumage in the upper zone and a pale or carotenoid tone in the lower part.
The discovery also provides a better understanding of the evolution of bird feathers.
Since dinosaur plumage lacks a well-developed shaft, called a rachis, but does have other features of feathers (pig and barbels), the researchers concluded that the rachis was likely the result of a later evolutionary development of these other features.
The structure of the plumage suggests that its function was not related to flight, but that they were used to regulate the temperature or as an indicator of it. The researchers argue that, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the analyzed sample has features of the plumage of an adult and not a chick.
Experts concluded that even though the tail was from a young dinosaur, the plumage was more like that of an adult than that of a chick.

Although it was a purely theoretical work, the programme was written with the aim of simulating the observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
It would be the tidal forces between the dark matter present in the galaxy and that of the Milky Way that would cause the effect expected by the group of scientists.
The Milky Way influences the Sagittarius galaxy in the same way that the moon exerts a force of attraction on our planet and causes tides.
Experts concluded that dark matter affects each other just as regular matter does.
This theory holds that most of the dark matter surrounding a galaxy is located around it in a kind of halo and is composed of numerous small particles.

Extremely resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) was first detected by Dr. Tony Moll in the southern African area of Zululandia.
During an interview, he noted that the new variant was generating "a lot of concern and alarm, given its high mortality rate".
Dr. Moll believes that some patients may have contracted the virus inside the hospital and that at least two of the infected were healthcare workers at that hospital.
In a year, an infected person can infect 10 to 15 people with whom he has been in close contact.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB in the total tuberculosis patient group still appears to be low: 6000 of a total of 333 000 individuals infected at any one time in South Africa.

"While their thermal behavior is not as regular as large caves on our planet, which tend to maintain a fairly stable temperature, it is consistent with these deep cavities in the ground", said Glen Cushing, of the archaeology team at the USGS and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
Elections in France have traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a cubicle and put a pre-printed ballot in an envelope indicating the candidate they have chosen.
After the officials confirm the identity of the voter, the voter enters the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voter list.
The French electoral law sets out the procedures quite strictly.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have had to be transparent, allowing voters and observers to verify that there are no envelopes at the beginning of the ballot and that no envelopes are added other than those of those who vote, duly computed and authorized.
Candidates are allowed to send representatives to control each stage of the process, and overnight, volunteers count the votes under strict supervision and in accordance with specific procedures.

February 16 is the date on which Huhne and Pryce are scheduled to appear before the Westminster Magistrates' Court.
Nicholas Alden and Zachary Cuddeback, 25 and 21 years old, respectively, were killed, the latter driving.
Edgar Veguilla suffered injuries to his arm and jaw, while Kristoffer Schneider required facial reconstructive surgery.
Uka's weapon jammed while aiming for the head of a fifth man. Schneider suffers from permanent pain, cannot see with one of his eyes, is missing part of his skull, and his face had to be reconstructed with titanium.
Schneider gave his testimony via a virtual link from a United States Air Force base in his home country.
Carpanedo participated in two individual races of the championship apart from the competition on Wednesday.
The first was the slalom, in which he obtained a No Finished the first race, as did 36 of the 116 participants in that race.
In her other race, the giant slalom, she took tenth place in the women's group of the sit-downs with a combined running time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes behind the first Austrian finalist, Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes below the ninth finalist, Gyöngyi Dani, from Hungary.
Four seated skiers failed to complete their runs and a total of 45 participants out of 117 in the Giant Slalom failed to qualify for the race.
The Madhya Pradesh police force was able to recover the stolen laptop and cell phone.
Deputy Inspector General, D.K. Arya, stated: We have arrested five individuals who abused the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop.
Baba, Bhutha, Rampro, Gaza and Vishnu Kanjar are the accused.
According to police superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although there were three people inside the home at the time of the car's impact, none of them sustained injuries.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services were removing the driver of the red Audi TT from inside.
He was initially transferred to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been in Edinburgh County Court, charged with the murder of her son.
While she is in custody awaiting indictment and trial, any eyewitness testimony may be questionable, as her image has been widely circulated.
It is common practice in other parts of the UK, but because the Scottish justice system operates differently, the courts have considered the publication of photographs to be potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee said: "Journalists seem to be walking on dangerous ground when they publish photos or other information of suspects".
The Crown Office, which is in charge of the prosecutions, told reporters that no further comment would be made at least until the auto of prosecution is dictated.
According to leaked information, the document will deal with the border conflict, which Palestine intends to resolve based on the existing borders in the form before the 1967 Middle East War.
Other topics also touched upon, reportedly, included the future status of Jerusalem, which both nations consider sacred, and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel demands a constant military presence in the valley for ten years once the agreement is signed, while the PA only accepts five.
During the complementary pest control trial, the rangers were to closely monitor the shooters as the shooters were being monitored and their effectiveness assessed.
In a joint venture between NPWS and the Sport Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., eligible volunteers were recruited within the Sport Shooters Association's hunting program.
Mick O'Flynn, who is in charge, provisionally, of the NPWS Park Conservation and Heritage office, noted that comprehensive safety and training training was provided to the four shooters selected for the shooting operation.
Yesterday, Martelly was sworn into a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
In four years, this is Martelly's fifth CEP.
Last month, a presidential commission advised the former CEP to resign, as part of a series of measures aimed at steering the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's way of responding to the widespread demonstrations that began in October against the regime.
The sometimes violent demonstrations were triggered by the fact that elections have not been held, in some cases since 2011.
Nearly 60 cases of iPods with malfunctions and overheating have been reported, resulting in six fires and minor burns to four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) reported 27 accidents involving these devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company categorized as "not serious".
The ministry took issue with the delay in Apple's report, saying it was "really regrettable".
Mariana was rocked by an earthquake at 7:19 am local time (21:19 am GMT) on Friday.
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Agency said there was no damage on the national territory.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also reported the absence of tsunami indicators.
In the Philippine capital of Manila, a former police officer hijacked a bus and held captive tourists from Hong Kong.
Rolando Mendoza opened fire with his M16 at the foreign visitors.
Several hostages have been rescued and, so far, at least six are confirmed dead.
Both the six hostages, including children and the elderly, and the Filipino photographers were released early.
Later, photographers took the place of an old woman who needed to go to the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began to study medicine.
She trained as a midwife and entered work for the National Women's Hospital in Auckland around 1959.
Liggins began her research into premature birth in her spare time, while working at the hospital.
His study showed that the fetal lung maturation of the baby could be accelerated through the administration of a hormone.
Xinhua reported that government investigators managed to recover the flight recorders from the black box on Wednesday.
Luna's fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to him.
Tommy Dreamer stated: Luna was the first queen of the Extremo. She died the night of the two moons, something unique, like her. A strong woman.
Dustin Gold in Dust Runns stated, "Moon was as rare as I am, even more so. I love her and I will miss her. I hope she is in a better place".
Since 2008, there has been an 8% increase in the 1,400 respondents to the 2010 federal election who oppose Australia becoming a republic.
Julia Gillard, the interim Prime Minister, said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic after Queen Elizabeth II's term ended.
34% of those polled share this view and want Elizabeth II to be the last Australian queen.
At one end of the poll 29% of people think Australia should become a republic as soon as possible; at the other 31% think it should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was due to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle, and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but his fitness has been called into question following his complaints.
He couldn't take any pain medication, because it's forbidden to use it at the Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number ever known.
Many people checked the find using various types of hardware and software and in early February it was made public on Tuesday.
Comets may have served as a source of water for our planet, as well as organic matter, which has the ability to form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists' hope is to understand how planets, especially our own, originate, since comets crashed into Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor earlier this year and last month signed a bill allowing same-sex couples to marry.
He called the rumours "political gibberish and bobbering".
He is speculated to run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the Federal Aviation Administration says would shorten airline flight distances, which would save millions of gallons of fuel per year, as well as carbon emissions.
It employs satellite technology, in contrast to the old ground-based radar technology, in order to enable air traffic controllers to detect aircraft with greater precision and provide more accurate data to pilots.
No additional transport will be implemented and trains will not stop at Wembley.
Due to concern over possible transportation issues, the possibility of the game being held behind closed doors, without the team's fans, was considered.
On Thursday, Science magazine released a research reporting the appearance of a new species of bird in the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Experts from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have revealed that the new species evolved in just two generations, even though it was estimated that it would take much longer, because of the reproduction between an endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortes, and a migratory cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can take on all kinds of shapes and roll into tiny figures.
Not only can it be hammered and rolled into sheets, but it can also be stretched to a very fine wire that can be twisted and braided.
It can be made very thin and adhered to another metal, so thin that it was used to decorate the hand-drawn illustrations in books called illuminated manuscripts.
This is called the pH of a chemical substance. You can make a pH indicator using kale juice.
The colour of cabbage juice will be altered depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The number of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) present in the analyte determines its pH level.
Hydrogen atoms are made up of a proton and an electron, so a hydrogen ion is the result of a proton being stripped of its electron.
Shake both dry powders together and, after doing so, with hygienic and moist hands, squeeze them to form a ball.
There will be a reaction between the moisture in your hands and the outer layers, which will feel strange to the touch and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flush toilets in almost every home, which were connected to a sophisticated sewer system.
In some homes in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece, vestiges of sewer systems were found.
Public toilets were also used in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, public baths had toilets, and some were shared by men and women.
When you communicate with someone thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it back almost instantly.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket, and scientists use telescopes in space because the light from the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and sight we have.
A giant rocket, over 100 feet high, is needed to carry a satellite or telescope into outer space.
The wheel has changed the world in amazing ways, but the most important thing it has done for us is to give us a much simpler and faster way of transportation.
Thanks to it, we now have many means of transport, such as the railway or the car, among many others.
Below, there are more moderate-sized cats that feed on medium prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small felines (which include independent domestic cats) that feed on smaller species that are much more abundant, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of niche: each cat has a particular function, which prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the most sociable of all the cats, and their lives are spent in large groups called packs.
The herds are made up of one to three adult males from the same family group, joined by up to thirty females and their young.
Females are usually closely related to each other, making them a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lions have the same behavior as wolves or dogs, with whom they have a striking similarity (unlike other large felines) both in their behavior and in that they are highly lethal to their prey.
An all-around athlete, the tiger has the ability to climb (but not very well), swim, leap and pull five times as hard as a robust person.
The tiger is of the same genus (Panthera) as the lion, leopard, and jaguar. These are the only four felines capable of roaring.
The tiger's roar is not a fully sounded roar like that of the lion, but rather, a sentence of words spoken to grunts and shouts.
Ocelots enjoy feeding on small creatures, and if possible, they will hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds, almost all of which are much smaller than their own.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find prey by smell, smelling the ground they have passed.
They have excellent night vision and in dark places and, in addition, they move very stealthily. The birds hunt their prey by mimicking their environment and then they swoop on them.
When a small group of living things (a small population) moves away from the main one from which they came (for example, if they move to a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island so that they cannot easily go back) they will often find themselves in an environment different from the one they used to be used to.
The new environment has different resources and competitors and therefore a new population will need different characteristics or adaptations from what it had before to be a strong competitor.
There have been no changes in the original population, which still needs the same adaptations as in the past.
Over time, as the nascent population adapts to the new environment, it begins to look less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that it will no longer be possible to classify them as the same species.
This process is called speciation, which simply means the development of new species, and is an inevitable consequence and a fundamental part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that people breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that they exhale (put out).
Plants generate food from the sun's energy, thanks to photosynthesis, and they also provide us with shade.
We build our houses from plants, and we also make clothes from plants, and most of the food we eat is plant food, and without plants, animals would not survive.
The Mosasaurus was the alpha predator of its time, so it feared nothing but its own kind.
Its long jaws had more than 70 razor-sharp teeth embedded in them, plus another group in the palate, meaning that whatever passed in front of it, it had no escape.
We don't know for sure, but it could have had viperine, and its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurids, and it could even have been a cannibal.
He also attacked any creature that entered the water: not even a dinosaur as huge as the T. Rex was a threat to him.
While most of that food would be quite familiar to us, the Romans also ate certain unconventional items at banquets, such as wild boar, peacocks, snails, and even a type of rodent, the lyre.
Another thing that they differed in was that the humble people and the women ate sitting in a chair, while the wealthy enjoyed sharing banquets and side-slipping while they ate.
It is not possible that the recipes of ancient Rome included foods that came to Europe from America or Asia centuries later.
Verbigracia, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa and no Roman of old ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a central temple for each of their gods as their home.
People brought sacrifices to the gods, and priests sought to meet the needs of those by holding ceremonies and festivals.
The temples have an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary that only priests could enter.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special shrine to his deity.
In the midst of the warm Middle Eastern climate, the house was not of much importance.
Hebrew families spent most of their time outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard, shops were just counters facing the street, houses were built with stone.
The land of Canaan lacked large forests, so the cost of timber was extremely high.
According to the Norse sagas, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and, during a journey further west, discovered the island and named it after himself.
However, despite their discovery, the Eskimo tribes already inhabited the area by that time.
While each country was separately 'Scandinavian', there were marked differences in relation to people, monarchs, customs and history between Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although the back of the document contains some writing, it is not a treasure map.
The Declaration of Independence has the phrase "Original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776" written on its reverse. The text appears at the bottom of the document, face down.
Although it is not known for certain who wrote it, it is known that as soon as it was made, the huge parchment document (measuring 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was rolled up for safekeeping.
Therefore, it is likely that the annotation was added only as a label.
Although the landings on D-Day and subsequent battles had liberated northern France, the southern side was still to be liberated.
Its government was in the hands of the Vichy French, who were a group that, in 1940, had agreed peace with the Germans and were working with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the so-called Operation Dragon was deployed, through which the Allies invaded southern France.
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were on their way to Germany.
A civilization can be defined as a specific culture of which a large group of people living and working together form part; that is, a society.
The term civilization derives from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, and is related both to the word civis, from the same language, meaning citizen, and to civitas, whose meaning is city or city state and which, in addition, determines in some way the size of society.
Cities-states are the precursors of nations. A culture of civilization involves a long generational transmission of knowledge, a lasting cultural legacy and a homogeneous spread.
Minority cultures often disappear without leaving any relevant historical traces, and fail to be recognized as civilizations proper.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government under the Articles of Confederation, with Congress as its only component.
Congress had no power to tax, and since it had a national executive or judicial branch, the taxing function fell to state authorities, who often failed to cooperate in enforcing all their laws.
Nor was he empowered to override tax laws or interstate tariffs.
The articles required the unanimous approval of all the states to proceed with their amendment and the states gave so little importance to the central government that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national team, is the second most successful team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Among the most widely practiced sports are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice-joke, roller-skating and Formula 1 racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern areas, with athletes participating in international tournaments and Olympic events.
Japan is made up of nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making it the seventh largest archipelago in the world.
Due to the conglomerate/group of islands it contains, Japan is often referred to as an archipelago, from a geographical point of view.
The history of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when European sailors sailing through the area recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, that is, beautiful island.
The establishment of a base in southwestern Taiwan by the Dutch East India Company in 1624 initiated a transformation in the aboriginal method of grain production, employing Chinese labor to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
The Qing dynasty (1644-1912) army took control of the northern and western coastal region of Taiwan in 1683 and declared the latter a dependent province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after being defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government acceded to the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which retained control over the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three main constructions: Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings at the ends of the complex have been reconstructed so that tourists can visualize how they originally looked.
By 1976 thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and work continues today.
For example, the most common still image photography format globally is 35 mm, which was the most commonly used film size towards the end of the analog film era.
It's still being produced today, but more importantly, its dimensional relationship has been transferred to the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
In truth, the 35 mm format is somewhat confusing, since its measurements are 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
Hence the dimension ratio of this format (divided by twelve in order to calculate the simplest integer ratio) is said to be 3:2.
Many typical formats (e.g. wordplay, APS group of formats) are the same or very similar to this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, which has been constantly mocked and often ridiculed, is a simple rule that generates dynamism while allowing a certain order to the images.
It indicates that the most effective position to place the central object is the intersection that forms between the horizontal and vertical lines that divide the image into thirds (see example).
During this phase of European history, the Catholic church, which had accumulated wealth and power, was challenged.
For more than a millennium, Christianity had managed to unite the European states despite their different languages and customs.
His power, present everywhere, affected everyone from the monarch to the common people.
One of the most important principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that church funds be set aside for that specific function.
The central dome of the church had remained in Rome for more than a millennium, and this concentration of power and money caused many to wonder whether this principle was being respected.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, the British began a naval blockade of Germany.
While the strategy, which involved the disruption of vital military and civilian supplies, was successful, it violated the widely recognized international law enshrined in several international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain drew international waters in entire sections of the ocean to block the entry of ships, putting at risk even neutral vessels.
Having received a reduced response against this tactic, Germany expected to meet a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
Throughout the 1920s, the attitude adopted by most citizens and nations was one of pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, countries wanted to prevent a similar situation from happening again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States in order to take a job at the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents, a book of poems and a letter of recommendation made by Charles Batchelor (his manager at his last job) and addressed to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of delimiting the different time periods. Each stage or each family in power constituted a different dynasty.
Between each dynasty, there was also a period of instability, with provinces divided. The best known was the Three Kingdoms, which developed over 60 years, between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these stages, a bloody war broke out between many nobles vying for the throne.
One of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history was the Three Kingdoms, where thousands of people died in a struggle to occupy the throne of the great palace in Xi'an.
There are many political and social consequences, such as the use of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the conviction that the country belongs to the people, and not to a single sovereign.
Likewise, after the Revolution, the posts were open to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and prestigious to succeed.
The same is true of the military, since, instead of basing army ranks on classes, they now base them on caliber.
The French Revolution was also a source of inspiration for many other people from the repressed working class in other countries to face their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond this worldly life. He used to visit a cave that became known as Hira on the mountain of Noor (light) to meditate.
The cave itself, which has endured through time, illustrates very realistically Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
On the summit of one of the mountains north of Mecca, lies a cave completely abstracted from the rest of the planet.
It is very difficult to find, even if you were sure it exists.
Nothing can be seen but the wonderful clear sky and the numerous surrounding mountains. From inside this cave, very little of this world can be seen or heard.
Of the Seven Wonders, the only one still standing is the Great Pyramid of Giza.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptian people in the third century B.C.E., is one of many pyramid-shaped and large structures built to honor the late pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or Necropolis of Giza, in the Valley of the Dead, Egypt, contains numerous pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, temples, and the great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many other smaller pyramid tombs and temples were erected in honor of his wives and relatives.
The arco upward mark resembles a V and the arco downward mark is similar to a staple or a square without its bottom edge.
Up means you should start at the tip and push the bow, and down means you should start at the frog, where the hand holds the bow, and pull it.
The upward movement of the bow produces a softer sound, while a downward one is stronger and sharper.
Feel free to make your own markings with pencils, but do not forget that the markings on the bows were made there for a musical purpose and should therefore be respected.
On October 6, 1789, a mob of market women forced the terrified monarch Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette, her two young sons (Maria Theresa, eleven years old, and Louis Charles, four) and the king's sister, Madam Elizabeth, to return to Paris from Versailles.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a mob that shouted and threats against the king and queen.
The mob forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriage wide.
At one point, a participant in the revolt shook the head of a royal guard executed at Versailles in front of the panicked queen.
The Filipino people themselves paid the war expenses of U.S. imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to the US colonial regime in order to pay off most of the expenses and interest on bonds that floated on behalf of the Philippine government in Wall Street banks.
From then on, the super profits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the main profits of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that gave rise to the order's establishment.
The European historical period in which these events occur is usually referred to as the High Middle Ages, between the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (i.e. between 1000 and 1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages which, by convention, ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a concept that comprises, pragmatically, a wide range of ideas, from the technological impulse or imperative to a strict sense that there is an underlying logic that drives humanity's fate and that relates to the laws of science and how they are shaped in technology.
Almost all interpretations of technological determinism have in common two general ideas: that technological development itself unfolds along a path independent of any cultural or political influence and that, at the same time, technology has "effects" on societies that are inherent and not socially conditioned.
To give an example, one might argue that the existence of cars necessarily derives from the development of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically viable for a small volume of automobiles, so new manufacturing techniques are being designed to reduce the costs of owning a vehicle.
The massive use of cars also results in an increased incidence of traffic accidents, leading to the development of new techniques in the health field to repair damaged bodies.
The element of cultural determinism was very much present in Romanticism, according to scholars such as Goether, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped people and, over time, customs and cultures related to that geography developed that, being in harmony with the location of that society, were preferable to laws that were arbitrarily imposed.
Just as Paris is known as the city of fashion today, Constantinople was considered as such in feudal Europe.
Its reputation as an epicenter of luxury began in about 400 BC and extended until about 1100 AD.
During the 12th century, its status declined, especially because the returning crusaders brought gifts, such as silks and spices, which were valued more highly than goods offered in Byzantine markets.
The title of "capital of fashion" was thereafter transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The heyday of the Gothic style occurred in the period between the 10th-11th and 14th centuries.
At first, the dress was greatly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, because of the slowness of the communication channels, Western styles may be some 25 to 30 years behind.
Toward the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style, and one of the most significant developments of the period was the use of buttons to fasten garments.
Subsistence farming is farming that aims to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family group alone.
Subsistence farming is a simple, generally organic, practice that combines the use of stored seeds native to the ecological region with crop rotation or other comparatively simple methods to maximize production.
Historically, much of the main activity of farmers was subsistence agriculture, which is still practised in many developing countries.
Subcultures congregate individuals with similar ideas and feelings of marginalization by social norms and give them the possibility of generating a sense of identity.
There are many factors that can distinguish subcultures: age, ethnicity, class, location, or gender of its members.
The traits that distinguish a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, sexual, geographic, or be related to religion or politics, or a mixture of factors.
It is common for members of a subculture to exhibit traits of belonging by resorting to distinctive and symbolic use of style, such as fashions, gestures, and jargon.
One of the most commonly used mechanisms to graph the importance of socializing is to analyze the few and unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, misfortune or intentional abuse, were not socialized by adults during their growth.
Some wild children are confined by people, usually their parents, and in some cases, the abandonment of a child is due to the parents' rejection of the child's severe intellectual or physical disability.
It is possible that the wild children suffered traumatic situations or severe child abuse before they were abandoned or fled.
Others are said to have been raised by animals and some to have lived on their own in the wild.
When the feral child is raised exclusively by animals other than humans, it presents behaviors (within its physical possibilities) almost as a whole equal to those of the specific animal that cared for it, as well as its fear or indifference towards people.
While project-based learning should make that process easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes a little further.
Scaffolding is not a learning technique; rather, it is an assistance that provides support to those who are going through a new experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The scaffolding can be presented in both real and virtual formats; in other words, a teacher is a type of scaffolding, but so is the little animated paper clip of Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are embedded in the software and their function is to question, stimulate or explain procedures that may have been complex for the student alone.
Children are placed in foster care for a wide variety of reasons, from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment where there is no love, care and education; but it happens.
We can see that the foster care system provides a safe environment for these children.
The goal of our foster care system is to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, sustained education and reliable medical care.
The aim of family care is to meet all the needs that were not met in the household from which they were previously collected.
The Internet brings together and blends the components of mass communication and people-to-people communication.
The various features of the Internet open up new dimensions from the perspective of the concept of uses and rewards.
For example, 'learning' and 'socialization' are identified as significant incentives for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
In a study of user reactions to websites conducted by Eighmey and McCord (1998), personal involvement and long-term relationships were also detected as new motivational factors.
Through video recording, important breakthroughs have been made in the interpretation of microexpressions, which are facial movements of only a few milliseconds in duration.
Specifically, it is argued that, by properly reading their microexpressions, it is possible to detect whether a person is lying.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, explained how those who cannot understand speech because of brain damage can, nevertheless, accurately assess sincerity.
It even suggests that the abilities to interpret human behavior can be shared with animals, such as domestic dogs.
Through the research work of the 20th century it has been shown that there are two groups of genetic variation: the hidden and the manifest.
The process of mutation incorporates a new genetic variation; that of selection removes it from that set of variations.
Segregation and recombination shuffle the variation between one and the other generation after generation.
In the savannah, it is not easy for a primate, whose digestive system is similar to that of humans, to satisfy its amino acid needs with the plant resources available to it.
Moreover, failure to do so leads to serious problems - stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The proteins in leaves and legumes would have been the most easily accessible source of plant resources, but they are not easily digestible by primates like us, unless they are cooked.
On the other hand, foods derived from animals (ant, termites, eggs) are easy to digest, while providing a large number of proteins containing all the essential amino acids.
In short, it should not surprise us if our own predecessors were solving their "protein problems" in the same way that savanna chimpanzees do today.
Sleep disruption consists of intentionally waking up during the normal sleep period and falling asleep after a while (10 to 60 minutes).
This can easily be accomplished with a more or less gentle alarm clock that brings him back to a conscious state, though without fully waking him.
Registration is an additional requirement for the visa process.In some countries, you will need to register your presence and your accommodation address with the local authorities.
Other options based on the biological rhythm are to drink plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bedtime, which will force you to get up to urinate.
The degree of inner peace that a person enjoys is inversely related to the amount of tension in his body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force we have, each of us has the potential to find absolute peace and happiness.
We can all reach enlightenment, the only thing that stands in the way is our own tension and negativity.
While the foundations of Tibetan Buddhism are the teachings of Buddha, they were spread by the Mahayana path of love and numerous yoga techniques from India.
In general terms, secularism is very simple, it's based on kundalini yoga, meditation and the all-encompassing path of love.
In Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (illumination) is activated with yoga positions, breathing practices, mantras or visualizations.
Tibetan meditation focuses on Devata Yoga, through the visualization of various deities, energy channels can be unblocked, chakras can be activated, and enlightened consciousness can be developed.
The cooperation between the USSR and the USA was the result of facing a common enemy, Germany, during the Second World War. After the war, the clashes of system, process and culture ended up distancing the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It would spread over the next 40 years and be fought in real life, through proxy militias, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
Because by 17 September 1939 the Polish defences were already broken, their only hope was to retreat and reorganize themselves in the extension of the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans fell into disuse almost overnight, when more than 800,000 combatants of the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and formed the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland, in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international, bilateral and multilateral agreements.
Using ships to transport goods is a much more efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods across the oceans.
The Navy's role has always been to ensure that its country retains the power to move its people and goods, while interfering with the enemy's ability to do the same.
The North Atlantic campaign in World War II provides one of the clearest and most recent examples of this.
At the same time, the German navy, using mainly submarines, tried to cancel this circulation.
If the Allies had not succeeded, Germany might have taken power in Britain, as it did with the other European countries.
Goats were apparently first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
For the purpose of easily obtaining their milk, hair, meat, and leather, ancient peoples and tribes began to stay with them.
Domestic goats were usually gathered in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, often tended by goat herders who were usually children or teenagers, similar to the more popular shepherd. These grazing methods are still used today.
In England, railways had already been set up by the 16th century.
Even though the wagon rails were made of simple parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses pulling them to achieve greater speed and to pull heavier loads than on the slightly more rough roads of the day.
The addition of sleepers to hold the rails in place came early, but it was gradually realized that the rails would be more efficient if they were lined with iron on top.
This became a common practice, although iron caused more wear on the wagons' wooden wheels.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced with iron ones, and in 1767 solid iron rails began to be used.
The first known form of transportation was walking, which humans began doing in an upright position two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus (meaning upright man).
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not have the habit of walking upright.
While traces of bipedation have been found in Australopithecine fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, it is possible that Sahelanthropus walked on two legs 7 million years ago.
We can start living more friendly to the planet, we can join environmental movements or even become activists and fight to reduce, to some extent, future suffering.
It is, in many cases, asymptomatic treatment, but if we are not looking for a temporary situation, we should find the root of the problems and try to deactivate them.
It is evident that the world has undergone great changes as a result of mankind's technological and scientific advances, and the problems have been intensified by overcrowding and people's extravagant life-styles.
After being passed by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congress president John Hancock and secretary Charles Thomson was sent to John Dunlap's printing house a few blocks away.
Between 150 and 200 copies were made during the night, which are now known as the "Dunlap Copies".
It was John Nixon who first read the document and did so in the courtyard of Independence Hall, on July 8.
On July 6, a copy was sent to George Washington, who ordered it read to his army in New York on July 9, and on August 10 another copy arrived in London.
The 25 photographs of Dunlap, known to still exist, are the oldest preserved copies of the document. The original manuscript has been lost.
A lot of paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive today.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs, because they have feathers and they can fly.
However, there are many features in birds that still resemble dinosaurs.
They have scaly, clawed limbs, they lay eggs and they move on their hind legs just like the T-Rex.
Today, almost all computers operate on the basis of manipulation of data encoded under the binary system.
A binary number can only have one of two values, they are 0 and 1, and, according to computer jargon, these numbers are known as binary digits, or bits.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent, and symptoms, such as vomiting, are too common to be diagnosed immediately.
The clearest indicator of internal poisoning may be found with an open bottle of toxic medication or cleaning chemicals.
Read the label for specific information on first aid relevant to that specific poison.
Entomologists use the term "parasite" in a formal sense to refer to this group of arthropods.
The word comes from their ancient relationship with bedbugs, a species highly developed to parasitize humans.
Killer and bed bugs are nest-builders; they are adapted to inhabit their host's nest or home.
The number of reported cases of MS in the United States is close to 400,000, making it the most common neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
The central nervous system, the junction of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve, is the target of attack in multiple sclerosis.
Studies have shown that women are twice as likely as men to have MS.
A couple might conclude that raising a baby would not be in their best interests or in the best interests of the child.
These couples could choose to plan for the adoption of a baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that a different partner can take care of the child.
The main objective of science is to decipher the way the world works through the scientific method, which is the guiding principle for most scientific research.
It is not, however, an experimentation, it is a test used to rule out one or more of the possible hypotheses, asking questions and making observations that guide scientific research.
Both naturalists and philosophers focused on classical works, especially the Latin version of the Bible text.
Aristotle's thoughts, especially in matters of science, including psychology, were accepted.
As the dominance of the Greek language declined, the West distanced itself from its Greek roots in both philosophy and science.
Many rhythms present in physiological processes and behavior are often decisively dependent on internal cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not just reactions to regular external stimuli, have been recorded in almost all living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
The biological clocks oscillate in a self-sustaining manner and have a period of free cyclic operation, even if there are no external stimuli.
One of the key indicators that DNA consisted of a genetic-type material was the experiment conducted by Hershey and Chase.
Hershey and Chase inserted their own DNA into a bacterium using phages, or viruses.
They conducted two experiments in which they marked the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the DNA protein with radioactive sulfur.
Depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected piece of genetic material and whether it involves germ cells, the mutation can have various effects.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while those elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism usually attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the landscape, which includes wildlife and plants.
Some examples of possible activities at the site are: hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and visiting parks, and ecosystem information study.
One example is to visit, take photographs and learn about the orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns in their cars to go to work and often cross paths with others whose jobs are in the place they just left.
On this dynamic shuttle, everyone is somehow connected to a transportation system based on the use of private cars, and they support it.
Now, scientists are arguing that this massive carbon economy has robbed the biosphere of one of its regular states that has contributed to human evolution for the past two million years.
All are part of society and make use of transportation systems; and almost all complain about them.
In developed countries, it is uncommon to hear similar levels of complaints about water quality or bridge collapse.
What is the reason that transport systems give rise to complaints of such caliber and why failures occur daily? Are transport engineers simply incapable? Or is something more substantial going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the individual movement of drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions between them.
Unfortunately, it is not a simple task to study the flow of traffic, since it is not possible to make accurate predictions about the behavior of drivers.
Fortunately, there is a tendency in drivers to maintain a relatively consistent behaviour, which allows traffic flows to have logical consistency and can be the subject of approximate mathematical representation.
In order to more clearly plot the flow of circulation, relationships were established between the three most important elements: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) velocity.
Such relationships facilitate both the planning and design and the operation of the road devices.
The first species to take to the air were insects, which helped them evade their enemies more easily and find food and mates more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings backwards, tapping them to the sides of their bodies.
This gives them a wider range of possible small places to hide from predators.
At present, anisoptera and ephemeroptera are the only insects that cannot fold their wings.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus commented that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some shared his theory, but many others believed the opposite: that the solar system orbited the Earth, including the Sun and other stars.
This seems to make sense, since on Earth, you don't perceive their movement, right?
The Amazon River is the largest and second largest river on the planet, containing eight times as much water as the next largest river.
Furthermore, the Amazon is the widest river on earth, at some points up to six miles wide.
Of the total water from the world's rivers that flows into the oceans, 20 percent comes from the Amazon.
The great Amazon River has a length of 3,980 miles and receives water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, they could never surpass those at Giza, neither in size nor in the sublimity of the technique of their construction.
The ancient Egyptian people of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their ancestors, which by then dated back more than a millennium.
With about 800 inhabitants, Vatican City is the world's smallest independent country and the least populated.
Italian is used in Vatican City, both to draft its regulations and to issue its official communiqués.
The language spoken on a daily basis by most of those working within the state is also Italian and the use of Latin is generally reserved for religious ceremonies.
The entire population of Vatican City is Roman Catholic.
Basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper have been known since ancient times, as they can all be found in nature in their original form and are relatively easy to extract with rudimentary tools.
The philosopher Aristotle developed the theory that everything is made up of a combination of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
It was more similar to the states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma, only at the same time, he had the theory that they transform into new substances that make up the things we see.
Alloys are basically a combination of two or more metals, and remember, the periodic table has many elements.
Metals such as calcium and potassium are considered to be metals.
It is also possible that alloys exist with the presence of small amounts of elements, such as carbon, that are not metallic.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, made up of tiny particles called atoms.
The size of atoms is so impressively tiny that the last sentence in this sentence could contain trillions of them.
So when the pencil was invented, it gained many friends.
Unfortunately, as a result of the implementation of new writing methods, the pencil is used less and has lost its status.
Nowadays, people write messages on their computer screens, without even having to go near a notebook.
The only question is what will become of the keyboard when something new emerges.
The atomic bomb works on the principle that energy is required to make a nucleus with a large number of protons and neutrons.
It's similar to what happens when you roll a heavy truck up a hill, and when you split the nucleus once more, you release some of that energy.
The nuclei of some atoms are unstable, that is, they tend to decay with little or no thrust.
The surface of the moon is made up of rocks and dust and its outer layer is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
It's thinner under the lunar seas and thicker under the highlands.
There may be more seas on the near side because its crust is thinner, which made it easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are focused on finding out what people are attracted to or like.
These doctrines hold that people have certain needs or desires that have been internalized as they grew to maturity.
These theories analyze what causes certain people to want the things they do and what factors in their environment compel them to do or not do certain things.
Two well-known theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
In general, there are two types of behaviour when managers start to lead their former colleagues: On one side of the spectrum, there is the attempt to continue to be one of the boys (or girls).
Managers in this category have difficulty making decisions that offend employees, imposing disciplinary measures, conducting performance reviews, assigning responsibilities and holding staff to account.
At the other end of the spectrum, he mutates into an unrecognizable person who believes it necessary to change everything the group has been doing and do it his way.
In the end, the ultimate responsibility for the team's success and failure is the leader.
This behaviour often results in leaders becoming distant from the other members of the team.
The same standards of excellence that conventional equipment handles apply to virtual equipment, although there are small differences.
Often, members of a virtual team act as a point of contact for their nearest physical group.
They generally enjoy greater autonomy than members of a traditional group, as it is possible for their teams to meet in accordance with different time zones, which, for example, might not be understood by local management.
The existence of a real 'invisible team' (Larson and LaFasto, 1989 p. 109) is also a feature unique to virtual teams.
The 'invisible team' is the group in charge of management and to which each member reports.
What could be the motive for an organisation to undergo the challenging process of establishing a learning organisation?
When all available resources are properly utilized in the operational departments of an organization, room is created for creativity and ingenuity.
As a result, it is possible for an organization's process of working in teams to overcome a difficulty to give rise to a new innovative process in order to meet customer needs.
For an organisation to be innovative, leadership must first generate a culture of innovation, as well as knowledge sharing and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuous approach as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide factual evidence for a theoretical approach to cognitive research, thus narrowing the field of research and giving it greater accuracy.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior contributes to the research of scientists.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, injury and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in mental functions.
Thanks to the rise of new technologies, we have the ability to see and investigate structures and processes that occur in the brain that we have never seen before.
This provides us with a wealth of information and material to develop simulation models, which further our understanding of mental processes.
While artificial intelligence is often associated with science fiction, it is a specialty of great relevance within computer science, which deals with behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
Research in the field of AI involves developing machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behaviour.
Examples of this include monitoring, planning and programming, the ability to respond to diagnoses and customer queries, as well as facial, handwriting and voice recognition.
These questions have become separate disciplines, focused on offering solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is now often used in the sectors of economics, medicine, engineering and the military, as it was incorporated into various video game software applications and personal computers.
The study trips are an important part of every classroom, and it is very common for a teacher to take her students to places that are not accessible by bus.
The solution is technology, through virtual excursions, where students can see the exhibits in a museum, visit an aquarium or contemplate beautiful works of art sitting with their class.
Sharing a virtual field trip is also a great way to reflect on an outing and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a web page about their trip to the state capital, and each year the page is updated, but the previous versions are kept online in the form of a memory album.
Blogs can also help to improve students' writing skills, and although students often start their blogging experience with poor grammar and spelling, this usually changes when an audience is present.
Since students are often the most critical readers, the blogger begins to make an effort to improve his writing, in order to avoid criticism.
Blogging also "requires students to be more understanding of the world around them". The need to stoke the audience's interest inspires them to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are a resource that inspires collaboration and encourages students to deepen their learning beyond the typical school day.
Proper use of blogs can empower learners to be more analytical and critical, through active response to internet content, can define their positions in the context of others' writings, and to establish their perspectives on specific topics (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's captivating bilingual capital and boasts a variety of museums and art galleries that showcase the country's history and present-day.
Niagara Falls is further south and the north shelters the untapped natural beauty of Muskoka and the expanse that follows.
All of these aspects, among others, are what make Ontario stand out as intrinsically Canadian in the eyes of foreigners.
The larger areas further north are sparsely populated and some are wilder, almost uninhabited lands.
To make a population comparison that will come as a surprise to many, there are more African Americans than Canadians in the United States.
The islands of East Africa are located off the east coast of that continent, in the Indian Ocean.
Madagascar is by far the largest and a continent in itself if we talk about wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent or associated states of France and are popular for their beaches and luxury resorts.
Islam was also brought to the lands by the Arabs and imposed itself, to a great extent, in the Comoros and Mayotte.
The initial spike of European influence and colonialism took place in the 15th century, following the discovery, by the Portuguese explorer, Vasco da Gama, of the route linking Cape Europe with India.
The region is bordered by the Sahel to the north, and by the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: It is advisable that all female visitors state that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It may also be helpful to wear a ring (just make sure it doesn't look too expensive).
Women should realize that cultural differences can lead to what they consider harassment, and that it is not uncommon to be followed, held by the arm, etc.
Be bold in rejecting men and don't be afraid to stand up for your position (whether there are cultural differences or not, that's not right!).
The founders of the modern city of Casablanca were Berber fishermen during the 10th century BC and the Phoenicians, Romans and Mermenids used it as a strategic port, called Anfa.
It was destroyed and rebuilt by the Portuguese under the name of Casa Branca, but in 1755 it was abandoned after an earthquake.
The city was rebuilt by order of the Moroccan sultan with the name of Daru l-Badya and the Spanish merchants who established their businesses in that place called it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the most boring places in Morocco to go shopping.
The surroundings of the old medina are full of places where traditional Moroccan items are sold, such as earthen pots, ceramics, leather goods, water pipes and a whole range of bagels, although everything is prepared for tourists.
Goma is a tourist spot in the Democratic Republic of Congo, on the eastern border, near Rwanda.
In 2002, the lava from the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma and left much of its streets submerged, especially in the city center.
While Goma is quite safe, any visit abroad should be considered in order to take stock of the situation of the ongoing clashes in the province of North Kivu.
The city is also the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano and its mountain gorilla viewing tours are some of the cheapest in Africa.
To move within Goma, you can opt to take a wedding-wedding (mototaxi). The regular (local) fare is CDF500 (Congolese francs) for a short trip.
This, along with its relative inaccessibility, has given "Tombuctú" an image of an exotic and distant land.
Although Timbuktu is now an impoverished city, it still has an airport and a reputation that makes it a tourist attraction.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites at risk, as a result of the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the most important stops in Henry Louis Gates' African Wonders of the World special on PBS.
The city contrasts greatly with the rest of the country, as it has an Arab style more than African.
Kruger National Park (PNK) is located in northeastern South Africa and stretches along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park has an area of 19 500 km2 and is divided into 14 distinct ecozones, each of which has a different wildlife.
This is one of South Africa's most important attractions and is recognised as the main icon of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As in all nature reserves in South Africa, there are daily fees for conservation and park access.
It may also be convenient to buy a Wild Card that allows entry to select parks in South Africa or to all of the country's National Parks.
The territory of Hong Kong takes its name from the island of the same name, which is the destination most tourists consider the main attraction.
The display of buildings that mark the Hong Kong skyline has been compared to a luminous bar chart that is evidenced by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
The best way to enjoy the best views of Hong Kong is to leave the island and head for the Kowloon waterfront, which is located opposite.
It is in the reclaimed land of the north coast of Hong Kong that its urban development is concentrated, densely.
This is the site that the British conquerors adopted as their own, so if you want to see evidence of the region's colonial past, it's a convenient place to start.
The Sundarbans are the world's largest coastal mangrove chain, stretching 80 km (50 mi) from the coast to the interior of Bangladesh and India.
UNESCO has declared the Sundarbans a World Heritage Site, and the section of the forest within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
Nevertheless, the forests are not just mangroves but also some of the last remaining trees of the once mighty jungles that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans comprise an area of 3850 km2 and about one-third of its extent is covered by water or swampy areas.
The Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966, and it is estimated that there are now 400 royal Bengal tigers and some 30,000 speckled deer in the area.
Buses leave from the inter-district station (across the river) all day, although most, especially those traveling east and to Jakar (also called Bumthang), leave between 6:30 and 7:30 am.
Since buses between districts are often crowded, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Almost all districts have Japanese Coaster bus service, which are comfortable and durable.
Sharing a taxi ride is an agile and comfortable way to move to nearby places, such as Paro (150 ngultrums) and Punakha (200 ngultrums).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a trussed structure that crosses the Oyapock River, connecting Oiapoque, Brazil, with Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 83 m, with a length of 378 m and two lanes of 3.5 m wide.
Under the bridge is a free space of 15 meters and, although its construction was completed in August 2011, it was not enabled for transit until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational by September 2017, which is when Brazilian customs controls are expected to be completed.
The area that is now eastern Paraguay was inhabited by the Guarani, who were the most important indigenous group in that region and who lived as semi-nomadic hunters, in addition to practicing subsistence agriculture.
The Chacon region was home to other aboriginal groups, for example, the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who hunted, gathered and fished for a livelihood.
Paraguay, formerly known as The Giant Province of the Indies, was born in the 16th century, as a product of the encounter between the Spanish conquistadors and the native indigenous peoples.
The Spanish began the colonization phase, which extended over three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has been able to preserve much of its idiosyncrasy and aboriginal identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best teams and the best polo players in the world.
The most important tournament of the year takes place in December at the Las Cañitas polo fields.
Other minor tournaments and matches can also be seen at other times of the year.
On the website of the Argentine Polo Association you will find information about the tournaments and where to buy tickets for the polo matches.
The value of the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), the official currency of the Falkland Islands, is set at parity with the British pound (GBP).
There's only one bank on the islands, and you can change your money there, right in front of the FIC West store on Stanley.
In the islands, the British pound is accepted anywhere, but in Stanley, credit cards or US dollars are also accepted.
Chances are that on the outlying islands credit cards are not accepted, but you could use British or American money.
It is virtually impossible to exchange Malvinas money outside the archipelago, so try to do so before you leave.
Because Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics, with frequent temperatures exceeding +30° C during the summer.
Winter cold can be deceptive: While it is very rare for temperatures to be below freezing, wind and humidity interact to make you feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no specifically rainy or dry seasons; the amount of rain remains almost the same throughout the year.
While many animals in the park are used to seeing people, wildlife is still wild, so it should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, you should keep at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters from other wild animals.
No matter how gentle they may appear, bison, Uapatees, moose, bears, and virtually all large animals can be aggressive.
Dozens of visitors are injured each year by not keeping a proper distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially wild; so, respect their space.
Also, remember that smells attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid having or cooking foods that give off a lot of scent and keep the camp clean.
Apia, the capital of Samoa, is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889, the port was the scene of a disastrous naval confrontation when seven German, American and British ships refused to leave the port.
All ships were sunk except one British cruiser, and about 200 Americans and Germans died.
During the war for independence that faced the Mau movement, a peaceful encounter in the city resulted in the assassination of the head of state Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are a large number of beaches, because Auckland has two harbours.
In the North Harbour district, on the Pacific Ocean, are the North Shore beaches, which stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
The beaches are almost all sandy with safe places to swim and mostly have pohutukawa trees that offer shade places.
The beaches of the Tamaki Drive are spread out in the port of Waitemata, in the extravagant Mission Bay and St Heliers neighbourhoods in central Auckland.
These are familiar, sometimes very busy beaches with numerous and varied shops available on the thing.
Number One is the most popular local beer and is not complex, but rather pleasant and refreshing.
While there is a great variety of French wines, those from New Zealand and Australia might be considered better for transportation.
The local tap water is completely safe to drink, but if you're worried, you can easily find bottled water.
Australians consider the notion of "flat white" coffee to be foreign. A small black coffee is called "espresso", cappuccino is served with cream (instead of foam) and tea is not taken with milk.
The hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards, the fruit juices are expensive, but delicious.
Numerous trips to the reef are made throughout the year, and injuries from any of these causes are rare there.
However, heed the advice of the authorities, observe all signs and pay particular attention to safety warnings.
The cubomedusa is found near beaches and river estuaries from October to April, north of 1770, and occasionally outside this time.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack people, and most of them are afraid of them and would swim away.
The ocean is not the place where saltwater crocodiles are actively resident, their primary habitat being the estuaries of rivers located north of Rockhampton.
Booking your accommodation in advance of your trip gives you the peace of mind that you will have a place to sleep when you arrive at your destination.
Travel agents usually have agreements with specific hotels, although it is also possible to book other types of accommodation, such as camping areas, through them.
Travel agents generally offer packages that include breakfast, transfers to and from the airport, and even combined flight and accommodation packages.
They can also save the reserve for you in case you need time to think about the offer or to obtain other documents for your destination (such as a visa).
However, any changes or requests should be made through the travel agent first, and not directly through the hotel.
At some festivals, most attendees of musical events choose to camp on site and most spectators consider it a crucial aspect of the experience.
If you want to see the action up close, then you'll want to arrive at the camp early to secure a spot near the musical events.
Keep in mind that while the music may be over, in other areas of the festival, performances may continue into the wee hours of the morning.
Some festivals have special camping areas, intended for family groups with young children.
If you are crossing the northern Baltic in winter, check the location of the cabin, as crossing the ice creates a very annoying noise for those most affected.
During cruises in St Petersburg, time is also spent in the city.
Casinos usually go to great lengths to maximize the time and money their customers spend. There are usually no windows or clocks, and exits can be difficult to find.
They often offer special promotions of food, drink and entertainment in order to keep guests in good spirits and within the facilities.
Some establishments serve free spirits, although drunkenness affects judgment, and every good gambler knows the importance of staying sober.
Anyone who intends to drive in high latitudes or mountain passes should anticipate the possibility of snow, ice or low temperatures.
On roads with ice or snow, there is little friction, so it is not possible to drive as it does on bare asphalt.
During a snowstorm, so much snow can fall that it can be trapped in a very short time.
Also, visibility may be reduced by snowfall or by condensation or ice forming on car windows.
On the other hand, in many countries ice and snow conditions are normal and traffic flows almost without any interruption throughout the year.
Safaris are probably Africa's biggest tourist attraction and the most memorable part for many visitors.
The popular use of the term safari refers to overland travel to see the amazing wildlife of Africa, particularly in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach vehicles and standard equipment will make good vision possible.
Sometimes lions, cheetahs and leopards can be shy, so you'll have a better chance of observing them through binoculars.
The excursion known as a walking safari (also called a bushwalk safari, hiking safari or walking safari) consists of hiking, either for a few hours or for several days.
The Paralympic Games will take place between August 24 and September 5, 2021, with a number of events taking place elsewhere in Japan.
Tokyo, which hosted the 1964 Games, will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics.
If you booked your 2020 flights and accommodation before the announcement of the postponement, complications may arise.
There are different types of travel cancellation policies, but since the end of March, coverage for many of these coronavirus-based policies does not extend until July 2020, which is when the Olympic Games are scheduled.
Most events tickets are expected to cost between JPY 2500 and JPY 130 000 and common passes are expected to cost JPY 7000.
Ironing clothes while they are still wet can help dry them out. Many hotels have a flatbed and a table for lending to travelers, even if one is not in the room.
If you don't have a plank available, or if you don't want to use ironing stockings, you can try a hair dryer, if it's available.
Do not allow the cloth to become too hot, as it may shrink or, in extreme cases, burn.
Different methods are known to purify water, some more effectively targeting specific threats.
In some places, boiling water for a minute is enough; in others, several more are needed.
Not all filters are equally effective and if this is of concern to you, you should consider buying bottled water with a seal from a certified company.
Travellers may come across animal pests that are not known in the regions from which they come.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or in more serious cases, cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases, by themselves, or dangerous animals, which can injure or kill individuals by the use of their force, are not usually included in the category of pests.
Duty-free shopping offers the opportunity to buy goods in certain places free of excise duties and taxes.
Travelers visiting countries with a high tax burden can sometimes save a significant amount of money, particularly on goods such as spirits and tobacco.
On the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Freeway, the stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont is one of the most challenging driving conditions and often traverses remote and lonely terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be alert: there are many steep slopes, narrow lanes and tight curves.
The posted speed limits are notoriously lower than on the sections before and after, usually 35 to 40 mph (56-64 km/h), and their strict adherence is even more important than on any other section.
However, interestingly, the cell phone signal is much better here than on many other sections of the highway like Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastry is of good quality and in Bavaria the pastries are quite tasty and varied, similar to those prepared in Austria, its southern neighbor.
Fruit cakes are common, with apples cooked in them throughout the year and cherries and plums appearing in the summer.
Many German products that are baked in the oven also have almonds, hazelnuts, and other dried fruits.
If you have a taste for small but tasty pastries, try the Berliner, also called Pfannkuchen or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a recipe made from herbs and spices and served with meat or vegetables.
We can find curry dry and humid, depending on the volume of liquid.
In the northern Indian and Pakistani interior villages, yogurt is often used in curry. In southern India and other coastal areas of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly consumed.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a catchall expression that encompasses a wide variety of regional cuisines that are distributed throughout the country.
However, used without any other qualifier, the term tends to refer to the gastronomy originating from the central and eastern regions of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine, currently available throughout the archipelago, offers a variety of dishes seasoned with simple condiments, with predominance of the favorite aromas of Javanese, such as peanuts, chiles, sugar (especially Javanese coconut) and various aromatic spices.
The stirrups are the supports for the riders' feet that hang on either side of the saddle.
While they provide greater stability to the rider, they can present safety issues, as it is possible for your feet to get stuck on them.
If a rider is thrown from the horse, but one foot is stuck in the stirrup, he may be dragged if the animal escapes.
First, most riders wear riding boots with a heel that has a smooth and fairly narrow sole.
In addition, there are mounts, especially English ones, with safety bars that allow the leather of the stirrup to detach from its structure if a dismissed rider pulls back.
The Cochamó Valley is Chile's most popular climbing destination and is known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of extensive granite walls and ridges.
The peaks also offer striking views from the peaks. Climbers from all corners of the globe are constantly delineating new paths between their walls of infinite potential.
Downhill snow sports, such as skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports involving sliding on skis or a board attached to one's feet on snowy ground.
Skiing is a major travel activity with many adepts, sometimes called ski lovers, who arrange their holidays entirely based on skiing at a specific site.
The idea of skiing is very old, as there are cave paintings depicting skiers that date back to around 5,000 B.C.
As a sport, alpine skiing dates back to no later than the 17th century. In 1861 the Norwegians opened the first recreational skiing club in Australia.
Skiing: also known as rural skiing, traverse skiing or skiing.
Although they are linked, in general it does not involve practicing cross-country skiing or alpine-style mountaineering, developed on soils of steep slope and with much more rigid skis and footwear.
Think of the ski slope as a hiking trail.
In satisfactory conditions, it will cover somewhat longer distances than if it were to go on foot, but it will very rarely reach cross-country skiing speed without a good-weight backpack on conditioned tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through several countries would mean having to manage visa applications and passport controls several times.
However, the Schengen area functions as a single country in this respect.
Generally, whenever you move within this region you can cross the borders without going through a passport control post again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not have to deal with the separate permits for each Schengen country, which saves you time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal criterion for determining when a manufactured good can be considered an antique.
The definition varies geographically, where the age limit may be more narrow in places like North America than in Europe.
It may be the case that handmade products are classified as antiques, even though they are newer than goods of similar characteristics produced in series.
Reindeer husbandry is a key means of livelihood for the Lapps, and the culture associated with reindeer husbandry is important to many in other professions.
However, even traditionally, not all Lapons have been engaged in reindeer farming on a large scale, but lived from fishing, hunting and other similar activities, using reindeer primarily as draught animals.
Today, many Lapps are engaged in modern commercial activities, and tourism is a major source of income in Lapland, the Sami region.
Although widely used, especially by non-Roma, the term gypsy is often offensive, as it is associated with negative stereotypes and inaccurate assessments about Roma.
If your destination country is subject to a travel alert, this could affect your medical assistance or cancellation insurance.
You may want to look at the recommendations of other governments, but they are designed for your own citizens.
For example, an American visitor to the Middle East might face different situations from a European or an Arab.
Travel warnings are just a concise summary of the political situation in another country.
The views presented are often superficial, generic and overly simplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
The term severe climate refers, in general, to any hazardous weather phenomenon that is capable of causing damage, serious social disturbance or death.
Severe weather can occur anywhere on the planet and there are different types depending on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
Hurricanes, hailstorms, excessive rainfall, and wildfires are types and consequences of extreme weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, floods, or cyclones.
Extreme regional and seasonal weather events include windstorms, snowstorms, ice or dust.
Travellers are strongly advised to inform themselves of any risks of extreme weather in the area they are visiting, as this may affect their travel plans.
Anyone planning a trip to a country that could be branded a war zone should receive professional training.
A search for "Hostile Zone Course" on the Internet will likely find the address of a local company.
A course will normally cover all the topics discussed here in much more detail and, in general, with practical experience.
A course normally lasts between 2 and 5 days, and includes role-playing, first aid, and even occasionally weapons training.
Books and magazines on survival in the wild are common, but publications on war zones are scarce.
Passengers scheduled for sex reassignment surgery in another country should ensure that they carry valid documentation for the return journey.
Governments have different views on the issue of passports without gender declaration (X) or updated documents to match the name of the person with the gender with which he or she is identified.
The willingness of foreign governments to honor these documents varies greatly.
Security checkpoint inspections have become more invasive since 9/11.
Transgender people who have not yet had surgery should not expect to go through the scans with their dignity and privacy intact.
Backstreams are the flow that recedes from waves that break on shore, often on a reef or similar.
Because of the underwater topology, the return flow gathers in certain deeper areas and there can originate a fast current with direction to deep water.
Most deaths are caused by the fatigue of trying to swim against the current, which may be impossible.
Once I've escaped the current, swimming back will be no more complex than usual.
Make an attempt to reach somewhere where you can't reach it again, or, if you have the skills and someone has seen you, it might be convenient to wait for rescue.
The impact of returning home occurs earlier than the cultural one (there is no such thing as a "honeymoon" period of happiness), it takes longer to leave and can be harder.
Travelers who have found it easy to adapt to a new culture sometimes have great difficulty adjusting back to their native culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you will have adapted to the new culture and lost some of the habits of your native culture.
When you first traveled abroad, people were likely patient and understanding, knowing that travelers need to adjust to a new country.
People may not foresee that tolerance and understanding are also necessary for travellers returning home.
The light show and pyramidal sound are one of the most interesting things for the children in the area.
In the dark, you can see the pyramids and contemplate them in silence before the show begins.
Generally, you can hear the sound of tourists and vendors at all times.
The sphinx appears as a backdrop and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are projected onto the pyramids and all of them are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands were discovered in 1819 and are claimed by several nations, with the largest number of bases, reaching sixteen active in 2020.
The archipelago is 120 km north of the peninsular territory.The largest island is Rey Jorge, where the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas is located.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception, where there is a spectacular natural harbor formed by the flooded caldera of a still-active volcano.
Ellsworth Land, whose boundaries are defined by the Bellingshausen Sea, is a region located in the south of the peninsula.
At this point, the Peninsula Mountains blend with the plateau and then resurge to form the 360 km (220 mi) Ellsworth Mountain Range, split in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the northern sector, the Sentinel Range, are the highest peaks in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, with a summit at 15,950 feet (4,892 m) at Mount Vinson.
In remote places where cell phone coverage is not available, a satellite device may be your only option.
A satellite telephone cannot be equated with a mobile telephone, because, to make a call, it must be in the open air and with a clear line of sight to the satellite.
The service is commonly used in water transport, including recreational vessels, as well as for expeditions requiring remote data and voice.
You can consult your local telephone service provider for more information on how to join the service.
Combining travel and learning has become a very popular option among those planning to take a sabbatical year.
This is very popular among high school graduates, as it allows them to take a year off before college without jeopardizing their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a study programme abroad during a sabbatical year can indeed increase the chances of accessing higher education once you return to your home country.
A tuition fee is usually charged for these educational programmes.
Finland is a great sailing destination: the 'land of a thousand lakes' also has thousands of islands, both in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
You don't always need a yacht on the islands and lakes.
While the coastal archipelagos and the most abundant lakes are large enough for any yacht, smaller vessels or even a kayak provide a different experience.
Sailing is a national recreational activity in Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight inhabitants.
The same is true in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but, apart from this, it is quite unique (e.g. in the Netherlands the ratio is one in forty).
Most of the exclusive cruises that go through the Baltic Sea include a long-term stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you have the possibility of making a visit to the historic city for a few full days during your return journey, sleeping on the boat at night.
If you only disembark for excursions on board, you do not need a separate visa (since 2009).
Some cruise ship brochures list Berlin, Germany, but as noted in the map above, Berlin is not near the sea and a visit to Berlin is not included in the cruise fare.
Air travel can cause fear in people of any age and place, particularly if they have never experienced it or if they have experienced a traumatic event.
There is no shame in it - it is no different from other types of personal fears and dislikes that plague so many others.
For some, a little understanding of how planes operate and what happens during a flight may help to release a fear that comes from a lack of knowledge or a sense of control.
Courier companies are well paid for making quick deliveries, and time is often of the essence when it comes to business documents, merchandise, or spare parts for urgent repairs.
The big companies have their own planes on some routes, but there was a problem for the smaller companies and other routes.
If you did an air freight shipment, some routes may have taken days to unload and clear.
The only way to do it faster was to send it as checked baggage, because airline regulations prohibit carrying baggage without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The obvious way to travel first or business class on an airplane is to spend a fortune for that privilege (or, better yet, have your company pay for you).
But there is a price: in general terms, you can pay up to four times more than the economy fare in business class and up to eleven in economy class.
It is usually foolish to seek discounts for first class or business class seats on direct flights.
Airline companies are well aware that there is a basic group of travelers who are willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of arriving at a place quickly and comfortably, and to be charged accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău, and the regional language is Romanian, although Russian is also widely spoken.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic, and conflicts of this kind have arisen among them.
In 1994, this conflict led to the formation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria, east of Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but which is not recognised by any UN member state.
Despite the failure of political negotiations, economic ties have been re-established between the two sides of Moldova.
Orthodox Christianity is the majority religion in Moldova.
Smyrna is the third largest city in Turkey, with approximately 3.7 million inhabitants, the second largest port after Istanbul and a very good transport hub.
What was once the ancient city of Smyrna is today a modern, developed, bustling commercial metropolis, established around a vast bay and surrounded by mountains.
The sprawling boulevards, the mirrored front buildings, and the avant-garde shopping malls are dotted with red-tiled roofs, the 18th-century marketplace, and the old mosques and churches.
The village of Haldarsvík has excursions to the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an atypical church with an octagonal shape.
In the cemetery, there are interesting marble sculptures in the shape of a dove on some graves.
It is worth spending half an hour walking around the fascinating town.
To the north, within easy reach, is the romantic and captivating city of Sintra, which gained popularity with foreigners as a result of Lord Byron's vivid description of its splendour.
At Scotturb, the 403 bus runs regularly to Sintra and stops at Cabo da Roca.
You should also visit, to the north, the great Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima, a site of world-famous apparitions of the Virgin Mary.
Do not forget that, basically, you are visiting a place that served as a common grave and that is also a site of almost invaluable significance to a significant portion of the world's population.
There are still many men and women alive who survived their stay in this place and many more who had loved ones who were murdered or worked there until their deaths, both Jews and non-Jews.
Give the place all the dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves, don't joke about the Holocaust or Nazism.
Don't ruin the place by making marks or graffiti on the structures.
Catalan and Spanish are the official languages of Barcelona. About half of the people prefer to speak Catalan, the vast majority understand it and practically everyone knows Spanish.
However, since Catalan is legally the first official language, most signs are written in that language only.
Yet, Spanish is also widely used in public transportation and other buildings.
While the usual announcements in the Metro are only displayed in Catalan, unplanned interruptions are made in a wide variety of languages through an automatic program in a wide variety of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, rude and conceited.
Although it's often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to have a good time in Paris is to behave as well as possible, like a bien élevé (well-educated) person, which will make moving around there a lot easier.
A few acts of courtesy on your part will quickly make the apparent brusque manners of the Parisians disappear.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is very wooded, has mainly beech, fir and spruce, and presents a vegetation between alpine and Mediterranean.
It has a wide and extraordinary range of plant communities, thanks to the variety of microclimates, soils and altitude levels.
This region is also home to a wide variety of animal and bird species.
The European brown bear, the wolf, the eagle, the owl, the lynx, the wildcat, and the storks are some of the exotic animals, among numerous other common creatures, that can be found in the area.
During the visit to monasteries, women must wear skirts that cover the knees and cannot wear bare shoulders.
While almost all monasteries give coats to women who arrive unprepared, if you wear yours, especially if it is brightly colored, the monk or nun will smile at you at the entrance.
In the same vein, men are required to wear trousers that cover the knees.
This can also be borrowed from the clothes available upon entry, but these clothes are not washed after each person wears them, so it is possible that you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts. One size fits all!
The gastronomy of Mallorca, like that of other similar regions of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil in all its recipes.
Pa amb Oli is a popular and simple dinner, especially in summer. It is a bread with olive oil, tomato and any other ingredients such as cheese or tuna, among others.
All nouns, as well as the word Sie for 'you', always have their initial capital letter, even if they are in the middle of the sentence.
It's a key method for differentiating between certain verbs and objects.
It can also be said to simplify reading, although its writing is somewhat complex, since it is necessary to find out whether a verb or adjective is used in a substantiated form.
Pronouncing Italian is relatively easy, since most of its words sound the same as they are written.
The c and the g are the letters you should be most careful with, since they are pronounced differently depending on the vowel that follows them.
Also, be sure to respect the difference in pronunciation of the r and rr. For example, expensive means expensive, while carro means car.
Persian has a relatively simple and mostly regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this grammar manual will help you to learn much about Persian grammar rules and to gain a better understanding of sentences.
It goes without saying that if you are fluent in a Romance language, you will find it easier to learn Portuguese.
However, those who speak some Spanish may rush to the conclusion that Portuguese is quite similar and that it is unnecessary to study it individually.
Today, pre-modern observatories are generally obsolete and remain functional as museums or educational destinations.
Since, in its heyday, light pollution was not a large-scale problem as it is today, it is common to find them in cities or on campuses, being more easily accessible than those built in modern times.
Most of today's research telescopes consist of huge structures installed in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
The contemplation of cherry blossoms, called hanami, has been a tradition in Japan since the eighth century.
The concept came from China, where the plum flower was the most prized.
It was the emperor of Japan who organized the first cherry tree celebrations, only for himself and other members of the aristocracy of the Imperial Court.
Plants look best in a natural environment, so resist the temptation to pick just one specimen.
If you collect "specimens" during a visit to a formal garden, you'll get yourself expelled, no question.
Generally, Singapore is a very safe place to be and very easy to get around; moreover, you can buy almost any product from your arrival.
But because of its location in the "high tropics", just a few degrees north of the equator, you will always have to deal with the heat and, when the skies are clear, the strong sun, which happens less often.
Also, some buses head north to Hebron, the site where, according to history, the Biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives were buried.
You must confirm that the bus you are planning to take is going to Hebron and not just to Kyriat Arba, which is a Jewish neighborhood that is close to that place.
Inland waterways can be a good holiday theme.
For example, visiting castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley, taking a cruise to interesting destinations on the Danube, or taking a boat trip on the Erie Canal.
They also delineate routes for popular hiking and biking trails.
For the Christian religion, Christmas is one of its most important holidays, celebrating the birth of Jesus Christ.
Many traditions related to this festival have been incorporated by non-Christian and non-Christian people around the globe.
It is tradition to spend the Easter night in a vigil in some exposed spot to gaze at the sunrise.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may well be a pre-Christian ritual of spring and fertility.
More traditional churches usually hold an Easter Vigil on Saturday night during the Easter weekend, and congregations usually begin the celebrations for Christ's resurrection as soon as midnight.
All the animals that originally came to the islands came to this place by swimming, flying or floating.
Because they are so far from the mainland, mammals could not reach them, making the giant tortoise the main grazing creature in the Galapagos.
Many mammal species have been introduced to the Galapagos since man arrived in the archipelago, such as goat, horse and cattle, or rodents, dogs and cats.
If you travel to the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience the polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
Since the sky will remain dark for most of the day, it is a great opportunity to gaze at the northern lights.
With the small population in these regions and, as a result, no light pollution problems, you can also enjoy the stars.
In Japan, the work culture has a more vertical and formal structure than Westerners may be used to.
Typical business attire is suits and coworkers call each other by their surnames or by their jobs.
Harmony in the workplace is critical, where the emphasis is on the efforts of the group rather than focusing on praise of individual accomplishments.
Often, workers must have the approval of their superiors for decision making and are expected to obey their instructions without question.
