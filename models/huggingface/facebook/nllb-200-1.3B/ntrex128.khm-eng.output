Welsh AMs worry about 'mophetic looks'
There is a bit of a rift around some AMs on the request to change their status to MWPs.
It happened because of a plan to change the name of the House to the Welsh House.
AMs crossed political centers, which were worried it could lead to ridicule.
One AM worker said his team was concerned that it was comparing the wording to Twp and Pwp.
For non-Welsh readers: In Welsh, twp refers to the word light, while pwp refers to the word possibility.
Plaid AM said the group was "not happy" and suggested other options.
A Welsh Conservative said his group was "open" to the name change, but as noted it was a shortcut from MWP to Moffat.
In this context, the Welsh w reads similar to the Yiddish pronunciation of the letter u.
The parliamentary committee, which is currently drafting legislation to issue a new name, said: "It is a final decision that some commentators feel that MPs are being called to blame for their own members".
The Government of Wales Act 2017 transferred power to the Welsh Parliament to change its name.
In June, the committee released the results of a public consultation on a number of proposals that sought broad support for calling the House a Welsh Parliament.
Regarding the naming issue of AMs, the Committee supported either Welsh MPs or WMPs, but the MWP option received the most support in the public consultation.
It seems the AMs are proposing an alternative, but the defense is reaching a final decision that could lead to a headache for Premier Elin Jones, who is expected to table legislation on the name change in the coming weeks.
The reform bill would include other changes to the way Parliament works, including measures to discontinue the right to elect AMs and to organise a committee system.
The AMs will get the final vote on the question of what they should be called when they have debated the law.
Macedonia participates in referendum on changing the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote was held in an effort to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece over whether its province was called Macedonia.
The people of Athens have long demanded the name of its northern neighbour, which it represents for its territorial claims, and have repeatedly challenged efforts to become members of the European Union and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, one of the right-wing candidates on the name change, said he would not take the vote seriously.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claimed that the name change was merely the price to pay for joining the European Union and NATO.
The core of the silence over the fall of Martin was the church under the Hollam struggle.
Adam said, "Historically, the old man I spoke to said there were bars and churches on every corner".
"Today it's not like that".
He said that the gaps are understandable.
"People today are interconnected", he said.
"The bar is no longer the living room of your neighborhood where people go to play".
For the church, he was worried that the money from all the property sales would be gone as long as all the leaders wanted it and sooner or later they would go back to the old ways they started.
He said that the temple could be replaced by a massive apartment building with different people in multiple condominiums that couldn't help keep the neighbor's shelter.
He said, "Most of the condo buyers in these buildings are white people, so it will be hasten the day when these temples are completely closed because it is unlikely that most of the people who move into these condos will be these temples".
The township in 1870, a decade after Martin's rule, both churches were built by the white church before Harlem became a black city.
The Native Methodist Church moved out in the 1930s.
A black church that used to worship nearby took the name of the building.
Martin was occupied by a black church under the leadership of John Howard Johnson, who led a gang of retailers on 125th Street, a major thoroughfare for real estate shopping in Harlem, who refused to rent or promote to blacks.
A fire in 1939 left the building severely damaged, but because the villagers of the Gunshans planned to rebuild it, they entrusted the construction of the castle.
The life of David Johnson, the son of Prince Charles, the father of Johnson and the next Earl of Matten, called the castle "the poor man's nest".
Experts who visited the castle in July called it something else: "a heavenly cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical device".
Tiffany Ng, an expert from the University of Michigan, noted that it was the first bell tower in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to a larger bell tower at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said Martin did not replace him.
What has been seen many times in Martin in recent months is a symbiotic story of architects and craftsmen, some brought in by church leaders and others by the Evereville village.
The room in the church, a local administration board, was set up by religious leaders, writing that the church's parish in July was concerned that the parish would try to spend money on rooms in the church even if the rooms in the church were not related to the hiring of the parish architect and builder who had been sent.
Some villagers complain about the lack of stability on one side of the village.
A 13-year-old boy is injured by a fish after diving for sea urchins in California
A smart fish attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while swimming for seafood in California, just in time for rice season, officials said.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near the coast of Trinidad in the city of Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and then swam back with the team to help get him out of the water.
Hammel said at first he thought it was just the thrill of catching an egg, but then he "realized he was screaming, 'I have to be kicked!'
I have to stop them!
Hammel said he noticed that when he approached the boy, the bone of his hammer was knocked out.
"I shouted to everyone to get out of the water: Hammel added, 'There's a spider in the water!'"
The boy was taken to the Radi Children's Hospital in Sandiaga, where he was placed in critical condition.
The species of whales attacking is unknown.
Marine Chief Larry Giles said at a press conference that a whalefish had been spotted in the area weeks earlier, but it was not identified as an endangered species.
Giles added that the victim suffered a spinal injury to his upper torso.
Officials closed the coastal entrance from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami in Innisfree for 48 hours for purposes of investigation and security.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of rays in the area, but most of them are not considered endangered.
Sainsbury's is pushing for a UK vegetable market
Sainsbury's is frustrated because Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams have pedestrianised grocery stores with skilled staff.
As part of a massive push into the $2.8 billion UK grocery market, which continues to grow as cars are becoming more popular and home appliances decline, the large pedestrian-only stores will be tested in 11 stores nationwide and brought to many more stores next year, using it to prove a success.
Investments in the furniture sector are occurring as the market is looking for ways to use the space, TVs, microphones and household appliances.
Sainsbury's said it would double the size of its grocery store offering to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
In the line-up, L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with branded areas similar to those found in stores like Boots.
The modern marketplace also began to operate its own small-scale retail stores to make most of the products non-animal products, which are in increasing demand for younger non-vegan shoppers.
In addition, Fragrance will be testing in two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, south London, last week, while the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
The online shopping boom and the shift towards everyday grocery shopping in modern stores means that supermarkets must do more to convince people to come to the store.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, said the stores would look more and more like similar grocery stores, as similarly named stores in the supermarket tried to fight Aldi and Lidl's price cuts with more service and not more food.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos in hundreds of stores and introduced a number of Habitats since it bought the eponymous store two years ago, both of which it says have supported spice sales and made purchases more profitable.
Previous attempts by the supermarket to upgrade its grocery and pharmacy facilities ended in failure.
Sainsbury's did a trial run with Boots in the early 2000s, but the deal ended after allegations of misappropriating profits from chemical stores in its supermarket.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281-unit pharmacy business to Celesio, owner of the eponymous Lloyds Pharmacy, for £125 million three years ago.
It has been said that Lloyds will follow suit with the plan by adding several luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's Chief Commercial Officer, said: "We have changed the look and feel of our pedestrianised restaurants to enhance the environment for our customers.
We also engaged with specially trained co-workers to provide advice.
Our jewelry line is designed to meet the needs and attractive environment and convenient location means that we are now a buyer's destination that captures the feeling of old-fashioned jewelry shopping".
Peter Jones is Furious after Holly Willoughby pulls out of £11 million deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones has left The Furious after TV presenter Holly Willoughby pulled out of an £11 million deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on her new contract with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby had no time for their house-washing clothes and makeup.
The couple's profession has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop.
The 37-year-old presenter of this morning's show posted on Instagram that she was leaving.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons" Den star Peter Jones, withdrawing from her brand gambling business at the last minute to focus on a new contract for in-store skipping with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Several sources said Jones was "furious" when the TV golden-haired girl confessed at a press conference on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new deal, worth up to £1.5 million, meant she no longer had enough time to pay attention to their clothing and accessories brand Truly.
The business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and is predicted to boost Willoughby's net worth by £11 million.
As 37-year-old Willoughby posted on Instagram to announce she was leaving Truth, Jones dropped out of the UK to head for a holiday at his home.
A source said: "Truly is at the top of Holly's priority.
It will be her long-term future that will see her full in a few decades.
Her decision to pull you out is shocking.
No one can believe that what is happening on Tuesday is about to begin.
There's a box full of merchandise at Marlow HQ ready to sell".
Experts believe the departure of This Morning's speaker, one of the UK's most trusted stars, could cost companies millions due to massive investments in products ranging from cotton and donated to clothing and home-made shirts and the potential for further delays.
And it could mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three, Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin, have been close to Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for 10 years.
Willoughby co-founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined as president in March.
The two partnered and Jones owned a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby is to become a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We will not comment on his business dealings".
A very intense conversation and then we fall in love.
He joked about the criticism he would receive from the media for making statements that some thought would be inappropriate and positive towards the North Korean leadership.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump spoke in his cosmic voice as a "news shuttle".
I didn't give up anything.
He noted that Kim was interested in the second meeting after their first meeting in Singapore in June was hailed by Trump as a major step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
But the fruitless negotiations are stuck.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the U.N. General Conference on Saturday that North Korea did not see a "symmetrical response" from the United States to North Korea's transfer of nuclear weapons.
Instead, he noted that the US is continuing to apply sanctions.
Trump has taken a number of positive views in his speech.
He said, "We are doing great work with North Korea.
We will go to war with North Korea.
Millions will be killed.
Now we have this amazing relationship".
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results through the completion of rocket tests, aiding the Chimeans and the return of remaining American troops home.
At the same time, he defended his unusual approach to talking about his relationship with Kim.
Trump said, referring to the crowd directly in front of him, "It's easy to be president, but instead of 10,000 people out there trying to get into the arena, we're going to have about 200 people standing there".
Tsunami and earthquake strike on Indonesian island kills hundreds
For example, in the aftermath of the Limburg earthquake, many foreign NGOs were told they did not need their help.
Even if more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok were forced to displacement, no national disaster was declared as a requirement for international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they are so obvious that they don't ask for international help, so it's a bit of a challenge", Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is deploying a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet clear whether foreign staff can work there.
Sutopo, the spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see if the international agency would be allowed to participate in the relief effort.
Due to the earthquake, which Indonesia has always been unable to withstand, the country is ready for the wrath of nature.
While tsunami shelters were built in Aceh, it was not uncommon on other beaches.
The lack of sirens warning of a tsunami in Palu, despite effective warnings, is likely to have caused loss of life.
At best, travel between Indonesia's many islands is challenging.
Natural disasters have made many buildings even more flat.
A rescue boat deployed in Lombok, aimed at treating earthquake victims, is also en route to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the new disaster site.
President Joko Widodo has improved Indonesia's fragmented infrastructure as it was a key part of his election campaign, and he has spent money on numerous roads and railways.
However, the lack of funds frustrated Joko's administration as he faced re-election next year.
Joko is also facing pressure from the continuing physical tension in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim population have adopted a conservative form of the faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands more were displaced from their homes as Christian and Muslim militias fought in the streets using batons, picks, picks and other mixed weapons.
The team's goalkeeper, Daniel Sturridge, was in a strong tie.
Daniel Sturridge helped Liverpool from a Premier League defeat to Chelsea with an 89th-minute score on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received the ball from Xherdan Shaqiri 30 metres from Chelsea's goal and his team's 1-0 score.
He continued to throw the ball to his left before the ball pointed far forward.
This attempt went off high above the ground as the ball ran over the right side of the pitch.
In the end, the ball fell on Kepa Arrizabalaga's foot and fell into the net.
Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com: "It's just trying to get in there to get the ball and players like Shaq always keep moving the ball forward as much as possible, so I try to play by myself as much as possible".
"I saw Kante come in and pick up the ball and I didn't think much of it, then just scored".
Chelsea took a 1-0 lead at half-time after being scored in the 25th minute by Belgian striker Eden Hazard.
The blue jersey forward made a delivery to Mateo Kovacic on the pitch before returning to midfield and running in the Liverpool midfield.
Kovacic pulled away and went fast in the half.
He then kicked the ball cleanly, leading Hazard into the infield.
Hazard ran to defend and finished penalty shootout behind Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool play Napoli in the Champions League group stage at 3pm on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea are set to face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3pm on Thursday in London.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia rises to 832
The country's disaster agency said on Sunday that the death toll in the earthquake and tsunami had risen to 832.
Agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference that several people were reported to have been trapped in the rubble of the building by the 7.5 magnitude quake that struck on Friday and caused waves of up to 20 feet.
Palu, a city of over 380,000 people, was covered in debris from a shattered castle.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been launched after the woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55am with a gunshot wound at Grayson Mews on John Street and a 32-year-old man was arrested for murder.
Police urged people in the area who saw or heard something to come forward.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in its early stages, but I would urge anyone in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead who has seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us".
I would also urge anyone, especially a taxi driver who could catch anything on camera to contact us because they may have information that is necessary for our investigation.
A police spokesman claimed that the woman's body was found, that she was a resident of Birkenhead and that she was found in the house.
This evening, all the friends who believed they knew a woman arrived at the scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing, while police said they are in the process of providing information to the next relatives of the victims.
A taxi driver who lives in the Grayson Mews area just tried to get into his apartment but was told by police that no one was allowed in or out of the building.
He was shocked when he found out what had happened.
Now, villagers are being told it will be hours before they are allowed back in.
A police officer was heard telling a man that the entire area was now classified as a crime scene.
A woman appeared at the scene in tears.
She repeatedly said, "It's very scary".
At around 2 am, two police cars were inside the police barracks with another truck outside.
Some officers stood inside the police station, watching the apartment block.
Anyone with information is requested to give DM @MerPolCC a call 101 or contact the Crimestoppers team anonymously on 0800 555 111 by quoting reference 247 on September 30.
The Cromwell statue of Parliament became the last memorial with a column reflecting the re-writing of history.
Expulsion would be the most appropriate punishment for the Taliban-like destruction of many British cultural and religious relics carried out by Puritans.
But the Cromwell Society described Crick's proposal as "lily madness" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It is inevitable in the current debate whether the removal of the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside Westminster Palace will be a target.
The destroyer battleships in the English Civil War were neither commanded nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps Cromwell was wrongly credited for the actions of Thomas' ancestors in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent representation is a testament to 19th-century thought and part of the historical evidence that many believe it still holds value.
Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: "Perhaps more respected in the late 19th century than today, Cromwell was revered by many as the defender of Parliament against external pressure in his predecessor, the defence of the monarchy.
Even if the representation is completely accurate, it is in line with the historical debate.
What is clear is that the conflicts of the mid-17th century made for a continuous development of our nation, and Cromwell was the figure who could be construed as representing the other side of that division.
His work as a defender of the Lord is also valuable in celebration and remembrance".
Big pig killer kills Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in eastern China.
The South China Morning Post reported on Sunday that a man with his nickname "Yan" was found dead with a blood-stained vein near a pig's chest in a market in Liangshan, Guangzhou province.
A pig farmer vaccinated several pigs on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai, China.
He reportedly traveled with one of his cousins from Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, one of Kate's siblings found him dead and found the door to open the nearby pigs unlocked.
He said that in the pig's belly was a large pig with blood on its mouth.
According to the report, an autopsy confirmed that a 550-pound pig had caused the farmer's death.
According to the Guiyang Evening News, "One of my cousins' feet was bleeding and dirty".
Security cameras showed Yan walking into the market at 4.40am on Thursday to feed his pig.
His body was discovered about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Ian or one of his cousins.
Market managers told the Evening News that the pig was stung at a distance to prevent it from attacking anyone else, as police gathered evidence at the scene.
Yan's family and market authorities are reportedly in negotiations over his death.
Although rare, cases of pig attacks on humans have been recorded before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man critically injured.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig pushed a Welsh farmer to his tractor until his wife was afraid to stay away from the animal.
After an Oregon farmer was bitten by his pig in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC that not all pigs are normally winners, but blood natives can play the role of "a wake-up call".
They were just joking.
They are the ones who are really annoying... they don't want to hurt you.
He said, "You just have to pay them the right amount of money in respect.
Hurricane Ken Rosa brings heavy rainfall to the eastern United States
Predicted, Hurricane Rosa's is weakening as it moves over the cold waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring heavy rainfall to northern Mexico and the western United States over the next few days.
Hurricane Rosa had winds of 85 mph, was a Category 1 hurricane at 5 a.m. eastern time on Sunday and had buffeted 385 miles to the east of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to move northward on Sunday.
At the same time, a tidal wave is beginning to emerge over the Pacific Ocean and is moving eastward toward the west coast of the United States.As Hurricane Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday, which is a tropical storm, it will begin to push the storm's path toward the eastern United States.
Hurricane Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
The tropical moisture then interferes with the water melt, which will produce heavy rainfall in the tropics over the next few days.
In the region, heavy rainfall of 1 to 4 inches will cause dangerous flooding, landslides and landslides in sandy areas.
The tropical storm will cause rainfall to rise to 2 to 3 inches per hour at a point, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Rainfall of 2 to 4 inches is expected in parts of the tropics, especially in Arizona.
The flooding may be caused by rapidly deteriorating weather conditions due to heavy rainfall in the tropics.
It will be advised that severe illness is associated with walking in sandy fields with the threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rainfall can cause mountain valleys to become rivers with floodwaters, and a tidal wave will bring strong winds and dust.
The melting will bring heavy rainfall to parts of the southern California coast.
Over one and a half inches of total rainfall is possible, and can cause a slightly slippery flow and a slippery path.
This is the first rainfall in the region for the season.
Some tropical rainfall will begin to fall in Arizona late Sunday and early Monday before more rain on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rainfall to the foursquare on Tuesday and last until Wednesday.
October can see a sharp rise in temperatures across the United States, while the tropics have cooler weather, but the tropics remain warm.
This causal mechanism can lead to interesting temperature fluctuations over short distances.
There was a great example of an interesting temperature difference in the central United States on Sunday.
Temperatures are nearly 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between Lewis Avenue and Des Moines Lowe.
In the next few days, the summer heat wave will try to re-emerge and expand.
Much of the central and eastern United States is expected to begin to warm by October, with temperatures reaching 80 degrees, spreading from the lowlands of the southeast to some areas of the Pacific.
New York City could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which will be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows a high chance for above-average temperatures for the eastern United States through mid-early October.
Over 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's opening speech
More than 20 million people watched the testimony of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and a woman who accused him of sexual assault that occurred in the 1980s trial of Christine Blasey Ford on Channel 6.
Meanwhile, political confrontation continued with network broadcasters interrupting the writing of a regular show for Friday's last-minute twist: a deal created by Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake for the FBI to investigate a week of allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary that he was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh had made her drunk and tried to take off her clothes at a high school dance.
Kavanaugh, in this heartwarming testimony, said he was 100 percent sure it didn't happen.
That's more likely than the 20.4 million people Nielsen reported on Friday to have viewed the story.
The company counts the average viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
This figure is not immediately apparent for other networks that show it, including PBS, C-SPAN, and the Fox commercial network.
And generally, Nielsen has some problems measuring the number of people in the office.
It's an audience similar to playing a football game for a championship or scholarship.
Nielsen said Fox, whose fans overwhelmingly supported Kavanaugh's nomination, led the two networks to an average of 5.69 million viewers during the day's session.
ABC is in second place with 3.26 million viewers.
Nielsen said CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million.
Interest remained high after the session.
Flake is the central figure to the Friday series.
After the Republican Party's office issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was caught on CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning being yelled at by protesters as he tried to board a plane to a hearing at the Judiciary Committee.
He stood with his eyes closed for several minutes as he was being bullied, broadcast live on CNN.
One woman said, "I'm standing right here in front of you".
"Do you think he's telling the truth to this country?
He was told, "You have power when so many women have no power.
Flake said his office issued a statement and said before the stage closed he would speak further at the committee's hearing.
All cable and broadcast networks were covered in the hours after the Judiciary Committee was voted to push Kavanaugh's nomination to the Senate for a run-off election.
But Flake said he would do so with the understanding that the FBI will review the charges against the nominee for next week's presidential election, which the minority Democratic Party has been seeking.
Flake was persuaded in part by a conversation with his friend, Democrat Sen. Chris Coons.
After discussions with Coons and several senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake's option was powerful because it was seen that Republicans would not get a vote to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
UK PM could accuse critics of 'playing politics' on Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May may accuse critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "politically playing with" Britain's future and undermining the national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, England, 29 September 2018.
In another interview alongside this interview with Ms. on the front page, former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson threatened Ms. Johnson's control plan, called the Brexit control plan, saying a proposal that the UK and EU should collect each other's taxes was "very cautious".
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest suspect in death of LSU player
Police arrested a suspect in the shooting death of 20-year-old Wayde Sims, a LSU football player.
Dyton Simpson, 20, was arrested and held in jail on suspicion of second-degree murder.
Officials released video of a fight between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his wallet in the fight.
Police found the vase from the scene and said they found DNA on it that belonged to Simpson, according to a report from CBS affiliate WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, police said he confessed to shooting Wayde.
His bail was set at $350,000, according to prosecutors' reports.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office released a preliminary report Friday saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head.
The department is leaving the Fugitive Arrest Task Force of Louisiana State Police, Crime Department, State Police, Southern University Police and local citizens to assist in the investigation leading to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, director of LSU athletics, thanked local law enforcement for its "diversity and pursuit of justice".
Sims is 20 years old.
The 6-foot-6 forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played football for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said his team was "shocked and saddened" by Wayde's death.
Wade said, "This is what you worry about all the time.
Volcanoes erupted over Mexico City
Burning embers from the Popocatepetl volcano have reached several neighborhoods in the south of Mexico City.
The National Disaster Management Center warned Mexican residents on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after movement evolved in the crater and it emitted 18# gases and burned for 24 hours.
The center is monitoring wind and earthquake sounds.
Images on social media showed the footprints of the spider on the windshield of trucks in neighborhoods in Mexico such as Xochimilco.
Geologists have noted increased movement at the volcano, located 72 kilometers east of the capital, since a 7.1 magnitude earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been erupting since 1994.
Clashes between police and Catalan separatists before the automatic vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after a group of independence protesters clashed with riot police and thousands of people joined protests to celebrate the first anniversary of Catalonia's political vote on secession.
The masked suicide bombers, disguised as police officers, swallowed pills and threw poisonous drugs, creating a dark cloud along the roads that are usually crowded with tourists.
The clashes also broke out after police used their batons to prevent a fight.
For hours, the pro-independence movement shouted "Don't forget, don't leave", faced the trade union protesters, shouting "Long live Spain".
Local media reported that 14 people were seriously injured in the protests.
Tensions remain high in the autonomous region a year after the October 1 referendum, deemed illegal by Madrid but held by Catalan separatists.
Voters overwhelmingly chose to remain independent, although turnout was low, and those who opposed secession were overwhelmed by the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, in violent clashes, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop the ongoing vote at polling stations across the region.
Pro-independence groups camped out Friday night to prevent the protests from gaining the support of the National Police.
The protests continued but were forced to go in a different direction.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said he was no longer hopeful about Catalan independence.
Last year we had one of the best times.
I saw my parents rejoicing at being able to vote, but now we are stuck.
Despite managing a narrow victory in the December regional elections, Catalonia's pro-independence party has struggled to maintain momentum this year with its most prominent leaders in solitary confinement or in jail awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, 42, a mechanic who recorded the protest in support of police on his phone, said the clash was fueled by politicians of both parties.
He said, "It's getting worse.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial detention since the end of last year, announced that he would run for the European Parliament next year.
"Candidating for the European Parliament elections is the best way to defeat the criticism of the democratic devaluation and repression we have seen from the Spanish government", he said.
Londonderry: Man arrested after house was hit by truck
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a car was driven into a house in Londonderry repeatedly.
The incident took place at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at around 19:30 pm.
Det Insp Bob Blemmings said the damage caused damage to the door and the building itself.
The gun can also be fired at certain points.
Menga's attack gave Livingston a 1-0 win over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston was a victory
Livingston's rising success shocked Rangers, as Steven Gerrard suffered his second defeat in 18 games as captain of Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's recording showed the difference as Gary Holt's team moved on to the next round with Hibernian in minutes.
Gerrard's side are still undefeated in the Premier League this season and face the reigning champions Hearts, who will score 8 points next Sunday.
Rangers previously hosted Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston extended their unbeaten run in the league to six games with Holt still winning since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
The Livingstons lost the opportunity in front of a large audience.
Holt's team should have been in the lead before they scored with their lead giving Rangers all the trouble.
Scott Robinson achieved success through his strong effort across the front of the goal line to score, but Alan Lithgow managed to lead his team well after the ball went to defender Craig Halkett.
The hosts enjoyed having the Rangers play in front of them, knowing they could make the audience uncomfortable.
And it's the nature of the big input that comes in.
The Rangers received the free kick and the Livingston team made a field goal by Declan Gallagher and Robinson together forming Menga, who scored the goal and scored from the middle of the table.
At that stage, Rangers managed to score points but faced an unmanageable defender and goalkeeper Liam Kelly, who never had any major problems.
That form continued into the second pitch despite Alfredo Morelos's failed save from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was kicked out by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow scored a substantial amount of goals from Livingston's play.
The ball continued to enter the Livingston table and was broken consecutively, while two penalty shootouts after Halkett's game to defender Glenn Middleton and one for the ball were covered.
The "visible" by Livingston - analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
Great ballplay and results for Livingston.
For one man, the game was perfect, which still went beyond expectations on the course.
Their manner of playing and ball management has changed little since their return to the top flight, but a great reputation goes to Holt for the way he has pushed the team since his arrival.
He has many heroes.
Team leader Halkett was attentive to the fine-tuning of the defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their feet.
However, the Rangers have little momentum.
As well as they had been under coach Gerrard many times, they had fallen short of those standards.
Their last goal was a goalless draw - only when they beat the hosts and it was a surprise for Rangers in scoring in the middle of the table.
Erdogan is getting a hit in Cologne
There was a gloom and blue skies on Saturday (September 29) when the Turkish and German leaders met in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany in an attempt to repair ties between NATO allies.
They failed to address issues including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's membership in the European Union.
Erdogan then traveled to Cologne to open a new mosque.
The city is the home of the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police cited security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 from rallying in front of the mosque, but many supporters rallied to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters, mostly Kurds, made their voices heard, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
The protest reflected a split among the spectators, with some German Turks praising the heroes while others derided the dictators.
Car accident in Dibang: Cyclist killed in collision with car
A cyclist died in a truck collision in London.
The collision occurred near the intersection of Bestwood and Evelyn Streets, a major thoroughfare in Devon, in the east of the city, at around 10:15 a.m.
The driver stopped and doctors came to the rescue, but the man died at the scene.
The collision came several months after another cyclist died in a hit-and-run crash on Childers Road, about an hour away from the collision on Saturday.
City police said officers were working to identify the man and notify his relatives.
Road closures and city buses have been made and drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in chaos
Prison officials said six prison officers were injured in a riot in a high-security male prison.
The riot broke out at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire at around 09:30pm on Sunday and is ongoing.
Specialist officer "Tornado" was brought in to deal with the chaos in the arrests of eight prisoners and detained a group of people.
Several officers were treated for minor facial injuries at the scene.
A prison service spokesperson said: "Prison staff have special training in place to deal with the ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We should not tolerate violence in our prisons, and it is clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and may be in jail longer.
HMP Long Lartin holds more than 500 prisoners, including the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison warden was hospitalized after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, a corruption officer was called to jail to deal with a serious disturbance as staff were attacked with explosives.
Hurricane Ken Rosa is threatening Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with immediate flooding.
It's rare for climate degradation to be enough to strike Arizona, but that's what could happen early next week as the energy left over from Hurricane Rosa passes through the desert, bringing an immediate flood disaster.
The National Weather Service issued flash floods on Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona to eastern and eastern Nevada, eastern California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to make one trip to Phoenix on Tuesday, arriving late Monday with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted in an article that only ten cyclones have been tropical or weather-degrading within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) is a Hurricane Ken within 40 miles of the AZ border".
The National Center for Hurricanes recently predicted 2 to 4 inches of rain with peaks of up to 6 inches at the Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Other areas of the desert including the central Rockies and the Great Basin are likely to receive from 1 to 2 inches of precipitation with isolated totals of up to 4 inches.
The area facing immediate flooding, rain from Hurricane Rosa could be a blessing as the area is suffering from drought.
Although flooding is a major concern, some rainfall is likely to be beneficial as the desert is experiencing a drought-prone situation.
According to the U.S. Dry Disaster Management Agency, more than 40 percent of Arizona alone is experiencing severe drought, the second highest ranking, according to a report from weather.com.
First, the path of Hurricane Rosa leads to a landslide across the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Hurricane Rosa remained strong through Sunday morning with maximum sustained winds of 85 mph, 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moving north at 12 mph.
The storm is hitting the cold waters of the Pacific and will therefore be weakening.
It is therefore expected to make landfall in Mexico with a tropical storm strength of midnight or early afternoon on Monday.
Rainfall across parts of Mexico could be a serious contributor to major flooding.
Heavy rainfall of 3 to 6 inches is expected from Baja California to Sonora in the north, with up to 10 inches reported by weather.com.
Rosa then tracked northward across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning, slowing the path to tropical conditions that would make its way into Arizona and southern Utah late Tuesday.
The National Hurricane Center said the main catastrophe expected from Rosa or its remnants was heavy rainfall in Baja California, the Sonoran Desert and the coastal plain of the northeastern United States.
These rains are expected to create a threat to life by sudden flooding and landslide flows, sandy plains and landslides in mountainous areas, etc.
Midsomer Norton attack: four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested in an attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with a knife wound in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton at around 4am on Saturday.
He was taken to hospital as he was in "severe pain".
Avon and Somerset Police said a 17-year-old, an 18-year-old and a 20-year-old were detained overnight in the Radstock area.
Police officers appealed to anyone who could record the incident on mobile phones.
Trump says Kavanaugh has suffered the "pain and anger" of the Democratic Party
Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, that the election for Judge Kavanaugh was a vote to reject the Democratic Party's brutal and aggressive strategy.
Trump said Kavanaugh suffered the "pain and anger" of the Democratic Party throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress last Thursday, denying and dismissing allegations that Christine Blasey Ford sexually assaulted them decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing about her allegations.
The president said on Saturday that "the American people saw Kavanaugh's dignity and quality and courage" that day.
He told the West Virginia pro-choice crowd, "A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm the most legitimate legal mind of our time, a lawyer with a public service record".
The president referred to Kavanaugh's nomination as he spoke about the importance of the Republican vote in the midterm elections.
He said: "Five weeks after the most important election in our lives.
I'm not running, but I'm really running.
"That's why I'm everywhere fighting with other great candidates".
Trump cited the reason that Democrats have a mission to "contain and deter".
A senior GOP leadership aide told CNN that the first Senate vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected no later than Friday.
Hundreds killed by Indonesian earthquake, tsunami, with death toll rising
Authorities said on Saturday that at least 384 people were killed and many more drowned as massive waves hit the coast as a powerful earthquake and tsunami struck Indonesia's island of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in Palu on Friday when a 6m (18ft) high wave shook the beach at dawn, killing many and destroying everything on the beach.
The tsunami wave followed a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson of the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency BNPB, briefly told a news conference in Jakarta that "when the threat of the coronavirus hit on Saturday, people continued their activities on the beach and did not run away immediately and they became victims".
Nugroho said: "The tsunami wave did not come by itself, it shook Oslan, destroyed houses, destroyed everything on the ground. Moreover, the tsunami wave traveled through the sea at 800 km/h (497 mph) before hitting the coast".
He said, "Some climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived".
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 locations in Palu.
Aerial images released by the disaster agency showed that many buildings and shops were destroyed, bridges collapsed and collapsed, and a mosque was surrounded by water.
The earthquake continued to afflict the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes are known to have occurred in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Agency for Technology Assessment and Practice (BPPT) said in a statement that Friday's massive earthquake was about 200 times the strength of the atomic bomb that fell on Hiroshima during World War II.
It is said that the geography of the city, located at the end of a narrow strait, could increase the size of the tsunami wave.
Nugroho described the extent of the damage as "huge" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, modern shops and hotels had collapsed.
He said some of the victims' bodies were found under the collapsed building, and 540 people were injured and 29 others were missing.
Nugroho said the number of injuries and deaths and extent of damage could be even greater along the coast 300 kilometers north of Palu, a region called Donggala, which is close to the epicentre of the earthquake.
Nugroho said communications were "completely cut off without notice" from Donggala.
The Red Cross said in a statement that "more than 300,000 people live there", and its staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected area.
It's been said, "This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse".
The agency was heavily criticized on Saturday for not reporting a tsunami wave hit Palu, but officials said the tsunami arrived at a time of warning.
In a photo shared by a fan on social media, a man on the top floor of a building shouted alarming warnings of the approach of a tsunami wave to people on the street below.
Within minutes, a wall of water crashed into the shore, taking buildings and cars with it.
Reuters was unable to contain the focus of the images.
The earthquake and tsunami caused massive power outages and disruption of communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
Authorities said the military had begun to send cargo planes with aid from Jakarta and other cities, but those evacuated still needed food and other essential supplies.
The city's airport has been reopened for rescue efforts only and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the evacuation center in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to over 800.
It was terrible.
Doseba said that while World Vision staff from Donggala made it safely to Palu where the staff were throwing a party in the alley with colored flags placed in the main plaza of their office, they experienced a scene of destruction on the streets.
He said, "They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed".
It was terrible.
Although aid teams have launched a systematic movement of rescue efforts from the disaster, some have complained that highly skilled foreign aid donors are being prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies and personnel from abroad can begin once the affected area is declared a national disaster area.
That hasn't happened yet.
Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross, said: "It is still a provincial-level disaster.
When the government says, 'This is a national disaster,' we can be open to international aid, but that's not the case yet".
On the second night landed on Palu Island after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, those friends and family are still missing and they hope their loved ones will have a good time before the bad news of this natural disaster gets out.
On Saturday, a young boy was pulled from a toilet.
On Sunday, rescue teams freed a woman who had been stoned for two days with her mother by her side.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national boxing team, has trained two boxing students who are training for the Asian Games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Mandagi added that the others who were detained at the Roa Roa Hotel were his students.
"As a senior citizen in this world, I have my own emotional responsibility", he said.
Gendon described how within hours of the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel being circulated in his skiing community, he sent a loud WhatsApp message to Palu competitors attending the beach festival.
However, his message just saw a yellow sign instead of a blue sign.
He said, "I think that means the message was not sent".
Thieves steal $26,750 during ATM installation in Newport, Levee
According to a report from the Newport Police Department, the robbery on Friday morning stole $26,750 from Brink's employee workers who were depositing money into the Newport ATM in Levee.
The driver cleaned the ATM machine in the entertainment environment and prepared to give more money, Dennis McCarthy wrote in a release.
While he was working, another man ran out behind Brink's staff and stole a bag of money for transportation.
According to the release, witnesses found several suspects on the run, but police did not confirm the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with information on their identity should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West is changing his name to Ye.
Announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "Commonly known as Kanye West".
West, 41, is credited as Ye and used his eighth studio album, released in June.
The move came ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to unveil his new album Yandhi.
He replaced singer Ariana Grande on the show, which was cancelled due to "psychological reasons".
In addition to being the spelling of his current professional name, West has previously said that the word has religious significance for him.
West said earlier this year: "I believe that the word Ye is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means you".
"So I am you, I am we, it is we.
It's from Kanye, meaning unique to the word "Ye right, live right, reflect our good, our bad, our misunderstanding, everything.
This album is a reflection of who we are".
He is one of the few rappers to change their name.
Sean Combs is known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced his preference for the name Love and Brother Love.
West's former teammate, JAY-Z, also changed his name with or without a syllable and capital letters.
AMLO Mexico vows not to use military force against civilians
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed not to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloodshed revenge against students.
Lopez Obrador pledged on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he "will never use the military to attack the Mexican people".
The military opened fire on peaceful protests in the square on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people as the radical leftist student movement took root in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by giving monthly grants to those who study and opening a free public university.
He said unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract young people to criminal gangs.
The US should be funding the double A.I. project
Kai-Fu Lee, an AI investor and expert who has worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple, said that as China becomes more active on the issue of artificial intelligence, the United States should double its funding in the field.
Many commentators from different parts of the U.S. government have made announcements about AI projects, although the U.S. generally lacks an official AI strategy.
In parallel, China introduced its plan last year: the country aims to be the number one in AI technology by 2030.
"Double AI research funding is a good start because other countries are far from the US and we are looking for new opportunities in AI", Lee said.
Lee told CNBC in an interview this week that double funding could increase the chances of the next major AI breakthrough to take place in the United States.
Lee is the editor of the book "The Great Power of AI: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order", published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which invested in one of China's most important AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on the AI system that won the top American Othello player, and later was chief executive officer at Microsoft Research and head of its China office.
Lee acknowledged earlier US government technological challenges, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's manned development project, and asked for another back-up to help identify future prospects.
Lee said researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get government funding.
"It's not China that's taking away the academic leaders", Lee said, "it's business".
Facebook, Google, and other tech companies have hired influencers from many universities to work on AI projects in recent years.
Lee said that changing immigration policy could also help the United States step up its efforts.
He said, "I think green cards should be automatically given to AI PhDs".
The Chinese State Council released its Next Generation Creative Development Plan in July 2017.
Lee said the National Natural Science Foundation of China funds people at similar research institutions to the National Science Foundation and other government organizations that have given money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is low.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense established the Joint Intelligence Research Center, which intends to engage partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the creation of the Intelligence Committee.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for NSF, the company currently invests over $100 million a year in AI project research.
Meanwhile, the US lawmakers who sought to establish a National Security Commission on dictatorship have seen no action in the past few months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on changing the country's name
Macedonians voted on Sunday in a referendum on whether to change its name to the "Republic of North Macedonia", a solution to a decades-old dispute with Greece that has blocked its membership bid for the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, has claimed that the name of its northern neighbor represents a claim to its territory and has denied its entry to NATO and the EU.
The two governments signed an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but opposition nationalists claimed that the change would affect the ethnic identity of the majority population in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum, and a campaign of lobbying has cast doubt on whether voters will respond to the minimum 50 percent demanded for a referendum to take effect.
Question on the referendum: Do you want to join NATO and the EU by accepting the agreement with Greece?
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claimed that it was a price to continue entry into institutions such as the European Union and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje, said: "I came today to vote for the future of this country for the young people in Macedonia so that they can live freely under the framework of the European Union because it means a safe life for all of us".
Despite the lack of legal framework, many lawmakers have said they will respect the election results to make it a decision.
The name change would require a two-thirds majority in the House.
The state election organising commission said there were no reports of irregularities at 1 a.m.
However, turnout was 16 percent compared to the previous parliamentary election, 34 percent in 2016, of which 66 percent of registered voters voted.
Gjose Tanevski, a 62-year-old voter in the capital Skopje, said: "I came to vote because my children, our place is in Europe".
Macedonian leader Zoran Zaev and his wife Zorica and son Dushko voted for a referendum in Macedonia on a name change that would pave the way for the country to join NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov is preparing a small stage and throwing chairs in front of a stage set by those who will participate in the referendum.
Kavadarkov stated: "We are for NATO and the European Union, but we want to join our leadership not through the portal".
"We are a poor country but we have a price.
If they don't want to take us to Macedonia, we can disperse to other countries like China and Russia and become part of the regional European cohesion.
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO members would bring much needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
Zaev said after the vote count: "I am convinced that the majority of votes will be supported because 80 percent of our people will support the European Union and NATO.
He said the "consensus" result was "a confirmation of our future".
A poll released Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research said 30% and 43% of voters would participate in the referendum, which is below the required turnout.
Another poll conducted by Macedonian state television Telma found that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
For the referendum to be successful, the participants need to be 50 percent plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would represent the first serious attack on the policies of a Western liberal government since it came to power in May last year.
Watch Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero walk through Brighton's entire football defence:
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling sent Brighton's defenders to a 2-0 win over Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it incredibly clear in scoring their goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine received a half-century kick at the start of the series.
He fought three Brighton defenders before throwing into the field.
Aguero then saw four men in blue suits approaching him.
He pushed to the edge of a defender in front before running out of the Brighton goal.
He then pushed the touch to his left, the Sterling cap.
The English winger used the first kick to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right foot to hit Brighton's goalkeeper Mathew with a goal in the right corner of the penalty box.
Pep Guardiola, the city's school administrator, told reporters that Aguero was having some problems with his ankle.
We talked about his play for about 55 to 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
We were lucky at the time that he got a point.
But it was because of Sterling, who had given the Sky Blues first priority in the Premier League.
The goal was scored in the 29th minute.
Aguero received a good shot in the Brighton area in that game.
He delivered the ball well to Leroy Sane on the left wing.
Senn briefly defended the ball before passing it to Stalling to avoid a move into the long-range defence.
The Blooms rushed to catch the ball into the field just before they ran out.
The Champions League will be played at 12:55 pm on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play a game of craps to beat the Rockies.
With the Nationals eliminated from the playoffs, there is little reason to force any other start.
But the competitive-minded Scherzer hopes to get a game on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there is still a tie for the playoffs for the Rockies, the top seed in the NL West.
The Rockies earned points to go on to win 5-2 over the Nationals on Friday night, but they are still waiting to see their title capture in the first round.
If we're playing with nothing, at least we can get a sense of the atmosphere here in Denver for the crowd and other teams who will be wondering how high-level they are going to be playing against me this year.
Why don't I want to compete in it?
The National team has not yet announced the start of Sunday but has provided details to the Jersey players in the match.
The Chiefs will begin their 34th match, with the ball kicking off on Thursday and will play their usual Sunday.
The Washington right-hander went 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings in the game.
Trump supporters rally in West Virginia
The president made a blunt reference to the situation surrounding Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh while talking about the importance of Republican voter turnout in the midterm elections.
Everything we've done is risky in November.
The week before, there will be a major election in our lives.
It's a big election, I don't want to do it, but I have to do it, so I go everywhere to find the best candidate.
He continued, "You saw the opposition Democrats coming forward, now you see them.
And they are determined to take back power by any means necessary, you see from their greed for power and their selfishness.
They don't care about the people who suffer, who they have to trample to gain power and control, and what they want is power and control, and we're not going to give it to them.
He said that the democrats always have one mission: "Resistance and deterrence".
He said, "Well, you've seen them, and in the last four days, you've called the Democrats a group full of anger, anger and hate, and without integrity".
He addressed the Senate Judiciary Committee, Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, using a pseudonym that shocked his supporters.
Do you remember her answer?
Is it you who leaked the documents?
Oh, my God.
No, no, no, I remember - that was the worst slang I've ever seen.
Labour is no longer the big party.
They don't agree with you when you say something from your heart.
When the Momentum activists in my party voted against me, it was nothing surprising.
Speaking of which, I was the last Labour MP to be told that we were not welcome by them because we spoke from our hearts.
My colleague, Senator Joan Ryan, has been treated similarly because she is a strong opponent of discrimination against the Swiss.
In my case, the challenge to me was to criticize me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
Given the importance of economic policy, there is also a national security responsibility in Europe, which is the same issue that Jeremy has not agreed with previous leaders.
The announcement of the meeting at Nottingham East Labour on Friday meant that we wanted the outcome of the meeting to be coherent and fruitful.
In the more than eight years I've been a Labour MP, Friday night meetings have been pretty much the same.
But sadly, now many of the meetings that had political promises of "moderation and tolerance" have been completely forgotten and never even started.
It is clear that the dissenting view is no longer accepted in the Labour Party, and all opinions are judged whether they are acceptable or not, depending on the party leader.
It started after Jeremy became a leader, and he was someone who had worked with me, someone who I used to think I shared a political vision with, someone who started expecting me to do the opposite of what I had agreed to do, whether it was national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public, and no matter what I say, there is always a social media abuse calling for the abolition of political censorship, telling me that I should no longer be in the Labour Party.
And that's not just my experience.
In fact, I know I'm luckier than some of my colleagues because some of my opinions are political.
I am aware of the professionalism and commitment of my colleagues who face abuse and racism every day, but never wish it.
One of the things that frustrates me most in the current political era is that the level of rape is normal.
Jeremy Corbyn argued last week that Labour should promote a culture of tolerance and acceptance of differences.
The fact is, we're no longer the largest party, and with the vote of no confidence or the change in the electoral law, it's getting smaller.
I've been getting a lot of advice over the last couple of years, encouraging me to be more focused, not talk too much, so I don't have any problems.
But I didn't go into politics to do that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a schoolboy, which resulted from the Thatcher government's decision to discourage my large class from thriving, I have worked hard to provide better public services to those who need them most - whether they are councillors or government ministers.
I've never been a politician myself, including the last election.
No one in Nottingham East understands my policies and what is not in agreement with the current leadership.
To those who supported the theme on Friday, what I want to say is that when the country is demanding Brexit, which will affect our families, businesses and public services, I don't understand why I should waste my time and energy on lobbying the Labour Party leadership.
But the real message I want to convey, not to the Nottingham Momentum, but to my members, whether Labour or not: I am proud to have served you, and I promise that no threat of non-voting or any political gain will stop me from doing what I believe is in the best interest of all of you.
Chris Leslie is the Member of Parliament for Nottingham East
Ayr defeats Melrose 38 to 17: Ayr tops the table
The last two attempts may have resulted in a loss, but there is no doubt that the A's should have won Tennent's Premier League title.
They are now at the top of the standings, the team that has never lost a game in the top ten.
In the end, it was their great defense as well as a good opportunity that the home team and coach Peter Murchie should be excited about.
He said, "They have tested our game so far and we have not lost, so I have to be happy".
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "Congratulations to the E's, they've missed a better chance than us".
A try (run to the end) in the 14th minute by Grant Anderson and converted (after scoring with a shot and missing a goal) by Frazier Climo gave Ayr the lead, but Scotland's Rory Hughes, who was dismissed by Warrior, allowed Mason Bagelrose to score and Bagel Jones to score, but did not score.
Climo helped the A's to the lead by scoring a goal in the first tent before the player scored a solo try to give the A's a 17-5 lead at halftime.
But Melrose started well in the second tent, and a penalty by Patrick Anderson and a penalty by Baggot reduced the score to five points.
The match resulted in a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was sent off, and since the start of play, the A's have been able to move forward with the scores of Stafford McDowall, who has been a key member of the squad.
The A's interim captain Blair Macpherson was given a penalty, and Melrose scored a further point by Bruce Colvine at the end of a tense game.
The home side were back when Struan Hutchinson was given a wild card for kicking Climo out of the penalty box, MacPherson pushing from behind the Ayres' lead.
Clemons lost the wicket, which he had made since the start of play, after Kyle Rowe took David Armstrong's box kick into the net and sent Gregor Henry to score the home team's fifth goal.

Taking it back is a duty.
Across Bolivia, the landlocked country is still vividly remembered for a beach that was lost to Chile in the bloody 19th century resource conflict - as well as the desire to open a pier in the Pacific.
Those hopes have remained strong for decades as Bolivia waits for the International Court of Justice's decision on October 1 after five years of fruitful negotiations.
Roberto Calzadilla, Bolivia's Permanent Representative, said that Bolivia has a dynamic spirit of solidarity and calm and expects a positive outcome.
Many Bolivians will be watching the International Court of Justice ruling through the mainstream media across the country, hoping that the court in The Hague will believe Bolivia's claim that after decades of consistent negotiations, Chile should be obliged to negotiate to give Bolivia sovereign rights to its coastline.
Evo Morales, the popular Bolivian nationalist president facing a controversial re-election bid next year, is relying on a court ruling on Monday.
He vowed at the end of August, "We are about to return to the Pacific".
But some analysts believe the court is unlikely to reach Bolivia's wishes, and if it does, there will be little change.
The Netherlands-based UN agency has no authority to divide Chile and will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law, said that the fact that the International Court of Justice's decision came just six months after the last debate showed that the case was "unfair".
Instead of doing good for Bolivia, the last four years may have set the country back.
Zarate said that the problem of access to the sea was manipulated by the Bolivian administration.
She said Morales's rhetoric had damaged Chile's resolve.
Bolivia and Chile will be able to continue talking, but it will be very difficult to talk after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's ambassador to The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was too hasty and irregular.
He said that Monday is a day that will bring Bolivia a unique opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile and an opportunity to end 139 years of disagreement in the interest of mutual benefit.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who remains Latin America's most popular president, is using the maritime issue for political gain.
He added that Bolivia will not give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean.
This decision is an opportunity to show that we must overcome the past once and for all.
North Korea says there will be no nuclear weapons as long as it trusts the US
North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, said his country would not use its nuclear weapons if it did not trust Washington.
Ri made the remarks on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He urged the United States to follow through on the pledges made during the Singapore summit between the two leaders.
His comments came as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be in the process of restarting failed nuclear diplomacy more than three months after a summit in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
He said it was a "midday dream" to believe that continued US sanctions and opposition to a declaration ending the Korean War would lead to North Korea's defeat.
Washington was wary of the announcement, fearing that the city would not disarm first.
Both Kim and President Donald are keen for a second summit.
But there is widespread suspicion that Tangier is struggling to give up nuclear weapons, which the country sees as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to host the second summit between Kim and Trump.
The Paris fashion show shows the latest trends in the large-scale hat-wearing that is positioned on the main streets next to you.
If you want to increase your hair collection or wear a mask all day, look no further.
Fashion designers Valentino and Tom Browne have unveiled a stunning large-size hat collection for their SS19 collection on the runway dedicated to Paris Fashion Week.
The hats worn for the show hit Instagram this summer, and these designers sent their eye-catching hats to the showcase.
The Valentino hat is a large, large-headed hat with a large animal-like appearance that is hidden in front of the model.
Other cosmetics that are larger in size are potatoes, with a pear-shaped cap and a fruit-like texture - but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Tom Browne also showed off a strange option - one for Halloween.
Many of the colourful facades have a lip-synching effect, and are more akin to Hannibal Lecter's face than to haute couture.
The other is shaped like a swimming pool façade, which has a can and a window, while the other façade looks like a long narrow frame.
And if you keep up that big fashion statement, you're lucky.
Motorists predict that large, fancy hats will be popular and sold on the main streets near you.
The La Bomba-sized, two-foot-wide, leafy hat worn by Rihanna and Emily Ratajkowski.
The idea behind the casual hat, which has been popular on social media, has led to another big invention at fashion shows - a beach trundle bag made of a leaf that is almost as big as the model who wears it.
The pink flower box, decorated with petals like a rose with white leather seals, is a masterpiece by Jacques 'La Riviera of the SS19 label at Paris Fashion Week.
Famous designer Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "We are not waiting to see the big beach hats and bags on the highway for the upcoming summer because fashion designers have made it so influential that it will be difficult to question the demand for such large-scale materials".
John Edward: Language skills are important to people around the world
Scotland's private schools maintain a record of academic excellence, and this record was continued in 2018 with another outstanding test result, which reinforced character and achievement as a fitness in sports, art, dance and other community activities.
With over 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Private Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best possible services to students and their parents.
The private school aims to prepare its students for further education and postgraduate education for their chosen career and place as a citizen of the university.
In the field of education, which can be designed and implemented by school curricula, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, it goes into his head".
If you speak to him in his own language, that language goes to his heart.
This is a great reminder that we cannot rely on English alone when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the latest test results this year, we can see that languages are in the top table with the highest rates in private schools.
68 percent of all students of the school who studied foreign languages scored the highest.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of students scored A's in Chinese, 72 percent of German learners, 69 percent of French learners and 63 percent of Spanish learners also scored A's.
This shows that private schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as a key skill that children and young people need in the future.
Many of the languages chosen as subjects are given equal value to STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) subjects in private curricula and elsewhere.
A survey by the UK Labour and Skills Commission in 2014 found that the reason employers are having difficulty selecting staff was 17 per cent assumed to be lack of language skills.
So language skills are increasingly becoming a necessity in preparing young people for their future careers.
There are more and more job opportunities in the future that require multiple languages, so these language skills are fundamental in the business world.
No matter what career a person chooses, if they learn a second language, they will be truly equipped in the future to have the skills they need for as long as they need.
The ability to communicate directly with foreigners from different countries will automatically put multilinguals ahead of the competition for jobs.
According to a 2013 survey by market research firm YouGov of more than 40,000 adults in the UK, 75% of them cannot speak a foreign language fluently to communicate, and French is the only language they can speak fluently, with an average of 15%.
This is why investing in language teaching is so important for children today.
Multilingualism, especially in those in developing economies, will help equip children with better opportunities to find meaningful jobs.
Each school in Scotland will have a different language.
Some schools will focus more on classical and more traditional languages, although others will teach languages that are thought to be most important to the UK and looking to 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese, etc.
No matter what your child is interested in, there are always languages you can choose to learn in many private schools, and the teaching staff at those schools are all experts in this field.
Private schools in Scotland focus on providing learning environments that will engage children and equip them with the skills they need to succeed in the future.
At this point, it is not possible to argue in the global financial center that languages are so important for the future of any country, so all of this should be reflected in the whole education system.
Of course, modern languages should be considered as "international communication skills".
Private schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
We have to do it the best way we can.
John Edward is the head of the Scottish Private Schools Council.
The Lakers were led by head coach Mike Lapp, who was in his fifth year as head coach.
The fans' anticipation for LeBron James, who will be making his debut for the Los Angeles Lakers, has arrived.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in Sunday's pre-season opener against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how many minutes are to be played is yet to be determined.
Walton said on the Lakers website that it could be anywhere from one minute to 47 minutes.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James would be playing for a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers for the preseason schedule.
He said, "I don't need a pre-season game at this stage of my career to prepare".
The drug is a lithium-ion-ion generator in a YouTube channel
President Donald Trump began rallying supporters for a campaign tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It was the first of five rallies Trump held last week, with a few more in locations he's been drawn to, such as Tennessee and Mississippi, among others.
With a confirmation vote awaiting for the election to meet Supreme Court criteria, Trump intends to build support for the midterm elections as Republicans face losing control of Congress when the election is held in November.
What time is the Trump supporter rally in West Virginia tonight, and how do you watch it online?
The rally of Trump's supporters in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7 p.m. on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch the Trump supporter rally in West Virginia online, live on YouTube.
Trump is expected to settle a sexual assault charge with Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh this week, delaying the Senate confirmation vote by a week while the FBI investigates.
But the main purpose of this mass rallying is to help Republicans who are facing the November election get a boost.
According to Trump's campaign sources, the rally of five supporters last week was aimed at "motivating the many volunteers and supporters that the Republicans are trying to protect and increase their majority in the Senate and House of Representatives".
Trump's campaign spokesman, who declined to be named, told Reuters that controlling Congress was critical to his approach, as the president will travel to as many states as possible as we approach the hectic campaign season.
According to the West Virginia Metro News, the evening rally, held at Westbrook Stadium, could bring fans from Ohio and Pennsylvania and get support from the Pittsburgh media network.
Saturday will be Trump's second visit to Guinea during the month, a state where he won more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help out Virginia senator Patrick Morrisey, who is losing the election.
According to journalist Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of Versailles, Guinea, "it is not a good sign for Mauricio that the president is trying to help him in the election".
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA showcases bravery for the fight, hoping to go to the next one on Sunday
After three matches of each round, a four-man match on Saturday evening was a showcase for the might of the Ryder Cup.
Speed, which is a game concept that has been developed by players who believe in it and have participated in numerous competitions.
So what can we say, what is the acceleration now?
Jordi Spieth walked excitedly and said: "They are six points ahead and now there are four points left, well I think we have not made much progress".
Europe is more evenly matched, with four points up and 10 points to go.
Spitzer said yes, the American team, they felt too weak, they needed a lot of encouragement, especially the way Spitzer and Houston Thomas played each other all day and each boasted three points over four.
The batsman has played the ball from the starting position to the last hole of the ball (tee to green) and the leading run.
The cheering of Cantor intensified as his round went on to score the key goal to tie the score at four points as he and Thomas fell two points behind.
Their goal-kicking, which helped them win 15 games, generated a similar outcry to the screaming that he was convinced the Americans would not leave.
Spit told him, "You have to work hard and worry about your competition.
Every player is gone.
(Matthew 24:14) The apostle Paul wrote: "The things that are written in the Scriptures are written for you".
The players with the most points over the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed champion of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's most beloved oddity is four out of four, and you can't go wrong.
Mollywood is the only couple not to bogey on Saturday evenings, but they also avoid bogey on Saturday mornings, Friday evenings, and Broken (bogies from 10 to 18) on Friday mornings.
Such a run and the energy that flows from the crowd shows that they are the players to beat on Sunday, and there will be no more popular player to secure the great European victory when the sun sets in a national league like Fiorentina or Molinari.
What you want is for both to come out at the same time on different pipes.
It's not the time to talk about the glory of Europe.
The batsman, Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson, played fast with Sergio Garcia, the morning fourball player, when he was supplied with Alex Noren.
The bogie and the duck in the front nine led the Spaniards and the Swiss into a cage they could not get back into.
But on Sunday, no one will help you out.
The gameplay of the Fable (playing two versus two in the morning) and the Phantom (playing in the afternoon) is very interesting to watch because of the interplay between the warning codes they give, the warning they don't give, and the one where the strategy can be changed instantly.
Europe played better as a team so far and led on the day of the final, but the final also showed that the Americans had the fighting courage that some countries, especially the other American teams, doubted.
Europe won the final 10 to 6
Europe will be even better on the final day of the Ryder Cup after winning Saturday's final and the final, taking a 10-6 lead over the United States.
Tommy Flitworth and Frances Scully Molinari both led two wins over Tiger Woods to earn a four-point lead at Le Golf National.
The European team of Mozambique, who are bidding for the trophy they lost in Hazeltein two years ago, beat the Americans in the morning football match with a score of 3-1.
The United States struggled further in the finals, winning two games, but they still couldn't hold on to the loss.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points from each of the remaining games or the 12 singles on Sunday to retain the title.
Fleetwood was the first new European goalkeeper to score four points on the same night, while he and Molinari, who was named after Molinaro after the second pair played over the weekend, scored four points from the opening game in the Ryder Cup history.
After knocking down Watts and Triple-A in the FA Cup, they beat Watts and new American footballer Wesson DiCampbio perfectly by 5 & 4.
Watts, who finished two games on Saturday, showed his brilliance but still lost 19 of 29 games in the playoffs and the Falcons lost seven in a row.
Joe Styros took a break from football in the morning and returned to his team-mate Henrikh Stenson in the FA Cup with a 2-1 win over Dustin Stinson and Brooks Cubeca, who are ranked No. 1 and No. 3 in the world.
Europe is not playing well, even on the cheerful and comfortable terrain of the old Paris.
Gareth Spitzer and three-time champion Justin Thomas set the score for the Americans with two points to go on Saturday.
They won 2 & 1 against Spain's Anfal Torrey in the final and later defeated Torrey and Roma 4 & 3 in the final, losing two of their entries.
Only twice in Raiders history has a team come back from a four-point deficit to make the playoffs, even though Foerick's team-mates needed a tie to keep the title.
After being in second place for two days, the comeback on Sunday looked even more daring.
North Korea says there is no way to disarm unilaterally without trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions on the country only increase mistrust of the United States and there is no way the country will give up its nuclear weapons in any circumstance.
Ryongho told the annual conference that North Korea has taken significant voluntary measures in the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, evacuating nuclear test sites, and promising not to further develop nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
He said: "However, we have not seen any response from the United States".
If we can't trust the United States, we can't trust our national security, and in that situation, there is no way we can disarm first and foremost.
He continued to complain that Washington remained opposed to North Korea's "phased" approach to denuclearization, and that North Korea should be sanctioned as soon as it took further action.
He referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the US president and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work towards denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, while Trump pledged to ensure North Korean security.
North Korea has been seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington also opposed calls for an easing of the tough international sanctions on North Korea.
He said the US demanded the first elimination of nuclear weapons, increased the level of sanctions pressure to achieve its objective in a coercive manner, and even challenged the declaration of an end to the war.
The idea that punishment can lead to defeat is the daily dream of people who don't know us well.
But the problem is, it's true that work punishments are continuing to create more and more mutual distrust.
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US leader confirmed at the UN earlier this week.
The minister cited three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months, adding that "if the party to the nuclear disarmament issue is South Korea and not the United States, then the disarmament of the Korean peninsula is not in jeopardy".
However, the tone of Ri's speech was very different from last year when he told the U.S. General Assembly that targeting U.S. territory with North Korean rockets was inevitable after President Bashar called Kim a "suicide rocket man".
This year at the UN, Trump, who last year threatened to destroy North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in pursuing disarmament measures, but he also said there were more things North Korea needed to do and sanctions must continue until North Korea abolished nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no specific time frame for this, saying "if it takes two years, three years, five months - no problem".
China and Russia claim the UN Security Council should grant condolences to the city of Pyongyang for the measures it has taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that the implementation of the Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and successfully until we know the complete elimination of nuclear weapons.
The Security Council has consistently pushed for sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an effort to stop its attempts to spend on Pyongyang's missile and nuclear weapons programs.
Pham Minh met with Ri outside the United Nations and said he would visit Phnom Penh again next month to host the second summit.
Pham has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip didn't go smoothly.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying what North Korea had achieved in a matter of hours had attacked him as "excessive demands like a big wall".
North Korea promised at a meeting with Moon this month to disclose missile and nuclear sites if the United States took appropriate action.
He said Kim told him that the "appropriate or appropriate measures" he was looking for were Trump's security guarantees promised in Singapore and toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on adequate rest
A new study at Harvard this year gave its graduate students enough sleep in an effort to combat a violent culture that is becoming a culture of coffee drinking to study without sleep.
One study found that students at the world's top universities often don't know even the basics of how to take care of themselves.
Professor Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the training after a discussion about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
At the end of the discussion, a girl came up to me and asked, "Why are you telling me this when I'm in fourth grade?"
He told The Telegraph that she said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me.
The course, which debuted this year, explains to students about good sleep habits that help with study and exercise as well as improve students' overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychology at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to offer the course after finding that some students were not getting enough sleep during the week.
The one-hour course is related to free communication.
In one section, a picture of a living room where students are asked to click on a coffee cup, a shoe and a book, is told about the effects of caffeine and light, and how labor is affected by sleep deprivation and the importance of sleep habits.
In another study, participants were told that prolonged sleep deprivation could increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
The map of the school environment, with its inter-religious imagery, encourages participants to reflect on their daily routines.
Professor Czeisler added: "We know that this course will not change students' behavior immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know -- just as you have a right to know about the health effects of smoking.
The culture of pride in getting people to stay awake is still there, he added, adding that modern technology and the increased pressure on students means that their lack of sleep is a growing problem.
He said that ensuring that they get enough sleep should be the students' secret weapon to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety. He added that it helps prevent weight gain because not getting enough sleep keeps the brain in a state of hunger that makes them feel hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California native who is studying biochemistry and biophysics, helped Zeisler organize the training last year during his freshman year at Harvard.
They said the training made them visible and inspired them to push for a curriculum for the entire school.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all students to complete a similar program before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Gesler suggested that students should consider setting the clock, such as when to go to bed and when to wake up, and be aware of the effects of blue light emitted by electronics and LEDs, which can cause the brain to move in a different direction, leading to problems with sleep.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Menga bowling to Gerrard
The Rangers suffered another defeat when the Limoges striker scored for Stevenage Reds in a 1-0 win at home to Livingston.
The match was drawn at St Johnstone Road on 1 February, but Gary Holt's team suffered a second defeat in 18 games as manager to give his side eight points from Ladbrokes Premiership leaders Hearts.
Menga scored the lead seven minutes before the end of the first half and the Rangers' lineup seemed to be weak.
While Rovers dropped to sixth, Livingston moved up to third and behind Hibernian by the difference of goals scored.
And it can be even more problematic for the goalkeeper after the ball is out, as the spanner is treated for a head injury after an object is thrown off the field to be scored.
Zarad made eight changes to the team that went out of the league and into the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holte, on the other hand, was on the same page as Livi 11, who scored a point from Hart last week and was so full of his club that his opponent was almost exhausted.
The Rangers managed to manage the ball, but the Wings did even better with the ball they managed.
They should have scored the goal with just two minutes to go, when Menga's inaction sent Scott Pittman in and made Allan McGregor score a goal, but the line-up failed to seize the opportunity.
Keaghan Jacobs' free kick found the cricket team's captain Craig Halkett, but his teammate Alan Lithgow kicked the penalty away behind goal.
The Rangers were hoping to get the ball but hopefully it was more than believing in their play in the final third.
Alfredo Morelos really felt he should have gotten a penalty kick in the 25th minute as he and Steven Lawless were tied, but the referee Steven Thomson dismissed Columbia's bid.
Rennes managed to score only two goals on the pitch, but Liam Kelly, the veteran goalkeeper, was unhindered by striker Lassana Coulibaly and resisted the attack from Ovie Ejaria.
While the 34th minute opener by Levy may have been the rest of the game, no one can deny that they deserved what they put in.
The plan failed again to resist the conspiracy when the ball was put into play.
Scott Arfield did not react, while Declan Gallagher scored a goal to keep Scott Robinson from choosing Menga for the simple finish.
Coulibaly took Ryan Kent and the switch was effective immediately as the winger tied with Morelos, but Kelly ran out of his line to catch him.
But Winston continued to attract guests to their favourite sport, while Lithgow and Halkett were just two balls away at the edge of the field.
Holt's team could have taken the lead in the final stage, but McGregor showed a refusal to take the plunge before Lithgow took the lead from the corner.
Glenn Middleton's replacement had another claim for a penalty while he ran with the Cubs, but Thompson escaped again.
Almanac: The creator of the Geiger Counter
And this is a page from Sunday morning, September 30, 1882: today, 136 years ago and counting... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
He developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, which eventually led to the invention of the device known as the Geiger Counter.
The superiority of science, unprecedented since the advent of computer hardware, has also become a major pop culture phenomenon, as in the 1950 film Bells of Coronado, played by the unlikely scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans.
What is it? What is it?
ROGERS: It's a software hacking tool used to locate radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms given by radioactivity in the mineral.
Evans: It's definitely floating up now!
H.G. Hager died in 1945, just a few days short of his 63rd birthday.
But the invention of this device bears his name to this day.
New cancer vaccines can teach the immune system to see and hear about cancer cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to spot stem cells and kill them.
The vaccine trains the immune system to recognize and target stem cells, which is part of the treatment.
This technique involves taking immune cells from a patient and then changing them in a laboratory.
Then they can look at the common, potentially multi-cancerous proteins and then re-inject them.
An experimental vaccine has shown successful results in patients with limited levels of cancer.
A woman who was treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize sperm cells found that her ovarian cancer had gone away in over 18 months.
The method involves removing immune cells from patients, modifying them in the laboratory so that it can detect a common, multi-cancer protein called HER2, and then re-injecting the cells.
If we follow Dr. Berzofsky from the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, who said, "Our results suggest that we have a great vaccine".
Dr. Jebrzewski explains that HER2 promotes the development of several types of cancer, including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer, and colorectal cancer.
A similar method of harvesting immune cells from patients and teaching them how to target cancer cells has worked effectively in treating certain types of blood cancers.
Kanye West began to mingle with fans, wearing a MAGA hat after appearing on SNL.
It didn't work out so well.
Kennedy West made a statement in his studio during a Saturday night live broadcast after a huge performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run for president in 2020.
After he sang his third song that night, Ghost Town, and wore a sign that read Make America Great, he spoke out against the Democrats and raised his support for Trump.
Many times, many times, I talk to white people and they say, "Why do you like him when he's so racist?"
He said, "Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America long ago".
SNL began with a performance by Matt Damon, who in Hollywood made a mockery of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on allegations of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not televised, a video of West was posted on social media by actor Chris Rock.
It is unclear whether Rod is trying to embarrass West for posting such a video.
Similarly, West complained to the audience that he had trouble in the backstage about his costume.
They've been doing me wrong behind the scenes.
"Don't wear this out!" they said.
They have wronged me!
He said, according to The Washington Examiner, "They said I was in a psychiatric facility".
West continued, "Wast continued, 'Do you want to go to a mental institution?' by saying, 'He should wear my black hat because this means, 'You can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to grow?'
Try to love a little bit.
His comments caused increasing dissatisfaction among the audience, and the cast members of SNL seemed embarrassed. There were various reports that someone there told reporters: "The whole studio was silent like a dead man".
West is the replacement for former singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mark Miller, died days before the concert.
West was very skeptical about performing the song "I Love It" dressed as a Perrier Bottle.
Wes received support from TPUSA's president, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest spirits: Thank you for speaking your mind".
But on the chat show, Karen Hunter tweeted that West was the kind of person he was, and he was amazing.
But I've decided not to encourage anyone (by simply buying his tutorials or his clothes or supporting his art) who I believe is promoting a change-accepting ideology and a release that is harmful to my community.
He has the right to freedom.
She added, "So are we".
Before the performance, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying he was now "officially a celebrity known as Kenny West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow Diddy's adventures on the digital platform, also known as Puff Daddy and Puffy and P Diddy.
Following the events of the rapper Snoop Dogg's name is Snoop Lion, and of course the legendary Prince changed his name as a symbol, and then the artist was known as Prince.
Accusations of attempted murder at Belfast Hotel linked to the death of a man
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a hotel in east Belfast on Friday.
Police said the incident took place in Ballyhackamore.
The accused are expected to appear before the Magistrates' Court in Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington has attacked being a toxic man
Keith Haring plays Jon Snow in the epic fantasy film adaptation of HBO's Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor attacked a misconception of the male hero macho, saying that acting roles in plays make boys feel they must be wild to be highly respected.
Speaking to the Sunday Times Culture, Keith said he believed something was wrong and questioned how to address the issue of male peer pressure with #MeToo.
Keith recently married Rose Leslie, co-star of Game of Thrones, who, at 31, admitted that he felt "very strongly" needed to address the issue.
He said, "I personally feel it's very necessary at this time. What is the problem with being too much of a man?"
What kind of boys do we teach who will be men when they grow up in the face of the problems we see today?
Keith believes television may be partly responsible for the increasingly toxic masculinity caused by its own male characters.
He continued: "What is it that comes from the birth and what is it that can teach?
What is taught on TV and on the streets that makes boys feel that they have to be in a certain way (be something) to be a man or a real man?
I think that's the big question of our generation -- how do we change this?
Because it's obvious what's wrong with young people.
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not retire to Game of Thrones before or after the series ended this summer, saying he had finished the "do-it-yourself" story in the Village on a Horse's Neck.
Starting in November, Keith will star in the revival of Sam Shepard's True West, a story of a filmmaker and his brother-in-law who are bandits.
The actor recently revealed that he considers meeting his wife, Rose, to be the best thing to come out of Game of Thrones.
He said, "I met my wife in this play, so in that way it gives me a family for my future and my life from this point on".
Rose plays Ygritte, the girlfriend of Keith's protagonist Jon Snow, in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy drama.
The couple married in June 2018 on the grounds of the state capitol, surrounded by the Leslie family estate in Scotland.
HIV or AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
Health officials said that in the country, more than 820,000 people were affected.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Most of these new cases are sexually transmitted, which is different from the previous cases.
HIV has spread rapidly in parts of China, primarily due to contaminated blood transfusions.
Chinese health officials at a conference in Yunnan province said the number of people born with HIV in this way has already been reduced to almost zero.
However, year-on-year the number of people living with both HIV and AIDS in China has risen to 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a complex issue in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality has been decriminalized in China since 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to still be high.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
The transmission of the disease is mostly caused by a lack of sexual immunity in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged to make HIV treatment available as part of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies the leaked GOP Senate data, strongly criticizing it as "dangerous fraud" and "conspiracy".
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday condemned allegations that a member of her staff had posted the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on the congresswoman's Wikipedia page.
Los Angeles Democrat politicians claim that the allegations are pushing more from professional groups and right-wing websites.
Waters said in a statement on Twitter that "Lies, lies, and the most hateful lies".
The information released under the report includes the home address and phone numbers of U.S. Congressmen Lindsay Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of whom are in Utah.
The news emerged online on Thursday, when it was posted by unknown persons on the Capitol Hill website during the Senate hearing on sexual misconduct charges against Brett Kavanaugh, the recipient of the Supreme Court nomination.
The news came just after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh's response.
According to Hill, which reported that conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address of the Internet service provider that identified the source of the post was associated with Waters' office and released information of Waters' staff members.
Ms. Wordsworth continued, "This baseless accusation is completely untrue and a complete myth".
"My staff members have been compromised in their identity, personal information and security due to these false and untrue allegations, I am not responsible for the disclosure of this information".
This baseless accusation is completely untrue and a complete myth.
Waters's comments prompted online criticism from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
Ari Fleischer wrote: "This denial is made out of anger".
This shows that she is not qualified to be a member of parliament.
When someone is accused of something they did not do, they should not get angry.
They should not be stubborn.
They are not to be questioned about the motives of the accuser.
not to be deceitful, but to be quiet.
Ari Fleischer appears to be comparing Ms. Thatcher's reaction to Democratic criticism of Justice Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of appearing too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate who is running to oust Waters from the seat in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
He praised it on social media, pretending that "it's a big deal if it's true".
In her statement, Waters said her office had warned "appropriate authorities and law enforcement agencies" about these false allegations.
She continued, "We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed and they will be held legally accountable for all their destructive and dangerous actions against all members of my staff".
Rating for the film with anti-Johnny English Strikes Again: Rowan Atkinson, a powerless male comedian
It is now a tradition to explore the significance of the UK's withdrawal from the EU in new films with a more British-style perspective and which could benefit from a revival of the rights to the comedy-drama, Attack with Johnny English - which began in 2003 and was revived in 2011 with the new series Johnny English Reborn.
Is the self-deprecating talk about the subject of being as thin as garbage a new export opportunity for the country?
In any case, the British comic book artist Johnny English has been granted a second license to re-imagine his story - his name is a symbol of nothing more than a showcase for non-English-speaking comic books, but people like to go to see such films.
He is, in fact, a fire-breathing secret agent who, despite his bizarre disguise, is a bit like the comic book character Clouseau, a bit like Mr. Bean, and is as aggressive as the soundtrack of Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
His character was originally based on Atkinson, a traveller and mystery international man who was aired with a Barclaycard TV commercial, leaving a mess after he awoke from his sleep.
Had a good time once or twice on the last JE cruise.
I love where Johnny English approaches the superhero in a medieval cotton suit and has a light-lighted butterfly wings against his safety helmet.
Atkinson's talent for dark comedy was shown, but the one-sided humor made it seem like the comparison was too useful, too weird, too inappropriate, and especially like the characters of the big-budget films like 07 and Mission Impossible, which also included comedy.
The comic makes it feel like it's more about the kids than the adults, and to me, Johnny English's crazy adventure is less innovative and more focused than Atkinson's silent comic in the character of Ben.
A common topic of discussion at the moment is that the UK is in serious trouble.
A hacker has infiltrated the UK's top secret shopping network, revealing the identities of all the UK's secret agents in the sector, causing the intelligence services to be upset - a pitiful pittance for Kevin Eldon to step into.
It was the last chance for the beating prime minister to prepare for the fight and suffer a major political loss of popularity: Emma Thompson did her best and with a staff almost as good as Theresa May, but still couldn't solve the problem.
Her intelligence adviser told her that because each active engagement was downgraded, she would have to retire and return to work.
And that means the self-described Johnny English, who is now hired to teach in a top-notch institution, but gives informal lessons in how to be a secret agent: there are some great comics here, with English giving lessons on how to make stuff like the School of Rock comics.
English was sent back to the White House for an emergency briefing and reunited with his long-suffering, wealthy former neighbor, Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough, now a married man, was sent to the captain of a submarine, a thrilling acting role in which actress Vicki Pepperdine performed poorly.
So Batman and Robin of making things wrong on the Lord of the Rings franchise are back in action, facing off against Olga Kurylenko's Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is in danger of falling under the spell of a passionate tech giant who claims to solve Britain's computer woes: the fearsome Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough embark on their hilarious adventure: posing as a table runner, they set fire to a luxury French restaurant, create a physical destruction, and escape on the Volta's racing yacht, and English causes a stir when he attempts to use a realistic earpiece to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's home.
All stops and stops are set aside for the last few free ones, but despite its friendly and humorous nature, it is a children's TV show.
It's a good average.
And as with other Johnny English films, I still wonder: Could the British film industry not give Rowan Atkinson the first acting moment of his talent?
Labour denies that it is developing a plan for the British to work four days a week but are being paid for five.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party will consider a big, quick plan that would give Britons four days a week - but pay for five.
The party reportedly wants the companies to pass on the savings generated through the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to salaried workers by giving them extra vacation days.
It's nice to see employees enjoying three days of the week, but they can still get the same pay.
According to the sources, the idea may be in line with the party's economic approach and plans to make the country more labour-friendly.
The Trades Union Congress has backed a shift to a four-day workweek as a way for wage workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party source told The Sunday Times: "A review of the policy is expected to be announced before the end of the year".
"It will not happen in one go, but a four-day work week is a desirable goal that is in line with the party's approach to rebalancing the economy by giving to wage workers as well as the party's overall industrial strategy".
The Labour Party was not the first to support such an idea, as was the Green Party, which pledged a four-day work week during its 2017 general election campaign.
The desired goal is currently not supported by the entire Labour Party.
However, a spokesperson for the Labour Party said: "A four-day work week is not the party's policy and the party has not considered the goal".
Former opposition leader John McDonnell used last week's Labour Party conference to add detail to his vision for a socialist economic revolution.
McDaniel said he was committed to taking back power from the "faceless executives" and "profitable lobbyists" in the public service.
The plan by the former opposition leader also means that current shareholders in the state-owned company may not be able to get their entire shares back, as the Labour government may work to "cut" them off on the basis of dishonest behavior.
The former archbishop also confirmed plans to put salaried workers on the company's board and set up a permanent ownership fund to give 10 per cent of private sector company assets to employees, who are likely to pocket an annual bonus of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy, told 60 Minutes television program whether the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds.
The FBI investigation into the indictment of Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week, raising questions about whether the bureau's findings could influence any Republican senators in withdrawing their support.
In an interview aired on Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asked Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find anything that would lead them to change their minds.
Kennedy seems more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
Kennedy said, "I mean, really".
I said I'd go into the courtroom, I said I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, the indictment came out and said, "Did he do it?"
He was strong-willed, determined, and unquestioning.
In this respect, Graham's argument seems to be difficult to change.
He said, "My decision has already been made about Brett Kavanaugh and he will accept the charges that could be exploded".
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett denied it outright", Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
And all the people she mentioned by name that couldn't be contained.
He is 36 years old.
I don't see anything new changing.
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
On Saturday, New York City will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual concert event featuring exciting stars, big acts, and equally exciting missions in the quest to end global poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the Universal Citizens Festival will see tens of thousands of people flock to Central Park's Great Lawn to not only enjoy performances by Janet Jackson, Cardi B and singer Shawn Mendes, but also to raise the real bar for the event's goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Universal Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international humanitarian advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of activists actively fighting it.
To receive free tickets to the event (unless you agree to pay for a ticket to the VivaVie) the concertgoers must complete a series of tasks or activities such as volunteering, emailing world leaders, making phone calls or any other meaningful way to help promote their goal of ending poverty.
But just how successful has Global Citizen been with 12 years left to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with free concerts really a good way to get people to act by calling for action, or is it just another case of what's called "social media activism" - people feel like they're making a real difference by signing online invitations or sending digital social media messages?
Since 2011, Universal Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million actions from its fans, which pushes for even more diverse targets.
They say these actions have helped to inspire world leaders to announce commitments and policies that are worth more than 37 US dollars, which is set to impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group raised 390 commitments and declarations arising from its activities, at least 10 million US dollars of which were re-allocated or raised.
The group estimates that the funds left safe have the potential to positively impact nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and practitioners committed to helping children grow to their full potential, pledging to provide Rwanda with another US$35 million to help end the country's food shortage after receiving over 4,700 social media messages from university citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and citizens alike, we can make the social phenomenon of malnutrition a more comprehensive explanation later in history", the ambassador of the nutrition programme, Tracey Ullman, told the crowd during a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken, there were calls for the UK to improve access to maternal and child nutrition, and the government announced funding for one such initiative, the Power of Nutrition programme, which will reach 5 million mothers and children, as well as nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the most frequently asked questions on its website, which asked, "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
The general public responded: "It will be a long and difficult road - sometimes we fall and fail".
But like the civil rights movement and the nationalist ideology that preceded us, we will succeed because we are more empowered if we paint together.
Janet Jackson, singer The Weekend, rapper Cardi B, singer Janelle Monáe are among some of the acts performing at this year's event in New York City, which will be hosted by Deborah-Lee Furness and Howard Chat.
US Navy could use blockade to block Russian energy exports - Washington Secretary of State
The US Navy could, if necessary, be used as a last resort to block Russian energy from reaching markets, including in the Middle East, according to a Washington Examiner report by U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ayaan Zinke.
Zincki accused Russia's involvement in Syria - a notable one in which the country is operating at the invitation of the legitimate government - of being a trap to explore new energy markets.
He said, "I believe the reason they're in the Middle East is they want to be the energy hub, like they do in Europe, the Middle East, the southernmost part of Europe.
And according to the minister, there are ways and means to solve this problem.
He said the US has a navy capable of ensuring that the sea lanes are open and if necessary shut down to ensure that their energy does not enter the market.
Zinke was speaking at an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group called Voice of the Energy Consumer in the United Arab Emirates.
He compared Washington's approach to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they are similar.
Zinke was speaking at an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group called Voice of the Energy Consumer in the United States.
The statement came as the Trump administration is on a mission to push for its own liquefied natural gas exports to Europe to replace Russia, a cheaper alternative for European consumers.
For this reason, Trump's administration, including the US president himself, has been trying to persuade Germany to withdraw the Nord Stream 2 oil pipeline, which Trump says makes Berlin a symbol of Moscow if Germany does not.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is being built to increase pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a clean economy project.
The Kremlin argued that Washington's fierce opposition to the project was motivated by economic reasons and was a model of unfair competition.
Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September that "I believe we share the view that energy is not a tool to put pressure on each other and that consumers should be able to choose their own suppliers".
The US move has prompted a strong reaction from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the same project.
Germany's leading industry body, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the United States not to interfere in the EU's energy policy and the bilateral agreement between Berlin and Moscow.
Dieter Kempf, president of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), said after a recent meeting between former German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin that "I have a big problem when third states interfere with our energy supply".
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will "consider the most carefully" the 2020 presidential race
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would "consider very carefully" running for president after the midterm elections.
During a meeting at a city hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider running for office.
According to The Hill, she said, "It's time for women to go to Washington and treat the ruling government, which includes a woman in the top cabinet".
After November 6, I will think very carefully about running for president.
Warren argued with President Donald Trump during a town hall meeting, saying he was leading the country in the wrong direction.
She said: "I am deeply concerned about the impact that Donald Trump is having on our democracy".
Warren was highly critical of Trump and Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before the election".
However, a poll released on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's supporters thought she should not run for president in 2020.
According to the Suffolk University Political Research Center, Boston University polls show that 68 percent of potential voters from Massachusetts said the senator should not run for president.
Thirty-two percent supported women running for president.
The poll showed strong support for former governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent in favor of his bid and 48 percent against.
Other prominent Democratic candidates who have brought up the possibility of a 2020 presidential race include former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make a formal decision in January.
Sarah Palin quotes Track Palin's post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) at a rally of supporters of Donald Trump.
Tracey Fallin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in the Army in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence Monday night.
She told Trump supporters at a rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, that "what my son is going through, what he will have to go through when he comes back, I can understand the feelings of other families who have PTSD and some of the injuries our soldiers have when they come back".
Falin called his arrest a "big issue not being brought up", and she also spoke of her son and other former infantry veterans, who "come back differently, come back with different grades, come back with questions about whether their fellow soldiers, both infantry and airmen, are being respected for what they have done for this country".
According to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department, he was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with assaulting a woman, making violent statements, and possessing a weapon while intoxicated.
18 states, Washington D.C. support challenges to new immigration policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting legal challenges to a new U.S. policy that denies immunity to victims of domestic violence who flee or are victims of domestic violence.
NBC News reported that representatives from 18 states and districts filed a petition Friday in Washington to support policy-defying asylum seekers.
The full name of the plaintiff in Grace v. The suit, filed in August by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy, has not been released.
She said her partner and her son, who was a member of the violent gang, raped her, but U.S. officials denied her request for asylum on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
The state attorneys who are assisting Ms. Haggerty described the cases of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which have filed numerous petitions for asylum in the United States as they face the general problem of gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy amended a 2014 resolution by the Immigration Security Council that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Attorney General of Colombia Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "does not violate decades of international law and constitutional law, federal law".
The representative of the petitioner to the court said that "Federal law requires that all claims of copyright be adjudicated on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the complaint, and such a barrier is a violation of that principle".
The attorney further argued in brief that policies that deny entry to immigrants have had a negative impact on the U.S. economy, saying they could become entrepreneurs and "a necessary supply of labor".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and violence in June.
Sessions said in his June 11 statement: "The right of asylum is available only to those who have left their country because of persecution or fear of persecution because of their race, religion, nationality, or membership in a social or political group".
Requiring asylum does not mean reducing all problems, it does not even reduce all the serious problems that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as death toll doubles in search for survivors
The situation is even more serious for those who survive.
Risa Kusuma, 35, who was caring for her son with a fever at a shelter in Paulo, said: "It felt very stressful".
Ambulances are bringing bodies almost every minute.
Clean water is also lacking.
Seeing residents returning to their destroyed homes to pick up the leftovers and try to collect what they can.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals suffered damage from the 7.5 magnitude quake.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, sustained neck and shoulder injuries outside the Palau's Army Hospital and patients were treated outside due to the tremors.
Tears were streaming down his eyes as he recalled the devastating earthquake that shook the fifth-floor hotel room where he was staying with his wife and daughter.
There is no time to save yourself.
Harris further told The Associated Press that his family was in town for their wedding.
I heard my wife's scream for help, but then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to him and my child.
I hope they are safe.
US ambassador accuses China of "threatening" by "targeted torture advertising"
A week after a Chinese official newspaper ran a four-page ad in the American daily newspaper boasting of the mutual benefits of US-China trade, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using American media to promote targeted sanctions.
US President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to the news of the spending of China Daily in the Des Moines Register, Iowa's best-selling newspaper, after accusing China of trying to interfere in November's sixth US congressional elections, a charge China denies.
Trump's allegation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the US election marked what US officials told Reuters was a new phase in Washington's growing campaign to pressure China.
While foreign governments have placed advertising to promote trade, it is common that Beijing and Washington are currently and are locked in an escalating trade war, which has forced the two countries to raise import tariffs on each other.
Chinese and US experts say China's retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade war are deliberate to target exporters in states like Iowa, which has backed Trump's Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing has affected American workers, farmers and finance.
Chinese Ambassador Branstad wrote in an article in the Des Moines-Ridder newspaper on Sunday that China is now increasing the double threat with its crime and propaganda in our free press.
Ambassador Brenstaad wrote that "in spreading its condemnation, the Chinese government has taken advantage of the American tradition of free speech and free press by placing paid advertising on the Des Moines, R.I. newspaper".
"On the contrary, if you look at the newspapers on the streets of Beijing, you will find very few dissenting voices and not a real reflection of the different ideas that the Chinese people have about the troubled economic nature of China, because the media is under the control of the Chinese Communist Party", he wrote.
He added that one of China's most prominent newspapers had offered not to publish his article, although he did not say which newspaper.
Analysts warn that Republicans are trying to isolate women voters ahead of the midterm with the Kavanaugh crisis.
As top Republican lawmakers prepare to defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who faces sexual assault charges, analysts warned they would see a backlash, especially from women, in the run-up to the upcoming midterm elections.
There is a lot of interest around this issue, and most Republicans are indicating that they want an early election.
Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, told The Hill about the article published on Saturday that there is no going back.
Reeher said that the insistence of Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) that there be an FBI investigation was not enough to anger the owners.
According to the Washington, D.C. newspaper, Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesperson for MoveOn, said Friday that "women will not forget what happened yesterday, nor will they forget it tomorrow and in November".
On Friday morning, protesters shouted "November is coming!" as they protested in the Senate Chamber as the conservative Republicans who control the Judiciary Committee decided to move forward with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
Independent political analyst Stu Rothenberg told the news site that "blasphemy and democracy promotion will be shut down immediately".
Some people say it's already happened, that's true.
And it's already defined that way, especially for urban voters and young voters aged 18 to 29. If they don't like the president, they don't vote.
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing his allegations of sexual assault against the nominee for the Supreme Court, analysts have suggested that a backlash could occur if Republicans push for further confirmation.
According to NBC News, Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said earlier this week: "This has become a huge scandal for the Republican Party".
Guy Cecil, chairman of Priorities USA, a group that helps Democrats elect, noted to the news network that "it's not just about the commission's election or the last election or Kavanaugh being appointed as chief justice, it's about how Republicans should handle it and how they should implement her".
However, the American public seems to be more likely to believe either Ford's testimony or Kavanaugh's testimony, which they are more inclined to believe.
A new survey by market research firm YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents believe strongly or strongly in Ms. Fadde's literary works, and 35 percent said they believe strongly or strongly in Ms. Kavanaugh.
Furthermore, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh lied during his testimony, and only 30 percent said the same about Ms. Howard.
According to a report in The Guardian, at the urging of Congressman Flake, the FBI is also investigating the allegations made by Ford and another accuser, Deborah Ramirez.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh was drunk and raped her when she was 17.
Remireh alleged that the nominee for the Supreme Court position revealed his gender to her when they attended a prom while they were studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventors of the World Wide Web are planning a new Internet to beat Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, has launched a new company to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the tech giant, Inrupt, is a company that develops Solid, an open source technology by Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and what information users are allowed to access.
In a separate interview with Fast, Berners-Lee jokingly said that the motive behind the creation of the Internet was "global domination".
He said of the new company, "We have to do it now".
It was a historic moment.
The software uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own personal or POD online data stores.
It can store addresses, contacts, job lists, analytics, music, and other personal and professional equipment.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify, all in the same browser at the same time.
The great thing about personal online databases is that it's completely up to the user to access what kind of information.
The company called it "data-powered self-empowerment".
Inrupt's vision, according to CEO John Bruce, is for the company to bring the right resources and expertise to make Solid available to everyone.
The company is currently owned by Berners-Lee Bruce, and the security technology was purchased from IBM, a few developers were contracted to work on the project, and a volunteer coding association.
Starting this week, tech developers around the world can create their own mindset using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team would not talk to Facebook and Google about changing their business models completely.
We don't ask their permission.
In a post published by Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to empower the business and ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new networks built on Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee revolutionized the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Bernays-Lee has become a powerful voice in the underground debate.
Even at the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and chairman of the World Wide Web Association, the director of the Web Foundation, and the director of the Open Data Institute.
Berners-Lee added: "I'm really optimistic about the future of the web".
Bernard Vann: Former Victorian Cross winner since World War I is commemorated
The former Archbishop of England, who won the Victoria Cross during World War I as a soldier, is commemorated in his hometown for 100 years.
Bernard Vann won the award on 29 September 1918 in the raids on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But, ironically, four days later, he was shot dead by a sniper's bullet, and he never realized he had won Britain's highest military honor.
A stone plaque for a memorial was unveiled by two of his sons in a park in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his nephews, Michael Vann, said it was a stone of "great symbolism" that had been unveiled only 100 years since his diary received the award.
According to the Gazette, on 29 September 1918, General von der Leyen led his small army through the St. Quentin trench, walking through the rough swords and muskets coming from the field of battle.
He then rushed to the firing line, and with the greatest bravery, he led the front line forward with his guns and defeated the other three.
Sergeant Van was shot by German machine guns on October 4, 1918, more than a month before the end of World War I.
Michael L. Vaughan, 72, said his father's behavior - he was a chef - was not only bad, it was self-deprecating.
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid a wreath after the chorus, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band, ended.
Michael Lang Van went on to say that he felt very proud to be part of the squad, adding that "the bravery of a true hero is being demonstrated with the support of the crowd".
MMA fans are left in the dark to watch the brutal Bellator 206 fight, but it's like watching Peppa Pig.
Imagine you didn't sleep through the night to watch Bellator 206 but in the end they didn't let you watch the Halloween event.
The San Jose Mail featured 13 fights, including six on cardboard, and was also broadcast live at night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6am, as Haggard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the match, UK viewers were surprised to see the children's cartoon Peppa Pig instead.
Some were shocked after they slept until the morning to watch the match.
One Twitter fan described the cartoon-like post as "the most hurtful comedy ever".
Dave Schwartz, Bellator's vice president of marketing and communications, said: "It's a government order that at 6am, the content is inappropriate, so they have to switch to kids' shows".
I'm going to put Peppa Pig on it.
Bellator chairman Scott Coker said they would work on their timetable so that UK audiences could watch the future show together.
Coker said, "I think when I think about reinvention, I think we might be able to do it".
But it's 6:00 a.m. on a Sunday, and we can't do this work until our Sunday hours and it's their Monday hours.
But we're working on it.
Trust me, when it switches the subject, the letters are running up and down, and it's not likely.
We tried to solve it, and we thought it was a technical problem.
But it's not, it's a problem with the government.
I promise you, next time, it won't happen again.
We're going to give it five games, as usual, let alone six more, which we've done for our fans, but never before.
It shouldn't be happening.
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels he is "weaker" than sex
Olympic swimmer Tom Delhi says he feels inferior to everyone because of his sexuality, but it is this weakness that makes him successful.
The 24-year-old said he never knew this until he went to high school, that not everyone is like me.
Speaking on Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke of the freedom of gay men to give "hope" to others.
He also said that being a parent made him less worried about winning the Olympics.
The longtime host of the show is Kirsty Young, who took several months off to treat illness.
Appearing as the first guest on her show, Daley said he felt inferior to everyone else when he grew up because the way we love men and women is unacceptable to society.
He said, "To this day, feeling inferior and feeling that we are different is what has really motivated me to succeed".
He wanted to show that he was also a "one with them" so he didn't disappoint anyone when they found out about his gender identity.
The two-time Olympic gold medalist became a prominent LGBT campaigner and used his image at the Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries not to condemn homosexuality.
He said he brought it up because he was lucky enough to live with the consequences of being open about it, and he wanted to give others that hope.
The three-time world champion said falling in love with an American filmmaker, Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, "shocked me".
Last year, Delhi married an Oscar winner who was 20 years her senior, but he said age gaps were not an issue.
When you go through so many stories at such a young age, he went to his first Olympics at 14, and his father died of cancer three years later, and he said it was hard to find someone who was my age and had so many difficult experiences.
The couple became parents in June, giving birth to a son, Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daly said that "all of my vision" had changed.
He continued, "If you asked me last year, I would have said, 'How come I won the gold medal, I don't care?'
You know, there's something bigger and more important than an Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medalist now is Robbie.
His son shares the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after doctors diagnosed him with brain cancer.
Delhi said his father did not accept that he was going to die and the last thing his father asked was whether we had tickets to go to the London Olympics in 2012 or was it because he wanted to go and sit in the front row.
He said, "I dare not tell him that the dog can't be near me and sit in front of it".
He continued, "I was holding his hand and he stopped breathing and until he stopped breathing and he died, I finally realized he couldn't live as long as I thought he would".
The following year, Delhi participated in the 2012 Olympics and won the silver medal.
He continued, "I just realized this is what I've been dreaming about my whole life - to be baptized in front of a crowd at the Olympics, nothing makes me feel better".
At this point, it also helped promote his first musical choice - Proud by Heather Small - which talks about the process of trying hard to get into the Olympics and saying he still feels very bright.
BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs will be broadcast on Sunday at 11:15 UK time.
Mickelson, who was playing poorly, was moved from the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
Phil Mickelson of the United States will set a record on Sunday when he is called upon to turn the ball over in the 47th Ryder Cup, but he will have to change his game to make the stage end without a backlash.
Michaelson, who played in the double for the 12th time, was traded by manager Jim Furyk for the double-header (two in the morning) and the double-header (two in the evening) on Saturday.
Instead of playing as actively as he has for the U.S. in the past, the five-time major champion has split his time between his role as a defender and as an assistant coach, hoping to make up for what he did not do well.
The 48-year-old right-handed batsman and professional golfer has never played poorly in a match, even at Le Golf National course, but this time he has a hard time playing, he is always hitting the wrong ball.
And the home game didn't worry him much, but that's what Michael Jackson in the ninth round on Sunday will face with the reigning British Open champion, Francesco Molinari, who has partnered with Tommy Fleetwood and won all four of their matches this week.
If the American, who lost four points to start the 12-game losing streak, starts to play hot, Michaelson's game could be one of the most important.
Furyk expressed confidence in his players but did not say much.
Furik continued, "He understood his current position very well, he put his hand on my neck and put his hand on me and said he was ready for tomorrow".
He was very confident in himself.
He's a great player and he's contributed a lot to these teams over the years and this week.
But I didn't think he had to play those two games.
I've thought about it a lot, but this is what we need to do, in this way.
He always wanted to go out and play like everyone else.
Michaelson will break Nick Faldo's record for the most Ryder Cup runners on Sunday.
It may mark the end of the Ryder Cup goalkeeper's career, which did not match his own record.
Michaelson has 18 wins, 29 losses and 7 draws, but Fury said Michaelson's presence has brought many successes to the team.
He explained: "Michaelson is funny, he jokes, he plays funny words, he's a good guy in the group".
I think his brothers and sisters are having fun with him this week, which I'm happy to see.
He contributed a lot, not just for the game of golf.
The European Commission President Thomas Bjorn knows that great opportunities can be lost.
Thomas Bian, the European team leader, knows from experience that a remarkable lead into the Ryder Cup singles final can be a tough race.
The Danes made their first appearance at the 1997 tournament in Valderrama, where the team led by Seven Ballesteros took a five-point lead over the Americans, but they were defeated in the quarterfinals by a score of 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You have to remind yourself that we got a big lead in Valderrama, we got a big lead in Brooklyn, but we lost again, and in Valderrama, where we used to win, but that's it", said Beyoncé after watching the 2018 team win 5-3 both days, Friday and Saturday, to take a 10-6 lead at Le Golf National.
So if history shows me and us to that group, it's not over yet.
You will have to work hard for tomorrow.
Go in and play your best.
It's not over until you score on the scoreboard.
We have one goal, and that goal is to try and win this trophy, and that's what we have to focus on.
I've said so far, I'm focusing on the 12 players on our side, but we know exactly what's on the other side, that their team also has the strongest players in the world.
With the praise of his players who played so well on the pitch, Bian added: "I'm not ready to say anything yet".
Tomorrow is the big game.
Tomorrow is a character game that needs to be played differently.
It's really great to be able to be there with our teammates when we're at our best, but when we're out on our own, they're going to test our ability as goalkeepers to the limit.
That's the message that players need to understand: try to play your best tomorrow.
Now we leave our partner on the side and he has to play his best.
Unlike Beyoncé, Jim Furyk tries to get his players to play better individually (only) than they do in the league, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points in the fourth quarter.
Furyk himself was up and down the game in the final, being part of the winning team in Brooklyn but ultimately losing out to Europe's huge success in Medina.
He said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, who was the team manager in 1999, gathered his players to go to the final day: "I remember all the words".
We have 12 big games tomorrow, but we want to start winning fast, like we saw in Brooklyn at the Medina yesterday.
When such a spark is happening, it will put a lot of pressure on the game in the mid-round.
We also designed our fighters accordingly and we put them in the way we think is best and greatest for tomorrow's game.
Thomas was tasked with trying to hit back and face Rory McIlroy in the top game with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans in the semifinals.
Brian with his personal choice of playing, saying, "I played with this team in this order because I thought I could play it all.
The new German battleship has been delayed again.
A media outlet reported that the German Navy's newest warship should be commissioned in 2014 to replace the oldest warship from the Cold War era, but it will not be commissioned until next year due to systemic problems and cost overruns.
According to Die Zeit, citing a military spokesman, the commissioning of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the lead ship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg class, has been delayed until mid-2019.
The ship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but later shipping issues have hampered the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates, which the Navy ordered back in 2007, will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
It is believed that the ship will be equipped with a main battery of anti-aircraft guns and anti-ship missiles, as well as various stealth technologies such as radar, radio waves, and low-level noise.
Other features include long-term maintenance - the latest vessels can be deployed for up to two years at sea.
Die Zeit newspaper further reported that if the continuing delay means that the latest ship, which is said to allow Germany to build offshore power projects, will become obsolete when it is commissioned.
The ill-fated F-125 made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and handed it over to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has sent a ship to rebuilders after delivery.
The exact reason behind the ship's return is unknown, but German media have cited a number of serious bugs related to the software and hardware that render the ship useless if used to fulfill the combat mission.
The problem of weakness was so significant that the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class battleship was operating with a crew of about 120, almost half the size of the old Baden-class fleet.
The ship is also too heavy, which reduces its operational capability and the Navy's ability to modernize in the future.
It is believed that the Rhineland-Palatinate, a 7,000-tonne warship, is twice as heavy as the similar vessel used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to the hardware issues, the cost of the whole project - including the training of the engineers - is also becoming an issue.
It is said that the ship will cost 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion), up from the original cost of 2.2 billion euros.
The issue of the latest warship is particularly significant given recent warnings that the German fleet is in steady decline.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the chairman of the German parliament's defense committee, admitted that the navy was "really lacking in highly capable ships".
The official said the problem was widespread as older vessels were decommissioned but no replacement vessels had been found.
He lamented that the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class battleship could not join the fleet.
The National Trust has discovered the secret life of bats
A new study conducted at a castle in the Scottish Highlands aims to show how bats use the field to catch their food.
They hope the discovery will open new doors to the behavior of the birdcatcher and help pave the way for future conservation efforts.
A study by a team of scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will track common pipistrelles and soprano pipistrelles, as well as Daubenton and yellow-bellied mosquitoes, at Inverewe Park in the Western Ross.
Special cameras will be placed at key locations around the castle to monitor the bat's activity throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct telephone surveys using handheld sensors.
The expert sound analysis of all the recordings will confirm the frequency of the call out of the bats and what kind of animal is doing what.
A map and reports will be produced to create a detailed, scale-wide picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, Conservation Advisor at NTS, hopes the results will reveal which habitats are most important for bats and how each species uses the habitat.
This information will help to determine the benefits of conservation work such as grassland creation and the best ways to preserve forests for bats and bats-related species.
The number of moles in Scotland and across the UK has fallen dramatically over the past century.
They are under threat from construction and development that destabilize and impact habitat loss.
Wind turbines and blasting (high-voltage blasting in public places) can also cause hazards such as scraping, chemical contamination of certain building materials, and the first exposure to insects.
The truth is, bats are not blind.
But because of their habit of catching at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when they catch.
They use precision echolocation technology to identify the dangers and hazards of their flight paths.
The NTS, which is responsible for the preservation of over 270 historic buildings, 38 major parks and 76,000 hectares of landscaped grounds across the country, pays close attention to bats.
The organization has trained ten experts who are surveyors, inspecting the nesting sites and sometimes even rescuing the nesting ones.
The organisation also established Scotland's first bat-only reserve in Threave, Dumfries and Galloway, which houses up to ten species of Scottish bats.
Castle manager David Thompson says the castle area is the best terrain for the eagle.
He said, "Here in Threave Castle, we have a great area for bats.
We have many old castles, many trees, and even better gardens.
But there's so much more about bats that we don't know yet, so the work we need to do here and elsewhere will help us understand more about what a bat needs to survive.
He stressed the importance of inspecting bats before undertaking maintenance of old buildings, as accidentally damaging a single bat can kill up to 400 bats and their young, which could leave the entire bat homestead sterile.
The bees are protected, and it is illegal to disturb or destroy their rich habitat.
Elizabeth Ferrell, Scotland's chief executive of the Wildlife Conservation Trust, urged the public to come forward and support.
She said: "We need to learn more about our bees, we don't know how many of our bees are running away.
Ronaldo has dropped the sexual assault complaint and has his lawyer prepare a letter to the German newspaper
Cristiano Ronaldo has dismissed the allegations of sexual assault against him as "fake news", claiming that people want to make him famous.
His lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against Der Spiegel, which has released a statement of charges.
The Portuguese international for Juventus has been accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Der Spiegel reported on Friday that Ronaldo was alleged to have given $375,000 to her (Karl) to keep quiet about the incident.
Speaking in an Instagram Live video to his 142 million followers after the claim was reported, Ronaldo, 33, criticized the report as "untrue".
What is the answer?
What they said today was fake news. A five-time Ballon d'Or winner said this in a camera video.
They will seek to kill themselves in my name.
That's the norm.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but that's part of their job.
The player added, with a smile, "I am a lucky person".
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to file a lawsuit with the newspaper L'Oreal over allegations his lawyers have deemed "incorrect reporting of doubts about their privacy".
Lawyer Christian Schertz said Ronaldo would seek compensation for "moral damage in response to the most serious human rights violations, possibly one of the most serious human rights violations in recent years".
The alleged incident is said to have occurred in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting a woman at a club, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to Ronaldo's room, where he allegedly secretly raped her, according to documents filed in Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayurga claimed that Ronaldo had knelt down to apologize to her after the incident, telling her that he was 99% a good man, only 1% bad enough to do such a thing.
According to the documents, Ronaldo admitted that the two had had sex, but only with the consent of the parties.
Mayurga also claimed that she went to the police and took pictures of her injuries in the hospital but later agreed to settle the dispute out of court because she was afraid of retaliation and she was worried about public embarrassment.
The 34-year-old said she was now trying to recover as she was still in pain from what had happened.
Ronaldo joined Real Madrid after leaving Manchester United during the alleged trial and this summer moved to Italian club Juventus in a deal worth €100 million.
Brexit: UK will forever mourn the loss of its car maker
UK Business Secretary Greg Clark says Britain will forever regret losing its position as the world's leading car maker after Brexit.
He added that it was regrettable that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, the company would temporarily suspend production at its plant in Burnaston, near Derby.
He said, "We need a deal".
The Japanese automaker said the impact of the delay at the border in the absence of a package deal could cost a lot of work.
The Bernaston plant, which produces Toyota's Auris and Avensis, produced nearly 150,000 vehicles last year, of which 90 percent were exported to the European Union.
Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director in Burnaby, said: "My view is that if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, we will stop making cars in our factories".
Other UK carmakers have raised concerns about what will happen to their cross-border trade if they leave the EU without a deal, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini plant in Oxford within a month of Brexit.
The main concerns relate to what the carmakers say is the risk of a supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line operates on a "ticket-free" basis, importing vehicle parts every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and EU for the vehicles ordered.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, it could create border chaos, which industry insiders say could lead to delays and shortages of automotive parts.
The company has said that it will not be possible for Toyota to hold more than a day at its Derbyshire plant, and therefore its production will be halted immediately.
Clark said Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU was clearly designed to avoid such checks at the border.
He told BBC Radio 4 today that we want the best deal that will allow us to not only succeed now, but also to seize the opportunity.
"The evidence, not just from Toyota but from other automakers, is that we must be able to continue what is a successful supply chain".
Toyota said it would halt production for some time, but in the long run, the company warned that the additional costs would weaken the factory's competitiveness and eventually lead to job losses due to the high costs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years and is the union coordinator at the plant, said his members were increasingly worried: "In my experience when these jobs are gone, they won't come back".
A government spokesman said: "We have put forward a clear and credible plan for future relations with the EU".
The White House said Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again.
The White House said on Sunday that a meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be pushed back another week as the dispute over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh rages on.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, Trump aides' relations with Russia, and the president's obstruction of justice.
The question of whether Trump would remove the attorney general, which could affect the independence of the top lawyer, has been a back-and-forth debate in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed, by audio recording, a conversation with Trump and the possibility of removing the president under Article 25.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But on Monday, he went to the White House, where there was a report that he would be removed from office.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would decide not to remove Rosenstein, but the meeting was then postponed to avoid conflict with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh was accused of sexual misconduct by a woman, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both of whom had already testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh for a week, further delaying the election.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "The date for that has not been set yet, it could be this week, I think it could be a week or so, because there are other things going on at the Supreme Court.
But watch out, I always tell the media.
Some sources will dispute the claim that Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
The host, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders said the lack of press conference coverage was not due to dissatisfaction with some TV reporters who were asking too late, but she said: "I'm not going to deny the fact that they are really late".
She then said that direct contact between Mr. Trump and the media would definitely increase.
She said: "The president has answered more questions than any other president in the past. She said that without any proof and that we have kept the number of questions".
Sanders said that the press conference would continue, but if the press had the opportunity to ask the president of the United States a question in person, it would be better than talking to me.
We've been trying to do this a lot, and you've seen that we've done a lot of it over the last few weeks, and there's going to be a press conference next week where you can talk to the president of the United States.
Trump often accepts questions when leaving the White House or when attending an open meeting or a press conference with senior students, etc.
Press conferences with only one press are rare.
In New York this week, the president may have revealed the reason for his shocking and sometimes bizarre appearance in front of a large crowd of reporters.
The Secretary of State for Health has written to EU staff at NHS Scotland over fears of a test.
The Health Secretary wrote to EU staff working in Scotland's National Health Service (NHS) to express the country's gratitude and to wish them continued follow-up.
Jean Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, has sent a letter to the lawmakers, saying that in less than six months, the UK will leave the European Union.
The Scottish Government has already committed to a cost-compliant residence permit application for EU citizens working in its public service.
In her letter, Ms Fireman wrote: "In the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on the UK's departure continued towards a conclusion, as expected in the spring.
But the UK government is already ramping up its preparations for the no-deal scenario that it could encounter.
I know that you are all sorrowful and troubled.
That's why I want to reiterate how much I value the contributions of all staff members, regardless of their nationality.
Collaborators from across the EU and beyond have brought valuable experience and expertise that has strengthened and enhanced healthcare work and benefited patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is like home to you, and we want you to stay here.
American soccer player Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency amputation surgery after a head injury
The Tennessee News reporter Mike Organ reports that defender Christian Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury on Saturday in a 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores.
Tennessee coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred before halftime.
Reed said, "He came to the edge of the line and fell right there".
Several coaches and medical staffers put oxygen on the Abercrombie at the field line before putting him on a stretcher and bringing him back for further examination.
A Tennessee official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had already undergone surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there were no details on the type or extent of the injury yet, and Tennessee was trying to find out when the player was injured.
Aubrey Gannis, a sophomore, enters his first season with Tennessee after transferring from Illinois.
He had five catches on Saturday before leaving the game, leading to a season in which he also caught 18 catches.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher tax on the taxable income when they buy property in the UK
Overseas buyers will have to pay a higher service charge when they buy property in the UK, with additional payments for use to help the homeless under the new Tory scheme.
Such a policy would balance the success of Corbyn's efforts to attract younger voters.
The tax increase will be applied to those who have not paid tax in the UK.
The library expects it will raise up to £120 million a year to help the homeless.
Theresa May will announce today that overseas buyers are set to pay such a high tax when they buy property in the UK, spending extra money to help the homeless.
The move will be seen as an attempt to balance the success of Jeremy Corbyn's lobbying efforts to attract young voters by promising affordable housing, where the tax is targeted at those with higher incomes.
The tax increase will be made available to individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK, with additional money to encourage the government to fight against the problem of homelessness.
This surcharge is in addition to the current tax on the cost of the service, including the high rate tax set two years ago, the tax on second homes and homes purchased for rent, and for this type of tax it can be up to three percent.
The library expects the change to raise up to £120 million a year.
About 13 per cent of London's built property is bought by non-UK residents, which drives up prices and makes it difficult for first-time buyers to get in.
There are areas where many of the country's mineral resources, especially in the capital, have become "hot spots" due to the number of foreign buyers, many of whom spend almost all their time living abroad.
The new policy was created just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the cost of credit cards to help young people get their first home.
He accused major construction companies of inflating property prices by restricting land but not using it, and urged May to abandon the house mortgage to make it affordable to solve the UK housing problem.
Craig announced housing reforms that proposed including the management of rent and the termination of the eviction of innocent tenants from the apartment.
He also wants to give more power to the council to build more new settlements.
May said: "Last year I said I would resign as Prime Minister to live the British dream that the next generation should have a better life.
And that means tackling this fair housing market.
The UK has always been open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
But this is not true because it is too easy for non-UK residents as well as foreign-based companies to buy a UK home, while UK residents have a harder time buying a UK residence.
For many, their dream of owning their own home is too far away, and for them, finding a suitable sleeping place is a continuing reality.
Jack Ross: My biggest dream is to rule Scotland
Jack Ross, the chairman of Sunderland Football Club, said his "biggest ambition" was to manage Scotland at some point.
The 42-year-old Scottish manager is having the pleasure of helping the North-East, who are currently in third place in League One, to three points from the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after guiding St Mirren back to the Premier League last season.
I want to play for my country as a good player.
Ross told BBC Sportsound in Scotland: "I got a B cap, that's all there is to it".
But I dreamed of watching the Scottish team play at Hampden Stadium so many times with my father when I was young, and it always reminds me of that team.
That opportunity will come once I succeed in managing the club.
Sunderland managers before Roos include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former manager of Alloa Athletic said he was not afraid to follow the big, famous names he had been rejected by Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"My success at this point will be defined by 'Can I lead this club back to the Premier League?'
He said that due to the design and materials at the club, it will enter the Premier League without a doubt.
"It's not easy to get there, but I have to dare to imagine myself succeeding in leading the club there".
Roush has been in the management profession for three years, after a spell as assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months as a coaching staff member at Heart.
He then helped Alou back from relegation to the third tier and moved St Mirren from a weak team to champions the following season.
And Roush said he felt better than he did when he worked at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
He reminded of the responsibility of running Alo: "It may be the real break-up".
I'm really convinced that management is a more rewarding and fulfilling job for me than playing.
It turned out to be amazing because I was a good player, I was living a decent life, and I enjoyed being a decent player.
But getting in can be difficult.
There's a lot of work that you have to do every week.
I still have the same job, the stress and pressure of the job, but management feels like the right job for me.
I've always wanted to be in charge, and now I'm doing this job, and I feel like I've had the most fulfilling experience that I've loved, the most fulfilling experience that I've had in almost my entire life.
You can listen to the full interview on Sportsound on Sunday 30 September on Radio Scotland between 12pm and 13pm Scottish time.
The poll found that the ideal time to drink a pint is 5:30 p.m. on Saturday afternoon.
The spring heat wave boosted retail revenue in the UK, but it also put further pressure on the hotel chain.
Figures show that sales figures at bars and taverns rose by 2.7 percent in July, but revenue in restaurants fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, CGA's chief financial adviser, said: "The continued heat and longer-than-expected UK presence in the world cup means that July will follow a similar pattern to June, when wine shops rose 2.8% and restaurants fell sharply.
The 1.8% drop in restaurant sales in June was even more severe in July.
The number of bars and wine bars selling more wine and spirits than restaurants has also declined.
The wine-food stalls also sell less because of the intense sunlight, but in restaurants, they sell even more.
It's like people just want to go out and have a drink.
Across stores, bars and wine shops, wine sales rose 6.6 percent for the month, and food sales fell 3 percent.
Paul Newman, of the RSM's Research Group on Open Work and Reservations, said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of May.
Weather and the influence of social events or major sporting events are still the biggest factor when we talk about outdoor sales at home or in stores.
It is not surprising that the restaurant sector continues to struggle, even though a decline in sales of 4.8 percent year-on-year will cause a lot of pain, especially with the additional pressure on the continuing spending.
The unusually long spring season is becoming more difficult for grocery retailers, and only time can determine whether August-appropriate temperatures will improve their sales conditions.
Total sales growth at stores and restaurants, including newly opened stores, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a decline in new store openings.
A company tracking restaurant sales called Coffer Peach Tracker tracks sales in the UK's restaurant, bar and liquor industry, working on collecting and analyzing sales data from 47 executives with a combined turnover of over £9 billion, and it has been established as an industry standard.
One in five children has a secret social media account that they keep from their parents.
One survey showed that one in five children, aged just 11, had a secret social media account that they didn't let their parents or teachers know about.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed the growth of fake Insta sites.
The news has raised fears that pornographic content is being posted on these sites.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a master account to show to their parents.
One in five children, aged just 11, is creating a social media account that they keep secret from their elders.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed the rapid growth of fake Insta accounts, which are apps used to refer to the photo-sharing website Instagram.
The news has raised fears that pornographic content is being posted on these sites.
Twenty percent of students said they used a good, accurate Twitter account to introduce their parents, and they had another private account.
A mother accidentally accessed the social network of her 13-year-old daughter and posted a video of a teenager forcing another to rape me.
Research by the UK's Digital Awareness and the Independent Schools Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) found that 40 per cent of 11- to 18-year-olds had two accounts, and half of those children admitted to keeping their accounts private.
HMC President Mike Buchanan said: "It is both difficult and painful that so many teenagers have created online sharing platforms that their parents and teachers cannot know and see".
Eilidh Doyle will be a voice for the athletes on the Scottish Athletics board.
Elizabeth Dial was elected to the Board of Directors of Athletics Scotland as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the Board.
De Geault is Scotland's most successful track and field athlete, and the chairman Ian Beattie has described the appointment as a great opportunity for those who have learned the sport to benefit from her extensive international experience over the past decade.
"Eddie is held in high regard throughout Scotland, the UK and the global immigration community and we firmly believe that Immigration Scotland will benefit greatly from her inclusion on the Board", said Beatty.
She said: "I want to be a supportive voice for our athletes and I hope I can contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland".
The American, who won gold medals in the 200m and 400m at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics with a total of four Olympic gold medals and is now a BBC expert, has collapsed unable to walk after a severe stroke.
He tweeted: "A month ago today I had a stroke.
I was born with a limp.
The doctor said only time will tell how much I will recover.
This work is very hard, but it has helped me to recover, I have learned to walk again, and today I do the exercise of moving quickly!
Thank you for sending me encouraging messages!
The marketing of breast milk and the comparison of mothers to cows has created a lot of confusion online.
The company, which produces milk from a single cow, has caused a lot of controversy online by comparing nursing mothers to cows in an advertisement.
To unveil the world's first wearable device that pumps breast milk, Elvie Electronics has released a commercial video showing the convenience the new device provides to mothers who are breastfeeding.
Four mothers danced in a full-bodied cow barn, dancing to the tune of: "Hey, I breastfeed like them, but I don't have any pimples". And "Check it out, this is not a cow, this is me".
"Bring her out! Bring her out! Bring her out! Let me suck her from the womb!"
But the ad, posted on the company's Facebook page, has sparked controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of reviews, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it showed the "horror" of the dairy industry.
The idea of the cow is to sell the product.
One theory says that they are like us, so they get pregnant and give birth to milk, but their newborn babies are taken away just days before they are born.
The Elvie breastfeeding system is a one-time-only suit.
Another reasoned: "It is difficult to find a mother and child.
But why not use it to promote breastfeeding for mothers who breastfeed their babies?
Others argued: "I never thought of advertising like this".
Others supported the ad, with one woman saying she liked the song so much that it was "very funny".
I think that kind of advertising is a good idea.
I'll buy one too, and I'm gone if I'm breastfeeding the baby.
The infusion of milk makes me feel like a cow.
Advertising is a bit of a mess, but I can handle it.
This is a product that is being manufactured.
Another argued: "This is a humorous advertisement for mothers (mostly at work or in a bottle) to pump milk like a cow".
This advertisement is not to praise or evaluate the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, the women said they danced with a milkshake in their shirts.
The idea behind the campaign is based on the idea that women who breastfeed say that they feel like a cow.
But the Elvie Pump pump, which has no strings or spools, is simply placed in a woman's pocket, making it easier to move or carry and to get out while she's in labor.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother, said: "Elvie Pump is a new conversion product that will be a great start for farmers.
By linking the relationship between the breastfeeding woman and the milk-producing cow, we want everyone to understand breastfeeding and its challenges, and together we want to work on a demonstration in a way that we can understand and enjoy the convenience of the breastfeeding process.
This is not the first time that Elvie's milkshake has been featured on the front page.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on stage to show off her bikes to fashion designer Marta Jakubowski, wearing the cotton product while walking.
Hundreds of migrant children have moved to camps along the Texas border.
The number of immigrant children in detention has increased dramatically, although the monthly border crossing has not changed, in part because the policies and policies set by the Trump administration have made it difficult to find sponsors for these children.
Traditionally, most donors are undocumented immigrants, and they fear that they may have problems staying in the country if they dare to claim to have a child (who is also undocumented).
The issue escalated in June when federal authorities announced that sponsors and other adult members of their families must submit fingerprints, the data of which will be sent to immigration authorities for review.
Last week, Matthew Albence, the senior director of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied for undocumented immigrant benefits.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
About 80 percent of all individuals who are donors or family members of donors are living in the country illegally, and a large portion of those are convicted of criminal offenses.
"That's why we keep looking for these people", said Elbent.
According to the staff who provided the shelter, in order to speed up the process of helping these children, officials set a new rule that requires some of them to appear in court within a month of detention rather than after 60 days, which was the norm.
Many people will appear via videoconference rather than in person to challenge their legal rights to immigration judges.
Those deemed ineligible for residence will be deported abroad.
According to counseling staff and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months, if children are in detention for longer periods of time, they are more likely to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or escape.
Some public activists say the concerns are heightened in larger places, such as in Tornillo, where there are signs that children are experiencing this, that the problem in these places is being ignored because it is so big.
They added that moving children to the city as a place of refuge without giving them enough time to prepare themselves emotionally or to say goodbye to their friends can cause psychological problems for the twin children, some of whom are already experiencing these problems.
Syria has told US, French and Turkish occupation forces to withdraw immediately
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called for Syrian refugees to return home, despite the country's eight-year war crisis.
Muammar al-Alim, who is also the Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces that are illegally on Syrian soil under the pretext that they are fighting terrorism, we will have to deal with them on the way.
He told the assembly that they must withdraw immediately and without any conditions.
Mourad Ali claimed that the "war on terror" in Syria is almost over, with more than 360,000 people killed since 2011, with millions more displaced from their homes.
He said Damascus will continue this holy war until we drive all Syrian terrorists, terrorists and illegal foreign presence from Syrian territory.
The United States has 2,000 troops in Syria, primarily training and advising Syrian Kurdish and Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 infantry in the war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said the conditions were good for them to return and he condemned "some Western countries" for "extensifying unjustified fear" that has pushed refugees away.
"We have appealed to the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns", he said.
They are making politics of what should be a common human problem".
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
A U.S. diplomat speaking in diplomatic language said a new agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in Idlib's last stronghold created an opportunity to advance political negotiations.
Russia-Turkey deal averted a major offensive by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, where 3 million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement has a "clear timeline" and expressed hope that military action will focus on jihadists, including fighters from al-Qaeda affiliated Nusra Front, who will be eliminated.
Staffan de Mistura, the U.S. ambassador, is hoping to organize the first meeting of a new committee composed of members of the government and opposition parties to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the commission, saying the commission's work should be restricted to review the provisions of the current constitution, and warned against any interference.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Term
By this measure, many liberal followers may be hopeful that Trump will win re-election in 2020 unless the impeachment and scandal ends his presidency ahead of schedule.
In what is not called "the greatest final episode for the presidency!"
So far, there is no indication of your obsession with the tracker.
Since 2014, the best weekly viewing rate has doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly equivalent to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News had 2.4 million prime-time viewers and up to 1.7 million in four years, according to Nielsen and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show", ratings from the highest television viewership were as high as 3.5 million on prime-time news nights.
ABC's "Survivors Appearing" episode of the cabinet figure who became president after the attack on the Capitol, Neal Baer said: "This is a terror that people are interested in because it's not what we understand".
Nell Scovell, the veteran comedy writer and screenwriter "only part comedy: and a bit of a tricky truth about getting into the Hollywood "club" has another property.
She recalls a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her she would vote for Trump.
Why? She asked.
"He said, 'Because he makes me laugh,'" Mrs. Scovell told me.
The ability to play in the dark.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the storyline out of Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can come together and the health of the global economy.
The decor is the only elegance that the most exclusive viewer can afford.
And it's still not a newsworthy citizen when you find yourself at 6 o'clock watching a panel of experts debate Bob Woodward's use of "biographical fiction" around the source for his book titled "The Fear" by Paul Manafort. The Washington Post said Paul Manafort's black leather suit, which cost $15,000 ("Clothes Rough with Rage") and was related to Stormy Daniels' description of Trump's, um, religious criticism.
I'm not going to look at Super Mario the same way again for one person.
Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", said "part of what he's doing is making it feel like a reality show, that he's feeding you every night", possibly Trump's show, changing the broadcast landscape and the daily clandestine planning (fighting with the N.F.L. that praised Kim Jong-un).
You can't miss a mark or you're left behind.
When I went to see Fleiss this week, it was 80 degrees daylight outside his house on the north shore of Kauai, but he was hiding inside watching MSNBC while filming CNN.
He can't go hungry, not with Brett Kavanaugh facing a Senate committee and the future of the Supreme Court sitting in the balance.
Fleiss told me, "I remember when we did all the crazy shows that day and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western egalitarianism.'"
I thought it was a short story, but it got them.

Besides the money, the flood problem is in the race for the Golden Quarterfinals.
It's no surprise that Pennsylvania's 17th congressional candidate is seeing a flood of accountability for the reorganization of the two-seat constituency that is in power for one seat.
Recently, the district to be amended was again eliminated in the Pittsburgh district of Democrat Conor Lamb, who won a seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is running for another presidential candidate, Keith Rothfus, who currently represents Pennsylvania's 12th congressional district, which is heavily overlapping with the new 17th congressional district.
The map was made after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that older districts were constitutionally agreed in favor of the Republican Party.
The new 17th candidate race has affected a fierce campaign of censure between the Democratic Committees Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Commission on Censorship (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after winning a narrow victory in a close-call election in the March special election for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
That seat has been held by Republicans for more than a decade, with President Donald Trump winning by 20 points.
Political analysts gave the Democratic Party a thumbs up.
The United States has condemned El Salvador more than supporting China, and the confrontation has since been called off.
The diplomat noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing and there is little backlash from Washington.
Trump held a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela in Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until all of the partners fired Trump's staff.
State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month that State Department officials decided to recall US diplomats from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over the "recent decision not to recognize Taiwan".
However, the sanctions were considered unfair against El Salvador, which received about US$140 million in aid in 2017, including drug control, development and economic support.
Proposed sanctions, including cutting financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, could hurt Central American countries and high unemployment and murder rates.
As the internal meeting evolved, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to follow up on similar gatherings last year that were seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from traveling to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to move forward, finalizing considerations on sanctions against El Salvador effectively.
The diplomat said Vice President Mike Pence was to deliver a speech at the conference, scheduled for mid-October, in a sign of the administration's involvement on the rally.
And three American missionaries have returned from El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new messages or new sanctions from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Bolton declined to comment on any details of the talks, which were described by the three US officials, including two other diplomats who agreed to discuss the talks on an anonymous basis.
Their story was confirmed by an outside analyst close to the administration and spoke on condition of anonymity.
The Bible is a book of wisdom.
Waiting until the matter is resolved may be Robert Mueller's special advice on possible obstruction of justice by Trump, who now has significant evidence in public records.
Mueller is also reportedly directing his investigation into whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia in its attack on our election.
If Congress were to switch aid, Trump would face accountability in that body as he prepared to return to the electorate again, and perhaps eventually he would have a judge as his friend.
That and many more, I don't mean that Trump's failure is inevitable, nor is his equanimity in Europe.
There are many options being made by parties on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the long-running struggle.
In 1938, German officials were ready to stage a coup against Hitler if only the National Socialists resisted him and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed and missed an opportunity to avoid years of genocide.
The history course focuses on reflection points and the unresolved democratic movements forward are accelerated or slowed.
Now Americans are facing these ups and downs.
What if Trump fired Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who was in charge of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in the hot spot since the report reported that last year he had requested a presidential poll and speculated that he was unfit for his post.
Rosenstein says the Times story is not accurate.
"How do we respond if the F.B.I.'s request for a new investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite allegations of sexual assault and perjury?"
And more importantly, will we vote in the midterm for a Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we fail those tests, democracy will be in a long winter.
But I'm confident we won't fail because I learned from the lessons of Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the Nazis, who used to occupy my embassy.
She survived and emigrated to the United States 60 years later, and I said goodbye to Sabbath, who we used to be together.
It's my legacy. Can't I have a vision for our future?"

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers has a positive view on the clash with Rapid Vienna
Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a win over Austria after an impressive draw in Spain with Villarreal earlier this month will put them in a strong position to advance to the Europa League Group G qualifiers.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his debut in the season until a 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he is confident that Rangers can use this result as a great game.
The 31-year-old said: "It's a good point for us because Villarreal is a good team.
"We entered this competition believing we could get something and came away with a point.
We may have lost in the final, but overall, a draw is probably the right outcome.
They probably did better in tent one, and we came out in tent two, and were the best team.
As we enter Thursday, it is another big European night.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it was a tight game because they did well in their last game, but with the crowd behind us, we are sure we can push forward and get a positive result.
Last year was really tough, with all that happened to my injury and the move to the club itself, but there's a positive feeling factor to this place now.
The team is good, the boys are really enjoying it. The training is good.
Hopefully we can push on now, it's our last season and we're successful.
Women are sleeping around retirement, saving fear.
Although survey participants had a clear idea of how much care they wanted, very few spoke to their family members about it.
About half of people in the nationwide study said they were talking to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance nationwide, said, "People want family members to care for them, but they don't take steps to have that conversation".
This is the place to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot organize your family to provide care if you do not want to know your wishes clearly in advance.
Work with your counselor and your family to discuss where and how to receive care, as those options can be an important factor in determining the cost.
Bring your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you find ways to pay for those expenses.
Your financing options for long-term care may include a long-term health care insurance policy, a life insurance policy with a deductible to help cover these costs, or insurance with your own funds - as long as you have money.
Your legal documentation: Preventing access to legal battle.
Get a healthcare broker so you can identify the person you trust to oversee your healthcare and ensure that the person is professionally respectful of your wishes in case you can't be contacted.
Consider also your financial power of attorney.
You will choose a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and ensure that your pension will be paid if you are unable to pay.
Do not forget the little details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical problem and they are on their way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medications and allergies?
Explain the experience in detail in the written plan so you are ready.
"It's not just the financials that are not serious, but who is a doctor?" asked Martin.
What is the cure?
Who will take care of the dog?
There's a plan in place".
A man was shot multiple times with a sawed-off shotgun in Ilfracombe
A man was shot multiple times with a wind gun as he walked home one night.
The victim was in his 40s in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot dead in the chest, chest and arm.
Officials described the shooting, which occurred around 2:30 a.m., as "random activity".
The victim did not see his attacker.
His injuries were not life-threatening, and police were determined to torture the witness.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia
Officials said at least 384 people were killed by the earthquake and tsunami that hit Palu, Indonesia, on Friday, and the death toll is expected to rise.
As communications were cut off, rescue officials could not get any information from Donggala area, which is located in northern Palu, near the point of the 7.5 magnitude quake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala in Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow strait on the western coast of Sulawesi island, with a population of approximately 379,800 in 2017.
The city was just celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami wave hit.
Donggala is a controlled land mass that stretches along more than 300 kilometres of coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi.
The land under this control is a sub-provincial administrative region with a population of about 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the economic drivers of Central Sulawesi, especially the Donggala coastal region.
Nickel mining is also important in this province, but mostly concentrates at Morowali on the coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency, Palu and Donggala have been hit by several tsunami waves in the last 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami wave killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami wave also struck western Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is on the Pacific earthquake belt and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26 triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of the deaths being in Aceh province.
2005: A powerful earthquake struck the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people have died on Nias Island off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake struck the southern part of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami wave that slammed into the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck near Padang, the capital of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake strikes one of the Mentawai Islands in Sumatra, causing a tsunami wave of up to 10 meters, destroying several villages and killing about 300 people.
2016: A devastating earthquake hits the Pidie Jaya area in Aceh Province, causing devastation and panic as people are reminded of the devastation of the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
No tsunami wave has erupted at this time, but more than 100 people have died due to building collapses.
2018: A major earthquake hits the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and forced thousands of tourists to be temporarily confined.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on the charge.
According to a report released on Saturday by the Alaska State Police, Palin, 29, in Wasaga, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence and a warrant was issued for his arrest.
According to police reports, when the woman was an acquaintance, she tried to call the police to report the alleged crime and he took the phone from her.
Palin is being extradited ahead of Mat-Su's trial and is being held on a $500 bond, according to KTUU reports.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared himself "clearly not guilty" when asked for his defendant's answer, according to online reports.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanor counts, meaning he could face up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with a Class B misdemeanor, which carries a penalty of one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
It is not the first criminal charge filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father Todd Palin.
His mother Sarah Palin called the police to report the allegations of the attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault and obstructing the reporting of domestic violence and carrying a weapon while involved in the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of touching her face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans in 2016 after linking her son's violent behavior to PTSD caused by his service in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake tsunami: Hundreds of people killed
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude quake triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electricity and communications networks are damaged with the death toll expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck Central Sulawesi, located north of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
Many videos are circulating on social media with a timeline of immediate impact.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in Palu when a tsunami wave hit the beach.
Federal prosecutors are seeking a rare death sentence for suspected New York terrorists
Federal prosecutors are seeking a rare death sentence for Sayfullo Saipov, suspected in the New York terror attack that killed eight people, a rare sentence not carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, was accused of using a Home Depot rental car to carry out a bicycle rampage along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan that crashed pedestrians and cyclists on his route in October.
To justify the death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "deliberately" killed eight victims and inflicted "deliberately" serious bodily harm, according to the notice of intent to seek the death penalty filed in the Southern District of New York.
According to court documents, both convictions could lead to the death penalty.
Weeks after the attack, a federal court judge convicted Saipov on 22 counts, including eight counts of murder, in the crime of illegal trade, in turn used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and charges of violence and vehicle destruction.
Prosecutors said the attack required "extreme planning and care", describing how Saipov carried it out as "cruel, brutal and immoral".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury and damage to family and friendsDiego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", the note said of the nature of the offense.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the Southern District of New York passed the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of a drug dealer from a shop, but was sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
More recently, the death penalty was carried out in a New Zealand federal case in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple, and executed after they were convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, who is of Uzbek origin, showed a lack of moral character in the days and after the attack.
Police said he told investigators he felt good about what he did.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
Police said he also asked to display an ISIS flag in his hospital room.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 of the charges.
David Patton, the Federal Public Defender representing Saipov, said they were disappointed with the prosecutor's decision.
Patton stated, "We think that the decision to propose the death penalty rather than accepting a response to a charge of imprisonment without parole could prolong the pain of these events for all involved".
Saipov's defense had earlier asked the prosecutor not to seek the death penalty.
Conservative MP candidate says NIGEL FARAGE should be put in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage pledged to "gather the people's army" today during a protest at the Tory conference.
The former Ukrainian leader said politicians must feel the heat from those who stall on European integration because Theresa May's parliamentary candidate has suggested that he should take charge of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone told reporters in Birmingham that the UK would be out by now if Farage was the number one Brexit.
But many of the challenges she may face in reconciling her deeply divided party are highlighted by the Pro-Remains Tories, who are engaged in a separate anti-Brexit protest in the city.
The prime minister is struggling to keep her Brexit plan on track amid attacks from Brexiteers, Remainers and the EU.
The allies insisted she would push ahead with her attempt to negotiate a deal with the Brunswick despite a backlash from the public, forcing those stuck in European integration and workers to choose between the package and her chaos.
Bone told Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wanted to "identify Chequers".
He mentioned that Farage should be established as a network of friends and responsible for negotiations with Brussels.
He said, "If he takes the charge, we'll go out now".
Wellingborough MP candidate added: "I will stand up for Brexit but we need to get rid of Chequers".
On the creation of the opposition to the EU, he said: "We did not fight against the world war as a compromise.
We want to create our own laws in our own country.
Bone denied public opinion had changed since the 2016 election: "The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to continue is still untrue".
Conservative Brexiter Andrea Jenkyns was also in the lead, telling reporters: "I'm just saying: the Prime Minister listens to the people.
Chequers is not popular with the public, the opposition parties will not vote for it, it is not popular with our party and our activists, it really got in the way and got us to vote for the first time.
Please drop the checkers and start listening.'
In a message referring to May, she added: "The prime ministers keep their jobs as long as they keep their promises".
Farage told the rallying politicians that they must make the "feel warm" if they betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
He said, "Now this is a matter of mutual trust between us, the people and our political leadership".
They are trying to cheat Brexit and we are here today to tell them: We will not let you get away with it.
In a message to the eager crowd, he added: "I want to make our political class, which is committed to Brexit, feel warm.
We are rallying the people's army of this country to give us victory in Brexit and will not rest until we become an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.
Meanwhile, the rest of the crowd marched through Birmingham before opening a two-hour meeting in the city centre.
A group of activists covered banners with the words Tories Against Brexit after the group's appearance at the weekend.
A Labour colleague, Lord Adonis, ridiculed the Conservatives for the security problems they suffered with a party programme when the conference opened.
He added, "These are the people who are telling us that they can have IT systems in place and all the technology for Canada plus border-free, mutual confidence for border-free free trade in Ireland".
It's all fun.
He added that there is no such thing as a good Brexit".
Warren plans to focus on running for president
U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren has said she will consider running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future in a town hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November alongside GOP Representative Geoff Diehl, co-chairman of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She has become the centerpiece of expectations that she could take on Trump in 2020.
Saturday night's event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with settlers using a metropolitan school model since Trump took office.
One participant asked her if she planned to be president.
Warren responded that it was time for women to go to Washington to fix a broken government that already included a woman at the top.
Arrested in LSU's Sims shooting
Police in Baton Rouge, La., announced on Saturday that suspects had been arrested in the shooting death of LSU football player Wayde Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at the 11 a.m. ET news conference.
They released a video showing the shooting on Friday, asking for help to identify a man seen in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot dead near Southern University campus on Friday morning.
Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday on per 247sports, "Wayde Sims suffered a single gunshot wound to the head and eventually died".
Wayde stepped in to protect his friend and was shot dead by Simpson.
Simpson was charged and admitted to being at the scene with a weapon and admitted to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody at Baton Rouge Parish Police Headquarters.
A 6-foot-6 kid who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims played in 32 games with 10 starts last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton finished as world champion after the team ordered him to beat Sebastian Vettel
It became clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas was qualified enough to lead Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes' team command would be a big part of the race.
From Paul Bottas got a good start and almost beat Hamilton as they defended their place in the first two games and invited Vettel to hit on their team-mates.
Vettel entered the field first and left Hamilton to run into traffic in the crowd corner, which was what should have been decided.
Mercedes later ran a lap and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton drove forward after a race to some wheels that saw the Ferrari driver almost slamming left inside the wheel in a risky face-off after two turns to defend on the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the red row of the grid and was seventh by the end of the first race on his 21st lap.
He then took a large part of the race as he changed his bike to set the pace quickly and beat Kimi Raikkonen in the fourth round.
He eventually entered the 44th round but was unable to improve his pace in the remaining eight rounds while Raikkonen received a fourth round.
It was a tough day because Valtteri did a great job all weekend and was a good guy who told me.
Hamilton said the team did such a special job to have one or two.
That's the worst kind of language.
President Donald Trump mocked Sen. Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday for her insistence that she had not withheld a letter from Christine Blasey Ford in the Supreme Court sexual assault case against Brett Kavanaugh.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address the testimony given by Ford before a Senate committee, instead saying that what was happening in the Senate showed that people were "reckless and disrespectful and dishonest".
"One thing that can happen and one good thing that's been happening over the last few days in the Senate is when you see the anger, when you see people angry and mean it's bad and untrue", he said.
When you look at the release and the news and then they say, "Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do that.
What is the result?
Dianne Feinstein, did you make the news?
Remember her answer -- did you make the headlines? "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, my God.
I didn't make the news".
Oh, wait a minute.
If we leaked... No, we didn't leak", he added in the Senate interest.
Feinstein was sent a letter detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh by Ford in July, and it was leaked in early September, but Feinstein denied that the leak came from his office.
"I didn't hide the accusation of Dr. Ford, I didn't hide her story", Feinstein told the committee, The Hill reported.
"She asked me to keep it a secret, and I kept it a secret when she asked".
But her refusal is unlikely to sit well with the president, who said during a meeting on Saturday night: "I'll tell you what the worst idiom is.
Maybe she doesn't, but that's the worst language I've ever seen.
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court nominee accused of sexual assault by three women, the chief justice suggested that Democrats used slang to end the matter.
They have committed to seizing power by any means necessary.
Mediaite reported the Chief Justice's words that you see evil, chaos, they don't care who they hurt, they don't care who they have to compete with for power and control".
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored the second goal for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars worked hard to make up for Friday's Elite League defeat to the Belfast Giants with a 5-3 win over Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants scored two runs on the first two hits by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie led the home team before Dwyer traded the Giants.
Francois Bouchard scored a draw for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen scored two goals for their success.
It was the third Elite League defeat of the season for Adam Keefe's men, who followed it up by beating Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, with the Giants winning three games the previous season.
Dwyer scored the opening goal in the 3:35 minute from a Kendall McFaull assist, with David Rutherford helping Beauvillier take the lead four minutes later.
During a thrilling opener, Sullivan led the hosts back into the field at 13:10 minutes before Matt Marquardt became the equaliser for Cownie at 15:16.
Dwyer ensured the Giants led in the first inning as they scored his second on the final night of Game 1.
The hosts reconnected and Bouchard again kept them level with a goal scored in the 27:37 minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran teamed up to help Nielsen give Dundee their first ever lead in the final at the second round, and he secured victory for his team in his fifth semi-final.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, are at home to Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controllers died to save hundreds of people on board plane that escaped earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller has been hailed as a hero after he died helping a plane carrying hundreds of people land safely.
More than 800 people have died and many more are missing after a massive earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday with a tsunami.
Severe earthquakes continue to occur in the area and many people are trapped in the rubble in Palu.
But even as his colleagues were fleeing for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the massive control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport of Palu Airport.
He maintained his actions to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321 could fly safely.
He then jumped out of the traffic control tower when he thought it was falling.
He died in hospital.
Australian ABC News reported that Indonesian Airlines spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision could save hundreds of lives.
We arranged a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a large hospital in another city.
But unfortunately we lost him this morning before the royal expedition reached Palu.
He added, "Our hearts are heavy to hear this".
At the same time, authorities fear the death toll could reach into the thousands, with the country's disaster management agency saying access to the Donggala, Sigi and Boutong temples is limited.
Agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said: "The death toll is believed to be still rising as many bodies remain under the rubble while many people are unable to be contacted".
Waves that rose to six meters destroyed Palu, which was to have mass burials on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are carrying aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, 35, told Sky News: "Every minute, ambulances are bringing in a lot of bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
Small markets are being robbed everywhere".
Jan Gelfand, the head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is looking for help for the victims, but we don't know what they will find there".
This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the evacuation-related tasks".
Are you awake?" CNN reported.
Indonesia was struck earlier this year by an earthquake in Lombok, killing more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini says now a man has gone missing after plane crashes into saltwater lake near the coast
The airline that operated a flight that crashed into a saltwater lake near the Pacific coast in Micronesia now says one man is missing after saying 47 passengers and crew had safely evacuated.
Air Niugini said in a statement that on Saturday evening it could not count male passengers.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats rescued passengers and other crew after the plane sank while attempting to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials said Friday that seven people were taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers were in hospital on Saturday and all were in a critical condition.
What caused the crash and the sequence of events is still unclear.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said the aircraft landed in a saltwater lake near the coast in a short landing strip.
Some witnesses believe the plane overshot the landing strip.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane landed low.
Jaynes said, "That's a very good thing.
Jaynes said he and others walked through deep water at the emergency exit of the sinking plane.
He said the flight attendant was frightened, twitched and screamed and that he had suffered a mild head injury.
The US Navy said navigators were working nearby to improve the ship's navigation at one location and they also rescued by using a wind boat to ferry people ashore before the plane sank in 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network showed that 111 people died in accidents by PNG-registered airlines over the past two decades, but not related to Air Niugini.
The analysts calculated the time of the women being burned alive at night.
Prosecutors concluded their trial on Saturday of a man accused of burning a single Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
US Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as one of the expert witnesses in the intelligence analysis section.
He told the jury how he used a cellphone recorder to break down along with the movements of 29-year-old Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of his death.
The Clarion Ledger reported that Rowlett said he had received location data from several cell phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers on the evening of her death, contrary to his previous claims.
When the data showed his cell phone was with Chambers, he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford when police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford made the statement on Saturday and testified that he was not in town that day.
When asked by prosecutors whether Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's van that night, Sanford said he was "lying because my van was in Nashville".
Another irony is that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when he died.
Phone records show that the two had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that shortly after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' messages, phone calls, and contact information from his phone.
Hale said, "He's forgotten her out of his life.
The defense is scheduled to begin its summary hearing on Sunday.
The judge also said he expected the jury to be sent to court that day.
The hybrids: What is the mind-centered hybrids?
The hip-hop trio challenges gender stereotypes by filling their songs with a variety of positive vibes.
Hybrids from the Bristol area claim that hip hop music has moved away from the roots of politics and solving social problems.
They want to go back to their roots and make hip-hop music that focuses on the mind popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have seen a resurgence in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
New Zealand midwife sues a couple for dismissal after receiving a "nationalist" message
A New Zealand midwife is suing a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a misguided letter from a mother who complained that she was "another black person".
The couple denied that they were not racist, as was their insistence on "racism".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed excitement when she discovered that new child care provider Giselle Maurice was black on her first day of work in 2016.
Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a message, "No, another black man".
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Maurice twice.
According to The New York Times, after learning of her "uncomfortable" behavior, Plasco-Flaxman fired Maurice, claiming that their overweight African-American nanny had done a poor job and that she expected a Filipino to replace her.
Maurice was paid for a day's work and then sent her home on Uber.
Now Maurice has sued the couple to avenge their dismissal and is seeking compensation with a lump sum of $350 a day for six months for the work she was originally hired to do even without a contract.
She told the press on Friday: "I want to show them, look, you don't do that", he added, "I know it's discriminatory".
The couple attacked the allegations that they were racist, saying that terminating Maurice's job was reasonable to do so, fearing they would not trust her after upsetting her.
"My wife texted her that she didn't want to say that.
She is not racist.
We are not racists, her husband Joel Plasco told reporters.
"But would you put your child in the hands of someone you were forced to abandon, even though it was wrong?
What is the best way to help your child?
I was like, "I'm going to go to the bathroom".
Possibly in response to the "death penalty", Plasco said his wife had just given birth to a two-month-old baby and he had a baby and was in a "very difficult situation".
"Would you put up with someone like this?
It's not a good thing to do", the business finance adviser added.
As the story unfolded, the court representing the public was quick to condemn the couple on social media, criticizing them for their behavior and reasoning.
A new letter reveals that the publisher of Paddington fears readers are not telling stories about bees
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in someone's shoes by reading it for the first time before it's published.
It's pretty exciting now knowing what we know about Paddington's great success.
Saying her father had worked as a BBC photographer before being inspired to write a children's book by a young boy, the author would have been critical of his work, she added that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was "surprising" after his death last year.
As Paddington, whom she describes as "the most important member of our family", she added that her father was quietly proud of his recent achievements.
She said, "He's a quiet guy and he's not a cocky guy".
But with Paddington real to him, it seems like if you have a child who accomplishes something: you're proud of them even if it's not your doing.
I think he saw Paddington's success in that short way.
Although it was his invention and vision, he always paid tribute to Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to call.
Upon landing, her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where the medical team worked tirelessly to save her life.
Ednan-Laperouse said, "Nad was called regularly to say it was too bad she wasn't expected to do it".
"Then I got a call from Nad saying she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say hello to her.
And I did it.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The pharmacist gave her to keep her heart pumping upward, ending in residues and leaving her system.
She died a while ago and this is all off.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing that this was being revealed.
I couldn't whine or scream or cry because I was in a situation where my family and people were around me.
I have to take it all together".
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, who is now mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded a plane with other passengers, unaware of the suffering she was going through.
She said, "No one knows".
"I kept my head down and cried all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it was on the flight that I felt a sense of pity for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew he loved her".
The pain of the whole village with traditional cards to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who lost loved ones to suicide are working to prevent others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys put up a traditional sign on the Welsh Bridge with messages of encouragement and a phone number where people can call for help.
Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
She said, "I don't want any parents to feel the way I feel today.
Ms Davis, 45, of Lydney, said her son was a good cook with a romantic flair.
"Everyone knew him by his words.
They always say his smile lights up a room".
However, he quit the job before he died because he was in a very dark place.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, was the discoverer of his relatives after he took his own life.
"I'm still worried about the impact", Davis said.
Davis created the card "to let people know there's someone there, so you can go and you can talk to them, even if it's a friend".
Don't sit still - you have to talk".
Humphreys, friends with Davies for many years, lost her 15-year-old partner Mark shortly after his mother's death.
She said, "He didn't say he was feeling depressed or depressed or anything.
"Two days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
He was in the lowest look on Christmas Day when the kids opened their cards, he didn't look at them or anything".
She said his death was a big shock to them, but they had to work on managing those issues: "It's caused a rift through the family.
It divides us.
But we all have to keep fighting and fighting.

Brett Kavanaugh's future is put in jeopardy as the FBI begins its own investigation.
Flake said on Saturday, "I think if we can really get something like what he's asking for, a time-bound, sector-bound investigation, we might be able to bring a little bit of unity", and he expressed concern that the committee was "splitting apart" while being stifled by irreversible partisanship.
Why do Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their stagnation due to the timing.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away on November 6, and if the Republicans do poorly, they will be greatly weakened in their bid to get the man they want elected to the nation's highest court.
George W. Bush received a phone call to appeal to senators, convincing them to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Bush, and through him met his wife, Ashley, who was Bush's personal number.
What happened after the FBI released its report?
There will be an election in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It remains unclear whether Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate to allow Mike Pence to become vice president and to end the negotiations and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean defectors has fallen under Kim
A South Korean lawmaker said the number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong Un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug cited data from South Korea's Ministry of Unification, saying that last year there were 1,127 escapees compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said border control between North Korea and China and high price-fixing from human traffickers were key factors.
Phnom Penh did not make a public statement.
Most of the North Korean defectors were granted South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most fled through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily fortified Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China treats runaways as illegal immigrants rather than refugees, and often forcibly immigrants.
Relations between North and North Korea - still on the brink of war - have increased significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Tongan for talks focused on nuclear disarmament negotiations.
This comes after a historic meeting last June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un in Singapore, when they agreed on broad terms to work towards a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the US sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
Ri said in a speech to the US summit in New York that "without any trust in the United States, it will have no confidence in our national security, and in such a situation there is no way we can withdraw ourselves from the monopoly first".
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "neurotic" and tells him he's not qualified to serve on the Supreme Court.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "neurotic" and said he was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the remarks in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before a Senate committee on Thursday, "I can't help but think that if a woman ever did that, they would say, 'Neurotic.'"
Kavanaugh denies allegations of sexually abusing Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his speech, Kavanaugh had a heart-wrenching mood as he screamed and groaned while discussing his family and high school years.
He also denounced the Democratic Party's record-breaking committee, calling for a prosecution of the figure as a "crazy and enslaved political assassination" staged by a liberal group angry at Hillary Clinton, who lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony showed he could not serve on the Supreme Court because it showed his anti-Democratic bias.
"I think he's not qualified enough with those statements and with how he's been following Clinton and the Democratic Party", she said.
Pelosi made a controversial statement when asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if he were confirmed and if the Democrats won a majority in the House.
Pelosi said, "I'm going to say this, if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or to the FBI, he doesn't deserve to be not only on the Supreme Court, but on the court where he is right now".
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's decision to the Affordable Care Act, Roe v. Wade, which he considered a conservative court.
In his confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh evaded the question of whether he would challenge the Supreme Court's ruling.
Pelosi said, "It's not the time for angry, irresponsible people to go to court and expect us to say it's not great".
And women need to own it.
It was a moral critique, months and years of angry anger, and she couldn't take it out without tears.
Steinem told me 45 years later, "We cry when we're angry".
"I don't think that's weird, is it?"
She continued, "I was saved miraculously by a woman who was a real estate executive who said that she cried when she was angry, but invented a technique that when she was angry and started talking to someone, she said, 'You probably think I'm sad because I'm crying and look.
I was angry".
And then she just kept going.
And I think that's wonderful".
Tears are allowed as a place for anger in part because as a principle they are misunderstood.
One of my fondest memories from my first job as an office manager was seeing myself crying with unspoken anger, being squeezed in my eyeballs by an older woman who was the best manager I ever wanted, always a little scared -- who pushed me down the stairs.
She told me, "Don't let them see you cry.
They don't know how angry you are.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy because they understand you.
Then Democratic Congresswoman Patricia Schroeder of Colorado worked with Gary Hart in his presidential bid process.
In 1987, when Hart was caught in an affair of being unmarried on a boat, which was called a scam, and was suspended from running, Schroeder was deeply frustrated, thinking there was no reason why she should not pursue the idea of running for president herself.
30 years later, she came to me with a smile and said, "That wasn't a good decision.
"There are already seven candidates in this race and the last thing they need is one more candidate.
They called it "The White Dawn and the Seven Faithful Men".
Due to her slow campaign, she was behind the fundraising drive, and so she vowed she would not run until she earned $2 million.
It was a losing battle.
She found that some of her fans who gave $1,000 to the guys would only give her $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she wondered.
When she made the speech by announcing that she would not officially launch a campaign, she was actually trying to win over emotions - gratitude to those who supported her, frustration with a system that made it harder to get money and target voters rather than the delegation, and anger at the homosexuality she had hired.
Schroeder recalled how the press reacted to her: "You'd think I was desperate that I couldn't do anything".
"You'd think Kleenex was my business partner.
I remember thinking what stone they would put on the tomb?
"She Cried"?"
How the US-China trade war could be good for Beijing
The experts said the opening of the trade war between the US and China was causing disruption, and while the fighting was not yet over, the rivalry between the two countries could benefit Beijing in the long run.
US President Donald Trump first sounded the alarm earlier this year with a major Chinese export tariff on solar panels, iron and aluminum.
The most significant price hikes have occurred this week with new tariffs affecting $200 billion (£150 billion) of goods, effective on taxing half of all goods imported into the U.S. territory from China.
Beijing has been retaliating all the time, most recently imposing five to 10 percent tariffs on $60 billion of U.S. goods.
China has vowed to retaliate against the United States, and the world's second-largest economic power will not forget it anytime soon.
Getting Washington to backtrack means yielding to demands, but publicly kneeling to the United States would greatly embarrass Xi Jinping, the Chinese president.
But experts say that if Beijing can play its cards right, US trade war pressure could help China in the long run by reducing the two countries' dependence.
Abigail Grace, a researcher focusing on Asia at the Center for a New American Security, the Think Tank, said: "It is true that the rapid political decisions of Washington or Beijing could create conditions that could initiate economic sanctions in both countries that are more dangerous than the observers have previously recognized".
Foreign Minister says Syria "ready for refugees to return"
Syria has said it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is appealing for help to rebuild the country after seven years of war.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the situation in the country was improving.
He said, "Today the situation in the country is stable and secure due to the progress in the fight against terrorism".
The government continues to work to restore the areas damaged by terrorism.
All the circumstances now point to the voluntary return of refugees to the countries they left because of terrorism and to the exclusive economic crisis prevention measures that focus on their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United States estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still live in the country in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome help in rebuilding the destroyed country.
But he stressed that he would not accept any aid or conditional assistance from countries that support the insurgency.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup, defeating the United States in the final by 16.5 to 10.5 points at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has currently lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup on European soil since 1993.
Europe regained the crown as Denmark's Thomas Bjorn reached the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
Phil Mickelson, the American national player, struggled in the match, scoring three in the 16th and leading the bowlers to victory over Francesco Molinari.
Italian goalkeeper Molinari has done well in all his rounds, becoming the first of four players to ever go 5-0-0 after the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
Canadian American Spieth was knocked out 5 and 4 by the lowest ranked player on the European team Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
World No. 1 Dustin Johnson lost 2 to 1 and England's Ian Poulter could play in the Ryder Cup in his final.
Spain's Sergio Garcia became an eight-time Ryder Cup champion and became the European champion with an unprecedented 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It was a tough year.
So thank you, Thomas, for choosing me and believing in me.
I am very, very happy to get the trophy back.
It's about the team and I'm happy to be able to help", said Garcia with a sense of excitement about the European victory.
He passed the bat to his compatriot John Ram, who won the Tiger Woods 2 & 1 title at the championship game on Sunday.
Rahm, 23, said, "The incredible pride I felt in wanting to beat Tiger Woods, I grew up dreaming just watching this guy".
Woods lost his four matches in France and now has a Ryder Cup record of 13-21-3.
Oddly enough, one of the greatest players ever to win 14 major championships in such a short time is Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA struggled heavily over the weekend to find an exit, with the exception of players Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played goal throughout the tournament.
Jim Furyk, the captain of Team USA, said after a display of disappointment for his team: "I'm proud of these players, they fought.
There was a time this morning when we were putting the heat on the European continent.
We gave up.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He's a great team leader.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We'll put it back together, I'll work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee, and we'll move forward.
I love these 12 men, and I'm proud to be their president.
You should raise your hands.
We played better.
Water leaf elephant or red elephant update: Rally has dropped in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows a steady decline in the concentration of water lions in certain areas of the Tampa Bay watershed.
According to FWC, outbreaks have been reported in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties - indicating decreased concentrations.
The water lily's body bloom extends about 130 miles from the northern Pinellas coast to the southern part of Lee County.
The wreckage can be found about 10 miles from Hillsborough Sound, Connecticut, but in less area than last week.
Water leaf spores have also been observed in Pascagoula.
Moderate concentrations in or along the coast of Pinellas County were reported last week from low to high in the coast of Hillsborough County, high in Manatee County with high concentrations, or at the Sarasota coast with moderate concentrations in Charlotte County, backward to high concentrations in or along Lee County, and low concentrations in Collier County.
Continued respiratory inflammation was reported in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties.
No respiratory infections were reported in northern Florida last week.
