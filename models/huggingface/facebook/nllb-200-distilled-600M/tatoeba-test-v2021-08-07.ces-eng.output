According to Tatoeby's guidelines, members are advised to either add sentences in their native language or translate them from a language they understand into their native language. The reason is that it is much easier to put together natural-sounding sentences in their native language. When we write in a language other than their native, it is very easy to make sentences that sound strange. Please only translate a sentence if you know with certainty what it means.
