Politicians in Wales afraid of "looking like fools"
There was consternation among some members of the Welsh National Assembly over a proposal to change their title to MWPs (Members of the Welsh Parliament).
It has arisen as a result of plans to change the name of the Assembly to Welsh Parliament.
AMs from across the political spectrum are concerned that the name change could cause ridicule.
A Labour MP said his group was concerned because "it rhymes with Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means foolishness and pwp means shit.
A member of the Plaid Cymru party said the group as a whole was 'not satisfied' and had proposed alternatives.
A Welsh Conservative said his group was "open" to the name change, but noted that there is only a brief verbal jump from MWP to Muppet (fool).
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced in the same way as the letter u is pronounced in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting a bill to introduce the name changes, said: 'The final decision on the appointments that Members of Parliament will receive is, of course, up to the Members themselves.'
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the National Assembly for Wales the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation of the proposals, which was widely supported to call the Assembly a Welsh Parliament.
As regards the title of the AMs, the Commission preferred Welsh Parliament Members or WMPs, but the MWP option received the most support in a public consultation.
The AMs seem to be proposing alternative options, but the battle to reach agreement may prove difficult for the Assembly's President, Elin Jones, who is expected to draft a bill on the amendments within a few weeks.
The reform bill contains other changes to the way the Assembly works, including rules on disqualification of AMs and the composition of the committee system.
The AMs get the final vote on what they're going to be called when the bill is debated.
Macedonians hold vote on changing the country's name
Voters are voting on Sunday whether to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The vote is being held in an attempt to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour constitutes a claim to Greek territory and has long protested Macedonia's bid to join the EU and NATO.
The Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov is opposed to the vote and says he will abstain.
Supporters of the vote, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is merely a price to pay for membership of the EU and NATO.
The bells at St. Martin's go quiet while the churches in Harlem fight
"The older people I've spoken to said that in the old days there was a bar and a church on every corner", said Mr. Adams.
"Today, there is none of the parts".
He said it's understandable that the bars are disappearing.
"People are socializing in different ways these days", he said.
"Bars are no longer the neighborhood's living room, where people go on a daily basis".
Regarding churches, he is concerned that the money raised by selling assets is short-lived and that they "sooner or later are back where they started".
He adds that churches could be replaced by apartment complexes filled with the kind of people who don't help the neighborhood's recurring havens.
"The overwhelming majority of people who buy condominiums in these buildings are white", he says, "and it adds to the trend of these churches eventually closing down altogether because it is unlikely that most of the people who move into the condominiums will become members of the churches".
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis  Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin's a decade later.
The original Methodist congregation moved out in the 1930's.
A black congregation that had been active nearby took over the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation under the Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of shops on 125th Street, one of the primary shopping streets in Harlem, that would not hire or promote blacks.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but when Father Johnson's parishioners planned to restore the building, they commissioned the bell tower.
The Reverend David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the bells "the bells of the poor".
The expert who played the bell in June called it something else: "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first bell in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved into the larger bell tower at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin's couldn't find a replacement for him.
What has been unfolding at St. Martin's over the last few months has been a complicated tale of architects and contractors, some of them caught by church leaders, others by the diocese.
The parish council, the parish's governing body of leading lay people, wrote to the diocese in July expressing concerns that the diocese "would try to push the expenses forward" to the parish council, even though the parish council had not been involved in hiring the architects and contractors the diocese sent in.
Some of the parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark injures 13-year-old on lobster diving in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy Saturday while diving for lobsters in California on the first day of lobster season, officials said.
The attack happened just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about a half hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy scream for help and then with a group paddled over to him to help him out of the water.
Hammel says he thought it was just excitement about catching a lobster, but then he realized that the boy was screaming, "I got bit!
I got bit!"
"His whole collarbone was torn up", said Hammel, as he saw as he approached the boy.
"I called for everyone to come out of the water, 'There's a shark in the water!'" added Hammel.
The boy was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is in critical condition.
It's not clear what kind of shark attacked.
Wildlife conservationist Larry Giles said at a media briefing that a shark had been seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was not considered a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to his upper torso.
Officials closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for safety reasons and to conduct investigations.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to take over the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's is taking on the competition from Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with a line of beauty products with special assistants in the style of department stores.
As part of a major effort to capture the UK's beauty market, which is worth £2.8 billion and continues to grow as fashion and home products decline, the larger lines of beauty products are being tested in 11 stores around the country and will be launched in more stores next year if they prove successful.
The investment in beauty products is taking place as supermarkets look for new products for shelves that were previously used for television, microwave ovens and household products.
Sainsbury's says it's doubling its range of beauty products to 3,000, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw being introduced for the first time.
The existing L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees range also gets more space with branded areas in the style of those seen in stores like Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its boutique make-up range, so most of the products are suitable for vegans  something that is increasingly demanded by younger shoppers.
In addition, the perfume shop Fragrance Shop is testing in two Sainsbury's stores, the first opening in Croydon in south London last week and the second opening in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Online shopping and a trend towards buying small quantities of food daily from local retailers means that supermarkets need to do more to get people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, has said that stores will become like department stores as the supermarket chain competes with the discount chains Aldi and Lidl by introducing more non-food services and goods.
Sainsbury's has introduced Argos stores in hundreds of stores and has also introduced a number of Habitat stores since it bought both chains two years ago.
Previous attempts by the supermarket to update its beauty and pharmacy departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 00s, but the partnership ended in a dispute over how the profits from the supermarket pharmacies were to be distributed.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281-store pharmacy chain to Celesio, who owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125 three years ago.
According to the strategy, Lloyds will play a role in the plan by adding an additional range of luxury grocery brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: 'We have changed the look and feel of our beauty products to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be available to advise.
Our range of brands is designed to fit every need and the welcoming environment and convenient locations mean that we are now a compelling destination challenging the old way of shopping".
Peter Jones 'rabid' after Holly Willoughby pulls out of £11m deal
Dragons' Den star Peter Jones left "rabid" after TV presenter Holly Willoughby pulls out of an £11m deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their home furnishings and accessories brand Truly.
The company had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The This Morning host, 37, took to Instagram to announce she was leaving the project.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragons' Den star Peter Jones furious after she withdrew from their lucrative lifestyle brand at the last minute to focus on her own new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "angry" when the popular TV personality, during a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, said her new contracts worth up to £1.5m meant she no longer had enough time for their home and accessories brand Truly.
The company had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was tipped to double Willoughby's estimated fortune of GBP 11 million.
Willoughby, 37, took to Instagram to announce she was leaving Truly, while Jones flew out of the UK to one of her holiday homes.
A source said, "Truly was one of Holly's top priorities.
It was supposed to be a long-term project that she would be engaged in for the next few decades.
Her decision to withdraw surprised everyone involved.
No one would believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to the launch.
There's a warehouse full of goods at the Marlow headquarters, ready to go".
Experts estimate that the firing of the This Morning host, one of Britain's highest-earning stars, could cost the company millions due to large investments in products  ranging from pillows to candles to clothing and home products  and the potential for further delays in launch.
And it could also be the end of a long-standing friendship.
Mother of three Willoughby and landlord Dan Baldwin has had a close relationship with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby co-founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
The two couples are on vacation together, and Jones owns 40% of the shares in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby is set to become the brand ambassador for M&S and replaces Ant McPartlin as the host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We couldn't comment on his business practices".
"and then we fell in love"
He mocked the criticism he would receive from the news media for making a comment that "is not worthy of a president" and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said in his parody of a news anchor.
"I gave up nothing".
He noted that Kim is interested in a more recent meeting, after Trump hailed their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step toward denuclearizing North Korea.
But the nuclear disarmament talks have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see an "adequate response" from the United States to North Korea's initial disarmament efforts.
He noted that the US was instead continuing sanctions aimed at keeping the pressure on.
Trump took a more optimistic view in his speech at the election rally.
"We're doing really well with North Korea", he said.
"There was a war march with North Korea.
Millions of people could have been killed.
Now we have a wonderful relationship".
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had produced positive results - the completion of missile tests, assistance in the release of hostages and the repatriation of the remains of US military personnel.
And he defended his unusual approach to Kim.
"It's so easy to be stately, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this crowded arena, we'd have about 200 people standing there", Trump said, pointing to the group in front of him.
Indonesian tsunami and earthquake devastate island and kill hundreds
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, NGOs were told, for example, that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population was homeless, no national disaster status was declared, which is a prerequisite for calling for international emergency aid.
"In many cases, it has unfortunately been clear that they are not asking for international assistance, so it is a bit challenging", said Sumbung.
While Save the Children is assembling a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet certain whether foreign staff can work in the field.
Mr Sutopo, spokesman for the National Disaster Preparedness Unit, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international organisations would be allowed to contribute to the relief effort.
Because of the earthquakes that Indonesia is constantly exposed to, the country is very ill prepared for natural disasters.
Tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, but they are not common on other coastlines.
A tsunami warning was issued in Palu, but there appears to be one missing tsunami warning, and that's likely to have affected the death toll.
Even in the best of conditions, traveling between Indonesia's many islands is challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that has been in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the new crash site.
President Joko Widodo made Indonesia's poor infrastructure a focal point of his election campaign, and he has spent a lot of money on roads and railroads.
But Mr Joko's administration has been plagued by a lack of funding in the run-up to next year's election.
Mr Joko is also under pressure from underlying sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of religion.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were displaced as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets with machetes, bows and arrows and other primitive weapons.
Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge is tied at the last minute against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat to Chelsea with a goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a delivery from Xherdan Shaqiri 30 yards from Chelsea's goal, while his team was 1-0 down.
He kicked the ball with his left foot before making a high shot at the farthest pole.
The ball flew high over the field towards the top right corner of the net.
The ball dropped over a bouncing Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
"It was just about getting in the position to get the ball, players like Shaq always try to get as far as possible, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming, and I made a single touch, and I didn't think much about it, and I just took the shot".
Chelsea led 1-0 at half-time after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The Chelsea striker delivered with his heel back to Mateo Kovacic before he set up speed in midfield and sprinted into Liverpool's midfield.
Kovacic made a quick one-two at midfield.
He then made a long delivery that brought Hazard into the field.
Hazard ran from the defence and finished against the farthest pole with a left-footed shot past Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at 3pm on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea are playing Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3pm on Thursday in London.
Death toll from tsunami in Indonesia rises to 832
The death toll from the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, the country's disaster preparedness ministry said early Sunday.
Many people were reported to be trapped in the rubble of buildings that collapsed after the 7.5 magnitude quake, which hit Friday, created waves as high as 20 feet, spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
The city of Palu, with a population of over 380,000, was covered by debris from collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after woman stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been launched after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
The 44-year-old was found stabbed at 7:55 a.m. at Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police are urging anyone in the area who saw or heard anything to come forward.
Assistant Commissioner Brian O'Hagan said: "We are in the early stages of the investigation, but I would urge anyone who has been in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead and seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I would also urge anyone, especially taxi drivers who may have recorded anything with a dashcam, to contact us as they may have information that could be crucial to the investigation".
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman whose body was found is from the Birkenhead area and that she was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who believe they know the woman arrived at the scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation continues, and police say they're in the process of informing the victim's family.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to get into his apartment, but police have told him that no one is allowed in the building.
He was paralyzed when he heard what had happened.
The residents are now being told that it will be several hours before they can re-enter.
A police officer was overheard telling a man that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
A weeping woman arrives.
She keeps saying, "It's so awful".
At 2:00 p.m., there were two police cars inside the barricade and another car just outside.
A number of officers were inside the barricade, monitoring the apartment complex.
Anyone with information please write a message directly to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 and log 247 on September 30.
The statue of Cromwell in Parliament will be the latest monument to be affected by the debate on "rewriting history".
The removal would be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious artifacts, carried out by his fanatical, puritanical followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as "madness" and an "attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate over the removal of statues that the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster would become a target.
The picture storm of the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell is being sacrificed to the actions of his grandfather Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's stunning depiction of Cromwell is a testament to 19th-century attitudes and part of the historiography of a figure that many still consider worthy of veneration.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of Parliament against outside pressure, in his case pressure from the monarchy.
Whether it is an accurate representation is the subject of ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid-17th century has shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is one recognizable figure who represents one side of the struggle.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of honor and remembrance".
Killer rat assault and kill Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by his surname "Yuan", was found dead with an agitated pulse and bloodstained near a pigsty in the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inject pigs with vaccines at a pig farm on May 30, 2005, in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He had reportedly traveled with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that a door to the pigsty next door was open.
He said there was a big deer in the pigsty with blood in its mouth.
A forensic investigation confirmed that the 250-kg pig had bitten the farmer to death, according to the report.
"My cousin's leg was bloody and bruised", said the cousin, who goes by the last name "Wu", in a quote from the Guiyang Evening News.
CCTV footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told the Evening News that the pig had been locked away to prevent it from attacking others while police gather evidence at the scene.
It is reported that Yuan's family and market authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
This is a rare occurrence, but there have been previous cases of pigs attacking humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man with serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig had pushed a Welsh farmer against his tractor, until his wife scared the animal away.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a "trigger".
"They're just playing.
They're very curious... they're not trying to hurt you.
You just have to treat them with respect", he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa are expected to bring heavy rainfall to much of the southwestern United States.
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the cooler waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
But Rosa will bring heavy rain with flooding to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States over the next few days.
Rosa had winds of 38 m/s, a Category 1 hurricane, at 10 am Sunday (Danish time) and was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low-pressure outflow is forming over the Pacific Ocean, moving eastward toward the U.S. West Coast, and as Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will begin to push tropical moisture northward into the southwestern United States.
Rosa will give up to 254 millimeters of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then the tropical moisture will interact with the approaching low-pressure outlet, creating heavy rainfall in the southwestern United States over the next few days.
Locally, 25 to 101 millimeters of rain will cause dangerous storm surges, floodwaters and possibly landslides in the desert.
The tropical moisture will produce rain of up to 51 to 76 mm per hour locally, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 51 to 101 millimeters of rain are expected in parts of the southwestern United States, especially over large parts of Arizona.
There is a high probability of storm surges with rapidly worsening conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rainfall.
It would be a very bad idea to move out into the desert on foot when there is a danger of tropical rain.
Heavy rain can turn rifts into rushing rivers and thunderstorms will create strong local winds and dustblasts.
The approaching low-pressure eruption will bring heavy rainfall along the coast of parts of Southern California.
There is a risk of total precipitation of more than 13 mm, which may result in smaller amounts of flowing precipitation and smooth roads.
This would be the region's first rainfall in their rainy season.
Widespread tropical storm surges will approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday and spread later Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the Four Corners area on Tuesday and continue on Wednesday.
In October, there may be large temperature fluctuations throughout the United States as the Arctic cools, but the tropics remain fairly warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
There's a good example of dramatic temperature differences across the central United States on Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of almost 11 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the remaining summer heat will try to build up and expand again.
Much of the central and eastern United States is expected to experience a warm start to October, with temperatures above 26 degrees Fahrenheit from the southern plains to parts of the northeastern regions.
It's expected to be up to 26 degrees in New York City on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates that there is a high probability of above-average temperatures in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched the Brett Kavanaugh hearing.
Over 20 million people watched the heart-pounding testimony Thursday from Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who has accused him of a sexual assault allegedly committed in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television stations.
Meanwhile, the political battle continued with stations interrupting regular programming to report on Friday's late-night developments: an agreement brokered by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake that allowed the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she's 100% sure that Kavanaugh, in a drunken state, groped her and tried to take her clothes off for a high school party.
Kavanaugh said in an emotional testimony that he's 100% sure that it didn't happen.
According to Nielsen, it's likely that 20.4 million people watched it on Friday.
The company reported average viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
There were no readily available viewership figures from other stations showing it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble measuring how many people watch programs in offices.
To put it in perspective, that's the viewing rate of an NFL playoff game or the Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose opinionated hosts have strongly backed Kavanaugh's appointment, topped all stations with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the day-long hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was caught on CNN and CBS cameras Friday morning as protesters shouted at him as he tried to take an elevator to the Judiciary Committee hearing.
He stood there staring downward for several minutes as he was scolded and CNN broadcast live.
"I'm standing right here in front of you", said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?"
He was told, "You have so much power, and so many women are powerless".
Flake said his office had issued a statement, and said before the elevator closed that he would have more to say at the committee hearing.
All the TV stations were live a few hours later, when the judging committee was to vote on whether Kavanaugh's nomination should go to a full Senate vote.
But Flake said he would only vote in favor of the bill on the belief that the FBI would investigate the charges against the nominee the following week, which the Democrats, who are in the minority in the Senate, had demanded.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a discussion with Coons and a number of senators afterwards, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice had an impact because it was clear that the Republicans would not have votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the Kavanaugh allegations.
UK Prime Minister accuses critics of 'playing politics' with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the EU of "playing politics" with Britain's future and undermining national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview alongside Theresa May's cover story, her former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson attacked her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying that a proposal for Britain and the EU to collect each other's tariffs was "completely ridiculous".
Police arrest Dyteon Simpson, suspected of being behind the death of LSU player
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and is in custody on suspicion of involuntary manslaughter, Baton Rouge police said.
Officials released video of Sims and Simpson's confrontation, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, CBS affiliate WAFB reported.
After questioning Simpson, police said he confessed to the shooting of Wayde.
His bail is set at $350,000, the lawyer reports.
The coroner of East Baton Rouge Parish issued a preliminary report Friday, stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound that went from head to neck.
The department says a task force from the Louisiana State Police, the state police laboratory, Southern University police and local citizens has assisted in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked local law enforcement for their "care and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-3 forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team is "broken" and "in shock" over Wade's death.
"That's the kind of thing you're always afraid of", Wade said.
Volcano spews ash over Mexico City
Ash spewed from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern neighborhoods of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity erupted in the crater and 183 gas and ash leaks were recorded in 24 hours.
The center monitored the disturbance and tremors over several rounds.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash on car windows in neighborhoods in Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noted increased activity in the volcano, which is located 45 miles [72 km] southeast of the capital, since an earthquake measuring 7.1 on the Richter scale shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with police officers as thousands participated in rival demonstrations marking the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarizing independence vote.
A group of masked separatists held back the police officers, throwing powdered paint and creating dark clouds of dust on streets that would normally be crowded with tourists.
There were also fights later in the day, with police using their batons to keep the fighting down.
For several hours, independence groups shouted "Nothing forgotten, nothing forgiven" and were met by unionist protesters shouting "Long live Spain".
14 people were treated for minor injuries sustained during the protests, local media reported.
The situation remains tense in the independence-minded region one year after the 1 October vote, which was declared illegal by Madrid but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
Voters overwhelmingly voted for independence, but turnout was low, and those opposed to secession largely boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop the vote during violent clashes at polling stations across the region.
Independence groups had camped out overnight on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration was held but was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer dared hope that Catalonia could achieve independence.
"Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy for the opportunity to vote, but now we are stuck", he said.
Despite a narrow but important victory in the regional elections in December last year, the Catalan independence parties have struggled to maintain momentum, and many of their best-known leaders have either been exiled themselves or are in detention awaiting trial for their role in the vote and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, recorded the protests on her phone in support of the police and said the conflict was created by politicians on both sides.
"There's going to be more and more tension", he said.
On Saturday Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been awaiting trial since last year, announced that he would run for the European Parliament elections next year.
'The nomination of a candidate in the European elections is the best way to move away from the setback in democratic values and the defeat we have seen from the Spanish government,' he said.
London: Men arrested after house hit by car
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 have been arrested after a car repeatedly crashed into a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at about 7:30 P.M. BST.
Police inspector Bob Blemmings said there was damage to the gates and the building itself.
There may also have been a crossbow fired at the car at some point.
Shot from Menga, Livingston wins 1-0 over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured the win
The upstart Livingston overtook Rangers, giving Steven Gerrard just his second defeat after 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's shot made the difference as Gary Holt's team moved up to the second-place finish with Hibernian.
Gerrard's side have not won a league title this season and will face the top team, Hearts, who are eight points behind, next Sunday.
In the meantime, Rangers are going to see Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, is building on their undefeated streak of six games, and head coach Holt has yet to record a loss since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses chances against cash outs
Holt's team should have been ahead long before they scored, and their direct style of play created big problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but delivered in the cross in front of goal, after which Alan Lithgow inevitably hit outside goal after he slipped in to hit Craig Halkett's crosshead in front of goal.
The home team was content to let the Rangers play in front of them because they knew they could give the team trouble in dead-ball situations.
And it was under those circumstances that the important goal came.
Rangers made a free-kick, and Livingston used an opening, while Declan Gallagher and Robinson worked together to make the score for Menga, who made a touchdown and scored from the middle of the field.
At the time, Rangers had dominated the ball possession, but struggled to get through the home defense, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was largely unchallenged.
That pattern continued in the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos forced a save from Kelly.
Scott Pittman's shot was blocked with his feet by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow shot outside the frame during another of Livingston's dead-ball situations.
There were continuous passes into Livingston's field, but were blocked, and two requests for penalties  after Halkett's tackling of substitute Glenn Middleton and one for hand on the ball  were rejected.
"Fremend" from the Livingston analysis
Alasdair Lamont of the BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal effort and a strong result for Livingston.
Everyone played brilliantly and exceeded expectations on their upward journey.
Their style of play and squad have been largely unchanged since their return to the top flight, but much of the credit goes to Holt for the way he's strengthened the team since he joined.
There were many heroes.
Captain Halkett was amazing and led a well-organized defense, and Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their toes throughout the game.
But the Rangers lacked inspiration.
They've been really good at times under Gerrard, but they played below the level.
Their finishes lacked sharpness  only once they got the home field  and it's a sudden wake-up call for Rangers, who are in the middle of the scoreboard.
Erdogan receives mixed reception in Cologne
There were smiles and blue skies on Saturday (September 29) when Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdoğan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve relations with the two NATO members.
There have been disagreements on such issues as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's approach to the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a new, large mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police, for security reasons, held off a crowd of 25,000 from gathering in front of the mosque, but a crowd of supporters showed up nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of Erdogan opponents, many of them Kurds, also took note and condemned both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to host in the country.
The competing protests reflect a controversial guest who is seen as a hero by some German Turks and mocked as an autocrat by others.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist killed in collision with car
A cyclist has died in a car crash in London.
The accident happened near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford in the southwest part of the city around 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped, and there were rescuers on the scene, but the man died on the spot.
The accident comes a few months after another cyclist died in a collision with a car whose driver fled the scene on Childers Street, about a mile from Saturday's accident.
Metropolitan Police said officers were working to identify the man and inform his family.
Roadblocks have been erected, bus routes have been rearranged, and motorists are being urged to stay out of the area.
Long Lartin Prison: six officers injured in riot
Six prison guards were injured during a riot at a maximum security prison, according to the Prison Office.
There was a riot at HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire at about 9.30am BST on Sunday and the riots are still ongoing.
Specialist Tornado officers have been brought in to handle the riots involving eight inmates and taking place in one wing of the prison.
The officers were treated for minor facial injuries at the scene.
A Prison Service spokesman said: "Specially trained prison staff are deployed to deal with the ongoing unrest at HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we are aware that those responsible will be reported to the police and may end up spending longer time behind bars".
HMP Long Lartin has over 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison warden was being treated in hospital after being attacked by an inmate.
And last October, prison officers were called to the prison to deal with serious riots in which employees were attacked with pool bullets.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with storm surge (dry areas may benefit)
It's rare for a tropical low pressure to hit Arizona, but it's most likely to happen early next week, when the remnants of Hurricane Rosa move across the desert landscape of the southwestern United States, creating a risk of storm surge.
The National Weather Service has already issued storm surge warnings for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a direct route over Phoenix on Tuesday with arrival late Monday in the rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix tweeted that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or low pressure status within 200 miles [300 km] of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border".
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict 51 to 102 millimeters of rain with isolated amounts up to 152 millimeters in Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
Other areas of the south-western desert landscape, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to gain 25 to 51 mm with a local possibility of 102 mm.
For those not at risk of storm flooding, Rosa's rain can be a blessing because the region is affected by drought.
Flooding is a very serious matter, but it is likely that some of the rain will be useful because the southwestern United States is currently experiencing drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, just over 40 percent of Arizona experiences the second-highest category of drought, the least extreme", reports weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa is expected to make landfall on the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa is still hurricane-force Sunday morning with maximum sustained winds of 38 mph and is 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and moving north at 19 mph.
The storm meets cooler waters in the Pacific Ocean and thus decreases in strength.
It is expected to hit Mexico with tropical winds Monday afternoon or evening.
The rainfall over parts of Mexico could be heavy, posing a high risk of flooding.
"A total of 76 to 152 mm of rainfall is expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with a potential of up to 254 mm", weather.com reported.
Rosa will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical low pressure, which will then move up through Arizona and into southern Utah late Tuesday evening.
"The primary threat from Rosa or its remnants is expected to be very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwest Sonora, and the southwestern desert region of the United States", reported the National Hurricane Center.
The rains are expected to create life-threatening storm surges and floodwaters in deserts and landslides in mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton attack: four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found wounded in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton around 4pm BST on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital where his condition is reported to be stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset Police said.
Police have urged anyone with cell phone footage of the incident to come forward.
Trump says Kavanaugh was under the Democratic Party's "evil and wrath"
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh has been subjected to "the evil, the anger" of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying allegations by Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing on his charges.
The president said Saturday that the "American people saw the skill, the quality and the courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
"A vote for confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote that confirms one of the most brilliant legal minds of our time, a lawyer with a remarkable record in public service", he told a group of supporters in West Virginia.
The president made an indirect reference to Kavanaugh's nomination while talking about the importance of Republicans showing up at the polls in the midterm elections.
"In five weeks, one of the most important choices of our lives will be made.
You cannot vote for me, but you are voting for me", he said.
"That's why I travel around and fight for great candidates".
Trump argued that the Democrats are on a mission to "dispute and block".
The first major procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior Republican official told CNN.
Hundreds killed by Indonesian earthquake and tsunami, death toll rising
At least 384 people were killed and many washed away by huge waves that hit the beach when a major earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday when waves as high as 20 feet [20 m] hit the coast at dusk, sucking many to death and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami was caused by an earthquake measuring 7.5 on the Richter scale.
"When the tsunami occurred yesterday, people were still doing activities on the beach, they didn't run immediately and they were victims", said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's disaster preparedness agency BNPB, at a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come alone, it dragged cars, logs, houses, it hit everything on land", Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had moved through the open ocean at 500 miles per hour (800 km/h) before hitting the coast.
He said that several managed to survive by climbing trees to escape the tsunami.
About 16,700 were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
The disaster relief agency has released aerial photographs showing many destroyed buildings and shops, twisted and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
Subduction continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The earthquake's tremors were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Board for Assessment and Use of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's massive earthquake was about 200 times more powerful than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The city is geographically located at the end of a long, narrow bay, and this may have made the tsunami bigger, the board said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of a number of victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 had been injured and 29 were reported missing.
Nugroho said the death toll and damage could be greater along the 300-kilometer coastline north of Palu, the Donggala area, which is closer to the epicenter of the quake.
Communications "became completely paralyzed without information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
"There are over 300,000 people living here", the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, but it could get a lot worse", they said.
The board was criticized on many fronts on Saturday for not reporting that a tsunami had hit Palu, but officials said the waves had arrived within the time the warning was issued.
Amateur footage shared on social media shows a man on the top floor of a building desperately shouting warnings of the approaching tsuamien to people on the street below.
Within minutes, a wall of water hits the shore, sweeping away buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to immediately confirm the authenticity of the recordings.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage that cut off communications around Palu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military has begun sending cargo planes with emergency aid from Jakarta and other cities, authorities say, but food and basic necessities are still desperately needed among the evacuees.
The city's airport has been reopened, but only for relief work, and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is expected to visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami is over 800.
This is really bad.
World Vision employees from Donggala have safely arrived in Palu city, where employees are seeking shelter under shelters set up in the yard by their account.
"They told me they saw many destroyed houses", he said.
This is really bad.
Even as aid organizations began the hard work of resuming relief work, there were complaints that foreign aid workers with extensive expertise were prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian law, financial aid, supplies and staff from abroad are only allowed to enter if the area where the accident occurred is declared a national disaster area.
It hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a disaster at the provincial level", said Aulia Arriani, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says, 'OK, this is a national disaster,' we can open up international assistance, but there's no status yet".
On the second night in Palu after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of the missing held fast to the hope that their loved ones would become the miracles that illuminate the bleak stories of natural disasters.
Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of a sewer.
On Saturday, rescuers released a woman who had been trapped under rubble for two days with her mother's body by her side.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian paragliding national team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others who were captured at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were among his students.
"As a veteran of paragliding, I have my own emotional burden", he said.
Mr. Gendon told how in the hours after news of the Roa Roa Hotel collapse circulated in paragliding circles, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the participants in Palu who were attending the beach festival.
His messages, however, resulted in only one gray fly instead of two blue ones.
"I think that means the messages weren't delivered", he says.
Thieves take $26,750 while filling an ATM in Newport on the Levee.
Thieves stole $26,750 Friday morning from a Brink's employee who was about to meet a cash machine in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from Newport police.
The driver of the car had emptied the ATM at the entertainment complex and was preparing to deliver more money, wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy in the press release.
While he was busy, another man "raced up behind the Brink's employee" and stole a purse that was supposed to be delivered.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, according to the press release, but police did not say how many were involved in the incident.
Anyone with information on the identity of the thieves, please contact Newport Police on 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West is changing his name to Ye.
He announced the change Saturday on Twitter, writing, "The creature formerly known as Kanye West".
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for a while and used the name as the title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande on the show, which was canceled for "emotional reasons", said the show's creator.
The name is an abbreviation of his current stage name, but West has previously said that the name has religious significance for him.
"I think 'ye' is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you,'" West said earlier this year, discussing the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, this is us.
It went from Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye which is a reflection of our good, bad and confused sides, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are".
He's one of a number of famous rappers who have changed their names.
Sean Combs has alternated between Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he reportedly prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
One of West's former partners, JAY-Z, has also switched between lowercase and uppercase letters and changed whether the hyphen is included.
Mexico's AMLO promises not to use military force against civilians
Mexico's newly elected president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador vowed Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he "would never use the military to oppress the Mexican people".
Troops opened fire on a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 at a time when leftist student movements were taking root in many parts of Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by providing monthly government grants to students and opening more free, open universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities draw young people into criminal gangs.
The US should double its funding for artificial intelligence
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount it spends on research in the field, says AI investor and user Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft, and Apple.
The comments come after various parts of the US government have made statements about artificial intelligence, but the US still lacks a formal strategy for artificial intelligence.
However, China introduced its plan last year and aims to take the lead in AI innovation by 2030.
"It would be a good idea to double the research budget for artificial intelligence, as all other countries are so far behind the United States, and we are looking for the next big breakthrough in AI", Lee said.
Doubling the budget could double the chances of the next big achievement in artificial intelligence being achieved in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee published the book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" this month at Houghton Mifflin Harcourt and is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most prominent artificial intelligence companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that beat the highest-ranked American Othello player, and later became head of Microsoft Research and director of Google's China division.
Lee acknowledged previous technology competitions sponsored by the U.S. government, such as the Robotics Challenge, hosted by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when a new competition would come up to identify the next visionaries.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get government grants, says Lee.
"It's not China that's taking the academic leaders, it's the big corporations", Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have hired star students from universities to work on artificial intelligence.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could also help the United States strengthen its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think that PhDs in artificial intelligence should automatically be offered work permits.
The Chinese State Council issued its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
China's National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people at academic institutions in a manner similar to the National Science Foundation and other government organizations' distribution of money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense established a joint center for artificial intelligence to involve partners from industry and research, and the White House announced the creation of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
The NSF is currently investing over $100 million a year in AI research.
However, US legislation seeking to establish a national security commission on artificial intelligence has been stalled for several months.
Macedonians hold vote on changing the country's name
The Macedonian people voted on Sunday whether to change their country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia", a move that would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that has blocked Macedonia's bid for EU and NATO membership.
Greece has a province called Macedonia and maintains that the name of its northern neighbour constitutes a claim to Greek territory and has therefore used its veto when Macedonia has sought membership in NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents believe the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's predominantly Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not take part in the vote and a boycott campaign has cast doubt on whether the voter turnout will reach the 50% required for the vote to be valid.
The question on the ballot was: 'Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with the agreement with Greece?'
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that it is a price worth paying to give Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia, access to associations like the EU and NATO.
"I came here today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the EU, because it means a safer life for all of us", said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
The vote is not legally binding, but I think that Members of Parliament have said that they will respect the result of the vote and will enforce it.
The name change would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state election commission said there were no reports of irregularities at 1 p.m.
But turnout was only 16 percent compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters cast ballots.
"I voted today because of my children.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko, participated in the vote in Macedonia on a change of the country's name that would open up for membership of NATO and the EU, in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small stage and pulled up chairs in front of tents set up by those who want to boycott the vote.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads held high, not through the back door", Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of the Euro-Asian integration.'
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership would provide much needed investment in Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20 percent.
"I think a large majority will vote for it because over 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO", Zaev said after casting his vote.
He said a "yes" vote would be a "secure for our future".
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research indicated that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the vote  less than the required turnout.
Another poll conducted by the Macedonian television channel Telma TV indicated that 57 percent of those polled planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
For the vote to be valid, the turnout must be at least 50 per cent plus one vote.
If the vote fails, it will be the first major political loss for the Provisional Government since it took office in May last year.
Watch Manchester City's Sergio Aguero struggling through the Brighton defence and scoring
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling defeated the Brighton defender in Manchester City's 2-0 win on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy with his goal, which came after 65 minutes.
The Argentine forward received a delivery in midfield at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran fast past three Brighton defenders before he swung out onto the open court.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green jerseys.
He struggled past one defender and then ran from several on the edge of Brighton's field.
He then made a left turn and found Sterling.
The English forward used his first touch of the field to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right boot to outmaneuver Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot into the right side of the net.
"Aguero is struggling with some problems with his feet", City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about him playing for about 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he scored a goal at that moment".
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the immediate advantage in the Premier League game.
That goal came after 29 minutes.
Aguero received the ball in that sequence deep inside Brighton's territory.
He sent a nice delivery down the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a few touches before he led Sterling to the furthest pole.
The Sky Blues forward punched the ball in the net just before it slipped past goal.
City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at 12.55pm on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
The joker wants to make fun of the Rockies
The Nationals have been eliminated from playoff contention, so they didn't have much to fight for.
But the ever-competitive Scherzer is hoping to take the pennant Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there's still a chance of a playoff appearance for the Rockies, who have played one game more than the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies at least held onto a wild-card spot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals Friday night, but still have their first division title in the works.
"Even though we have nothing to play for, we can go to the game knowing that the atmosphere would be at its highest among the crowd here in Denver, and that the opponents would play at the highest level I'm going to face this year.
Why shouldn't I be excited to play under those conditions?"
The Nationals haven't announced their starting lineup for Sunday, but they'll likely pitch Scherzer in a situation like this.
Scherzer, who would be the first man on the mound for the 34th time, trained his pitches Tuesday and would pitch on Sunday, which is usually his day off.
The Washington right-hander is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump holds a rally in West Virginia
The president was referring indirectly to the situation surrounding his election to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, as he spoke about the importance of Republicans showing up at the polls in the midterm elections.
"Everything we've done is at stake in November.
Five weeks away from one of the most important choices of our lifetimes.
It's one of the big, big ones. You can't vote for me, but you actually vote for me. That's why I travel around and I fight for great candidates", he said.
Trump continued, "You can see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, you can see, it's happening right now.
And they're determined to get their power back by any means available, and you can see how vicious, how disgusting they are.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control, but we're not going to give it to them".
The Democrats, he said, are on a mission to "fight and block".
"And you've seen it over the last four days", he said, calling the Democrats "vile and vicious and disgusting and lying".
He mentioned the top Democratic senator on the Senate Judiciary Committee, Dianne Feinstein, by name, which triggered a loud bow from the audience.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh, no, wait a minute. That was really bad body language. That was the worst body language I've ever seen".
Labour is no longer a spacious party.
They are intolerant of those who express their views
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, it wasn't really a surprise.
I am just the latest in a long line of Labour MPs who have been told that we are not welcome  just because we have expressed our opinion.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated similarly because she strongly disagreed with anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship measure was to criticize me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
In relation to the importance of responsible economic policy, in relation to national security, in Europe, ironically similar issues that Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders on.
The call for the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday said that 'we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive'.
For most of my eight years as a local Member of Parliament, Friday night meetings have been exactly like this.
Unfortunately, the tone of many meetings today is not that, and the promise of "friendlier, more lenient" policies is far from the past, if they ever get under way.
It has become increasingly clear that dissenting views are not tolerated in Labour and that all opinions are weighed against the party leadership's acceptance of them.
It started shortly after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues with whom I had previously thought I shared a political stance began to expect me to make a U-turn and take positions I would never have agreed with otherwise, whether it was on national security or the EU's single market.
When I say my opinion in public - and it really doesn't matter what I say - there is a long string of rude messages on social media calling for abstention and opposition to the centrist politics and telling me that I should not be a member of Labour.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments made against me are usually political.
I have great respect for the professionalism and the fighting spirit of those colleagues who are daily overwhelmed by sexism or racism, but who still continue to fight.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is where abuse has become the norm.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that Labour should create a culture of tolerance.
But in reality it is no longer a spatial organisation and with every vote of no confidence or change in the electoral rules the party is shrinking.
I've been getting a lot of advice over the last two years that if I put a lid on myself and not be so loud, I'm gonna "make it".
But that's not why I got into politics.
Since I joined Labour 32 years ago, when I was in school, I have been provoked by the negligence of the Thatcher government which had left our classrooms in a state of disrepair, and I have set myself to create better public services for those who need them most - whether as a councillor or a minister in the government.
I've never hidden my politics, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been in any way confused about my political positions and disagreements with the current leadership.
To those who tabled the resolution on Friday, I would say that when the country is headed for Brexit, which will hurt households, businesses and our public services, I do not see the need to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour leader.
But the one message I have is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to the local voters, whether they are Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no form of threat of disqualification or political eligibility will deter me from acting on what I believe is in your interest.
Chris Leslie is the Member of Parliament for Nottingham East
Ayr 38-17 Melrose, undefeated Ayr, top team
Two late goals may have made the final score draw a not entirely true picture, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved the win in this fantastically entertaining match of the day in Tennent's Premiership.
They're now at the top of the points table, the only undefeated team out of ten.
In the end, it was as much their superior defense as their better use of opportunity that carried the home team home, and coach Peter Murchie had every right to be pleased.
"Our battles have been tough so far, and we're still undefeated, so I have to be happy", he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "Respect Ayr, they took their chances better than we did".
Grant Anderson's goal in the 14th minute was followed by a successful kick from Frazier Climo and brought Ayr forward, but a yellow card to Scotland international Rory Hughes, who was dealt to the Warriors, gave Melrose an advantage, and Jason Baggot scored a goal which was not followed by a kick.
Climo extended Ayr's lead with a penalty kick just before halftime, and he scored and then got a solo score, so it was 17-5 to Ayr at halftime.
But Melrose got off to a good start in the second half, and Patrick Anderson's scoring, followed by a kick from Baggot, narrowed the gap to five.
There was a long break afterwards as Ruaridh Knott was seriously injured and was carried off the field on stretchers. When the game resumed, Ayr extended the lead with a score from Stafford McDowall and a follow-up kick from Climo.
Ayr manager Blair Macpherson was then given a yellow card, and again Melrose used their extra man with a score from Bruce Colvine without a follow-up kick after a period of intense pressure.
However, the home team came back and when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card for tackling Climo without the ball, MacPherson was able to score a line-out behind the advancing Ayr club.
Climo followed up with a kick inside the stumps and followed up with another almost immediately after the game resumed, after Kyle Rowe caught David Armstrong's box kick and sent winger Gregor Henry off for the fifth home run.
Still game star looking for a new career in the catering industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran appears to be making the leap into the restaurant business after it emerged he's taken the CEO job at a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series he writes and stars in with his collaborator Greg Hemphill.
The duo has announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the show's last, and it seems Kiernan is planning a life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the CEO of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, but a source suggested to the Scottish Sun that Kiernan would be part of Glasgow's "growing restaurant market".
'The sea is ours': Inland state Bolivia hopes court will reopen route to the Pacific
Sailors patrol around the naval headquarters, which is shrouded in the seams, in La Paz.
A navy blue flag is flown at public buildings.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon River are painted with the slogan: "The sea is ours, it is a right.
It's a duty to take it back".
All over the inland state of Bolivia, the memory of a stretch of coastline lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century is still strong, as is the yearning to sail the Pacific again.
Hopes may be at their highest for decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling from the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of voting.
"Bolivia has momentum, a sense of community and clarity, and of course it is waiting with a positive outlook", said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the International Court of Justice ruling on big screens throughout the country and hope that the Hague court will give Bolivia the assent that Chile  after decades of discussions  is obliged to negotiate the granting of sovereignty over an area with access to the sea to Bolivia.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic native president, who faces a controversial election campaign next year, also has a lot at stake in Monday's verdict.
"We are close to returning to the Pacific", he promised in late August.
But analysts say it is unlikely that the court will take Bolivia's side and that if it did, there would be no major changes.
The UN Assembly, which is based in the Netherlands, has no power to hand over Chilean territory and has stated that it cannot determine the outcome of any discussions.
That the International Court pronounces its verdict only six months after the final arguments were heard indicates that the case "was not complicated", said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And instead of advancing Bolivia's cause, the last four years may have been a setback.
"The issue of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian leadership", said Zárate.
Morales' belligerent rhetoric has wiped out the remaining goodwill of Chileans, she said.
Bolivia and Chile will continue discussions at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the Court's decision-making was abnormally rapid.
On Monday, Bolivia will have "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "end an era of 139 years of disagreement and to achieve mutual benefits", he said.
Mr Calzadilla also denied that Mr Morales, who remains one of Latin America's most popular presidents, was using the maritime problem as a political crutch.
"Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific", he added.
"The verdict is an opportunity to see that we have overcome the past".
North Korea says there will be no denuclearization unless they can trust the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never disarm its nuclear weapons unless they can first trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to honor promises made at a summit in Singapore between the rival leaders.
His comments followed the apparent resumption of nuclear diplomacy by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo over three months after his meeting in Singapore with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it is a "dream" that continued sanctions and U.S. opposition to a declaration ending the Korean War will ever bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is reluctant to declare until Pyongyang has first taken significant steps towards disarmament.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want another summit.
But there is widespread skepticism as to whether Pyongyang is serious about dismantling an arsenal that it most likely sees as the only thing that can guarantee its security.
Pompeo is planning a visit to Pyongyang next month in preparation for a new summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest collections of large headwear that you will soon be able to buy in local stores
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or block the sun completely, you'll find the answer here.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne lifted the veil on the catwalk for a collection of unusual headwear in extra-large sizes as part of their SS19 collection, which impressed at Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical hats have dominated Instagram this summer, and the two designers have been sending their eye-catching creations down the runway.
The most impressive work by Valentino was a lavish feather-like shadow that covered the heads of the models.
There were also other extra large accessories, including watermelons with jewels and even a pineapple  but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also unveiled a selection of bizarre masks just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had lips that were more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creature looked like a scuba diver's stuff with a snorkel and a mask, and others looked like a molten waffle.
And if you keep up the big fashion statements, you're in luck.
Scouts predict that the giant hats could be making their way to stores near you.
The giant hats arrive in the heels of "La Bomba", the straw hat with a 60 centimeter wide shadow that has been seen on everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The iconic brand behind the highly impractical hat spread on social media has sent a new large creation down the runway  a straw beach bag almost as big as the model displaying it.
The orange bag with a white leather handle and a pair of fringe-fiber straps was the most eye-catching piece in Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Famous fashion designer Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to see large hats and beach bags in mainstream stores next summer. The designer has had such an impact that it will be hard to ignore the demand for accessories in the giant size".
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Scotland's independent schools have a long history of outstanding academic achievement, and this continues in 2018 with yet another series of outstanding exam results, which are further enhanced by individual and collective success in sport, the arts, music and other local endeavours.
With up to 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best level of service to their pupils and parents.
Independent schools seek to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen career and their place as global citizens.
As an education sector that can compile and implement a tailored curriculum, we are seeing that modern languages remain a popular subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, it hits his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it will touch his heart".
It's an important reminder that we can't just stick to English when we want to build relationships and trust among people from other countries.
We can see from the latest exam results this year that languages are at the top of the statistics with the most passes in the independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages scored high A's.
Data collected by SCIS's 74 member schools showed that 72 per cent of pupils achieved A's in Mandarin, while 72 per cent of those studying German, 69 per cent of those studying French and 63 per cent of those studying Spanish also achieved A's.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are promoting foreign languages as important skills which children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Language is now seen as a subject choice on a par with STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent schools and elsewhere.
A 2014 study by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills found that among the reasons why employers could not fill vacancies, 17% were due to lack of language skills.
This is why language skills are becoming increasingly important in preparing young people for their future careers.
Language skills will be required for more job opportunities in the future, and these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Whatever career paths young people choose, if they have learned another language, they will have a great advantage in the future with a lifelong skill like this.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives a multilingual person an edge over competitors.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of over 4,000 people in the United Kingdom, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation, and French is the only language spoken by a multi-digit percentage, 15 percent.
That is why it is important to invest in language teaching for those who are children today.
Knowing more languages, especially those of developing countries, gives children a better chance of finding meaningful employment.
In Scotland, the languages of instruction vary between schools.
Some schools focus on the more classical modern languages, while others teach languages that are expected to be most important to the UK in the 2020s, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests, there will always be a range of languages to choose from at independent schools with teachers who are specialists in the field.
Scottish Independent Schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that prepares children and gives them the skills they need to succeed, whatever the future may hold.
At present, there is no denying that languages continue to be of real importance for the future of the country in a global business environment, and this must be reflected in the training.
Modern languages should be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, this diversity and this distinction to the youth of Scotland.
I'm not going to do it.
John Edward is the Chairman of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron is making his Lakers debut Sunday in San Diego.
The wait is almost over for fans who want to see LeBron James play his first game for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday's season opener against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it's not clear how many minutes he's playing.
"It's going to be more than 1 and less than 48", Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James will most likely not play the entire game.
After practice earlier in the week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six games before the season opens.
"At my current level of my career, I don't need to play before the start of the season to be ready", he said.
Trump's rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is opening a strip election rally tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's the first of five Trump campaign meetings scheduled for next week, including meetings in Trump-friendly places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the vote to confirm Trump's nominee for the vacant Supreme Court seat is on hold, Trump is trying to build support for the upcoming midterm elections because Republicans risk losing control of Congress when the vote is cast in November.
When is Trump's rally in West Virginia tonight, and how do you see it online?
The Trump campaign rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, will take place at midnight (UK time) between Saturday, November 29 and Sunday, November 30, 2018.
You can watch Trump's campaign in West Virginia online via YouTube live stream.
Trump will most likely speak about this week's hearings on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, which were tense over sexual misconduct allegations and the anticipated Senate confirmation vote has been put on hold for a week while the FBI investigates the allegations.
But the primary purpose of this strip election is to create momentum for the Republicans who face a difficult election in November.
People on President Trump's campaign said the five polls next week are meant to "energize volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and build their majority in the Senate and House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"Control of Congress is so important to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we enter the hectic campaign season", a Trump campaign spokesman, who declined to be named, told Reuters.
Tonight's rally is being held at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling and is expected to draw Trump supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and get media coverage from Pittsburgh", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state he won by over 40 points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia's Republican candidate for the Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who is lagging behind in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to step up to give him a boost in the polls", said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA has shown a fighting spirit and is trying to keep hope alive ahead of Sunday's singles match
After three one-sided rounds, Saturday's four-man duel was perhaps what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging momentum pendulum is a completely invented sporting concept, but a concept that players believe in, not least in competitions like this.
Where would they say there's momentum now?
"They led by six points, and now it's four, so we're probably looking at that as a bit of momentum", said Jordan Spieth, before holding the firing light.
Europe has the advantage, of course, they are four points ahead and there are 12 more points to play for.
As Spieth says, the Americans feel they have a little wind in their sails, and there are plenty of encouraging things to focus on, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both boast three points out of four possible.
Spieth has been sharp from tee to green and sets a good example for his teammates.
The loud cheers grew louder as the round continued, and Spieth hit a crucial putt that secured victory in duel four, even though he and Thomas had been two strokes behind after two duels.
His put, which secured them the match on hole 15, was met with a similar scream - the kind of scream that shows he doesn't think the U.S. team is out of the competition yet.
"You just have to find the strength within and focus on your own struggle", Spieth said.
That's all the players have left now.
18 holes where you can make a difference.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas over the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, arguably the biggest story in Ryder Cup history.
Europe's strange but sympathetic pair have scored four points in four matches and are flawless.
"Moliwood" was the only couple not to get a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the final nine holes on Friday morning.
The series and the way the energy seems to flow both to and from the wild crowd show that they are the ones who will be the hardest hit on Sunday, and it would undoubtedly be very popular if a potential European victory is sealed by Fleetwood or Molinari when the sun sets over Le Golf National.
All in sync on each of their holes.
It is too early to talk of a European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made a short trial against Sergio Garcia, morning full of four-man duels, when he paired with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two double bogeys on the first nine holes dug the Spaniard and the Swede into a hole they were never close to getting out of.
Sunday, there's no one to help you out of your hole.
The four-ball, two-team, two-player games are so fascinating to watch up close because of the interactions between the couples, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and the way strategy can change so quickly.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has built up a considerable lead before the final day, but the four-man duels have also shown that Team USA has the fighting spirit that some, especially in the United States, have doubted.
Europe leads 10-6 ahead of the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe has a big lead ahead of the final day of the Ryder Cup, having come out of Saturday's fourball and foursomes with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
The well-played duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the way with two wins over a struggling Tiger Woods and have so far scored four points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjørn's European team, trying to win the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an imprecise American team in tomorrow's fourball, winning the series 3-1.
The United States was more resistant in foursomes, winning four games but still trailing.
Jim Fury's team needs eight points in Sunday's 12 singles matches if they're going to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European debutant to win four points in a row, and he and Molinari, who have been nicknamed "Molliwood" together, after a sensational weekend, are only the second pair in Ryder Cup history to win four points in their first four matches.
They crushed Woods and Patrick Reed in fourballs and then elegantly defeated a dispirited Woods and American debutant Bryson Dechambeau with an even more impressive 5&4.
Woods, who struggled through the first two games Saturday, had a few glimmers of genius, but now he's lost 19 of his 29 games in fourballs and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose was well rested for the morning's fourballs and returned to partner Henrik Stenson in foursomes and took a 2-1 victory over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka  who is number three in the world.
Europe is exactly what they want it to be on a light windy day southwest of Paris.
Three-time major winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas led the way for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They won a hard-fought 2-1 victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourballs and later came back to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in foursomes, having lost the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has a team fought back from four points behind in the singles, but with the Furyks currently holding the trophy, they must only reach a draw to keep it.
After two days of second place, it looks like they can't handle a counter-attack on Sunday.
North Korea says it won't unilaterally disarm if there's no trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions strengthen their mistrust of the United States and that the country will not give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such conditions.
Ri Yong Ho told the Worldwide Organization General Assembly that North Korea had shown "significant goodwill" in the past year, such as by halting nuclear and missile tests, setting up a nuclear test site, and promising not to further develop nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"We have not seen a similar reaction from the United States", he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, there is no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances, there is no chance that we ourselves will take the first step in unilateral disarmament".
While Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's opposition to a "phased" approach to nuclear disarmament, where North Korea would be rewarded if it took gradual steps, his speech seemed important because it did not unequivocally reject unilateral disarmament as has been the case in the past from Pyongyang.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first-ever summit between a sitting US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, where Kim promised to work on "nuclear disarmament on the Korean Peninsula", while Trump promised to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea has demanded a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also shown resistance to softening up tougher international sanctions against North Korea.
"The US insists on 'nuclear disarmament first' and is increasing the pressure with sanctions to achieve its goals by force and even opposes the 'declaration of the end of war'", Ri said.
"The idea that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a dream among people who don't know who we are.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions are reinforcing our mistrust".
Ri did not mention plans for a summit between Kim and Trump anymore, as the US leader highlighted at the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months, adding: "If denuclearization were to be negotiated with South Korea and not the United States, the negotiations would not be so tight".
Nevertheless, the tone of Rice's speech was very different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that North Korea's missile launch on the US mainland was inevitable, after "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim a "rocket man" on a suicide mission.
Last year, Trump threatened at the UN with "total annihilation" of North Korea, but this year he praised Kim for showing courage in disarmament, but said there was still much to be done and that sanctions had to remain in place until North Korea disarmed.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no timetable for these actions, but said "It doesn't matter if it takes two years, three years or five months".
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: "The Security Council must maintain sanctions with conviction and without error until we achieve total, final, confirmed nuclear disarmament".
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously increased economic sanctions against North Korea in an attempt to halt Pyongyang's missile and nuclear weapons programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for another meeting.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times in the past year, but his last trip didn't go well.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying progress had been made, while just hours later North Korea accused him of making "gangster-like demands".
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to shut down a missile facility and a nuclear complex if the United States took "responsive steps".
He said Kim had told him that the "corresponding steps" he demanded were the security promises Trump made in Singapore and moves toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on getting enough sleep
A new course at Harvard University has given all undergraduate students more sleep, designed to counter the growing macho culture of studying all night long while being kept awake by large amounts of caffeine.
One researcher found that students at the world's best universities often do not know the first thing about taking care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He got the idea for the course after giving a talk about the effects of sleep deprivation on learning.
"When the interview was over, a girl came up to me and said, "Why don't I know this until I'm on the exam?"
"She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me", he told The Telegraph.
The course, which is being offered for the first time this year, explains to students how good sleep habits can improve academic and athletic performance as well as overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health department, says that the university decided to offer the course after discovering that the students were severely sleep-deprived during the week.
The hour-long course consists of various interactive exercises.
One of the exercises is a picture of a college classroom where students are asked to click on coffee cups, curtains, running shoes, and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, how lack of sleep affects athletic performance, and the importance of good sleep habits.
In another part of the course, participants learn how long-term sleep deprivation increases the risk of heart attack, blood clots, depression, and cancer.
Participants are encouraged to reflect on their daily habits by clicking on various icons on an interactive map of the campus.
"We know that this will not change the behavior of the students immediately.
But we think they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know how cigarettes affect your health", adds Professor Czeisler.
The pride of taking an all-nighter still exists, he says, adding that modern technology and increased pressure on students have made sleep deprivation a growing problem.
The "secret weapon" against stress, fatigue and anxiety is good and adequate sleep, he said. It even prevents weight gain, because lack of sleep makes the brain think you're hungry, which is why you're always hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian student of chemical and physical biology, helped to organize the course last year when Professor Czeisler took one of his courses in his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and made him work to make it a university-wide course.
He hopes that the next step will be for all graduates to be offered a similar course before continuing their education.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students set an alarm so that they know when to go to bed and when to get up. This can raise awareness of the harmful effects of light from electronic screens, which can alter the circadian rhythm and make it harder to fall asleep.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers, goal from Menga, downs Gerrard and co.
Rangers suffered another defeat on the road, as Dolly Menga's goal meant Steven Gerrard's inconsistent team had to settle for a 1-0 loss at Livingston.
The Ibrox side were looking for their first win on home soil since a 4-1 win at St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team gave Gerrard just the second defeat in 18 games as manager, leaving Hearts eight points clear of Ladbroke Premiership top seed.
Menga hit seven minutes before halftime, which an uninspired Ranger team couldn't answer.
Rangers are now down to sixth place, while Livingston are up to third place behind Hibernian with only the goal difference.
And there could be more bad news on the way to the Rangers, as linebacker Calum Spence was treated after being hit in the head by a throwing object that appeared to come from the live-action section.
Gerrard made eight changes to the line-up, which reached the Betfed Cup semi-finals by beating Ayr.
Holt, on the other hand, set the same 11 that shaved a point off Hearts' lead last week, and he would have been delighted to see his sharp team exhaust opponents all over the course.
Rangers had the ball, but Livingston was more effective.
They should have scored two minutes into the game when Menga's first pass sent Scott Pittman against Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder's attempt was passed over.
A deep-court free kick from Keaghan Jacobs found its way to captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive player Alan Lithgow kicked past the back row.
Rangers took control, but they played more on hope than ability in the offense.
Alfredo Morales was certainly not pleased when Judge Steven Thomson dismissed the Colombian's appeal for a penalty kick when he and Steven Lawless were brought together after a quarter-final.
Rangers managed just two shots on goal in the first half, but former Rangers goalkeeper Liam Kelly had no problems with Lassana Coulibaly's head shot and Ovie Ejarias's home run.
Although Livis' opening in the 34th minute was somewhat accidental, it must be said to be deserved for their efforts alone.
Again, the Rangers couldn't handle a dead-ball situation in depth from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who took time to find Menga, who could easily kick it into the goal.
At halftime, Gerrard Coulibaly replaced Ryan Kent, which almost immediately gave a kick as the winger sent the ball into Morelos, but the well-playing Kelly ran from his position to block.
But Livingston forced the team to play on their premises with many long balls up the field from Lithgow and Halkett.
Holt's men could have extended the lead in the second half, but McGregor dismissed Jacobs with a firm hand before Lithgow headed by the goal.
Rangers' replacement Glenn Middleton appealed again for a late penalty kick after being sacked along with Jacobs, but Judge Thomson was looking the other way here, too.
Yearbook: The Inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from the Sunday Morning yearbook: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, if we count... was the day that the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger invented a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that would eventually lead to the device known as the Geiger counter.
The Geiger counter has become a fixture of both science and popular culture, as seen in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring Roy Rogers and Dale Evans as farmer scientists:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter used to find radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms that the radioactivity in the minerals is doing".
Evans: "Oh, come on, this is it!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before he would have turned 63.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" cancer cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" cancer cells and kill them
Vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells as part of treatment
The method consists of extracting immune cells from a patient and changing them in the laboratory
They can then "see" the protein that is common to many cancers and where they are re-injected.
An experimental vaccine is showing promise in patients with a range of cancers.
When a woman with ovarian cancer was treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells, the cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method involves taking immune cells from patients and modifying them in the laboratory so that they can "see" the protein called HER2, which many cancers have, and then injecting the cells back into the body.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine".
HER2 "can cause several cancers to develop", including breast, ovarian, lung, and bowel cancers, explains Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach, taking immune cells from patients and "teaching" them to attack cancer cells, has worked in the treatment of a particular type of leukemia.
Kanye West gave a Trump-friendly speech wearing a MAGA hat after his SNL performance.
It didn't go well.
After a disjointed appearance on the Saturday Night Live studio, Kanye West was taken aback when he hailed US President Donald Trump and said he would run for president himself in 2020.
After playing the third song of the night, Ghost Town, wearing a Make America Great Again helmet, he began a thunderous speech against the Democrats and maintained his support for Trump.
"I talk to white people so often, and they say, 'Why do you like Trump, he's a racist?'
But if I was worried about racism, I would have moved out of the United States by now", he said.
SNL kicked off tonight's show with a Matt Damon sketch, where the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on the assault charges against Christine Blasey Ford.
Although the footage was not shown, comedian Chris Rock West posted the tirade on social media.
It's unclear whether Rock was trying to expose West by putting the footage up.
West also complained to the audience about poor backstage treatment due to his headdress.
"They bullied me backstage.
They said, 'Don't go out there with that hat on.'
They bullied me!
And they said I was sunk deep", he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West went on, "Do you want to see how deep I've sunk?" and said he was going to put on his Superman cape, because it means, "You can't tell me what to do.
Try with love".
Audiences bowed at least twice to his comments, and the SNL staff seemed embarrassed, Variety reports, with a comment from a person present: "The studio was in a state of silence".
West had been booked as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose then-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West confused many by performing the song "I Love It" while dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West was backed by the leader of the conservative group, TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest people: THANK YOU FOR NOT Letting THE PEOPLE BACK YOU".
Talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West is "just who he is, and that's fine".
"But I choose NOT to reward a person (by buying his music, his clothes or supporting his 'art') who embraces and spreads an ideology that is harmful to society.
He's allowed.
And so have we", she added.
Before the show, the rapper had announced that he had changed his name to "the entity officially known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name, following Diddy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Fellow rapper Snoop Dogg has been named Snoop Lion, and the recently deceased music legend Prince changed his name to a symbol and then to The Artist Formerly Known as Prince.
Charged with attempted murder after stabbing at a Belfast restaurant.
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed at a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police say.
The accused is expected to appear in Belfast's High Court on Monday.
The charges are being reviewed by the public prosecutor's office.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington is out for toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his swordplay as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor lays claim to the stereotypical macho hero, saying that such TV characters often mean young men feel they have to be tough to be respected.
Kit told the Sunday Times Culture that he thought "something went wrong" and asked how to tackle the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie at 31, admitted that the problem "is very close to his heart".
"I'm very concerned about where we've gone wrong in the city with masculinity", he said.
"If we look at the problems of today, what have we taught young men in their upbringing?"
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity because of its very masculine characteristics.
He continued: "What is inborn, and what is learned?
What is it that young men learn from television and from the street that makes them feel that they must be men in this way?
I think that's one of the big questions of our time - how do we change that?
For it is evident that something has gone wrong with the young men".
During the interview, he also admitted that he will not be making any sequels to Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, saying that he is "done with battlefields and horses".
Kit is starring in a November remake of Sam Shepard's True West, which is the story of a film director and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that he considers meeting his wife Rose to be the best part of the entire Game of Thrones experience.
"I met my wife because of this series, so in that way it has given me my future family and shaped my life forever", he said.
Rose played Ygritte, who Kit's character, Jon Snow, falls in love with, in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has reported a 14 percent increase in the number of citizens with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people in the country have been affected, according to the health authorities.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, 40,000 new cases were recorded.
The vast majority of new cases were sexually transmitted, which is a new trend.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China because of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who contract HIV in this way has been reduced to near zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
In one year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexually transmitted HIV is an acute problem in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was legalized in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is reportedly widespread.
Studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men marry women at some point because of the country's conservative values.
Many cases of infection are due to the lack of contraception in these conditions.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised free and equal access to HIV medicine in an attempt to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that her staff leaked data on Republican senators and blasts against "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories".
House of Representatives member Maxine Waters denied Saturday allegations that a member of her staff shared personal information about three Republican senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the allegations came from websites and supporters of the "far right".
"Lies, lies and more terrible lies", Waters wrote in a Twitter post.
The information released allegedly contained the home addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of whom are from Utah.
The information was posted online Thursday by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing on allegations of sexual assault against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak happened after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative support sites like Gateway Pundit of RedState reported that the IP addresses indicated that the information had been posted by Waters' people, and then they published information about a member of Waters' staff, writes The Hill.
"This unfounded accusation is completely untrue and a blatant lie", Waters continued.
"The member of my staff whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations is in no way responsible for this leak of information.
This unfounded accusation is completely untrue and a blatant lie".
Waters' resignation quickly drew criticism online, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"It is an angry denial", wrote Fleischer.
"It suggests she doesn't have the right temperament to be a congresswoman.
If you are accused of something you did not do, do not get angry.
You mustn't be defiant.
You must not question the prosecutor's motives.
You have to keep your head down".
Fleischer compared Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Kavanaugh, who was criticized for being too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate seeking to take Waters' seat in the midterm elections, also tweeted his opinion.
"Great, if that's true", he tweeted.
In Waters' official statement, she says her staff has contacted "the relevant authorities and law enforcement regarding these fraudulent allegations".
"We will make sure that the perpetrators are found", she continued. "And that they will be held legally accountable for their actions, which are destructive and dangerous to everyone on my staff".
Johnny English is back in action.
It has become the norm to look for a Brexit angle in all recent films with a British flavor, and it seems to be relevant to the latest action comedy in the Johnny English series, which started back in 2003 with Johnny English and reappeared in 2011 with Johnny English - born again.
Will the sarcastic self-deprecating sarcasm about how badly we are treated become the country's new export?
At any rate, the incompetent Johnny English with the rubber face and the big eyes has been given his permission to make roarers again and again.
He is, of course, the chubby secret agent who, despite his desire to be a smooth gentleman, has a bit of Clouseau, a knife-edged Mr. Bean and a proper slapping of him who performed a single note to the Chariots of Fire song at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
He is also originally based on the worldwide and international louse-pants who left havoc in their wake after Atkinson portrayed him in Barclaycard's television commercials.
There are some good moments in this latest shot of the JE trunk.
I loved when Johnny English approached a helicopter wearing medieval armor, and the propellers were sounding against his helmet.
You can see Atkinson's talent for physical comedy, but the humor feels rather understated and oddly redundant, especially now that more "serious" film series like 007 and Mission Impossible also offer compelling comedy as an ingredient.
The humor seems to be aimed at children rather than adults, and to me, Johnny English's wild adventures are not as inventive and focused as Atkinson's silent film flirtations as Mr. Bean.
The endlessly topical starting point of the film is that Britain is in serious trouble.
An Internet hacker has infiltrated England's top-secret spy network and revealed the identities of all the British agents in the field to the dismay of the agent in charge - a sadly very small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last chance for a pompous and combative Prime Minister who is already suffering a complete meltdown in political popularity: Emma Thompson is doing her best with this Teresa May-like character, but there's not much to work with in the script.
When her security advisors inform her that every active spy has been exposed, she is forced to cancel someone's pension.
And of course, there's this clumsy Johnny English, who's now the superintendent of a top-notch school, but who secretly teaches you how to become a secret agent.
English is rushed back to a crisis meeting at Whitehall and reunited with his hard-won former right-hand man Bough, again played by Ben Miller.
Bough has now married an over-enthusiastic but well-meaning submarine captain - a role played by Vicki Pepperdine.
Thus, the complete dismay of the Royal Intelligence Service is that Batman and Robin are back, as they meet Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatale, Ophilia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is stumbling close to being infiltrated by the charismatic and creepy tech billionaire Jason Volta - played by Jake Lacy - who claims to be able to solve England's computer problems.
English and Bough embark on their furiously risky escapades: disguised as servants, they set fire to a prestigious French restaurant; they create chaos as they smuggle themselves aboard Volta's luxury yacht; and English creates pure ragnarok as he tries to use virtual reality glasses to familiarize himself with Volta's house.
All the cannons are fired in the closing sequence of the film, but as well-intentioned and energetic as it is, there's a child's television feel to it.
It's a little mediocre.
And as I couldn't help but think about the other Johnny English films, couldn't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that did justice to his talent?
Labour refuses to bargain with a four-day workweek with unchanged pay for the British
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour is said to be considering a radical plan whereby the British can settle for a four-day week but get paid for five.
The party would supposedly want business leaders to use their savings from artificial intelligence (AI) to give employees an extra day off.
This would mean that the employees would have three days of weekends without any reduction in pay.
Sources say the idea would be consistent with the party's economic goal of moving the country in a more favorable direction for workers.
The Trades Union Congress supports the idea of a four-day workweek as a way for workers to benefit from a changing economy.
A senior Labour Party member told The Sunday Times: 'A policy proposal is expected to be published before the end of the year.'
"It's not going to happen in a day, but a four-day workweek is a goal that fits with the party's approach to changing the economy for the benefit of workers and the party's overall strategy for industry".
Labour would not be the first to support such an idea when the Green Party proposed a four-day workweek during the campaign for the 2017 parliamentary elections.
The aim is not, however, unanimously supported in the Labour Party.
A Labour spokesman said: "A four-day work week is not party policy and is not under consideration in the party".
Labour's shadow finance minister, John McDonnell, spent last week's party meeting outlining his plans for a socialist economic revolution.
McDonnell says he's determined to wrest power back from "anonymous CEOs" and "exploiters" in utilities.
The shadow finance minister's plans also cast doubt on whether the current shareholders of water companies will get their money back, as a Labour government could "rainstorm" them on the basis of immoral actions.
He also confirmed plans to have workers on company boards and to set up inclusive ownership funds which would distribute 10 per cent of the value of private companies' shares to employees, who would receive up to £500 a year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell 60 Minutes that the FBI investigation of Kavanaugh could change their vote
The FBI investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week, raising the question of whether the FBI's findings could cause Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview aired Sunday, 60 Minutes reporter Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could dig up anything that might change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open to the idea than his South Carolina counterpart.
"Yes, of course", said Kennedy.
"When I went into the hearing, I said I had spoken with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, after the accusations came out, and I said, "Did you do it?"
He was steely, determined and unambiguous".
Graham's voice, on the other hand, seems to be set in stone.
"I've made my decision regarding Brett Kavanaugh, and anything else would require a very strong indictment", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know that Brett denied it in the strongest terms", Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of the people she mentioned could confirm it.
That was 36 years ago.
I don't see how that would change anything".
What is the Global Citizens Festival, and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
On Saturday, New York City hosts the Global Citizens Festival  an annual music festival with a very impressive array of artists and an equally impressive goal: to end world poverty.
For the seventh time, the Global Citizens Festival will welcome tens of thousands of people to the vast Central Park lawns to look forward to concerts with Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, while also raising awareness of the ultimate goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival started in 2012 and is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy organization that fights to end poverty by increasing the number of active opponents.
To receive a free ticket to the event (if you do not want to pay for a VIP ticket), concertgoers must perform a series of tasks or "acts", such as volunteering, writing to a world leader, making a phone call, or doing any other meaningful act that can raise awareness about the goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been, now that they have 12 years to go?
Does the idea of rewarding people with a free concert really make a difference, or is it just another case of so-called "clicktivism"  that people feel they are making a difference by signing a sign-up online or making a Twitter post?
Global Citizen reports that since 2011, they have recorded more than 19 million "actions" by their members directed at various objectives.
They believe that these actions have prompted world leaders to make binding targets and policy actions amounting to more than $37 billion, which by 2030 is expected to affect more than 2.25 billion people.
In early 2018, the group listed 390 targets and actions that had become due to their actions, amounting to over $10 billion that had already been disbursed or collected.
The group estimates that these funds have so far directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
One of the main targets is The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based investment and business partnership that aims to "help children reach their full potential" and pledges $35 million to help address nutrition problems in Rwanda after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the help of the British government, donors, other governments and global citizens like yourself, the social injustice of malnutrition can become a footnote in the history books", The Power of Nutrition ambassador Tracey Ullman told the audience at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that the UK government has now pledged funds to improve nutrition for mothers and children after receiving more than 5,000 online appeals.
In response to one of the website's frequently asked questions: "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen wrote: "It will be a long and hard fight, and sometimes we will stumble and make mistakes.
But like the civil rights movement and the anti-apartheid movements, we will succeed because we are stronger together".
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monae are among the performers at this year's festival in New York, hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US Navy can use its fleet to "block" Russian energy exports, says US Interior Secretary
"If necessary", Washington could use its navy to prevent Russian energy from entering the market, including in the Middle East, US Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke told the Washington Examiner.
Zinke argued that Russia's interference in Syria  especially where they operate at the invitation of the legitimate government  is a pretext to expand their energy sales.
"I think they're in the Middle East because they want to sell energy, like they do in Eastern and Southern Europe", he is reported to have said.
And he says there are both methods and resources to prevent it.
"The United States has the ability with our navy to ensure that there is free passage on the sea routes and if necessary we can also block them so that we can ensure that their energy does not come to market", he said.
Zinke was speaking at a meeting of the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit organization that considers itself the "voice of the American energy consumer".
He compared Washington's approach to dealing with Russia and Iran, saying they were essentially the same.
"The economic options with Iran and Russia are about exploiting and replacing fuel", he said, referring to Russia as a "one-trick pony" whose economy is dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements come after the Trump administration has aimed to increase European exports of liquefied natural gas to replace Russia, which is by far the cheapest choice for European consumers.
To achieve this, Trump administration spokesmen, including Donald Trump himself, have tried to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump says has made Berlin a "prisoner" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the 11 billion-dollar Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is expected to double its current capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is an economic project.
The Kremlin believes that Washington's strong opposition to the project is an expression of unequal conditions of competition and is merely due to economic considerations.
"I think we share the view that energy should not be a tool for exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their supplier", Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said at a subsequent meeting in Moscow with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in September.
The American position is being criticized by Germany, which has confirmed its participation in the project.
Germany's leading industrial organisation, BDI, has asked the US to stay out of EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem with third-party interference in our energy supply", said BDI head Dieter Kempf after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren is "strongly considering" running for president in 2020, says Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren is "strongly considering" running for president after the midterm elections, she said Saturday.
At a town council meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she's considering running.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our political system, and that requires a woman on the front lines", she said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6th, I will seriously consider running for president".
Warren gave his opinion on President Donald Trump to the city council, saying he was "leading the country in the wrong direction".
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", she said.
Warren has been vocal in his criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet Friday, Warren wrote, "Of course the FBI will investigate this before the vote".
However, a poll from Thursday shows that the majority of Warren's own backbenchers don't think she should run in 2020.
According to a poll by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe, 58% of "likely" voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run.
32 per cent supported the possible candidacy.
The poll showed greater support for former governor Deval Patrick with 38% in favour and 48% against a possible draft.
Other high-profile Democratic candidates being discussed in the 2020 presidential election include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden says he'll announce his final decision in January, reports the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin is mentioning Track Palin's PTSD at a rally for Donald Trump.
26-year-old Track Palin spent a year in Iraq after joining the Army in September.
Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
"What my own son is going through after he comes home allows me to relate to other families who are feeling the effects of PTSD and other injuries that our soldiers are coming home with", she told an audience at a Trump campaign rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said of his son and other veterans that "they have changed and become tougher. They go and wonder if there is respect for what their colleagues on the ground and in the air and all other members of the military have done for the country".
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, preventing the reporting of domestic violence, and possession of a firearm while intoxicated, said Dan Bennet, a spokesman for Wasilla police.
18 states and D.C. support opposition to new asylum laws
18 states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to a new U.S. law that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from all 18 states and D.C. delivered an independent statement in Washington on Friday in support of an asylum seeker who opposes the law, NBC News reports.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the federal law has not been released.
She claims that her partner "and his violent gang-member sons" had abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
The prosecutors supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, from which a large number of U.S. asylum seekers originate, as countries with widespread problems of gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum law overturned a 2014 decision by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney Karl Racine said Friday that the new law "disregards decades of state, federal and international law".
"Federal legislation requires that all asylum applications be decided on the basis of relevant facts and circumstances, and such an impediment goes against that principle", the non-partisan statement said.
The lawyers also argued in the statement that the law to reject immigrants harms the U.S. economy, as they are more likely to become self-employed and "provide needed labor".
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions stripped immigration judges of the right to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
"Asylum is offered to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear of persecution based on race, religion, nationality, or membership in a particular social group or political opinion", Sessions said in his June 11 announcement of the law.
Asylum was never meant to solve all the problems - or just all the serious problems - that people around the world face every day.
As the death toll doubles, efforts to find survivors in Palu are becoming desperate.
For survivors, the situation only got worse.
"It's very tense", said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, as she comforted her little boy with a fever at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute, the ambulance comes in with a body.
We need clean water".
The inhabitants now returned to their ruined homes to sort through the soaked property and save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals that were also hit by the 7.5 magnitude quake were unable to keep up.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who broke his back and shoulder, were lying outside Palus Military Hospital, where patients are being treated outdoors due to the strong aftershocks.
Tears came to his eyes as he related how the tremor shook the fifth-floor hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was masted to a broken wall, I think", Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was attending a wedding in the city.
"I heard my wife scream for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe".
US Ambassador accuses China of obscene practices and propaganda
A week after a Chinese newspaper ran a four-page ad in an American newspaper touting the benefits of U.S.-China cooperation, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to China Daily's paid printing of the Des Moines Register  Iowa's best-selling newspaper  after accusing China of meddling in the November 6 congressional elections.
U.S. officials told Reuters that Trump's accusation of Chinese interference in the U.S. election marks a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to pressure China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are now locked in an escalating trade war, with several rounds of tariffs on each other's imports.
China's retaliatory tariffs in the trade war would hit exporters in states like Iowa, which backed Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts say.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa for several years, which is a major exporter of agricultural food to China, said Beijing has harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in an editorial in the Des Moines Register Sunday that China is "escalating the use of the unseemly methods by running propaganda ads in our own free press".
"By spreading propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of America's proud tradition of free speech and freedom of the press by running a paid ad in the Des Moines Register", Branstad wrote.
"In the kiosks here in Beijing, you will find few dissenters, and you will not get a fair picture of the Chinese people's different attitudes to China's worrying economic direction, as the media is under tight control by the Chinese Communist Party", he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers refused to publish" his article, although he did not say which one.
Republicans alienating women ahead of the midterm elections with the Kavanaugh case, analysts warn
While many top Republicans are supporting and defending Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh against allegations of sexual assault, analysts warn they will face a backlash in the upcoming midterm elections, especially from women.
The issue has stirred up a stir, and most Republicans have already made it public that they want the vote to continue.
"This is not something that can be reversed", Grant Reher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article Saturday.
Reher said he doubts Republican Senator Jeff Flake's (Arizona) request for an FBI investigation for the 11th hour will soften the anger of voters.
"Women don't forget what happened yesterday  they won't forget it tomorrow or in November", said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, according to The Hill on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters at a Senate rally shouted "November is coming!" as Republicans, who control the Judiciary Committee, voted to move forward with Kavanaugh's nomination despite testimony from Professor Christine Blasey Ford, according to Mic.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are about to reach new heights", independent political commentator Stu Rothenberg told the news outlet.
"People say it's already reached a high level; it's true.
But it can reach even higher, especially among suburban female swing voters and younger voters  18-29  who rarely vote, despite disliking the president".
Even before Ford's public accusations of sexual assault of the Supreme Court nominee, analysts had pointed out that it could backfire if the Republicans continued with the nomination.
"It's become a worse mess for the Republicans", said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, earlier this week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final result or whether Kavanaugh is held accountable; it's also about how the Republicans have handled this and how they've treated her", Guy Cecil, chairman of Priorities USA, a group that supports Democrats in getting elected, told the news channel.
But Americans seem to have a divided opinion on who to believe, based on the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with the latter having a bit more on his side.
A recent YouGov poll shows that 41% of those polled "certainly or probably believed" Ford's testimony, while 35% said they "certainly or probably believed" Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they believed Kavanaugh either probably or certainly lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
At Flake's request, the FBI is now investigating the allegations made by Ford and at least one other person, writes Deborah Ramirez for The Guardian.
Ford testified under oath last week to the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh, while intoxicated, raped her when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee showed her his genitals at a party when they were both students at Yale in the '80s.
The inventor of the Internet plans to create a new Internet and compete with Google and Facebook
The inventor of the Internet, Tim Berners-Lee, is launching a new company to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend is called Inrupt and is a company based on Berners-Lee's open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who has access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners Lee joked that the plan for Inrupt is "world domination".
"We have to do it now", he said of the startup.
"This is a historic moment".
The app uses Solid's technology so people can create their own "personal online data collection" or POD.
It may include contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available in one browser at the same time.
The unique feature of online personal data collection is that it is entirely up to the user to decide who can access that specific information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data".
The idea behind Inrupt, according to its CEO, John Bruce, is to pool resources, processes and capabilities to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired by IBM, a few software developers on project contracts and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee says that he and his team are not talking to "Facebook or Google about whether they should completely change everything so that all of their business models suddenly become redundant".
"We do not ask for their permission".
In an article on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to offer commercial energy and an ecosystem that can ensure the integrity and quality of the new Internet being built on Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he started the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been a key voice in the so-called net neutrality debate.
While Inrupt is launched, Berners-Lee will still be the inventor and CEO of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about the next era of the Internet", Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Victorian Cross recipient from World War I honored
The only English priest to win the Victoria Cross for fighting in World War I is being celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel and priest Bernard Wann won the Order on September 29, 1918, during the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But he was killed four days later by a sniper and never learned that he had been awarded England's highest military order.
On Saturday, a memorial was unveiled by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
Michael Vann, one of his grandchildren, said that it was "incredibly symbolic" that the stone was unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather's resounding achievement.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a very thick fog and under heavy machine gun and artillery fire".
Later, he ran to the front and led his men with "the greatest courage" before single-handedly attacking an artillery piece and destroying three guns.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918, just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "something I knew I could never live up to, but that makes me humble".
He and his brother James Vann also laid a wreath after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he "felt very honoured to be in the parade" and added that "the support of all these people underscores the true heroism".
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, but instead got Gurli Pig
Imagine staying up all night watching the star-studded Bellator 206 and then being denied access to the main event.
There were 13 matches on the San Jose show, including six matches on the main show, and they were shown overnight in England on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were getting ready to meet, viewers in England were somewhat surprised when the transmission switched to show Gurli Pig.
Some were unimpressed after staying up early in the morning for this very fight.
A fan on Twitter described the switch to a children's cartoon as "a kind of sick joke".
"This content was not legally appropriate at 6 a.m., so they had to switch to children's shows", said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president, when asked about the broadcast.
"Gray Gurli, yes. " I know.
Bellator's CEO, Scott Coker, said they would work to include English viewers in future planning.
"When you think about the rebroadcast, I think we can make it work", Coker said.
"But it's six o'clock Sunday morning over there, and we won't find a solution to it until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the switch was made, I got a lot of messages, and not all of them were friendly.
We tried to fix it, but we thought it was a technical malfunction.
But that was actually the law.
I can promise you that it won't happen next time.
We're going to settle for five games instead of six, as we normally do, and we're trying to give our fans something extra, and then we're running out of time.
This is an unfortunate situation".
Tom Daley had "a lesser value" to sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone else because of his sexuality, but it motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said that he did not realize until he got to the big leagues that "everyone is not like me".
When he was on Radio 4's first Desert Island Discs with Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said that he was less interested in winning the Olympics after becoming a parent.
The longtime regular radio host, Kirsty Young, has taken a few months off due to illness.
Daley was a guest on Laverne's first show and said that he felt "less valuable" than everyone else in his upbringing because "it wasn't socially acceptable to like boys and girls".
He said: "To this day, the feelings of being remembered and different have been the things that have given me the strength to succeed".
He wanted to prove he was "something", he said, so he wouldn't disappoint everyone when they learned of his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a high-profile LGBT activist and used his participation in this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call for decriminalization of homosexuality in several countries.
He said he spoke out because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without negative consequences and he wanted to give others "hope".
The three-time world champion said he was "surprised" when he fell in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black - whom he met in 2013.
Daley married the Oscar winner last year, who is 20 years older than him, but told me that the age difference had never been a problem.
He said it's hard to find someone his age who's had similar ups and downs when you're going through so much at such a young age. He went to his first Olympics at 14, and his father died of cancer three years later.
In June, the couple became the parents of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that "his whole perspective" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, it would have been all about whether I should win a gold medal", he said.
"But there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie".
His son shares the name of his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at age 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley told me that his father didn't accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked was if they had gotten tickets to London 2012 when he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him that he wouldn't be there by then.
I held his hand when his breathing stopped, and it first dawned on me that he was not immortal when he stopped breathing and was dead", he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I just knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life - diving in front of a home crowd at the Olympics.
It was also the inspiration for his first song selection  Proud of Heather Small  which had meant a lot during the run-up to the Olympics and still gave him goose bumps.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11.15 BST.
Uskarp Mickelson on the bench for the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson sets a record on Sunday as he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he's got to do something about the form if he's not to make it a sad milestone.
Mickelson, who is setting a record by making his 12th appearance in the biennial competition, was benched by captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's fourball and foursomes.
Instead of being the center of the action for the United States as usual, the five-time grand winner had to act the hip and practice his game in the hope of making up for the mistakes.
Even at the peak of his career, he had the most straight-ahead drive, which is why the 48-year-old is not a perfect match for the pitch at Le Golf National, where the long rough often punishes stray shots.
And if the field wasn't big enough, Mickelson will face the ever-precision winner of the British Open, Francesco Molinari, in the ninth match on Sunday, who has teamed up with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans, who are starting the 12 singles matches, start strong, Mickelson's fight could be decisive.
Furyk did not express surprising confidence in his teammate.
"He understood his role perfectly today, patted me on the back, put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow", Furyk said.
"He has great faith in himself".
He's in the Hall of Fame and he's given so much to these teams before and also this week.
I didn't think he'd play two games.
I imagined he'd play more, but that's how it went, and that's how it was supposed to be.
He wants to be out there with us like everybody else".
On Sunday, Mickelson beats Nick Faldo's record for most games played in the Ryder Cup.
It could be the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never quite matched his individual achievements.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven ties, even though Furyk said his presence contributes to something indefinable.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's witty, he likes to stick to people, and he's good to have in the team room", he explained.
"I also think the younger players had fun playing against him this week, which was fun to watch.
He's contributing a lot more than just the game".
Europe's captain Thomas Bjørn knows that great leadership can quickly disappear
European captain Thomas Bjørn knows from experience that a solid lead before the final day of the Ryder Cup singles match can quickly become nerve-racking.
The Danish debuted in 1997 in Valderrama, where a team led by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but was about to be caught before the finish line with a 141⁄2-131⁄2 victory.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a nice lead in Valderrama, we had a nice lead in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we just won", says Bjørn after seeing the 2018 team win both 5-3 on Friday and yesterday to an overall lead of 10-6 at Le Golf National.
History tells me and the rest of the team that it's not over.
I want it full of garbage by tomorrow.
Go out there and do the right thing.
It's not over until you get the points on the board.
We have one goal, and that is to try and win the trophy, and that's where our focus is.
I've always said that I'm focused on the 12 players on our side, but we're also aware of what's on the other side  the best golfers in the world".
Satisfied with the performance of his players on a difficult course, Bjørn added: "I don't take any of this for granted.
Tomorrow is a whole new challenge.
Tomorrow, it is the individual performance that counts, and that is something else entirely.
It's great to be out there with a partner when it's going well, but when you're out there alone, you're tested on every single parameter as a golfer.
That's what the players need to understand. Bring out the best in you tomorrow.
Now you must leave your partner, for he too will bring out the best in himself".
The opposite is true for opponent Jim Furyk, who is hoping for better individual performances than in the partnership game, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Furyk himself has experienced some hardships on his last day, first at the Brooklyn championship before losing when Europe performed the Miracle at Medina.
"I remember every word", he said when asked how captain Ben Crenshaw in 1999 had spoken to his players before the final day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you want to have a good start, like you saw in Brooklyn, like you saw in Medina.
Once momentum has found a direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the inter-fight.
We're going to put our teams together accordingly and put the players on the field in the order we feel like we want to, and we're going to try to create magic tomorrow".
Thomas has been tasked with trying to lead the rebound and faces Rory McIlroy in the top fight, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter and the other Europeans play in the first half of the series.
"I chose this group of players in this order because I think it secures us all the way through", Bjørn said of his choice of singles players.
Germany's new warship is delayed again
The German Navy's newest frigate was supposed to be ready in 2014 to replace Cold War warships, but the Germans have to wait at least another year because of technical problems and an escalating price, local media report.
The deployment of the largest ship in the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg class of frigates, the "Rheinland-Pfalz", has been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, citing a spokesman for the military.
The ship was due to join the fleet in 2014, but delivery problems have plagued the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels, ordered by the fleet back in 2007, are to replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
They are known to have a powerful cannon, a wide range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, and stealth technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Another important feature of the newest frigates is a reduced need for maintenance: it should be possible to keep the frigates away from home ports for up to two years.
But repeated delays mean that the advanced warships  that are said to make Germany appear as an overseas power factor  will already be obsolete when they are deployed, Die Zeit writes.
The failed F-125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to take the ship into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to the shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media cited a number of crucial "software and hardware flaws" that rendered the warship unusable in combat situations.
Software errors were of particular importance as the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships are to be manned by a crew of 120 seamen - only half the crew of the older Bremen frigates.
It also turned out that the ship was too heavy, which reduced its performance and limited the fleet's ability to make future updates.
The 7,000-tonne "Rheinland-Pfalz" is said to be twice as heavy as similar ships used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to hardware defects, the cost of the project, which includes training of the staff, is also becoming a problem.
It is said to have reached a staggering €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion), with an initial price of €2.2 billion.
The problems with the latest frigates are becoming even more important in the light of recent warnings that Germany's naval power is shrinking.
Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German government's defense committee, admitted earlier this year that the navy is "running out of ready-to-fly ships".
The official said that the problem has grown over time because the old ships were taken out of service without being replaced.
He complained that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates were ready to join the fleet.
National Trust eavesdropping on the secret lives of bats
New research from the Scottish Highlands is trying to uncover how bats use the landscape when they hunt.
The hope is that the findings will shed light on the unique behaviour of the flying mammals and will help with future conservation efforts.
The study is being carried out by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland and follows common bat, dwarf bat, long-eared bat and water bat at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment is placed at carefully selected locations in the area to record bat activities throughout the season.
Data are also collected by NTS staff and volunteers using handheld detectors.
In-depth analysis of the sound recordings will reveal the frequencies of the bats and show which species do what.
To produce a detailed landscape picture of their behaviour, a report and a map of the habitat are made.
Rob Dewar, conservation adviser for NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important and how they are used by the different species.
This knowledge can help to identify the benefits of habitat conservation efforts such as the establishment of nesting grounds and how best to conserve forest areas for bats and similar species.
Bat populations in Scotland and Britain have declined dramatically over the past 100 years.
They are threatened by buildings and urban development projects that affect ship owners and reduce their habitat.
Windmills and lighting can also pose a danger, as can fly traps, chemical treatment of building materials, and attacks by pets.
In fact, bats are not blind.
But because they hunt primarily at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes.
They use advanced echolocation technology to find insects and fly around obstacles.
The NTS, which is responsible for the preservation of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important parks, and 76,000 acres of land around the country, takes bats very seriously.
They have ten trained experts who often collect data, inspect ships and sometimes conduct rescue operations.
The organization has even created Scotland's first and only dedicated bat sanctuary in the area around Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight out of ten of Scotland's bat species.
The area's superintendent, David Thompson, says it's an ideal territory for them.
"Here at Threave we have a very good area for bats", he said.
"We have old buildings, lots of old trees and all the good habitat.
There is much that is unknown about bats, so work here and elsewhere can help to understand what they need to thrive".
He stresses the importance of looking for bats before undertaking property maintenance, since the destruction of a single nest can kill up to 400 females and young, risking the extinction of an entire local population.
Bat is protected, and it is illegal to kill, disturb or disturb them or their nest.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish project manager for the Bat Conservation Trust, has called on the public to join in.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bat, and for many of the species we have, we don't know how populations evolve".
Ronaldo rejects rape charges while lawyers sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has called rape allegations against him "fake news" and says people "want to promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German news outlet Der Spiegel, which brought the allegations.
The attacker from Portugal and Juventus has been accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He allegedly paid her $375,000 to keep it a secret, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Hours after the allegations were made public, 33-year-old Ronaldo spoke to his 142 million followers on Instagram Live, criticizing the information as "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no. I'm not going to do this.
What they said today is fake news", the five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the camera.
"They will promote themselves by using my name.
It's not a bad thing.
They'll be famous for saying my name, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy man, and everything is fine", the player added with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they have called, according to Reuters, "an unforgivable disclosure of suspicions about privacy".
Attorney Christian Schertz says the player would seek compensation for "moral corruption in a class similar to the charge, which is probably one of the most serious violations of privacy rights in recent years".
The incident allegedly took place in June 2009 in a room at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anal, according to the report filed in the municipal court of Clark County, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronald fell to his knees after the alleged incident and said he was "a good guy 99% of the time" grabbed by "the one percent".
The case file says Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that there was consent.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had her injuries photographed in a hospital, but that she later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she felt "fear of retaliation" and worried about being "publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old now says she will reverse the deal as she is still deeply affected by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was facing a move from Manchester United to Real Madrid when the incident was supposed to have taken place, and he moved this summer to Italian giant Juventus for €100 million.
Brexit: Britain 'will forever regret' the loss of car manufacturers
Britain "will forever regret" losing its status as the world's leading carmaker after Brexit, said Commerce Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was 'worrying' that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if the UK left the EU without a deal it would temporarily cut production at the Burnaston plant near Derby.
"We need a deal", Clark said.
The Japanese carmaker said that longer waiting at the border in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which produces Toyota's Auris and Avensis, produced almost 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the EU.
"The way I see it, production at our plant will stop if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March", said Burnaston CEO Marvin Cooke.
Other British carmakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, are fearful of leaving the EU without a cross-border trade agreement.
For example, BMW says they will close their Mini factory in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concern of car manufacturers is related to risks to the supply chain in the event of a no-deal withdrawal.
Toyota's production is running on a tight schedule, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU.
If Britain leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, problems could arise at the border, which the car industry says could lead to delays and parts shortages.
It would be impossible for Toyota to store more than one day's production at the Derbyshire plant and then production would be stopped, the company said.
Clark says Theresa May's Chequers plan for future negotiations with the EU is "complex to precisely avoid these border checks".
"We want the best deal that not only allows us - as I call it - to enjoy our current success, but to seize this opportunity", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"The statements from Toyota and other manufacturers indicate that we need to be able to continue what have been successful supply chains".
Toyota could not say how long the production would be stopped, but in the longer term higher prices would reduce the factory's competitiveness, which would ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is a general contractor at the factory, says that his members are becoming increasingly concerned: "My experience tells me that once these jobs are gone, they won't come back".
A government spokesman said: 'We have proposed a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.'
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, White House says
Donald Trump's crucial meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may "be postponed for another week" as the fight over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein looks over the shoulder of special counsel Robert Mueller as he investigates Russian election meddling, ties between Trump aides and Russia, and the president's possible obstruction of justice.
Whether Trump will fire the deputy attorney general, thus jeopardizing Mueller's independence, has been a topic of discussion in Washington for months.
The New York Times reported earlier this month that Rosenstein was considering wearing a microphone to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of impeaching the president via the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the news.
But last Monday, he went to the White House, and word got out that he was going to resign.
Instead, a meeting was arranged for Thursday with Trump, who was then at the UN headquarters in New York.
Trump said he would "prefer not" to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed to avoid a tie-up with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing where Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who has accused him of sexual assault, were due to testify.
On Friday, Trump ordered an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, delaying the Senate election.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, was on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "There is no date set. It could be this week. I can also imagine that it could be pushed a week with all that is going on in the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I always like to keep the press updated".
Some reporters would challenge the claim that Sanders hasn't held a White House press conference since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said the lack of press conferences was not due to TV reporters playing for the gallery, but added: "I don't disagree with them playing up to the camera".
She then said that direct contact between Trump and the press would be increased.
"The president is taking more questions from the press than any president before him", she said, adding without citing a source: "We've looked at the numbers".
Press conferences will still take place, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask the president of the United States directly, it's infinitely better than talking to me.
We're trying to give it a lot of opportunity, and you've seen us do it over the last couple of weeks, and it's going to be in the press conference space when you can talk to the president of the United States".
Trump often takes questions when he leaves the White House or attends open hearings or press conferences with high-profile guests.
Press conferences with Trump alone are rare.
This week in New York, the president showed why, when he made an impromptu and sometimes mysterious figure in front of the press.
Health Minister meets EU health workers in Scotland following Brexit concerns
The Minister for Health has written to the EU staff working in Scotland's NHS, expressing the country's gratitude and wishes that they stay after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before Britain withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to paying for the applications for permanent residence for EU citizens working in its delegated public sector.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: 'During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on withdrawal continue and it looks like decisions are expected in the autumn.
But the British government has also stepped up its preparations for a possible no-deal Brexit.
I know this must be a very uncertain time for all of you.
That is why I would like to reiterate how much I appreciate the efforts made by each and every employee, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from outside the EU and abroad bring valuable experience and expertise that strengthens and improves healthcare for the benefit of patients and communities.
Scotland is absolutely your home, and we would very much like you to stay.
Christion Abercrombie is in emergency surgery after a head injury.
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie has been in emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in Saturday's 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, according to Tennessee's Mike Organ.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters the incident occurred before the break.
"He went out to the sideline and just fell out there", Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before putting him on a stretcher and taking him in for further examination.
A spokesman for Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie's operation at Vanderbilt Medical Center was over.
Harris added that there are "no details on the type or extent of the injury yet", and Tennessee State is trying to determine when he sustained the injury.
Abercrombie is a sophomore and in his first season at Tennessee State after a stint at Illinois.
He had five tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, giving him 18 total tackles this season.
Foreign buyers are charged higher stamp duty when buying a house in the UK
Foreign buyers are charged a higher stamp duty when they buy property in the UK, and the extra money is intended to help the homeless, according to the Conservative Party.
This move is intended to dampen Corbyn's success in attracting young voters.
The higher stamp duty will hit those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Treasury expects this will generate £120 million a year for the homeless.
Theresa May is today proposing that foreign buyers be charged a higher stamp duty when they buy property in the UK, for the benefit of the homeless.
The move will be seen as an attempt to counter Jeremy Corbyn's success in attracting young voters with promises of cheaper housing and going after the highest-income earners.
The increase in the poll tax will affect individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK, and the proceeds will be used to support the government's fight to ensure that everyone has a place to sleep.
The additional charge, which is added to the current stamp duty and the higher levels introduced two years ago for multi-dwelling purchases and purchases for rental, could reach 3%.
The Treasury expects it to raise £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of new construction in London is bought by people living abroad, which is driving up prices and making it harder for first-time buyers to gain a foothold in the housing market.
Many wealthy areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become "ghost towns" because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new bill comes just weeks after Boris Johnson proposed a cut in the poll tax to make it easier for young people to buy their first home.
He accused big construction companies of keeping property prices up by buying land they don't use, and he asked May to drop quotas on cheap housing to solve Britain's "shameful housing situation".
Corbyn has proposed a number of striking housing reforms, including control of rents and the removal of the landlord's right to evict people if they comply with the lease.
He also wants to strengthen the possibility of constructing public housing.
May said: 'Last year I said I would use my presidency to restore the British dream; that life is getting better for every generation.
And that means fixing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
But it cannot be that it is as easy for foreign companies and people living outside the UK to buy housing as it is for hardworking British people.
For too many, the dream of owning a home has become too remote, and the indignity of sleeping on the streets is still too widespread".
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to become Scotland's coach"
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "ultimate goal" is to eventually become Scotland's coach.
The 42-year-old Scot is enjoying the challenge of reviving the North East club, who are now third in League One, three points from the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
"I played a match with the B team and that was it", Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
"But I grew up watching Scotland on the Hampden with my father when I was a child, and it's always pulled me in.
However, that opportunity would only come if I was successful in coaching clubs".
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic manager says he had no qualms about following such established names at such a big club and had previously turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Now I measure success by 'can I get this club back in the Premier League.'
The structure and facilities of this club make it unquestionably home in the Premier League,' he said.
"It's not an easy task, but I think I'll only see myself as successful here if I can get the club back there".
Ross is only three years into his coaching career after a stint as an assistant coach at Dumbarton and a 15-month failure as part of the Hearts coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa to bounce back from relegation to the third tier and transformed St Mirren from relegation to title-winning status the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did in his career playing for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was a real crossroads", he recalls of his time in Alloa.
"I honestly believed that coaching was the right thing for me, more than being a player.
It sounds strange, because I was doing well, earning a lot of money, and I had some success stories.
But it can be hard to play.
There's a lot of stuff you have to go through on a weekly basis.
There's still that kind of stress and pressure that coaching, but it just feels right.
I've always wanted to exercise, and I'm doing it now, and I've never felt more comfortable with myself in my entire adult life".
You can hear the full interview on Sportsound on Sunday 30 September on Radio Scotland between 12 and 1pm BST.
The best time to have a beer is Saturday at 5:30 p.m., study shows.
The heat wave this summer has boosted the profits of pubs in England, but has put restaurant chains under greater pressure.
Sales in pubs and bars rose by 2.7% in July, while sales in restaurants fell by 4.8%, figures show.
Peter Martin, CGA business consultant who compiled the figures, said: 'Continued sunshine and England's unexpectedly long World Cup have meant that July follows the June pattern, with pubs seeing 2.8% merchant sales, except that restaurants are hit harder now.
The decline of 1.8% in restaurants in June was only worse in July.
Pubs and bars focused on the sale of beverages fared best, experiencing growth equivalent to the decline of restaurants.
Pubs with a focus on food suffered from the sun, but not as much as restaurants.
Looks like people just want a drink.
In the pub and bar chains, beverage sales rose by 6.6% for the month, while food sales fell by 3.3%".
Paul Newman, who analyses the services sector, said: "The results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
When it comes to out-of-home sales, the weather and major social or sporting events are the biggest factors.
It is not surprising that restaurants are still struggling, although a fall in sales of 4.8% year on year will hurt the rising costs.
The long, hot summer could not have come at a worse time for the food industry, and only time will tell whether the more moderate temperatures we have experienced in August will provide much-needed respite".
The overall increase in sales combined for pubs and restaurants including new openings was 2.7 % in July, reflecting the decline in newly launched brands.
Coffer Peach Tracker, which monitors sales figures for pubs, bars and restaurants in the UK, collects and analyses data from 47 different groups.
One in five children has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents
One in five children - up to 11 years of age - has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers, according to a study.
A study of 20,000 schoolchildren in grades four through nine reveals a growth in "fake" Insta pages.
The news has increased fears of sexual content being posted
20% of students said they had a "main account" that they could show their parents
One in five children under 11 years of age set up social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A study of 20,000 students in 4th grade and above reveals a sharp increase in "fake" Instagram accounts  a reference to the photo-sharing service Instagram.
The news has increased fears of sexual content being posted.
20% of the students said they had a "main account" that they could show their parents, while also having a private one.
A mother who stumbled upon her 13-year-old daughter's secret account saw a teenager urging others to "rape me".
The survey, carried out by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) for private schools, found that 40% of 11-18 year olds had two profiles, half of whom admitted to having private accounts.
HMC director Mike Buchanan said: "It's frightening that so many teenagers are tempted to create online profiles where their parents and teachers can't find them.
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" on the board of Scottish Athletics.
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Board of Directors of Scottish Athletics at the Annual General Meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland's most successful athlete, and chairman Ian Bettie described the switch as a great opportunity for those making decisions about sport to benefit from her extensive 10 years of experience at international level.
"Eilidh is highly regarded in the athletic world in Scotland, the UK and the rest of the world and we are confident that Scottish athletics will benefit from her being on the board", Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I will try to be the voice of the athletes and I hope I can contribute and help to set a direction for sport in Scotland".
The American, who won two of his four Olympic gold medals in the 200- and 400-meter races at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta and is now a frequent commentator for the BBC, could not go after a transient ischemic attack.
He tweeted: "A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that time would tell if I would recover and to what extent.
It's been hard work, but I'm completely healthy, I've learned to walk again and I'm doing agility exercises today!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Advertising of breast pumps comparing mothers to cows is getting mixed online
A breast-pumping company has shared the opinion online with an advertisement comparing nursing mothers to cows being milked.
To mark the launch of what is said to be "the world's first silent breast pump", the technology consumer magazine has released a sarcastic music-video-inspired advertisement that is meant to show the freedom that the new pump gives mothers.
Four real mothers dancing in a haystack to a song that goes, "Yes, I'm milking myself, but you don't see a tail", and "In case you haven't noticed, these aren't gills, these are my breasts".
The voice is, "Pump it out, pump it out, I feed my baby, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my breast".
But the ad, which has been posted on the company's Facebook page, has sparked controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received a mixed reception from viewers, many saying it mocks the "horrors" of the dairy industry.
"Very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth before they can produce milk, except that their babies are stolen from them shortly after birth", one user wrote.

Another wrote: "Understandably traumatic for both mother and child.
But why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their babies?"
Another added: "What a cold commercial".
Others defended the ad, one woman admitting that she found the song "amazingly funny".
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
If I was still breastfeeding, I would have had one.
Breastfeeding made me feel exactly like a cow.
The commercial's a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
It's a brilliant product", one wrote.
Another commented: "It is a funny advertisement aimed at mothers who pump milk (often at their workplace or in toilets) and feel like 'queues.'
It is not an advertisement praising or criticizing the dairy industry".
At the end of the video, the women reveal that they have danced with the discreet pumps in their bras.
The concept behind the ad is based on the fact that many women who breastfeed say they feel like cows.
The Elvie pump is completely silent, has no pipes or hoses, and fits discreetly in a breast-feeding bra, giving women freedom to move, hold their children, and even go outside while pumping.
Ana Balarin, partner and CEO of Mother, wrote: "The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between nursing mothers and dairy cows, we wanted to focus on the challenges of breast-pumping, while showing in an entertaining and recognizable way the freedom that the new pump can provide".
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump has made headlines.
At London Fashion Week, a mother went to two catwalks for Marta Jakubowski while wearing the product.
Hundreds of migrant children secretly moved to tent camps on the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has exploded, even though the number of border crossers has not changed, due in part to harsher rhetoric and tougher laws by the Trump administration that make it harder to place children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors have been undocumented immigrants themselves, and they have feared for their ability to stay in the country by coming forward and taking in a child.
The risk of repatriation increased in June when authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult household members would be required to provide fingerprints and that this data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that they had arrested several individuals who sought to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The administration later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had clean criminal records.
"Nearly 80% of those who are either sponsors or members of sponsored households are in the country illegally, and a large number of them are foreign criminals.
So we're still chasing those people", Albence said.
In an effort to speed up the children's cases, authorities have introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within a month of their detention, which was previously 60 days, aid workers say.
Many people use video calls instead of actually going to an immigration judge to present their case for legal residence.
Those who are deemed ineligible for residence are deported quickly.
The longer children are in custody, the more likely they are to develop anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent outbursts or attempted escape, according to aid workers and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months.
Advocates of better conditions say that these risks are more pronounced at larger facilities like Tornillo, where the size makes it harder to monitor if a child is suffering.
They added that moving to a tent city without mental preparation or the opportunity to say goodbye to friends can accumulate traumas that many are already struggling with.
Syria announces US, French and Turkish "occupation forces" to withdraw immediately
When Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem addressed the UN General Assembly, he urged Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, said that the presence of foreign forces in the country is illegal and under the pretext of fighting terrorism and they will "be met with equivalent means".
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally", he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the war on terror is "almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have fled their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to "fight this decisive war until we have cleared all Syrian territories" of both terrorist groups and "illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, primarily training and advising Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the war-torn country.
On the refugee issue, Moualem said that conditions were good enough for them to return home, accusing "some Western countries" of "spreading unjustified fear" that caused the refugees to disappear.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to help facilitate these returns", he said.
"They politicize what should be a purely humanitarian matter".
The United States and the European Union have warned that no aid will be made available to rebuild the country until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Syria to establish a buffer zone in the last major rebel-held city of Idlib has opened the way for continued political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented a major attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, which is home to three million people.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action would go after jihadists from the Nusra Front, a spinoff of Al-Qaeda, who "will be wiped out".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of the new committee soon to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem has set conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, stating that the panel's work should be limited to "reviewing the legislation in the current constitution", and warned against interference.
That's why Trump wins another term.
By that logic, Trump will probably be reelected in 2020, unless the impeachment trial and scandals end his presidency early, which many liberal viewers are hoping.
In what will undoubtedly be "the most dramatic end to a presidential term ever!"
There's no sign of visual fatigue at this time.
Since 2014, prime-time viewership has nearly doubled for CNN to 1.05 million and nearly tripled to 1.6 million for MSNBC.
Fox News averages 2.4 million viewers at prime time, compared with 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow Show has the most viewers with up to 3.5 million on major news nights.
"It's a spectacle that people are drawn to because it's not something we understand", said Neal Baer, host of ABC's drama Designated Survivor about a cabinet leader who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has a different theory.
She remembers a taxicab ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he was going to vote for Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
"He said, 'Because he makes me laugh,'" Scovell said.
The chaos has entertainment value.
But unlike any other TV show, the stories coming out of Washington could decide the case between Roe and Wade, whether refugee families can be reunited and the health of the global economy.
Switching channels is only for the most privileged.
And yet it's about more than being an informed citizen when you watch a six-hour panel discussion where experts discuss Bob Woodward's use of "deep background" when he wrote his book "Fear"; Paul Manafort's $15,000 strut leather jacket ("clothed with hybris", wrote The Washington Post) and the implications of Stormy Daniels' vivid descriptions of Trump's anatomy.
I certainly don't want to see Super Mario the same way.
"Part of what makes it feel like a reality show is that he gives you something every night", said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", about the Trump show's rotating cast and daily surprises (fights with the NFL, praise for Kim Jong-un).
But if you miss a section, you're fired.
When I caught Fleiss this week, it was 90 degrees outside his home on the north shore of Kauai, but he was sitting inside watching MSNBC while he was taping CNN.
He couldn't force himself away, not with Brett Kavanaugh to be heard by the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court to be decided.
"I remember when we did all these crazy shows back in the day, and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right".

Big money makes way for the close midterm elections for the House of Representatives
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th district receives large sums of money as a result of a two-district tie-up, with two congressmen vying for the same seat.
This newly redistricted Pittsburgh suburb is creating problems for Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another special election last spring.
Lamb is running against another incumbent congressman, Republican Keith Rothfus, who now represents Pennsylvania's 12th district, which overlaps heavily with the new 17th.
The maps were re-drawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old district had been unlawfully set up in favor of the Republicans.
The fight for the new 17th district has sparked a financial battle between the major party committees, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after narrowly winning a high-profile election in March's special election for Pennsylvania's 18th district.
The seat has been in Republican hands for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political commentators give the Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States considered punishing El Salvador for supporting China, but changed its mind
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing with little protest from Washington.
Trump had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until partners kicked Trump's leadership out.
State Department officials decided to recall top U.S. diplomats from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama following "the recent decision to no longer recognize Taiwan", State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But it was only El Salvador that was punished, and they got about $140 million from the United States in 2017, for things like drug control, development and financial aid.
The proposed penalties, which include cuts in financial aid and restrictions on entry permits, would have been painful for the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder rates.
As the internal meetings progressed, North and Central American officials postponed a summit conference on security and economic development, which was to continue last year's meeting, which was seen as a step toward preventing immigrants from coming to the United States.
But in mid-September, top officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place anyway, dropping any consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is scheduled to address the conference in mid-October to send a signal of the importance Americans place on the meeting, diplomats said.
And the three American envoys secretly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without further harsh demands or penalties from Washington.
A spokesman for Bolton at the White House declined to comment on the details of the case, which were described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who would like to discuss internal considerations if they remained anonymous.
Their descriptions were confirmed by an outside analyst close to the administration who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Know the Story
The next hurdle could well be Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report on Trump's possible obstruction of the investigation, for which there is considerable and publicly available evidence.
Mueller is also reportedly going to focus his investigation on whether the Trump campaign secretly collaborated with Russia on the election attack.
If Congress were to be re-assessed, Trump would likely be held accountable as he prepares to meet again with voters and, in time, a jury of his peers.
There are many uncertainties, and I am not saying that Trump's final outcome is inevitable, nor is it the case with his European counterparts.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we all have to make choices that will affect how long the fight will go on.
In 1938, German officers were ready to launch a coup against Hitler if only the West could resist him by supporting the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and did not seize the opportunity to avoid the year-long bloodbath that followed.
It is around such turning points that the axis of history turns and the inevitable march of democracy increases or decreases.
In the United States, we are now facing several of these turning points.
What do we do if Trump fires the man who determines the future of Mueller's investigation, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein?
Rosenstein's seat has been hot since this newspaper was able to report that he had last year proposed making secret recordings of the president and challenged his suitability for the office.
Rosenstein says the Times's account is inaccurate.
"How do we react if the FBI's recently sought-after investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is halted or not properly conducted? Or if he is admitted to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and perjury?
And, more importantly, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, it will be a long winter for democracy.
But because of what I learned in Prague, I believe we can do it.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied the homeland of my embassy.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later sent me away to light Sabbath candles on the garden cross table.
How can I not be optimistic with that in my luggage?"

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers is optimistic ahead of the match against SK Rapid Wien
Rangers face SK Rapid Wien on Thursday, and after the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, a win over Austria will give them a good chance to advance from Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his debut before the 2-2 win over Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use the result as a springboard to something even bigger.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal is a good team", said the 31-year-old.
"We went to the game thinking we could bring something home, and we got a point.
Maybe we could have taken the stake home, but all in all, I think it was a reasonable outcome.
They were probably the best in the first half, but we came out in the second half and were the best team.
Thursday is another big European night.
We're hoping for three points, but it's going to be difficult because they had a good result in the last game, but with the crowd behind us, I'm sure we can put pressure on them and get a good result.
The last year has been tough because of all the things that have happened with my injuries and the changes at the club, but the mood is good now.
The team is great, and the boys are really enjoying it.
Hopefully we can go on now, put the last season behind us and have some success".
Anxiety over retirement savings makes women sleepless
Although the participants had a firm idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few talked about it with their family.
About half of the participants in the Nationswide survey said that they discussed the costs of long-term care with their spouse.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
"Most people want a family member to take care of them, but they don't do anything to start the conversation", says Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationswide's life insurance business.
That's how you get started.
Talk to your spouse and children: You will not prepare your family to care for you if you do not tell them your wishes in time.
Use your counsellor and your family to discuss where and how you would like to receive care.
Ask your financial adviser: Your financial advisor can also help you figure out how to pay for expenses.
Long-term care can be financed by traditional long-term care insurance, cash-based life insurance or self-insurance from your own resources  as long as you have the means.
Get the legal paperwork in order: Get the legal battles in motion.
Get a power of attorney so that you can have a trusted person handle your medical treatment and ensure that doctors and nurses comply with your wishes in case you are unable to communicate yourself.
Consider also a financial power of attorney.
If so, you appoint a trusted person who can make financial decisions and see to it that your bills are paid if you cannot afford it yourself.
Remember the small details: Imagine that one of your aging parents needs medical attention urgently and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medications and allergies?
Get all these details down on paper so you're ready.
"It's not just a question of the economy. Who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What medication?
Who's watching the dog?
Get the plan in place".
Man shot multiple times with an air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot multiple times with an air rifle on his way home from a city tour.
The victim was in his 40s and was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, midsection and hand.
Police describe the shooting, which occurred around 2:30 a.m., as "completely random".
The victim didn't see the perp.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and police are calling for witnesses to come forward.
Earthquake and Tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, authorities said, expecting the death toll to rise.
As communications have been cut off, emergency workers have been unable to receive information from Donggala Regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude quake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the earthquake struck.
Here are some facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi province and is located at the bottom of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, which had an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami hit.
Donggala is a regency that stretches over more than 300 km of coastline on the northwestern part of Sulawesi Island.
The Regency, which is an administrative region under a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the mainstays of the economy of Central Slavonia, especially in the coastal area of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but takes place mainly in Morowali, which is on the coast opposite Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the past 100 years, according to Indonesia's disaster center.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
In 1996, Donggala was again hit by a tsunami that killed nine people.
Seismologically, Indonesia is on the so-called Ring of Fire of the Pacific Ocean and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Some of the largest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years have been:
2004: A powerful earthquake on the west coast of Aceh province in northern Sumatra, Indonesia, triggered a tsunami on December 26, affecting 14 countries and killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, including more than half of those in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 earthquake struck south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that swept toward the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra Province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5 earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra, triggering a 10-meter tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A superficial earthquake hit the Pidie Jaya Regency in Aceh, spreading destruction and panic as the population was reminded of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time, no tsunami was triggered, but more than 100 were killed by the collapsing buildings.
2018: A powerful earthquake struck the tourist island of Lombok, Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's oldest son charged with domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested for assault.
29-year-old Palin of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstruction of domestic violence reporting and resisting arrest, according to the report released Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, he took the phone from a female acquaintance as she tried to report the alleged crime.
Palin is being held in custody at the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility on a $500 bail without security, KTUU reports.
He was arraigned Saturday, where he pleaded "clearly not guilty", the network reports.
Palin is charged with three Class A misdemeanors, which could result in a prison sentence of up to one year and a $250,000 fine.
He's also been charged with a Class B misdemeanor, which carries a maximum penalty of one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time Palin's been charged with criminal mischief.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the assault.
The case is currently pending in the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstruction of reporting of a domestic violence crime and possession of a weapon while intoxicated in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of punching her in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans groups after explaining her son's violent behavior with PTSD as a result of his deployment to Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: several hundred dead
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The quake measured 7.5 and triggered a tsunami that destroyed hundreds of homes.
The area is without electricity and communications, and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck just south of central Sulawesi, which is northeast of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
Videos circulating on social media show the moment when the earthquake hits.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach party in the city of Palu when the tsunami made its way to the coast.
Prosecutors are trying to get a New York City terror suspect sentenced to the rare death penalty.
Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, suspected of the New York City terror attack that killed eight people - a rare punishment that was last handed down for a state crime in 1953.
In October, 30-year-old Saipov allegedly used a rental car from the Home Depot construction market to carry out an attack on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, where pedestrians and cyclists who got in the way were crushed.
As a basis for the death penalty, the prosecution must prove that Saipov "deliberately" killed the eight victims and "deliberately" caused serious personal injury, as required by the death penalty declaration in the Southern District of New York.
According to the court document, the death penalty is a possible outcome of both of these charges.
Several weeks after the attack, a state jury was able to present Saipov with a 22-count indictment, including eight counts of murder in connection with gang activity, typically used by public prosecutors in organized crime cases, and one count of assault and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "comprehensive planning and preparation", the prosecution said, describing Saipov's execution as "horrible, vicious and depraved".
'Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused personal injury, bodily harm and loss of life to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco,' the declaration of intent reads.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the last time the Southern District of New York raised a defendant in a death penalty case.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers but was sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last death sentence was handed down in a New York state trial in 1953, when Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being convicted of spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov was a native of Uzbekistan and, according to court documents, showed no signs of remorse in the days and months following the attack.
According to police, he told investigators that he was comfortable with what he was doing.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack by watching ISIS videos on his phone.
He also asked to have the ISIS flag hung on his hospital room, the officers said.
He has pleaded not guilty to all 22 counts of the indictment.
David Patton, one of Saipov's public defenders, said that they were "of course disappointed" by the prosecutors' decision.
"We believe that the decision to pursue the death penalty and not accept a confession and life imprisonment without the possibility of parole will only prolong the trauma for all involved", Patton said.
Saipov's defense had earlier asked the prosecution not to pursue the death penalty.
Conservative minister thinks Nigel FARAGE should take over the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the people's army" during a demonstration at the Conservative meeting today.
The former UKIP leader said politicians had to "feel the pressure" from Eurosceptics after one of Theresa May's own ministers said Farage should take over the EU negotiations.
The Liberal Democrat MP Peter Bone told the Birmingham demonstration that Britain would have "been out now" had Farage been the Brexit negotiator.
May's challenge to bring the deeply divided party together is underlined by the presence of Conservative Remainers at a separate anti-Brexit demonstration in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep his compromise plan on track amid attacks from both Brexiteers, Remainers and the EU.
Her allies insist that despite the setback, she will continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels , forcing Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package or "chaos".
At the Leave Means Leave demonstration in Solihull, Bone announced that he would scrap the Chequers plan.
He explained that Farage should have been included and given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was in charge, we'd be out by now", he said.
The Wellingborough minister added: 'I will fight for Brexit, but we must scrap Chequers.'
Regarding the background of his opposition to the EU, he said: "We did not fight world wars to be subordinate to anyone.
We will make our own laws in our own country".
Bone rejected any change in public opinion since the 2016 vote: 'That the British people have changed their minds and want to stay in the EU is completely wrong.'
Conservative Brexitist Andrea Jenkyns was also at the demonstration and told reporters: "I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The Chequers plan is unpopular with the general population, the opposition does not vote for it, it is unpopular with our own party and with our activists who are actually on the streets and getting us elected.
Now, stop checking out the Chequers, and start listening.'
In a pointed remark to May, she added: 'Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises.'
Farage told the rally that politicians should be able to "mark the pressure" if they fail to follow the 2016 vote.
"Now it is a question of trust between us  the people  and our political class", he said.
"They will betray Brexit, but we are here to tell them that we will not let them get away with it".
In a message to the enthusiastic audience, he added: 'You must make sure that the political class, which is about to betray Brexit, feels the pressure.
"We are mobilizing the people's army here in the country that gave us the victory in Brexit, and we will not stop until we have become an independent, self-governing and proud Britain".
Meanwhile, Reds marched through Birmingham before a two-hour march into the city centre.
Scattered activists waved Conservative Against Brexit banners after the group's breeding this weekend.
The Commission has not yet decided whether to accept the amendments.
"These are the people who claim to have control over the IT systems and technology for Canada, for border control, for free trade without borders in Ireland", he said.
"It's totally ridiculous.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit,' he added.
Warren is "considering strongly" running for president
House of Representatives Senator Elizabeth Warren "is seriously considering running for president" after the November midterm elections.
According to the Boston Globe, the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future at a council meeting Saturday in western Massachusetts.
Warren, who has often been critical of Donald Trump, is set to seek re-election in November against state Republican candidate Geoff Diehl, who was co-chairman of Trump's Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
There has been speculation that she would challenge Trump in 2020.
The Holyoke meeting Saturday afternoon was her 36th meeting with voters at City Hall since Trump took office.
One of the participants asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren replied that it was time for "women to go to Washington and repair our political system, and that requires a woman on the front lines".
Arrest in the LSU Sims shooting.
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced Saturday that a suspect was arrested Friday in connection with the shooting death of Wayde Sims, the LSU basketball player.
Baton Rouge police announced that 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson had been arrested Friday for an ET news conference at 11:00 a.m.
They had released a video of the shooting on Friday to ask for help identifying a man in the footage.
20-year-old Sims was shot and killed near Southern University early Friday.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head and died from his injuries", police chief Murphy J. Paul said, according to 247sports.
Wayde stepped in to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and confessed to being present, possessing a weapon and shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and is now in the custody of the East Baton Rouge Police Department.
Sims was a 6-foot-3 junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, and last season, he played in 32 games, starting in 10, and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is close to the World Championship, after team orders give him victory over Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified against Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the Mercedes team's orders would play a decisive role in the race.
From the lead, Bottas got a good start and was close to completely knocking Hamilton off when he defended his position in the first two turns and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel drove into the pits first, and left Hamilton to fight the traffic at the back of the field, which should have been decisive.
The Mercedes went into pit a lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton came back ahead when the Ferrari driver reluctantly had to leave the track after a double defense at turn three.
Max Verstappen started from the back row and was seventh after the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then led for much of the race, when in an attempt at a quick finish he failed to change tyres to take Kimi Raikkonen's fourth place.
He had to pit in the 44th inning, but could not increase the pace in the last eight laps, which is why Raikkonen secured fourth place.
"It's a tough day because Valtteri did great all weekend and was really a gentleman when he let me come by.
The team did an incredible job of securing both first and second places", said Hamilton.
Really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally Saturday for insisting she had not leaked the letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
At a West Virginia election rally, the president did not directly mention Ford's testimony before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead said that the events in the Senate showed that people were "malicious and disgusting and dishonest".
"The one thing that could happen, and the beautiful thing that's happened in the last few days in the Senate, is when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and mean and disgusting and dishonest", he said.
"When you look at the statements and the leaks, and they say, "Oh, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me".
Do you remember that?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak it?
Remember her answer... was it you who leaked the document?
No, no, no, I'm not going to.
I haven't leaked anything".
Wait, just a second.
Have we leaked... no, we haven't leaked anything", he added in a mock-up of the senator.
Feinstein received the letter about Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh back in July, and it was leaked earlier in September, but Feinstein denied the leak came from her office.
"I have not covered up Dr. Ford's allegations, and I have not leaked her story", Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
"She asked me to keep the letter confidential, and I have done so".
But her denial was not well received by the president, who said during Saturday's vote: "I'm telling you, that was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen".
During the president's continued defense of the nominee for the Supreme Court, who has been accused of sexually assaulting three women, Trump suggested that the Democrats use the allegations to advance their own cause.
"They are not afraid to use any means in their efforts to regain power.
You can see the viciousness, the abominations, they don't care who they have to drum to get power and control", the president said, according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars against the Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars made a comeback after losing Friday's Elite League game to the Belfast Giants by winning the comeback match 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants quickly took the lead with two goals from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied the score at home before Dwyer again put the Giants ahead.
Francois Bouchard equalised for Dundee, before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory with two more goals.
It was the third Elite League defeat of the season for Adam Keefe's side, who came from behind to beat Dundee 2-1 in Friday's game in Belfast.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
Dwyer put out in the fourth minute at 3:35 from an assist by Kendall McFaull with David Rutherford as assist, as Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In a busy first period, Sullivan brought the home team back into play at 1:10 p.m. before Matt Marquardt was behind the Cownies' tiebreaker at 3:16 p.m.
Dwyer led the Giants at the first break, scoring his second goal late in the first period.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard again equalized with a nice goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran worked together to help Nielsen lead Dundee to the lead for the first time in the game late in the second period, and he secured the victory with the team's fifth goal halfway through the final period.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their five games, are home in Milton Keynes for their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controllers died to ensure that hundreds of airline passengers escaped earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller is being hailed as a hero after he died to ensure that a plane carrying hundreds of passengers landed safely.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a major earthquake hit Sulawesi on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue to ravage the area, and many are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Although 21 year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung's colleagues fled for their lives, he refused to leave his seat in the hovering control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He remained in his seat to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was holding at the runway, was safely airborne.
He jumped out of the control tower because he thought it was going to collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
According to Australian ABC News, spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia Yohannes Sirait said his decision may have saved hundreds of lives.
We obtained a helicopter from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"We are devastated", he added.
Authorities fear the death toll could reach several thousand, and the country's disaster preparedness agency says access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is restricted.
"The death toll is expected to rise because there are still many bodies in the ruins and it is not possible to reach them", said spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves as high as 20 feet have devastated Palu, which is holding a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are flying in aid and supplies.
The 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, told Sky News: "Every minute a new ambulance comes with more bodies.
There is a shortage of clean water.
All the shops are looted".
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is working hard to help the survivors, but we don't know what we're going to find.
It is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse".
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask you all to work around the clock to complete all evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" he said, according to CNN.
Indonesia was hit by an earthquake in Lombok earlier this year, killing more than 550 people.
Air Niugini now says one man missing after plane crash in the lagoon
The airline behind the plane that crashed into the Pacific Ocean lagoon in Micronesia now says one man is missing, although it had previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew members had been evacuated from the sinking plane.
According to a press release, Air Niugini said it was unable to locate a male passenger on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and police to try to find the man.
The airline did not return requests for further information on the passenger, such as age and nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water during landing at the airport on Chuuk Island.
Officials said Friday that seven people were rushed to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in hospital as of Saturday and were all in stable condition.
It is still unclear what caused the crash and the exact sequence of events.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both say the plane landed in the lagoon in front of the runway.
Some witnesses believed the plane flew past the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane landed on very shallow water.
"It was really lucky", Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that he and other passengers were able to swim to safety to reach the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He said the crew panicked and screamed and that he had a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors working on a nearby quay also helped in the rescue work by using a rubber boat to carry people ashore before the plane sank to a depth of about 100 feet [30 m].
Data from the Aviation Safety Network show that 111 people have died in accidents involving PNG-registered airlines over the last two decades, but that Air Niugini has not been involved in these accidents.
Analysts are setting a timeline for the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecution concluded its evidentiary hearing Saturday in the indictment of a man accused of burning a woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as an expert witness in data analysis.
He described to the jury how he used wiretap data to piece together the course of the 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said he obtained location data from several cell phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, contradicting his earlier claims, according to The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was close to Chambers' cell phone at the time he claimed he was with his friend Michael Sanford, police visited Sanford.
Sanford sat in the witness box on Saturday and told me he was out of town that day.
When the prosecutor asked whether Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "lying because my truck was in Nashville".
Another discrepancy was that Tellis said he'd known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Cell records show they'd only known each other a week.
Rowlett said that at some point after Chambers' death, Tellis had deleted Chambers' text messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He erased her from his life", Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its proceedings on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the jury to vote later that day.
The High Breed: What is political hip hop?
A hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative view of the genre by giving their music positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol believes hip-hop has moved away from its origins with political messages and social issues.
They want to go back to basics and make political hip-hop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have recently had a revival in the UK thanks to artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
New York nanny sues couple after firing them for "racist" texting
A New York nanny is suing a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a text message by mistake from her mother who complained that she was "still a black person".
The couple denied being racist, but compared the lawsuit to "blackmail".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed her horror at finding out that the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, was black when she showed up for her first day of work in 2016.
"NO, NOT A BLACK PERSON", Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she ended up sending it to Giselle Maurice, even twice.
When she discovered her mistake, the "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman fired Giselle Maurice, saying that their former African-American nanny had been bad at her job and that she was expecting a Filipino instead, according to the New York Post.
Giselle Maurice was paid for her one day's work and sent home in an Uber.
Now Giselle Maurice is suing the couple for compensation for the dismissal and for $350 a day for the six months she was supposed to live with the family, even though this was agreed upon without a contract.
"I want to show them that you can't afford to do something like this", she told the newspaper on Friday, adding: "I know it's discrimination".
The couple have defended themselves by saying that they are not racist and that the firing of Maurice was justified because they were afraid that they would not be able to trust her after having offended her.
"My wife had come to send her something she would not have said.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists", Joel Plasco told The Post.
"But would you leave your children with someone you had been rude to, even if it was by mistake?
Your baby?
I mean it".
Plasco likened the lawsuit to "blackmail", and that his wife had given birth two months earlier and was in a "very difficult situation".
"Do you really go after someone like that?
It's not very friendly,' the investment adviser added.
Although the trial is still ongoing, the People's Court has already written off the couple on social media and shamed their behavior and logic.
New letter reveals Paddington publishers feared readers couldn't relate to a talking bear
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was published, said of the letter: "It is hard to imagine being the one who reads it for the first time before it was published.
It's quite fun to read now, knowing how popular Paddington became".
She said her father, who worked as a cameraman at the BBC before he was inspired to write the children's book about a little clothing boy, would have been optimistic even though his story was rejected, and that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was "bitter-sweet" after his death last year.
She describes Paddington as a "very important part of our family" and says that her father was modestly proud of his success.
"He was a quiet man, and he didn't like to brag", she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it felt almost as if you had a child who had achieved something: you were proud of them, even though it wasn't really your merit.
I think he saw Paddington's popularity that way.
"Even though it was his work and his imagination, "he used to say it was Paddington's fault".
Saying goodbye to my dying daughter over the phone.
After the landing, her daughter was taken to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to say that it was really bad and that she probably wouldn't survive", said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad, saying that she would die in the next few minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
So I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, my dear.
I'll see you soon.
I'll see you later.
The medication she had been given to keep her heart going was slowly losing its effect.
She was dead a few minutes ago, and now the body's shutting down.
I just had to sit there and wait for it to happen.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to try to get my act together".
Finally, mourning Ednan-Laperouse boarded the plane with the other passengers, who had no idea what she was going through.
"No one knew", she said.
"I bowed my head, and the tears continued to flow.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane, I had an overwhelming sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her".
Mourning women trying to stop suicide jumpers
Two women who have lost relatives to suicide try to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have put up a map on a Welsh bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers to get help.
Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he got depressed, and 18 when he killed himself.
"I don't want any parent to experience the grief I experience every day", she said.
Sharon Davis, 45, said her son was a promising chef with an infectious smile.
"His smile was known to all.
People said his smile lit up the room".
He stopped working before he died, though, because he was really bad.
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old brother found him after he killed himself.
Sharon Davis said, "I'm always afraid of it spreading".
Sharon Davis made the cards to "tell people that there's someone out there that you can contact and talk to, even your friends.
Don't go with your thoughts yourself. You have to talk to someone".
Sharon Davis' longtime friend, Kelly Humphreys, lost her boyfriend of 15 years, Mark, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say anything about being sad or depressed or anything", she said.
"A few days before Christmas, he began to change.
He was really down on Christmas Day, and when the kids opened their presents, he didn't have any eye contact with them".
She said that his death was very traumatic for them, but that they had to get through it: "It has created a hole in our family.
It's torn us apart.
But we all have to keep going and fight".

Brett Kavanaugh's future remains uncertain as the FBI begins its investigation.
"I thought that if we could actually get something like what he asked for  a time-limited study with a limited scope  we might get a little bit of agreement", Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee "had fallen off the rails" amid the tightly-partailed situation.
Why wouldn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to do their investigation?
Their reluctance is due to the timing.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away, November 6, and if the Republicans do not fare as they expected, they will be weakened in their efforts to get the man they would like to have elected to the highest judicial office in the land.
George W. Bush has been calling senators to get them to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Bush and through that met his wife Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI finishes their report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It remains to be seen whether Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would give Vice President Mike Pence the deciding vote and elect him to the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean defectors 'drops' under Kim Jong-un
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean lawmaker.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from South Korea's Ministry of Communications, said there were 1,127 drop-offs last year compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Park said that tighter border controls between North Korea and China and higher numbers due to human trafficking contributed to the changed numbers.
Pyongyang has not made any official comments.
The vast majority of North Korean defectors are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
The South Korean government says that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the Korean War ended in 1953.
Most are fleeing through China, which has the longest border extending to North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily guarded demilitarized zone between North and South Korea.
China considers the defectors to be illegal immigrants and not refugees, so they are often forcibly repatriated.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are technically still at war, have improved markedly over the past few months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss the stalled nuclear disarmament negotiations.
This follows the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed to work towards a nuclear-free Korea at an overall level.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions for the failure to make progress.
"Without trust in the United States, there is no faith in our national security, and under such circumstances, it is out of the question that we will disarm on our own", Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he's unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said his temperament was not suitable for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi's comments came in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman had behaved like that, she would have been called hysterical", Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied the allegations that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
In his opening remarks, Kavanaugh was very emotional, and when he talked about his family and his high school years, he almost cried and started to cry.
He also denounced the Democrats in the committee, calling the accusations against him "grotesque and a coordinated show of character" orchestrated by the left who were angry that Hillary Clinton did not win the presidency in 2016.
Pelosi said she thought Kavanaugh's testimony proved he couldn't sit on the Supreme Court because it showed he was biased against Democrats.
"I think he's disqualified himself with his statements and the way he went after the Clintons and the Democrats", she said.
Pelosi is sidestepping when asked if she'd try to bring Kavanaugh to a federal court if he's confirmed and if the Democrats get a majority in the House.
"I would say that if he doesn't speak the truth to Congress or the FBI, he's not fit to sit on the Supreme Court, but certainly not in the court he's sitting on now", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently sitting as a judge on the Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions in Obama's health care reform or abortion case Roe v. Wade because he is considered a conservative judge.
During the hearings, Kavanaugh did not answer questions about whether he would reverse certain previous Supreme Court decisions.
"It shouldn't happen that a hysterical, biased person has to contest a judging job and expect us to say, 'Oh, that's not just great,'" Pelosi said.
And women have to use it.
It's a just outcome, months and years of anger, and she can't get it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry", Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's abnormal. Do you think it is?"
She continued: "I got great support from a woman who was a manager, who said that she also cried when she got angry, but that she developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and started crying, she would say to the person she was talking to, 'You might think I'm sorry because I'm crying.
But I'm mad".
And then she just kept going.
And I thought it was genius".
Tears are allowed as an expression of anger, in part because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my most vivid memories is of one of my first jobs in an office with an overweight male population, where I often cried out in anger, where I was grabbed by the neck by an older woman - a cold boss, whom I had always been a little afraid of - and dragged down the stairs.
"You must never let them see you cry", she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They'll think you're sorry, and they'll accept that they got you".
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Hart was exposed for having an affair on a boat called Monkey Business and withdrew as a candidate, Schroeder was really frustrated and came to the conclusion that she might as well run for president herself.
"It was not a very well-thought-out decision", she told me, laughing, 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the running and they certainly didn't need another candidate.
Some called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".
Because it was late in the campaign, she was behind on fundraising, so she promised she wouldn't run unless she raised $2 million.
The battle was lost beforehand.
She discovered that some of her supporters, who gave $1,000 to men, only gave her $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she thought.
When she gave a speech about not running, she was overwhelmed with feelings - gratitude for the people who supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and reach out to voters instead of voters, and anger at sexism - that she got a lump in her throat.
"You'd think I was having a nervous breakdown", recalls Schroeder of the press reaction to her.
"You'd think I was sponsored by Kleenex.
I remember thinking, what are they gonna write on my headstone?
"She cried?"
This is how the US-China trade war could benefit Beijing
The opening voices of the U.S.-China trade war were loud, and although the battle is far from over, the divisions between the countries may be beneficial to Beijing in the long run, experts say.
US President Donald Trump fired the first warning shot earlier this year by imposing tariffs on key Chinese exports such as solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest escalation this week with new tariffs affecting goods worth 200 billion dollars will apply in principle to half of all goods imported into the United States from China.
Beijing has retaliated each time, most recently by imposing tariffs of 5-10% on US goods worth 60 billion dollars.
China has vowed to follow the United States all the way, and the world's second-largest economy is unlikely to give in just yet.
If it makes Washington back down, it means they're giving in, but for Chinese President Xi Jinping, it would be too embarrassing to bow to the United States.
Experts say, however, that if Beijing plays its cards right, the U.S. pressure in the trade war could have a positive effect on China in the long run by making the two markets less interdependent.
"A quick decision in either Washington or Beijing could pave the way for an economy that could spiral out of control in both countries, and it's actually much more dangerous than you thought", said Abigail Grace, a research fellow focusing on Asia at the Center for New American Security.
Syria 'ready' to take in refugees, says foreign minister
Syria says it is ready to accept the return of refugees and is asking for help to rebuild the country, which has been devastated by more than seven years of war.
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in the country were improving.
'Today the situation is more stable and secure thanks to the successful fight against terrorism,' he said.
The government continues to control areas devastated by terrorists and is working to restore normalcy.
All the conditions are now in place for the refugees to return to the country they were forced to leave because of terrorists and the unilateral economic sanctions that affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
An additional six million people still in the country are in need of emergency aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government was willing to accept help to rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that the government would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that had helped support the insurgency.
Europe secures victory at the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup and beat the American team 16.5 - 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris.
The United States has now lost six straight times on European soil and has not won a single Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the trophy when Captain Thomas Bjørn's team reached the 14.5 points it took to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who struggled for most of the tournament, shot his drive into the lake at par 3 on the 16th hole, causing him to lose the match to Francesco Molinari.
Italian Molinari performed well in all rounds and became the first of a total of four players to go 5-0-0 since 1979, when the current format of the tournament began.
American Jordan Spieth was sent off with 5&4 by the lowest ranked European player, the Dane Thorbjørn Olesen.
World number one Dustin Johnson fell two to one to Ian Poulter of England, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
The eight-time Ryder Cup veteran, Spaniard Sergio Garcia, became the tournament's leading European with 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a rough year.
I'm very grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I'm really happy to get my trophy back.
It is a team effort and I am happy to have been able to help,' said an emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He sends the torch to his compatriot John Ram, who defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in a singles match on Sunday.
"I'm incredibly proud to have beaten Tiger Woods, I followed him as a kid", said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a Ryder Cup record of 13-21-3.
That's a funny statistic for one of the greatest golfers of all time, who's won 14 major titles, surpassed only by Jack Nicklaus.
The American team struggled all weekend to find the form except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who had a solid game throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk said after his team's disappointing performance: "I'm proud of the boys, because they fought for the cause.
There was still time this morning when we countered Europe.
We lost.
Hats off to Thomas.
He's an excellent captain.
All 12 of his players played really well.
We're gonna regroup, and I'm gonna work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee, and then we'll move on.
I love those 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
You gotta lighten up on the hat.
We were defeated".
Algae bloom updates: concentrations are decreasing in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows that there is a general decline in algae concentrations in parts of Tampa Bay.
According to the FWC, there are reports of widespread blooms in the area around Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier  suggesting that the concentration is decreasing.
The algae bloom spreads along a 210-mile stretch of coastline from northern Pinellas County to southern Lee County.
There's a slight upwelling about 10 miles off the coast in Hillsborough County, but it's less than last week.
There have also been observed blooms in Pasco County.
Medium to high concentrations in or at sea in Pinellas County during the last week, low to high concentrations in the offshore waters of Hillsborough County, background to high concentrations in Manatee County, background to high concentrations in or at sea off Sarasota County, background to medium concentrations in Charlotte County, background to high concentrations in or at sea off Lee County and low concentrations in Collier County have been reported.
Breathing difficulties are still being reported in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
There have been no reports of respiratory distress in northwest Florida in the past week.
