The Prague Stock Exchange at the closure of the market had a negative collapse.
After the collapse of the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange has restored the losses.
The CEZ stock transactions have reached almost half of the current daily trade.
Since the beginning of Tuesday, the Prague Stock Exchange has recovered from the fall of the day before it was almost 6%.
Behind this decline there is the collapse of the shares in Wall Street.
So, also from us, we show a market reaction to the result of the vote of the House of Representatives in America, which refused to support the local financial sector stabilization plan.
The collapse of actions in Asia
On Tuesday, the Asian Stock Exchange shares experienced a dramatic collapse, although the indices, however, during the day later deleted some of the losses.
The Hong Kong Stock Exchange Hang Seng Index during the day dropped almost 4%, but later a portion of losses stabilized to 2.5%.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index, which follows the movement of Chinese shares at the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, dropped by 3.8% while in Shanghai markets were closed.
The Sydney Stock Exchange shares lost more than 5%, but at the end the losses fell to 4.3%.
The Thay-Wan Stock Exchange, according to the local index, dropped by 3.6%.
“The planning of the rescue action is uncertain and this will affect the financial markets around the world,” said the head of the Hong Kong Currency Office, Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong, despite being part of China, manages its own financial policy, thus without depending on the Central Bank.
Hong Kong has interest rates at the same level as the United States.
The US lawmakers, according to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, should quickly return to the dialogue and approve the proposal for financial support.
Otherwise, there is the risk that other countries will also suffer consequences.
Statement of American actions
The U.S. Parliament on Monday rejected the financial system support plan, for which $700 billion (approximately twelve billion Czech crowns) had to be allocated.
The lawmakers ignored President Bush’s call to support the plan.
According to Bush, the plan would solve the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
The U.S. shares on Monday experienced a strain and the main shares recorded the biggest collapse in more than a twenty years.
The Dow Jones index dropped by 7% and a collapse of this size was last observed in 1987.
The index was down before the vote, but as soon as it was seen that the draft law was not approved, it went into free fall.
The U.S. government can allocate $700 billion to the banks.
The highest representatives of the American Congress and President George W. Bush’s government agreed on a broader form of an agreement on economic support for the U.S. financial system.
The vote will be at the beginning of the next week.
U.S. lawmakers broke the ice in the dialogue on the approval of the rescue plan in the form of economic aid to the U.S. financial system for a total of $700 million (approximately twelve billion crowns).
But it is not yet said.
The representatives of Congress, therefore, must define some details of the agreement before publishing the final form of the law and voting for it.
The financial system support plan will be discussed on Monday in the House of Representatives.
This was told Reuters on Sunday by Barney Frank, the chairman of the Chamber’s Banking and Financial Services Committee.
The Senate, according to some sources, could vote on the plan probably not before Monday.
According to the economists, the announcement that the approval of the financial plan should be the first and fundamental psychological factor capable of awakening the financial markets.
But there will be a return to reality due to the complexity of the mechanisms with which, in practice, the aid of the markets will be achieved.
The plan must be effective.
“We made a big step forward.”
“We have clarified our different opinions about the form of the presentation of the market stabilization package,” said Democratic Nancy Pelosi to Bloomberg.
The final vote may take place on Sunday.
The delegates of the lawmakers met the night between Saturday and Sunday with the U.S. finance minister Henry Paulson, to give a definitive shape to the government’s funds.
These funds should serve to acquire from financial companies non-creditable mortgage assets, which lead financial companies to serious losses and put the stability of the entire system at risk.
“We are at the fulfillment of the final agreement of the plan that will work and that must also be effective on the market.”
“It is necessary to continue the recovery plan, but I think we’re there,” Paulson said.
Signal for Asian Trade
The global financial crisis raises strongly on the stock markets that are suddenly collapsing.
According to the Democratic Senator of Nevada Harry Reid, the legislators are trying to reach a definitive agreement in Congress even before Sunday.
They want to calm investors before trading on the Asian financial markets, which are, in time, the first to influence the Monday market following Congress's decision.
But for now it is not definitely clear when the two American Congress Chambers will vote for the law and even if negotiations will be able to stop at the last moment on some problem.
The lawmakers hope that it will be approved in the coming days.
But the law will still undergo many changes.
The total amount for the system support must be divided into two parts.
The first $350 billion should be available as soon as possible, as President George Bush asked.
But Congress can block the allocation of the rest of the amount in case it will have the impression that the program does not perform its function, blocking the next $100 billion and after the final 350.
Bush appreciated the progress in negotiations.
Although the President can veto this decision, Congress can overcome its right to veto.
Despite these changes, the basic thought of the program has remained,that is to get the funds to buy passive mortgage values, whose price is collapsed due to hundreds of thousands of Americans who are unable to pay their mortgages.
“We processed everything.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the law Sunday and the Senate Monday," the Republican senator said.
U.S. President Bush is also satisfied with the progress in negotiations.
His spokesman Tony Fratto said Bush was pleased with Saturday’s positive progress and appreciated “the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy.”
Restriction of the Golden Paracadute
Senate banking committee chairman Christopher Dodd, the main spokesman, said that the legislators agreed on the responsibility of the financial program, the protection of taxpayers from losses, the closure of the budget of the reductions, the fractioning of the financial plan.
The new law should also limit the so-called gold paracaduces for the leaders of the companies participating in the program and is creating a committee that will control the funds.
These should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
“We’ve worked very hard and we’ve made a big step forward towards the agreement that will work and will be useful for the market and also for all Americans,” Paulson said.
The plan is about helping the owners of the houses who have problems with payments.
The government should negotiate the new rates of the mortgages it will buy with the aim of lowering monthly expenses on the rates for debtors and will allow it to hold their homes.
Marek: Psychological support
The proposed plan is, according to Patria Finance’s chief economist, David Marek, a good idea but its implementation will be very difficult.
And that's why we don't know how and for what price the problematic assets will be purchased.
This will be decisive for how the losses will be divided between them the financial sector and the government," said this week Marek for the site iHNed.cz .
If the plan is approved right now or early next week, it is not so fundamental, according to Marek.
More importantly, it is that the representatives of the Congress have already reached an agreement on supporting this plan and that they will baptize it as soon as possible.
The psychological meaning of this agreement that will be approved is at this time the most important,” Marek emphasized.
Duel to the Last Blood: MP3 Reader vs Mobile
We will advise you how to choose
While almost every mobile phone can read MP3 files, no MP3 player can call.
This makes it clear that it is better to buy only the phone.
There are many reasons to get a self-reader.
The choice depends entirely on the way of use and the needs of the future owner.
Per you will hardly buy a costly high-quality track to listen to Maxim Turbulenc’s latest album.
First of all, these musical products do not come out as LP and from a quality point of view there is not even an objective reason for this.
However, if you have hard-rock, jazz, or blues vinyls on your shelves, you’ll probably dream of a row like this.
It also works with portable music, i.e. compressed music or simply in MP3 format.
There are also prices and quality categories.
For some it may be unacceptable to spend for a reader 8,000 crowns, as well as a Pink Floyd fan may hardly digest the twentieth crowns of the market.
Two extremes among which there is enough space for everyone.
The choice is wide.
It is the duration of the battery.
Some high-quality music reader can do much more than just reading music, but what the cell phones do not even for mistake.
There is no other current device as universal as the mobile.
In addition to the primary functions, calling and sending sms, you can read music and videos, record both and have a camera, sometimes better and sometimes worse and maybe you can even browse.
And if we consider smartphones and palmars you will also have a miniature computer in your pocket.
It’s a small miracle that no refrigerator can make the grid and no television can photograph anything.
The universality of the cell phone also brings disadvantages.
More functions you use on the cell phone and first the indicator on the screen will require the charging.
Reading music consumes a lot of energy.
A few cell phones can read music for more than twelve hours, usually, and much less.
In this sense, music readers (especially the simplest) are much more effective.
When it comes to cheap cell phones don’t count that they can last for more than a few hours.
If you still add us, from time to time, some calls, get to work for security another charging machine, this also applies to the most expensive devices.
But you won’t have this problem with a MP3 player, even the worst last at least 9 hours with continuous functionality with a recharge.
Another problem is when you download music on your cell phone.
Unfortunately, only a limited portion of devices have the universal USB port and not all of them can be connected to the computer without a special software.
Certainly the music can be recorded directly on the memory card, but only a few memory readers are able to do it without an adapter for the minicards that are not used in mobile phones.
The readers, except for some exceptions (iPod) do not need any special software.
Just fill the device with music via USB from the computer.
Most mobile phones and readers create themselves a multimedia library ordered by the names of the interprets, the name of the album, the gender or by the user’s classification.
Some devices only play the tree structure of the maps, similar to the Explorer tool in Windows, and some know how to do both things (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
Readers are easier to manage, cell phones can do more.
When choosing a particular device, you are especially interested in the battery resistance, memory capacity, quality and type of audio outputs and clearly the ease of use.
If the music serves you primarily as a background and if you listen to it every day just briefly on the tram you will have a cell phone that read MP3.
This can be done on any mobile phone.
You don’t have to worry too much about what formats the cell phone or reader recognizes.
MP3 players support them all, the global majority of the music that comes to you will be in this format.
In addition to this format that belongs to the most common, the total majority of devices supports music in WMA format.
There is less the AAC (format used by the company Apple and its iPods).
Better cell phones also allow, for example, to buy music online.
Just visit, through the mobile internet network, the corresponding pages of the operator (or another provider) and buy the song or album.
This same service could already be a valid topic for buying a mobile-readers.
Unfortunately, the offer of the operators is poor and is usually limited only to hit of the time of the radio.
The prices are not very low.
But it is generally assumed that this way of selling music (whether through GSM, internet or wireless internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people always wear their cell phone behind.
Anyone who wants to listen to some fruit in the pocket while the MP3 player remains forgotten at home.
But it also depends on this, if you always carry behind the couch or at least the wireless headphone.
If not, you can use the integrated player that almost every cell phone, but only a small portion of MP3 reader has.
Per the greatest advantage of mobile readers will be, for many, the price.
The cheapest ones usually cost less than 3 thousand crowns.
For 3 and 4 thousand crowns you will already buy a very decent walkman.
Usually, however, you will be limited by the absence of an entrance for the common headsets.
The best and technically more equipped and even with the 3.5mm capture for common headsets, cost up to 15,000 crowns.
Instead, the advantage of the readers is, in addition to others, the easy managing.
The simpler ones are not necessarily cheaper (see our choice) it really makes anyone to handle them.
The minimum of functions, the similarity of manageriality once with the common stereo or the giradish, is obvious.
There is no danger of mistaken the launch of the mobile internet network and consequently a giant bill for data transmission.
What equipment to take
Even the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for interchangeable memory cards (M2, microSD, etc.).
Also when it comes to the purchase of the corresponding card, enter into the 2,000 crowns.
But be careful
Basic models support only cards with a maximum capacity of 2GB.
Only the most expensive can do so with 8GB memory cards.
If you already have a mobile phone and you want to buy a cheap MP3 player, take Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
According to the capacity (max. 2 GB) you should not spend more than 1 100 crowns.
If you are one of the most demanding listeners you prefer to take the specialized cell phones - walkman (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have individual keyboards for MP3 and the convenience of service so you get closer to the same MP3 player.
In this field has made more way Sony Ericsson, which walkman line cell phones have the same scale of use as MP3 readers sold separately.
The MP3 players of the above-mentioned brands provide you with the same service and the same price category up to 4 000 crowns, but with a greater memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery strength (commonly 15 hours, in line up to 35 hours).
The first virtual operator will reach the Czech Republic from this year.
Maybe
Per the mobile phone market in the Czech Republic is quite mature and our operators offer almost all services as their partners in Western Europe.
There still is something missing – a virtual operator that obliges the traditional to lower the price.
It may not be missing for a long time.
The fact that Czech operators belong to the most expensive in Europe we have already written many times on Mobil.cz.
In the end, it has also been confirmed by ČTÚ, which noted that the price of SMS is higher from us than in the rest of the Union.
After the European Commission’s latest steps in the field of roaming rates regulation, a paradox situation may be created – for some Czechi mobile operators customers, SMS will cost less from abroad than at home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic remain so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, the lack of competition that would really want to start the fight .
It may sound absurd, also there we have three mobile networks and coverage much above 100%.
Instead, mobile telephony operators like to laugh at the fact that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this sense often emphasizes the head of the Czech Telecommunications Council (ČTÚ) Pavel Dvořák, who in the past some times expressed that there is no place for another operator in the Czech Republic.
It’s true that the traditional operator with its own network probably no longer has many possibilities. (the rest might be difficult now to find other frequencies).
But there’s still another option – the virtual operator.
Just the entry into the market of virtual operators led to a remarkable decline in prices, to which traditional operators would then have to react.
At the same time, even before the entrance of bears such as Tesko Mobile and Virgin Mobile to the market, sounds similar to us sounded in Britain.
However, it has been shown that the place for such operators exists and that they can really succeed.
At the end of the examples we don’t have to go too far.
In February of this year we informed you of the arrival of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
In just a half year this operator has managed to acquire more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest local operator.
At the same time, behind Mobilking is the financial group Penta to which in the Czech Republic belongs, among others, U:fon.
The advantage of virtual operators is the ability to focus on a much more concrete group-setting.
To be able to operate effectively, there are many fewer customers enough than a traditional operator.
It is not behind, that is, relatively high costs for the creation, operation and maintenance of the mobile network.
So in the world virtual operators usually present at a low cost, offer calls and SMS at a low price, which is often in balance with the most restricted service offer.
Thus, for example, Tesco Mobile in the UK offers SMS that costs at least half compared to its competitors.
But as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows can be a fairly good move even the bet on a group-setting not recently.
This operator targets to say so specifically about men.
“Real men choose the Mobilking operator that they like and that they can trust,” says David Seibertz, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company that produces this virtual operator.
It’s hard to say if you can also say a similar concept from us as in Poland.
Miroslav Čepický, a spokesman for Vodafone, said: “The Czech market is relatively small for a fragmented approach, on which the majority of virtual operators are based.
Moreover, from the point of view of services it is relatively saturated.”
In the Czech Republic there is no possibility, said mobile network operators
But it seems almost certain that if there will ever be an operator in the Czech Republic it will not be the Mobilking.
“We’re talking about the expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic negotiations don’t have many expectations.
The expansion of Mobilking will take place rather in the other countries of our area," said in a telephone dialogue for Mobile.cz Jana Studničková, the press spokesman of the financial group Penta.
So he indirectly confirmed that the current operators in the Czech Republic are definitely not very favorable to this thought.
Instead, they try to do everything because you don’t create any potential competitor.
For a while it has not hidden its interest in the launch of a virtual operator, the GTS Novera group that would like to take another step to become a real competitor of Telefónika O2 in the field of business customers.
“We have a great interest in being able to offer our customers not only fixed services but also mobile telecommunications.
First it is better.
We have repeatedly negotiated this possibility with all Czech mobile network operators.
We’ve already managed to progress in negotiations with some of them,” said Pavel Kaidl, a spokesman for the group.
Maybe better times will come.
From non-official information it turns out that the first virtual operator will probably have it by the end of the year.
For now, around its creation there is an impenetrable wall of silence.
“At this point we don’t believe that in the Czech market there is room for the creation of a full-time virtual operator.
The Czech market, unlike other markets, is very specific.
Until now, no subject with a complex and serious project has addressed us," he said in his statement to Mobil.cz Vlastimil Sršeň of the press section of Telefònika O2.
The specificity of the Czech market is also applied by other operators.
T-Mobil’s press spokeswoman Martina Kemrová adds in a rare agreement with the O2 statement: “For now we have not noticed any vital and profitable commercial project for both, on which it is possible to continue to build.”
And he adds: "On the T-Mobil network will hardly appear a virtual operator by the end of the year.
At this point we have already had to have a concrete agreement on the table, so that it could be considered at the horizon.”
Vodafone focuses on achieving its 3G license requirements.
Miroslav Čepický adds: “We are open to the negotiations of potential virtual operators, especially in the field of expenditure and infrastructure sharing.
We consider this, from the point of view of customers, the most productive.
Vodafone’s main strategy in this field is to find a partner to build a common network for fast mobile internet.”
The competent authorities – with the complex operators
The attitude of mobile telephone operators can be easily understood, the entrance of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would lead to a decrease in prices and thus a decrease in profits.
Why then facilitate the rise of such a competitor?
The trouble around the creation of U:fon testifies that when the operators hold a thing they know how to remove from the same side.
There is a great pressure on ČTÚ during the creation period of U:fon towards the company of T-Mobile.
This is testified by public access information from the website of ČTÚ.
But now just U:fon serves as a topic for which not accept the virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová noted: “The competitive environment of the mobile phone market has been slightly enhanced above all with the entrance of the fourth mobile operator to the market.
As for the type of mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that the entrance of another competitor would put high demands on him and, above all, on his services.”
However, the attitude of mobile telephone operators is quite surprising the complete disinterest by the Czech regulatory bodies.
It is not just the attitude of the ČTÚ that unfortunately in the Czech Republic – unlike Britain and other developed countries – has no competence to interfere with economic competition.
It belongs exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (ÚOHS).
This, however, has taken its typical position.
The entrance of the virtual operator to the mobile market would be possible after the conclusion of the necessary infrastructure rental agreement between the mobile operator and the virtual operator was made.
No such contract has been concluded so far because the offer of potential buyers probably has not been interesting enough for traditional operators,” said Kristián Chalupa, of the UOHS Foreign Relations section, in response to our question.
A such statement by the representatives of the operators may not be surprising.
Instead, by the office that must defend the interests of consumers and on the other hand take care of the fact that no one takes advantage of its position on the market, it is more than a delicate deal.
Especially when Kristián Chalupa adds: "Outside where virtual operators commonly operate, we can notice that their entry into the market has contributed to the lowering of prices for mobile phone services."
But of course the pressure on the proper functioning of the market environment and the lowering of prices do not belong to ÚOHS interests.
Really shocking in the whole situation is the almost exciting harmony of these three operators resulting from their reactions.
The question of whether it really is only a coincidence, comes by itself.
Just as the same price of the gasoline for all gasoline is the result of coincidence and competitive struggle.
“The section has not found signs of anti-competitive behavior regarding this fact and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
No operator has a dominant position, so it has no corresponding greater responsibility for its behavior on the market.
The necessary tools for the opening of the mobile network market for virtual operators may also lack the telecommunications regulator,” Chalupa said in a statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of the many controversial points.
Of course, there is the analysis of the relevant markets developed by ČTÚ, according to which telecommunications are the only market from the point of view of economic competition.
In such a market, of course, no Czech operator has a dominant position.
But some legal experts offer another approach – for the creation of a virtual operator, the agreement of the network operator is always necessary.
And the mobile operator has – finally logically – the monopoly of its network.
So for a certain portion it must be dominant by force.
But even if we don’t admit this argument, for ÚOHS it should be a minimum warning that three mobile operators proceed in such strangely similar way.
At the same time, the complaints by the stakeholders (including the mentioned company GTS Novera) show that during negotiations with all operators they encounter very similar obstacles.
Download responsibility to ČTÚ in telecommunications is a fairly common trick with which ÚOHS keeps out of the whole business.
We have seen this in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, it failed to promote the expansion of the rights of ČTÚ in the field of economic competition in telecommunications until the update of the telecommunications law recently approved, despite the fact that, from this, many experts expected the improvement of the situation.
This fact the representatives of ÚOHS must know more than well, but their interests are elsewhere.
It can be done when no one looks.
While we are not aware of it, the functioning of such pseudo-virtual operators remains, some of which even exist in Czech mobile networks.
These are companies that publish their prices lists of mobile telephone services which are public only partially.
These are usually companies that deal with multilevel marketing.
So for example Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and a number of others offer their own mobile phone services.
The pricing lists of these companies usually reach only the predefined people.
The magic lies in the fact that the company facing the operator appears as a classic business client, which orders a large amount of SIM card.
As a major customer then receives special (and other) price offers.
The problem is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile telephone operators prohibit a similar prohibition.
"If the cases you are talking about were presented, which we will be interested in, it could be a violation of the contractual conditions, and it could lead to the conclusion of cooperation with that company," said Martina Kemrová.
But it is quite unlikely that such an activity will not reach the ears of the responsible subjects of mobile operators.
Especially in the cases of the 3 mentioned companies you can deal with thousands of customers.
No operator defends himself from such a attitude at the same time.
From the activity of these companies they thus draw a non-indifferent profit and at the same time – unlike real virtual operators – they are not damaged in any way with their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický warns of possible problems: “Law allows such speculations, but only a negligible percentage of customers use the services of these companies.
They must also accept that the SIM card in their phone is not registered on their behalf, so they cannot have it in full as the usual customers of mobile operators.
But this should be a little strange thing to the CSTU.
In addition, another issue is opened for UOHS.
If mobile operators close their eyes to such a attitude, why do they block the creation of the virtual operator?
It is necessary to add that ÚOHS has strong rights enough to disguise similar activities and if it does not want it will not have to be satisfied with the explanation of the operators who do not have an idea of all this and that their business conditions prohibit it.
When it is no longer expensive
As in the text has been said several times, the entrance of virtual operators to the mobile market has led to a significant drop in prices for services.
At the same time, practically in all countries where traders were born, traditional traders tried more or less to prevent their creation.
The topics they used were practically identical - market too small, the limit too saturated, problems with the quality of services, etc.
But in developed countries in these cases the regulatory bodies have intervened to defend not mobile telephone operators but their customers.
Both with formal measures and with non-formal pressure, then he came to the creation of the first virtual operator and others came to him.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory organs throw the whole case from one to the other as a boiling potato.
For our experience, we cannot get rid of the feeling that the unclearness of the skills in these cases makes it more than comfortable.
Do not throw the sponge.
If the retroscene information is correct and the virtual operator will really soon appear from us, the Czech mobile market will return to the motor.
If one of the operators had agreed to the creation of a virtual mobile operator only hardly ÚOHS could remain impassible to the rejection (discrimination) of other stakeholders.
And we may stop calling at higher prices than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech hymn has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four new versions of the Czech national hymn.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek on the occasion of the Day of recognition of the Czech State presented in a solemn way the new recordings of the national hymn "Kde domov můj".
The new recording of the hymn was made by the National Theatre Orchestra under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions available – single with the male or female voice, step of coro and instrumental edition.
The song is directed by Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the hymn reviews are Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček.
On the iHNed.cz site you can listen to all four versions.
Bělohlávek considers the Czech national song one of the most begli inni.
He has already told the radio "Český rozhlas" that he has chosen specifically to sing the variants alone, singers with the most representative young voices, which are expressive and popular.
"From the beginning I tried to take care that both and even the coro, have the clear phrase, that the text is well understood, that they are in harmony," he.
The National Hymn will celebrate its 175th anniversary next year.
The song "Kde domov můj" was played for the first time in 1834 on the stage of the Stavovskéh divadlo in the original opera Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetán Tyl accompanied by the music of František Škroupa.
It has acquired popularity and people have spontaneously made it theirs.
The first strip of the song after the founding of the 1918 Czechoslovakia then became the natural part of the national hymn.
It remains one of the seven national symbols even after the birth of the Autonomous Czech Republic.
How the “new” inno sounds
The MHD Wednesday in Prague will accompany you for the first time also with an electronic card
Wednesday 1 October 2008 will be written in the history of the Prague Transport Company as the date when in the metro, tram and bus will come the first passengers who instead of the paper ticket will have an electronic ticket in their pocket.
At the moment it can be purchased by about a hundred thousand people who own their own Opencard card.
Passengers can buy the 30 and 90 days and yearly (which will last from 1 January 2009) and at the same time make their card recharge at the Infopoint and the Transport Company offices and at the metro stops Museum, Můstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
The cuts can be purchased since yesterday on the website of the Transport Company www.dpp.cz.
More than 400 customers took advantage of the service before the afternoon.
Those who will start using the service via the internet can completely forget the stalls in the metro stops where so far they had to make long files for paper tickets.
The cutting is purchased via the internet and on the Opencard it is reloaded on one of the twelve subsidiaries of the Municipal Library.
“In these places, passengers have a pack with staff format that will help those interested in online purchases and will also record on their card the credit acquired,” said project spokesman Martin Opatrný.
In addition to the libraries you will be able to load the electronic cuts on the Opencard in bancomat and selfservice that are installed at the metro entrances.
How are these banks?
They are red, they look like the tickets obliterators and passengers have already noticed them at the metro stops of Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"There are now five in the city, but by the end of the year there should be eight," Opatrný concluded.
The cutting will be controlled instead of by the driver from the bancomat.
The bankomat service that will work from tomorrow is very simple.
Just enter the Opencard card and before paying the cutting, you will be charged above.
The electronic teller will be valid from tomorrow not only in the capital but also in its surroundings.
That is, in the urban train and bus lines from the number 300 to 499, that the inhabitants of the municipalities of Central Bohemia take to reach the capital.
“In the trains added to Prague’s integrated transport there are the controllers equipped with card readers with which they verify time and zone validity,” explained the method of checking the tickets Filip from the organization Ropid, which sets up the time of Prague’s collective transport.
Urban buses have the card readers integrated into the driver's box.
During the climb is therefore necessary not only to show the magnetic card to the driver, but also to support the Opencard at the determined point next to the box.
Thus, the driver verifies the validity of the charged cuts.
"If the passenger needs to check the validity of the charged cuts, there is nothing easier than asking the driver this type of information," Drápal added.
Passengers taking the urban buses and will not remember, when the cutting validity expires, can again go to the self-service bancomat, where the cuts are charged on the card.
Here you will see the information about the validity of their documents on the screen of the device.
Sudanese Germans Require a US Referendum
The Sudanese Germans in 1945 demanded the inclusion of Šumava to the United States.
This follows from the letter deposited in the Southern Bohemia Scientific Library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live at least under the patronage of the United States.
With this desire, according to what is said, some groups of Sudet Germans turned to the President of the United States in 1945.
This results above all from the letter stored in a private archive and now deposited in the Southern Bohemia Scientific Library.
The Germans of Český Krumlov ask in the letter to the U.S. President not to allow the return of the “Shumava district” – occupied by Hitler under the Monaco agreement – to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation and we want to be sure of the promises that American units will arrive on German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," the letter signed with the words "The people who keep the fate of Šumava with all their heart."
Since, they say, the annexation to Czechoslovakia – knowing the Czech national character – gives the Sudet Germans hope only to brutality, lack of concerns, incomprehension, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter pray the American president to take over the protectorate on Šumava now and forever.
“We can’t believe that without concern for the opinion of a quarter of a million inhabitants, you would recognize this territory as a state foreign to us, which oppresses and radicalizes ethnic minorities and has not contributed for nothing, just for nothing, to the victory of the Allies,” it writes in the letter.
The reason why the authors can’t sign it is the alleged fear of the thirst of revenge by the “Czech oppressors.”
If the President of the United States had to doubt the German conviction of Šumava, it would be enough to organize a referendum in the district on the will of its inhabitants to become part of the United States or live under the domination of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may seem naive with our knowledge of the post-war history, according to some witnesses it properly describes the expectations of the Sudet Germans at that time.
Although the Czech Germans had to minimally realize that it would be their displacement from the Republic, only a few of them fully admitted such a possibility.
Some expected the United States and Britain to negotiate a kind of autonomy for the Sudanese peoples.
Others thought they would simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is also confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice.
He was mobilized during the war as a German of Budějovice in the Baltic Sea maritime power.
When at the end of the war he was captured by the British and placed in the prison camp in Holštýn, dozens of other Czech Germans went to find him so that he taught him the Czech.
"These believed that once he returned home the Czech would make him comfortable," Chalupa said.
None of the German prisoners, who lived in Czechoslovakia during the war, according to him, counted on the fact that on the basis of the decrees of Beneš they would be moved from the Republic.
Don’t think – you’ll pay.
The emotional campaign will attack the drivers
The most expensive action in Czech history focused on road safety.
It is also possible to define the emotional media campaign, which the Ministry of Transport intends to launch on Wednesday.
The office of Minister Aleš Řebíček, expects that this will disconnect drivers from a dangerous behavior on the wheel.
The 150-million campaign will appear on television, radio, cinema, the internet but also on the wheels.
It should disappoint drivers from driving fast and under the influence of alcohol on the wheel.
And remember them also to put the belt before leaving.
It wants to touch in consciousness especially young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and not for the last professional drivers.
What will appear in the spot?
Especially stories of people that will affect emotions.
And this is the witness of the “bloody” slogan of the entire campaign:
Don’t think – you’ll pay.
The word “do not think” is written majuscule on the sheet.
And in a pocket of blood there is the word "I will pay".
This must symbolize that a person can in a moment of distraction pay with his own life.
The spots will "touch" the spectators until 2010.
The ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where you can commonly see images with dramatic scenes of the victims of accidents.
It is promised to reduce the number of accidents and deaths on the Czech roads.
The spot was prepared by the Euro RSCG agency.
Carrot and baston to the drivers
“With the drivers the carot and baston system works.
The carrot for them is for example when they pass with the red and thus they save time.
The stone is the danger of a fine or an accident.
It is necessary to remember the risk to the drivers, "says the psychologist of the Ministry of Transport Martin Kořán of the Na Homolce Hospital.
And therefore we need information campaigns in the press and above all negative advertising, the psychologist believes.
According to him, the panels that warn drivers of danger are already less effective.
"If the fixed panel that warns of danger has been installed, it will probably soon confuse with the environment and the drivers will not pay more attention to it, " warns Kořán.
Olmert would return almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace.
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert has expressed his favour for the return of almost all the territories occupied in 1967, i.e. the borders of Jordan, Eastern Jerusalem and the Golan heights, in exchange for peace between Palestinians and Syrians.
This is what the newspaper Jediot Achronot said in the dialogue published on Monday.
"We have to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all (occupied) areas, if not all," Olmert told the newspaper.
“We will land a certain percentage of these territories but to the Palestinians we will have to leave the same percentage (of the Israeli areas), because without this there will be no peace,” he added.
He admitted that the possible return will also include East Jerusalem.
“Whoever wants security in Jerusalem and above all does not want the rubber or the spy to pass through it, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up a part of Jerusalem,” Olmert noted in the scene of the two July attacks in the city, during which some people were killed and dozens of people were injured.
According to the prime minister it will be necessary to find "a particular solution for the temple mountain, the sacred and historic places," which are inside the Old Town.
“Whoever wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the whole city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work,” he also emphasized.
Retreat from the Golan Heights
Olmert also spoke for the withdrawal of Israel from the Golan heights, which he believes is the essential condition for the conclusion of this peace agreement with Syria.
But that would also require some effort from Damascus.
“I do not propose the conclusion of peace with Syria only on the basis of the withdrawal from the Golan,” he warned.
“The Syrians know what they will have to give up to get the Golan heights.
They will have to give up the current relationship with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with the Hezbollah (the Shiite movement); they will have to give up the permanent support, which they offer to the terrorism of Hamas, (the Shiite movement) of Al-Qaeda (the terrorist network) and Jihad (the holy war) in Iraq,” he said.
Question after the accident: Are stewarders in buses illegal?
The law does not recognize them, you can’t walk on the bus that takes long distances.
In the context of the tragic accident near the Italian city of Padova, the Student Agency bus was out of question whether the steward and passengers can move on board the bus during the race.
“If we want to comply with the laws strictly and formally, the steward’s activity is in conflict with the law of road traffic,” said transport ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka.
The incident last week with which a 22-year-old hostess died was caused by a truck that cut the road to the bus.
The girl, unfortunately, was sitting next to the driver at the less secure place in the bus, although there were still two more seats assigned.
But the bus can cause an accident or brake suddenly even when you distribute coffee or newspapers.
It depends on whether the bus is equipped with or not standing seats according to the traffic booklet.
If it is not approved, passengers must be sitting.
The buses of the Student Agency have no seats, the company’s director Radim Jančura confirmed on the Aktuálnĕ.cz website.
“We assessed this with the Ministry and at the beginning did not allow the passengers to move on the bus.
After it was revoked and we concluded that passengers can use the bathroom during the race if they have the place assigned," he expressed his point of view.
The law does not recognize the steward.
“There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of the steward – no law concerns the regulation of this role.”
However, no regulations prohibit the carrier from performing the services.
The road traffic law only recognizes the vehicle’s accompanying term, its rights and duties are not defined,” said spokesman Hanzelka.
The director of the Department of Road Traffic of the Ministry of Transport Josef Pokorný instead believes, that the law cures enough this issue.
It depends on whether the bus has approved stands.
It’s all there,” he says.
Categorize buses in urban places where there are stations and maximum speed limited, interurban with stations with maximum speed higher and long trail without stations with maximum speed permitted and seats equipped with safety ceilings.
As in the aircraft, the expert says.
The BESIP road safety expert Jaroslav Hořín does not find the bottom problem in the steward movement on board the bus.
“In a quiet race there are not so many dangers, the situation can be compared to the service on aircraft.
Even there is not safe when a turbulence arrives and the flight assistant can beat his head.”
“If the bus makes a sudden brake obviously values the laws of physics.
Like in the city bus or tram.
The carrier must resolve the safety of the steward with an internal regulation," he says and also means that, from the point of view of the law, the problem is not solved.
Jančura is willing to suspend services.
The Student Agency is the only transport company that offers the services of the steward.
This employs about two hundred.
The director does not even consider their job dangerous after the accident.
“As soon as I feel that I have to consider the steward’s profession as a dangerous job, I will abolish it.
Passengers can receive coffee and newspapers as they depart.
It will also reduce costs,” he says.
The director of Asia Alexej Litvin, who manages a fraction of lines compared to the Student Agency, motivated the absence of steward on its means as an interest in security.
“We don’t have any hostess, we’re opposed from the beginning.
Sooner or later it will end with a deadly accident," said less than a year fa Týden.cz.
There was an enormous tragedy.
In the crash of the line to Naples, a young hostess from the region of Plzeň, who had worked for the company for two years, died.
A Slovene truck probably came out of the emergency route without using the flame and blocked the road to the bus.
The driver of the bus tried to avoid it with a sharp maneuver, but he scratched it with the right front.
Jančura refuses the fact that the two seats reserved for the rest of the stewart were occupied.
“It’s not possible to book these seats in long-track buses, they’re unlikely.”
The company intends to denounce the truck driver.
The agency will not wait for the court's judgment to pay the damages to the girl's family, but it expects a financial compensation from the guilty.
The revision of the law?
Not in sight
The revision of the law, on which a group of 30 transport ministry experts have worked for more than a year, could lead to clarification of the stewart movement on board buses.
“They did not any concrete results.
They don’t consider them so much by the buses, they take more care of the score system, maximum speed on the highway and use the cell phone during driving,” says expert Hořín.
“The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of the stewart as a major threat to the safety of passengers,” with this concludes the spokesman Havelka, that the safety control of the buses is the competence of the police and security offices.
The hopes of Düsseldorf point on Frankfurt
It is not missing the passwords in the letter of the director of the WestLB addressed to the house employees.
In the letter published on Monday that could form "the capital market center of the financial group of savings" through the unit meeting of the Düsseldorf banking institution with the Deka-Bank of Frankfurt.
The West LB would launch a “competent block” with lasting profits in such an enterprise.
Moreover, a whole such union could be a decisive boost for further bonds in the country’s banking sector.
Thus it is read, when a board in difficult times wants to demonstrate the ability to act.
Because the WestLB afflict is still under strong pressure.
Not only by the EU Commission, but also through the National Agency for the Financial Supervision Service, having noted a long time ago to the regional government of Northern Renania - Westphalia that time strings to seek a future solution.
There are many different types of cookies that can be used for the purposes of our website, such as our website and our website.
He at the end of August the head of the Deka-Bank Franz Waas at the presentation of the first half of the year that a merger of the house at Via Magonza with a national bank such as the Helaba or the West LB has no sense.
But the Deka's administrative counsel, which is half brought by regional banks and consortiums of savings, delegated the board to conduct talks with the West LB on common contracts.
It could be market negotiations or parts of them.
However, the conversations have, as they say in the business square, just started.
The Deka-Bank, with its 3000 employees is one of the most counting on the business square in Frankfurt, is not the first time that it is about consolidating the sector of savings.
In 2003, for a short period, it seemed that the Deka-Bank could merge with the regional bank of the Renania-Palatinate and the Helaba.
Three of them did not do anything.
As soon as the projects were published, the regional bank of Asia was opposed to Helaba’s participation.
The remaining two institutions were also unable to reach an agreement.
The regional bank of the Renania-Palatinate went to the regional bank of Baden-Württemberg in Stockholm.
However, we have often thought about a merger of the Deka-Bank with regional banks.
But at the end Günther Merl, the chairman of the Helaba board, spoke against design games to meet with his house.
Remember that it seems that you create the cognitive, that it is necessary that you approach the different houses of the public sector.
Since the elections to the Bavarian Parliament have passed, there may first be a meeting of the Bavarian Landesbank with that of Baden-Württemberg.
This is not a good news for Helaba.
If the pressure increases for other mergers, the partners will be missing.
In the South now there would be the junior partner, although so far it has overcome the financial crisis much better than houses in Monaco and Stockholm.
The Assia-Turingia savings association, which participates with 85 percent of Helaba, has put the catenax to the meeting with the WestLB.
It will only be the NordLB.
These geo-strategic reasoning are just a account.
On the other hand, there is also the question of how the different business models of the individual houses are combined.
In June, Merl noted that the decisive question, with which business model the future of the regional banks would be secured, would not yet be answered by the German Savings Fund Association.
In the end, the division of the West LB could also come out, which is of course not desired.
Thus, the letter of the Board of Directors expresses the willingness to pursue in any case a “general solution”.
We will see how the reunification of individual parties with the Deka-Bank will work.
The second weekend of the beer festival is dedicated to the Italians.
It’s the first time for Elena, while for Luca it’s the third or fourth.
This time Elena is present to the party as a companion, and so says that everything is different.
Behind them next to the 5l barrel of the Kaiser brand stands a massive barbecue and shows about 200 travellers what the deep tones it is able to produce from the throat.
Elena first gave Luca a pack and after a kiss.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From here to the bus parking next to the station of Porta Nuova, they depart this evening at 23.45 four corridors with destination Monaco, Festa della Birra" , arrival scheduled at 6.30.
Three corridors are reserved primarily for Italians, in another only Brazilians travel.
In one corner of the parking lot, the South American are singing with the flag in hand, having already celebrated during the night.
It’s so noisy, says Marco, that it’s not something for the Italians.
Mark who carries a long cap with a false skin fist and a couple of glasses with the wide silver stick belongs to him the buses.
For 5 years they go to Octoberfest, this year there are 3 tours.
The night goes, day to the party, returning at 22.30.
“Pernotting would only create unnecessary expenses,” says Marco.
The cost of 45 Euro includes the trip, the welcome of the brindis with the Kaiser beer, made according to the rules of Bavarian authenticity, the illness cash and the German guide – Marco attended a German course in Frankfurt.
And so at night the buses depart around the Brennero.
There is no beer yet.
The silence falls in the bus, and the passengers sleep.
They will still need their strength.
They stop in Bressanone and Holzkirchen, where other Italian buses on the A9 highway before Munich take a short break.
When, as planned, the Marco group arrives at 6.30 p.m. at the parking near the Theresienwiese, there are already about 50 more buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco explains for the last time the attack program.
First, put the yellow chapel.
On it on the left there is written "Oktoberfest" next to the internet address of the travel agency of Marco: "Conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Second: "When the doors of the beer tendon open, it means running!", Marcus quotes early in the morning.
Run and occupy the seats at the bottom of the tent.
“Not in front, but we block, and not all the yellow bears sitting on the same panks, divided into the active space!”
The price is 8.25 euros, says Marco.
And don’t forget to give the hand.
Show the security service that we behave well!
As soon as you leave the places, they disappear!”
I think it’s a good thing to do, but I think it’s a good thing to do.
They are already going to the party.
On the road one attacks as follows the yellow bears to the trees, to the road maps and even to a advertising map of a large Bavarian popular party.
He wants to be ready to beat the withdrawal.
It is the second weekend of the festival, known as the “Final Week of the Italians”.
There are no accurate data, we talk about 50 thousand, who depart to cross the Alps and invade the tendons, it is claimed that 10% of the visitors come specifically from Italy.
The police of Monaco is strengthened with 7 agents of the High Adige, Italian volunteers support the Bavarian Red Cross, which makes a statistics on nationality, where the Italians are in the first place with 200 medical care before the English (about 60 medical care) and the Austrians (about 80).
The most popular is the Hofbräuhaus tendon.
I think it’s a good thing to do, but I think it’s a good thing to do.
The German banking system is relatively stable, Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück confirmed last week.
It is good that the politician has used the word "relative" and has also pointed out that the German banking sector is not saved from critical developments.
The crisis began in the weekend.
The real estate funder Hypo Real Estate, noted in the DAX, gets a billion loan from a consortium of German banks, to be able to protect itself from turbulence on the markets.
A situation expert told Reuters on Monday that support credits would reach 35 billion euros.
The Hypo Real Estate must only pay the interests for the requested part.
Money comes from both private and public banks.
At the end there are the losses of the Depfa affiliate.
The state funding, according to a newspaper article, has refinanced itself in the very short term – which is no longer possible due to the market uncertainty.
In the first half of 2008, the bank’s reserves had decreased by 95% over EUR 2.37 million, and the share of its capital also dropped from 1.6 to 1.45.
Current revenue and net revenue from financial transactions had fallen to 0 compared to last year, the revenue from increases of both requests and certain actions as regards the liquidation of credit deposits fell more than 70% over the 5 million euros.
Only thanks to higher revenue from the reimbursement of subordinate compensation costs that come from both the restructuring of the former Depfa group and the reimbursement of interest according to the single text of the tax laws and the management of business for entrepreneurial consortiums, the negative profit was quite moderate with about 16%.
The former public funding after being privatized in 1990 had lost himself in the speculation with commercial real estate loans, which were deposited in the Aareal Bank.
Since the income in the classical state financing was too low, Depfa has engaged more in infrastructure projects and in financing joint projects of private and state investors (PPP) and has diversified internationally.
The Hypo Real Estate now has to amortise the value of the affiliate, which will have a fundamental material effect on the group’s profits and losses.
The dividends have been cancelled.
In 2007 the number was reduced by 2/3.
The Hypo Real Estate after the absorption of Depfa is a major funding of the state and infrastructure.
It is more dependent on refinancing on the market among banks compared to other institutions, because it does not have customer trust deposits.
Due to the collapse of the U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago the credit concession between banks largely dropped, because banks accumulate liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate annually requires for a part of Depfa’s credit portfolio – about 50 billion. – short-term refinancing means.
According to the notice of Hypo Real Estate the financial need of the group has been covered by credit for a certain period of time and the company is protected from the influence of the mostly unfunctioning international monetary markets.
From other sources it feels, that thanks to the money the refinancing is insured until the end of 2009.
The Chairman of the HRE Board Georg Funke on the contrary said that the HRE group will not need the currency markets in a short time.
The Bundesbank and the National Agency for the Financial Supervision Service (BaFin) are based on the fact that the HRE Group’s commercialability is still secured.
This is expected for the shareholders and creditors of the bank.
In view of the dynamics and immeasurability of the crisis, there will be no guarantee.
The funding may not be fully used.
The opposite is also not to be excluded.
After Sunday night the bank as it learned it was about to fail, the momentary rescue failed to calm the souls.
The stock rate collapsed by 75% over 3.30 Euro.
They are very well arranged by the classmates.
While previous degree debts are almost unmounting, they give up the postponed credit courses.
It’s a good idea for you to be able to do it, but it’s a good idea for you.
In the first instance, the HRE moves seemed to be a speculative alternative investment, now their valence must, after the strengthening of the crisis of the banks and the institution itself, that with Depfa’s relevance the crisis has occurred, be considered dependent on the stability of the international financial system.
Until the central banks, governments and the least damaged banks are still ready, you can rely on an amortisation of the annuities within the deadline.
Or it comes into operation, what no one can expect – that the financial crisis will be overcome within the next 15 months.
But concerned with the information shrinked due to partial statistics the almost certain probability has become a justified hope.
It will especially create long-term investors some untouched nights with the decision to divide from their commitments.
Short-term investors may conclude the return of losses for future payments of the compensatory tax on plusvalues.
Sylvana and the Secrets of Bento-Box
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16 years old, the first day of school should present themselves to the Tachibana High School, the girls begin to rediscover: The German is completely "kawaii"!
What does it mean?
Sylvana knows the word already from Mangas-in the new log of exchange tells about Japan.
First day of school in Japan
How excited they were.
I also had the FIFA to go to school.
I live on the margins of Tokyo to Kawasaki and I need 40 minutes by train to get to the Tachibana High School.
I had to find the road alone and fortunately I didn’t miss it.
The beginning of the first hour of lesson does not seem to have been fixed as by us in Bassa Sassonia.
The schoolchildren arrive from 8 p.m. to 8 p.m. until a short conversation with the professor, the so-called “home room” begins.
But before I started the lesson, he touched me presenting me.
I am not the guy who speaks volunteerly in front of people, in addition in front of a class of 40 schoolchildren.
Since I didn’t have the school uniform yet, I put on my old host mother’s gonna, along with a shirt, blue socks and black leather shoes.
So dressed I put myself in front of the cathedral and tried to pronounce well: "Sayonara Wo she Sylvana..."- my name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and I celebrate my birthday within a week.
At that time I was very pleased that I had already started learning the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class dressed, laughed and made a sign and continuously I heard the word "Kawaii".
I knew it from my mangas.
It belongs to the essential lessic of Japanese girls to survive and means "sweet, sweet".
Then I ran quickly to my place.
The girl next to me swallowed, for her it was an honor to be sitting next to an exchange school.
The rest of the hour of lesson was continued quietly, but when he played the gong, I was caught in the true sense of the word.
Everything spoke disorderly and they laughed and drowned me with questions – then it’s really hard to understand the English of the Japanese.
During the break, everyone opened their blessing.
My host mother also made me the basket for lunch – it’s different from the boring German bread.
I had resounded with spices, salsicines, cetriol and algae salad, fruit and a kind of involtins with meat and tofu..
I don’t even know exactly what I eat in Japan.
Things look strange and have a completely new taste.
The fact is, that everything is really good.
It’s a good thing to do, but it’s a good thing to do, and it’s a good thing to do.
Bento is not just lunch in Japanese schools.
It happens sometimes that a girl gifts a Bento made by herself, prepared quite artistically, with the hope then to make the boy's acquaintance during the recreation.
I read it in my manga comics.
I am very curious if I can find out.
"Why exactly Japan?", my friends asked me when I told, I would like to go to school for a year in Japan.
I have always said:
“Why it fascinates me”
I have been reading Mangas for years.
And to better understand the comics and the culture they contain, sooner or later I began to learn a little Japanese.
I was completely convinced to come here once.
I am also fascinated by traditions, uses and costumes.
We have a lot here.
On the one hand, Japan is a place of technology and latest trends – on the other hand: strict, disciplined and traditional.
Because everything is well organized, I’ve never felt lost, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I’ve ever seen in my life.”
Rats also have feelings.
A mouse or a snake escapes when they feel the danger.
Neurologist Joseph Le Doux is convinced that even many animals have feelings.
But how could it happen if, when they behave in our same way, they have our same feelings?
On the Internet newspaper "Edge" for a few years articles of famous scientists have been published.
SPIEGEL ONLINE in a series presents selected answers to the question: "What do you think is true, without being able to try it?"
I believe that animals have feelings or other states of consciousness, without that I or anyone else has so far been able to prove it, since we cannot even prove that other men have consciousness.
But in this case we must at least hope, that all human brains have the same basic configuration.
As soon as we turn to the other species and ask questions about the feeling or the consciousness in general, we enter into an unpraktikable territory, because the reference base does not fall.
When a rat is in a dangerous situation, it does the same things that other animals do, that is, it thinks he is dead, escapes or attacks.
People behave similarly, from which some scientists understand that there is a comparable subjective feeling.
I do not believe in that.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult for us to transmit our feelings to animals.
On the one hand, the lateral prefrontal cortex is often connected with human consciousness, the associated circuits (this for its direct sharing to short memory and execution and control functions).
In humans this wide area is much more developed than in other primates and it seems that among other creatures it is completely missing.
At least in those aspects of our consciousness depending on the prefrontal cortex, including the knowledge, who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, the foundation is thus admitted on the assumption that man is even different from other primates.
Another dramatic particularity should appear in the way man speaks: since a large part of life is linked to the language, it is often said that it is linked to consciousness.
In this case, animals may be excluded.
Although consciousness does not depend on the language, it would influence it so that the animal consciousness, as it is done, is very different from the circumstances of our consciousness.
This is why it is difficult to find out how consciousness can be seen in other animals.
If it is not possible to measure it as an internal and subjective thing, in analyzing it through your own experience due to the special hardware, their research will bring us great problems.
Most interpretations refer to the content of conscious experience, but besides this there is another aspect of consciousness to which it would be easier for science to have access.
The processes of animal consciousness could be analyzed without regard to their contents, and this is exactly what happens in primate short memory studies, especially in the example of visualization.
So for this principle, which Christof Koch and Francis Crick follow,there passes first to the related neurals of consciousness than to the causal mechanisms: both may be identical but not necessarily.
Interestingly, this principle also highlights the value of the prefrontal cortex for the implementation of the visualization.
What does it mean for the feelings?
I impute them to the fact that an emotional system like that of fear is activated in one of its conscious brain activities.
What we indicate as "fear" is therefore the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defense system localized in the brain (or its consequences, such as the reactions of the body) occupies the work memory.
In this way, the feelings are closely connected to the regions of the cortex, which characterize the primates and in particular the human being.
With speaking nature we create subtle nuances of feeling, because we with the help of words and grammar can distinguish and categorize situations, to describe them to others.
Compared to this, Antonio Damasio, for example, believes that the feelings arise from the more primitive activities of the body regions of the sensations of the cortex and the paleo cefalo, similar to Jack Pankseep, who, however, focused more on the paleocephal.
Since this network has not changed much during human evolution, this could absolutely be part of the sensations extended to the species.
On a purely theoretical level, I cannot contradict it, but I think it is irreversible.
Pankseep raises arguments on the fact that what for rats and humans appears as fear, is likely to be warned so with the senses in both cases: but how could it happen if rats and humans experience the same thing when they behave similarly?
A scarafage in the event of danger escapes as if he also felt the fear?
In my eyes, the simple similarity of behavior cannot show any vital similarity yet.
And that is, the neural comparison continues to be helpful: rats and humans have similar paleoencephals, the scarafages do not even have a brain.
But is the paleoencephal responsible for the feelings?
And when it could be demonstrated to humans, how would it be demonstrated to rats?
I think rats and other mammals, even insects (who knows?) have feelings.
I didn’t know how to prove it.
And since their feelings are fundamentally different from ours (as the human consciousness is based on specific circuits and language), I prefer to study emotional behavior rather than the emotional sensations of rats.
In any case, there is progress at the neural level, in accordance with which you give up the same procedure on rats and men.
As I don’t do research on language and consciousness in rats, so I don’t do it on their emotions, I don’t even know if they exist.
This can be considered myope, but I prefer to take steps forward rather than constantly beat against a wall.
I am emotionally practical.
UEFA President Platini: Reference to Poland and Ukraine
Vice Prime Minister Iwan Wasjunik said the preparations will soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the President and Prime Minister.
“The government sees the decision of the UEFA in Bordeaux as a demonstration of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organize Europeans with Poland,” Wasjunik said.
“This is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun and there’s still a lot to do in both countries.”
Both homeowners land in the roadmap for the construction or reconstruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports.
The number of stages to be assigned to Europeans will eventually be reduced from eight to six.
“We can’t waste more time.
Now we have to work at the highest speed," Ukrainian association president Grigorij Surkis said.
“UEFA will keep us constantly in mind.”
A more radical step has been made in Poland.
After numerous scandals the leadership of the Polish association PZPN was suspended by the National Olympic Committee and replaced by the independent manager Robert Zawlocki.
The committee met at the request of Sport Minister Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
"There would be the serious danger that the PZPN will not be able to operate according to the rules," Drzewiecki told Polish news agency PAP.
“In a letter we told UEFA President Michel Platini that the preparation for the 2012 EM will not suffer.”
Many exhibitors of the first division only last season were sentenced for manipulation, at the end they even had to remove the start of the League at the last moment.
Dennis Quaid is angry.
She wanted to promote a new film, in an interview she talked about the private and now she has grains with the former: Hollywood star Meg Ryan has declared adultering her former Dennis Quaid.
He was angry and rebellious.
The War of the Roses is a delayed outbreak for the former couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: seven years after their separation the two Hollywood actors now dispute with each other a bad dispute - in public.
Meg Ryan in an interview with the American magazine InStyle last week for the first time spoke about the reasons for the failure of the marriage: "Dennis has long been unfaithful to me, and this was very painful."
The scope of the betrayals she would come to know it only after the separation.
The opportunity for the "Spirit Spray" was working with Ryan's press for his new film "The Women" – the story of an adultery is told.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his publicly declared adulter husband was of clear outbreak: it would be "unhearded," said the fifty-fifty-year-old to "New York Daily News", that "Meg for the next time repeats and re-elabors the story of our relationship."
It would also be “pleasant” that Jack, the seventh-year-old son they had together, again “will be publicly remembered the pain and subversion, which a separation means for every child.”
While Ryan from the separation lives alone, Quaid is married again and will soon become the father of twins.
And therefore his judgments end with the flagship: "My life in any case goes on.
I’m lucky to have a wonderful family where everything goes for the best.”
The price for air tickets and hotels drops
In the first half of 2008 the flights and nights in Europe were cheaper than the previous year.
In Germany, according to a current study, flights would even be up to 50% cheaper.
Flights and nights in the hotel have become more convenient again - this is the result of a study of the financial provider and American Express travel.
The company analyzed its bookings data for the first half of the year 2008 and after a price rise in the first quarter observed a clear decline in the second quarter.
After the prices on the hotel market have risen for years, overnight accommodations in many places have already fallen in prices.
From January to March, prices in 41 of the 48 European cities still rise in average around 6.9 compared to 2007
However, from April to June prices were already 3.6% lower than the previous year.
The most obvious trend would have been in Paris and Rome, where travelers had to pay 30 to 37% less than a year earlier.
The American Express sees the weak dollar quota as the reason for this, which would lead to a "heated desire to travel American tourists"
Even financial centers such as Frankfurt and London would be affected by the hotel prices recession more strongly than industrial centers such as Hannover, Colonia or Stavanger
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices with a 26.3% rise even hold the record in Europe
In terms of flight prices, the trend in the first quarter is still on:
Due to the charger of cherosene, the Economy Class passengers had to pay an average of 7.1% compared to 2007, long-range intensive fuel flights would even be up to 29.2% more expensive.
From April to June, the prices of Economy Class air tickets dropped on average by 12.5% compared to the previous quarter, but in the first class and in the Business, the price changes were much weaker.
In Germany prices have fallen even stronger than in other European countries:
From January to March prices rose by 11.9%, in the second quarter they fell by 23.6%.
As for German domestic flights, according to the study, the prices have even halved.
The reason for the price collapse would be, on the one hand, the declining economic growth, the company explains.
The demand in many segments of the air travel market has broken down.
On the other hand, through the Open Sky Agreement, which liberalizes air traffic between the United States and Europe, there would be an increased pressure from the competition.
Sign of the critical situation would be the suppression of non-profit tracks at the Airlines, as well as the high number of airlines that in the first half of 2008 would declare failure – only in Europe it was 24 airlines.
The HSV defeated Gladbach by 1 to 0
With a single goal and simple methods, the S.V. of Hamburg becomes a captain.
In Borussia Luhukay is not yet able to find a group of 11 that works.
Here Kristoffer Klein worsenes the lucky landing for national player Marko Marin .
The Gladbach player first came late in the game and failed with a shot on the cross.
His message was formulated accurately, passed on his lips in a convincing way.
He knew he was absolutely right.
“We need the second goal,” Hermann Rieger spoke at the Hamburg Arena cabin corridor.
It did not happen so much in the catacombs, the game break was over and the majority was sitting again in their place.
Rieger has been a physiotherapist for almost 3 decades at HSV, enjoying an even greater estimate than some old players.
And so his monit also found hearing in the high spheres.
The assistant coach Cornelius Jol has recorded and lifted the finger in sign of approval.
Cornelius is the brother of the head coach of Hamburg Martin Jol.
His order must have played the same way: this is the second goal!
The change of position has not occurred.
“Today here it’s not all nice to see,” Marcell Jansen later admitted.
Bastian Reinhardt would also "will be more relaxed."
For the 1 to zero those of Hamburg have to thank the head blow to Mladen Petric (11) and the fact that the many weak players of Gladbach could not have done harm to the weak players of Hamburg.
“It was a dirty victory,” said Martin Jol.
The World Congress will be celebrating 121 years this Monday.
The spectators have already celebrated earlier, on Saturday afternoon, themselves, the blue sky on the arena and the glowing ranking on the video screen, which legitimized their sports society as before the class.
It will be a birthday without a celebration.
“We’re able to put everything in place,” Marcell Jansen said.
He has the presumption, that the temporary certificate from the table is more an indicator of the unpredictability of the championship than of the dominance of his HSV.
The team with its late new arrivals – the Brazilians Neves und Silva, the defense of the gate Petric as well as Jansen swallowed to FC Bayern – slowly finds himself, but has not yet managed to shine.
“We need more atmosphere and more Dribbling,” said Jol.
After the defeat of the vote

The dark matter influences the flight of spacecraft
For years, a mysterious phenomenon creates perplexity among scientists: dark matter influences the speed of spacecraft during the so-called Swing-by maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einsteins’ general theory of relativity might not be completely accurate.
The Ulysses spacecraft has flown through space for almost 18 years.
Because of the fuel pipes that freeze quickly, it is now on her death for freezing.
For years, among scientists, a mysterious phenomenon creates discomfort – the anomaly of Swing-by
The Swing-by is a flight maneuver of the spacecraft, with which they get additional slance/spinning/oscillation in the gravitational field of a heavenly body, for example Earth.
Thus, the probe can save a lot of fuel.
The Euro-American research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical spread as well as the solar probe Ulysses.
What has surprised the scientists for years: the races do not behave as expected according to the law on gravity.
There are irregularities in speed.
The probe suddenly becomes faster or slower.
So far the physicians have not been able to explain this effect.
The year remarked the anomaly of Swing-by.
Some experts fear that even Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity, which describes the force of attraction of matter with a curvature of space, may not be completely accurate.
The American physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton strongly believes as before Einstein failed, and tries to explain the anomaly of Swing-by through the so-called dark matter that astronomers have observed in the cosmos.
"The responsible for the anomaly could be the dark matter that could also be very close to the Earth," he writes.
The existence of dark matter has been known by space scientists for about 10 years.
From her obviously comes a force of attraction, whose effect on the other heavenly bodies is made visible.
It is completely invisible, that is, it does not send or reflect any kind of electromagnetic radiation, especially any visible light.
According to the scientists, dark matter constitutes at least a good fifth of the entire mass of the cosmos.
Those kidnapped in Egypt are free.
After 10 days in the hands of their kidnappers, the kidnapped tourists in Egypt will be free again, as the Italian Foreign Minister confirmed.
The kidnappers from Sudan had requested several million euros of rescue.
In a shooting before the release, six kidnappers were found to have been killed.
Five Germans were kidnapped in the south of Egypt.
The rescue negotiations are already ongoing.
The Germans are always at the forefront of the kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE describes the most important cases.
European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are undoubtedly free.
This was by Egyptian state television, Arab broadcaster Al-Arabija and Italian media.
Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release after the Italian TV broadcaster Sky TG 24: "Our citizens and other hostages have been released.
We are examining their health,” Frattini said.
The five Germans, five Italians and one Romanians as well as their eight Egyptian accompanies would be healthy and safe, the Egyptian state television.
The 19 components of an expedition in the desert are already on a journey to Cairo.
It remains unclear the retroscene of a shooting occurred before the liberation of the hostages: thus the thieves after the indications of an Egyptian public security agent would have been ready for the conclusion of the kidnapping, before the Sudanese army surprisingly killed 6 of them.
“The problem was solved.
They agreed on a rescue," the official said.
It would be “only only dealt with the hostages,” when suddenly this “surprise” came.
Sudanese soldiers on Sunday in the border zone between Sudan, Chad and Egypt had killed by firearms 6 of the kidnappers and captured 2 of them.
The kidnappers had claimed a rescue of €6 million from Germany; the money had to be delivered by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The newspaper "El Masri El Jom" in reference to a German intermediary, the release of the hostages would be delayed because the thieves feared for their own safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers wanted to release the women in hostage after the rescue was paid.
The men would have to remain detained until the thieves had a safe way of escape.
The German Embassy in Cairo refused to take a position on the report.
The abuse of the homeland "he led to suicide"
Years of abuse by the parent have led a woman to kill herself, a court said.
Michael Trerise, 57, from Stithians, Cornwall, was imprisoned for six years after he admitted eight cases of sexual assault.
The Truro Crown Court learned that he regularly harassed his daughter Stephanie Randle when she was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a note of the confession: "I feel responsible for his death."
The court learned that Mrs. Randle had been murdered in her house in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
When she was a girl and lived in Coventry, Trerise harassed her and hunted her before she had sex, while her mother was out to work in a pub.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the eighties, and he returned to Cornwall.
His daughter went to Plymouth.
But the court learned that Mrs. Randle, who had spent a lot of time as a volunteer at the National Trust, was tormented by the abuses they had caused her.
In 2006, the public ministry Ramsey Quaife told the court that Mrs. Randle's friends, who was a brave surfist and cyclist, was "emotionally dead" and that she had "molled with life".
In April 2007, her true father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
It is believed that he was killed by a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle comforted his daughter's father-in-law, who wrote a letter of confession that ended: "I bind her and put her."
“I didn’t harass him sexually.
I feel responsible for his death.”
Judge Christopher Elwen said to Trerise: "He is an extremely strange feticist, and for his victim he must have been terrible, especially when he was only seven years old.
“This unpleasant saga ends with the victim who takes his life.
Even harder is the fact that if he did not, it would be difficult for the facts to end before the court.”
I notice the effects that Stephanie's father and mother describe had on their daughter in these years.
Otherwise it was clearly likely that she would have been a promising and happy successful young man.”
The official who lost the data will be punished.
The Cabinet Office official who left the top-secret documents on a train in June must be accused by the Official Secrets Act, the BBC.
The man was transferred from the Ministry of Defense when he left two highly classified documents on the train to Waterloo.
The documents were passed to the BBC before they were delivered to the police.
It is the least delicate of the charges formulated according to this law and there is nothing that suggests a criminal intention.
BBC defense correspondent Frank Gardner said the movement would come as a surprise to many of the administration.
"They would have thought that this was treated internally in the Mod and the Cabinet," he said.
The employee, who cannot be appointed, is to be charged under section 8.1 of the act, the clause relating to the protection of information.
The Crown Prosecution Service recommended that the officer should be accused by the metro police due to the highly sensitive nature of his work.
The missing documents contained assessments on al-Qaeda and the capabilities of the Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was taken away from his home and brought to a hidden place.
Construction companies face the B&B account
British construction companies could face a account of over £80,000 after the rescue of the Bradford & Bingley bank.
The government has given £14 billion to protect the deposits of 2.6 million Bradford & Bingley savings.
The interest on that loan will be paid by all companies that take the money from savings, including the 59 construction companies.
Director-General of the Building Societies Association (BSA) Adrian Coles said it’s “irritant” that companies and their members have to pay.
The loan of £14 billion will eventually be refunded when the Bradford & Bingley bonds will be refunded.
But the interest that will mature in the meantime will be made to pay every year to the 700 financial companies that take deposits. but the interest that will mature in the meantime will be debited every year to the 700 financial companies that accept deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 construction companies would be included in that number.
It is annoying that those institutions that have behaved prudently... are now called to pay part of the account of those institutions that have been much less prudent.
by Adrian Coles, BSA
He said that every company had to pay in proportion to the deposits he had, and that the companies among them had to pay 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that the interest on the loan will rise to £450 million in 2009.
This means that companies will have to find £81 million to pay the first year of interest.
Adrian Coles, Chief Executive Officer of the Association of Construction Companies, told BBC that he believes it is unfair.
“It’s annoying that those institutions that have behaved cautiously in the recovery market are now called to pay part of the account of those institutions that have been much less cautious.”
According to the BSA, no company has failed since documentation began in 1945.
"We have to examine all aspects in the coming weeks to see what options there are to protect construction companies and their members from what could be a significant account," said Mr. Cole.
The interest due in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September of this year to the end of March.
In 2010 the interest of a whole year will be due and this could be almost twice the highest.
Since construction companies are mutual organizations without shareholders, their members end up paying the account through higher fees or lower interest rates on savings accounts.
Milk salt at 5 penny per litre
People in Jersey are facing the fact that they have to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy has announced that there will be a huge increase in its milk prices for an extra of five penny per liter since Monday.
It is the second price rise this year, after a two penny rise in February, and comes after a research carried out by a consulting company.
Retail vendors must decide on their own whether they want to download the price increase on their customers.
(DANILO) Before the February rise, the gross price changed for the last time in 2002.
Previous PostPrevious Bangladesh’s former prime minister has been arrested
A court in Bangladesh has rejected a warranty request from former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, which means she could be arrested when she returns to the country.
His lawyers said that the court refused to grant him a guarantee for expelling 50 million taka (729.700 dollars) to a businessman when he was a parliamentary member.
The case is one of the many corruption accusations on her.
The long-standing political rival of Sheikh Hasina, Khaleda Zia, was released on caution at the beginning of the month.
Sheikh Hasina's return to Bangladesh is scheduled for the next few weeks but his party, Awami League, has demanded that the country's military-backed temporary government first gives him total freedom.
The correspondents say that while she was going abroad for medical care on the word, it is not clear according to the terms of her release, whether she will be able to stay free when she returns to Bangladesh.
His lawyers say he will appeal to the Supreme Court against the order of the High Court.
"The High Court has rejected the request for caution for Sheikh Hasina suggesting that she can't have the caution since she's already abroad on the word for medical care," says her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
“We will appeal against the order of the Supreme Court.”
His lawyers explain that he needs caution to return to the country from abroad to prepare for December elections.
Sheik Hasina is expected to return home after October 17, said Sunday a senior leader of the Awami League party.
She was arrested last year after the government ranched to the military force took power, but was released in June, to go abroad to receive medical care.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia deny all accusations against themselves.
Fear for the Afghan anti-polio campaign
Nearly 200,000 children in Afghanistan are missing in the recent immunization campaign due to violence related to the Taliban, the UN says.
The UN has launched a vaccine program in six provinces last week.
But it is said that it cannot reach children in the parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for security reasons.
A spokesman for the UN said this happens despite the taliban’s promises that they would not have attacked or hindered thousands of people who carried the vaccines.
BSkyB loses legal battle with ITV
BSkyB lost its legal battle with the Competition Commission's decision to force the company to reduce its participation in the rival ITV television station.
BSkyB was told by the appeal court of the competition to cut its shares in ITV from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
Previously, the Commission had said that BSkyB’s participation hindered competition and allowed an unfair influence on ITV.
BSkyB bought the participation in 2006 in an agreement that actually blocked NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Office of Fair Trading that the acquisition of BSkyB’s participation in ITV raises doubts about ITV’s independence, making the Competition Commission launch an investigation.
The head of Virgin, Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and the regulator of Ofcom opposed the purchase.
BSkyB argued that forcing it to reduce its ITV stake was unreasonable and a disproportionate remedy - as BSkyB had said it would surrender its voting rights.
New investigation of the US prosecutor's case
The U.S. Prosecutor General appointed a special public ministry to examine the release of nine U.S. lawyers in 2006.
The operation took place when a report on the case by the General Inspector of the Department of Justice criticized the actions of administrative officials.
The report was critical to the White House, the legislators and former prosecutor-general Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was triggered by the fear that the prosecutors had been removed for political reasons.
Special public ministry Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether the officials interrogated during the investigation lied to the investigators in an attempt to hinder justice.
"Series of allegations concerning potentially criminal behavior have not been fully investigated or approved," General Inspector Glenn Fine said in his report.
The assignment of a special ministry with the power to force witnesses to testify was one of the main recommendations.
The dispute began when nine U.S. prosecutors were removed from their positions from the Department of Justice in December 2006.
At that time, the department said the lawyers had been dismissed for end performance.
But later it came out that the dismissed lawyers were not considered more expensive than many other colleagues, leading many observers to the conclusion that the dismissal was motivated by politics.
Some of the prosecutors had been involved in the trial against high-profile Republican members of Congress, while others had refused to investigate the allegation of fraud to the damages of democratic voters.
The US prosecutors are investigating and bringing cases to court on behalf of the government.
They can be dismissed at any time, but they cannot be dismissed for political reasons.
The then head of the Department of Justice, prosecutor-general Alberto Gonzales, was in the storm for the dismissals, and eventually resigned his position.
A number of other officials of the Department of Justice have been dismissed.
(The general inspector's report was very critical regarding Mr. Gonzales' role in the case, saying that he carried a primary responsibility in the dismissals, who had abandoned his role as leader and was extraordinaryly dismissed during the trial.
Other officials, including Bush’s former senior assistant Karl Rove, were criticized for not collaborating with the investigations.
The Meat Loaf Epic will be celebrated
The rock star Meat Loaf is going to be honored at the Q Awards for her epic inno Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will withdraw his special gold prize at the next week’s ceremony in London, said he was “honored” to win the award.
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title of the track of the hit of Meat Loaf's 1977 album.
The Coldplay will lead the nominations for this year’s prizes, being on the list of nominations in four categories.
Paul Rees, chief editor of the Q magazine, said: "There are some songs that transcend things like time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is undoubtedly one of those."
The song, composed by Jim Steinman, required a strong vocality that was provided by Meat Loaf.
It was opened with an instrumental section that lasted almost two minutes.
The song was performed as a single in the UK in 1979 and reached the 15th place.
But Meat Loaf's album Bat Out Of Hell remained in the ranking for nine years and came to sell more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - real name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered health problems in recent years, including an intervention for an irregular heart attack in 2003 after collapsing on stage.
In 2007, acute laringitis forced him to cancel the concerts.
He later emerged that he had a cyste on a vocal corner.
Dark city streets, often forgotten and soon for sale
New York City has thousands of avenues, boulevards, streets and other crossroads, some famous, others merely used.
But even many veteran taxis and residents for a long time find it difficult to give the location of Extra Place, mostly because they’ve never heard of it.
The small street is in the East Village and goes north from the First Street – without the Second Street – between Bowery and the Second Avenue.
About 30 feet wide and 120 feet long, it more resembles a dusted shell than an active traffic road.
There are no road signs.
It is virtually impossible to see it on a normal atlante.
The road must have admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the property company of recently built luxury buildings on the First Street.
You want to reopen Extra Place and create a cleaner passage for shops and boutiques that should open in the new buildings.
Other admirers include long-standing neighbors who say they were hit by the roofed road simply because it was one of the last remains of the famous neighborhood of the past.
But the city preservation and development department, which has road control, has no interest in keeping it.
During a meeting of the municipal council's land use committee some representatives of the city agency and Avalon Bay drafted a proposal for the real estate company to buy the roads.
But the committee prefers that the road remains in the hands of the city, and has asked for a new plan to be presented next month, says Susan Stetzer, District Director of Community Board 3.
“There is very little space left to the city’s property, and we would like the city to continue to possess Extra Place,” he said.
“We may have proposals to set up and manage it, which could be done by Avalon, but we also want to ensure public access.”
Avalon Bay many months ago announced it wanted to reopen the small street and install seats, including some to use for a cafe to which the real estate company hopes to rent the space.
The idea that Avalon Bay would buy the road was made public for the first time at the meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, a spokesman for Avalon Bay, said that although the company wants to use the road, it doesn’t necessarily mean that it wants to possess it.
"The main concern of Avalon Bay is to renew this outskirts and turn it into a public amenity," he said, adding that the city suggested the sale.
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for Housing Preservation, said that it was in fact the city's desire to sell the road and noted that the agency's purpose was to develop the property rather than manage it.
Compared to his most colourful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place left a light historic footprint.
Some believe it took its name in 1802, when a large farming company owned by Philip Minthorne was divided among its many children and the narrow strip of land was not complained.
The back door of CBGB, the punk rock monument that closed in 2006, opened on Extra Place, and the street is better known as the set for the photo cover of the Ramones album "Rocket to Russia."
“The ground was beautiful,” said Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones, who took the photo in November 1976.
“It was full of dirt, brands of clothes and pieces of boots, posters, leaves, cords.”
Some residents, including some bloggers who write about "gentrifying" East Village, opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, suggesting that the piece of public property, modest as it is, should remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rarity – a piece of city almost for nothing changed that should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, who has a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled, "The Book of Complaints: A Little Nostalgic Look at the City on the Way of Extinction"), has published part of a City History Discourse that appeared on The New Yorker in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: “Extra Place is an angry, out-of-the-country, dark even in the day and delimited bridges of stained iron warehouses and windows with the saracines, with week-old newspapers running along the basics.”
With few exceptions, the road seemed almost the same as a recent evening.
A rats walked smoothly through the back of the road near a door that led to the CBGB, which is now the site of an aristocratic clothing store.
On the walls there were graffiti and a bottle of empty 22 ounces of beer near a group of unleashed newspapers.
Few passengers said they rarely thought of Extra Place but suggest that it would need to be a bit empty.
Mr. Fields, on his part, said that he also thinks some people underestimate the road attraction in his current state.
"The best years of my life," he said, "were in black, dirty and disgusting places. "
The bilingual debate: immersion in English
In this Educational Look, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the candidate’s position on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, senior member of California Studies and senior director of educational studies at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the book "Not good as you think: Why the middle class needs to choose a school."
Really attracting Spanish voters is a complicated matter.
Barack Obama’s educational projects are a significant example.
Mr. Obama’s campaign notes that, “African and Latin students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students,” which is true.
To combat these shortcomings in achieving the goals, Obama’s educational plan specifically supports, among other things, “transitional bilingual education” for English students.
However, the question for Obama is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which emphasizes the teaching in class of other languages than English, does not take into account his interest in filling the learning gap.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school in the eastern county of Los Angeles.
School students are for the majority Spanish and low-income.
More than one-third of students, many of whom have arrived recently, are studying English.
But, among the fourth students, a surprising 100 percent of students did the higher level test in the 2008 math state exam.
An equally surprising 93 percent of fourth-class students have done the expert level test on art-of-language-English.
This incredible result was achieved using a different ingredient than Mr. Obama's favorite.
Sixth Street emphasizes repair and exercise, constant assessment of skills and a "no excuse" attitude.
Moreover, and here Mr. Obama should note, according to Linda Mikels, Director of the Sixth Street, the school’s outstanding approach for English students is “full immersion.”
The use of English emphasizes the almost exclusive use of English in the context of education.
Mrs. Mikels, who is opposed to bilingual education, told me, "We had a fantastic success with a student just arrived from Mexico and if you had entered the class 12 months later you't be able to figure out what it was."
“It works,” he observed, “for us it works.”
Will Obama model a school like Sixth Street Prep to replicate it in other schools with Spanish majority and with English students?
The results achieved by the school make the answer to that question very easy, but the educational policy in its own party (the National Education Associations is a long-standing supporter of bilingual education) and its own continuous support for bilingual education prevent prediction of Mr. Obama’s response.
While he agrees that immigrants should study English, Obama recently made the topic banal when he said that people should stop worrying about the "only-English" legislation.
Instead, he said, "You must be sure that your children are able to speak Spanish."
If Obama really wants to close these shortcomings, he should carefully consider the educational models that work rather than neglect them or banalize them.
The oil is slowly down and the economic fear is renewed.
Oil prices dropped suddenly on Monday due to concerns that even the US rescue plan for financial markets may not be able to raise the economy.
The future of the grape fell from 7 percent to $99.80 per barrel at the New York Stock Exchange in the morning operations.
The prices lost more than $20 per barrel since last Monday.
In the last two weeks, the raw materials markets have been exhausted by Wall Street’s financial agitation, and by a couple of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After reaching a peak of $145.26 per barrel in June, prices had collapsed to $90 per barrel at the beginning of this month, before rising again, on the background of a tremendous uncertainty in the financial markets.
The anxiety influenced investors again on Monday even after congressional leaders had said they had reached an agreement in the weekend about the rescue plan, the largest in history.
The news was obscured by the fresh concerns that the financial crisis was far from being passed.
In the last episode of the progressive merger, Citigroup will buy the banking operations of Wachovia Corporation, the government said on Monday.
At the same time, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalized the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Barclays Capital’s analysts said that the frenetic weekend negotiations had led to a rescue agreement,” it seems to have failed to revive the sense of the market.
As the economic situation worsenes, the demand for raw materials, including oil, is expected to calm down.
"The prospects for global equity, interest rates and exchange rates markets have become uncertain," Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note to investors.
“We believe that raw materials will not be able to escape from the infection.
From a perspective of raw materials our most pressing concern is to what extent the American virus will disappear globally and specifically to China.”
Bank analysts have lowered their expectations for the next year while oil consumption is home due to the slowing economic growth, reducing oil and gas prices forecasts by about 20 percent for 2009.
The performance in the second quarter marks a team record.
After spending more time than anyone with the Jets uniform in the last eight and more seasons, defendant Shaun Ellis thought he had seen everything.
Then he watched what was going on in the second quarter of Sunday, when the Jets turned a point-free match into a turn.
“I’ve never seen something like that,” Ellis said.
The second quarter began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals had equaled the gray of the threatening clouds that overwhelmed them with a hot game.
Then the Brett Favre quarterback found Laveranues Coles for a 12 yard touchdown, providing the perfect signal for a afternoon where their growing synthesis made a giant step forward.
Favre found Coles for two more touchdowns in the fourth, including one when a cornerback fell and another with 10 seconds left at the end of the first time.
"I didn't get out of my path," Favre said of all the passes arrived in Coles.
He is a fantastic player.
Our communication has been great despite what people can think.”
While Favre and Coles were taking games, the defense heavily hit the quarterback of the Cardinals Kurt Warner.
The cornerback Darrelle Revis intercepted a vague launch and reloaded it for 32 edges in a touchdown.
Security Eric Smith planned another passage and intercepted it.
The linebacker David Bowens forces a Warner fumble.
The last turnover, the fumble forced by Bowens, could have been the most remarkable.
The Cardinals went in advance over that possession of the ball, with 10 seconds left, and after the Jets had replayed the ball with 10 minutes left, Jay Feely scored a goal of 20 edges, for an advantage of 34 to 0.
It was more than the Jets had ever marked in a quarter.
When asked to describe the madness, Jets coach Eric Mangini said, "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
When he was told both - the Jets gave 21 points without answer in the third quarter - Mangini said: "I can tell you that I liked the second quarter much more than the third."
There have been a lot of points in a small time gap.”
It’s a good thing to do, but it’s a good thing to do.
Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia has again shown why many consider him the best marathon ever, breaking his own world record at the Berlin Marathon Sunday and becoming the first person to run a 26.2 miles race under 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a victory on the race favourably planned at 2:03:59, Gebrselassie sends in frants for 27 seconds his previous score of 2:03:26, run last year in Berlin.
At the age of 35, Gebrselassie puts up the 26th world record of a career that has produced a world championship or a world record at every distance from the metric mile to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie jumped the Olympic Marathon in Beijing, fearing - too alarming, in retrospective - that air pollution would worsen her asthma problems.
Instead, he decided to run to Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions - sunny and 48 degrees at departure, 55 degrees at arrival - Gebrselassie won Sunday with a shocking average of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
As soon as half founders such as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat of Kenya have gone long distances, the marathon record has fallen more than two minutes in the past decades, since Ronaldo of Costa del Brasil won Berlin at 2:06:05 in 1998.
After Sunday's victory, Gebrselassie told reporters that two weeks ago he had cramps in his poultry and missed a week of training.
Clearly, the rest left it fresh, not roasted.
“I’m so happy,” Gebrselassie told reporters.
“Everything was perfect.
I started again a week ago, and I had doubts today, but at the end everything went well.”
He was somewhat criticized – especially in Kenya, the Eastern African rival of Ethiopia – for having excessively orchestrated his races, generally avoiding many of the best marathon stars in the world, relying on an apripista as if it were a mid-found race, and puting the world records above the sense of competition.
But these criticisms rarely decrease the size of Gebrselassie’s skills as a marathon.
With the step caught by four Kenyans on Sunday, Gebrselassie reached the middle point at 1:02:04.
Two Kenian elite runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, held in competition Gebrselassie after the apripists disappeared.
A little more than three miles from arrival, Gebrselassie made an end-out to separate from Kwambai, which ended second at 2:05:36, improving his best personal time of 5 minutes.
Kamathi arrived third at 2:07:48.
In the women’s race, Irina Mikitenko, native Kazakhstan who is now a German citizen, completed a remarkable year winning in 2:19:19, the seventh fastest time ever.
Paula Radcliffe of Britain holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, Mikitenko, 36, was a surprising winner of the London Marathon at 2:24:14.
She lost the Beijing Games with what is described as a bad accident, but she healed to win in Berlin, making her best personal time of almost five minutes in the third marathon she ran.
She run a race doing the calculations well, leaving a quarter of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners to leave with a great distance, taking them back after about 18 and a half miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia arrived second at 2:21.31, while Helena Kiprop of Kenya ended third at 2:25:01.
In a separate city, pride and processes of a black life
Born in the theme park extended on the towns of Orlando, a few miles from the splendor, the noise, the enormous, is the quiet city where the pride and complications of the African-American experience enter into life.
Eatonville, the first black city incorporated into the country and Zora Neale Hurston's home, is no longer as simple as described in 1935: "the city of five lakes, three croquet fields, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, abundance of guava, two schools and no prison."
It is a place of pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville to show their respect for Hurston, the most famous writer of Harlem Renaissance.
However, in many ways, the city that has described – and which makes tourists stop including it in the Florida tourist guide produced by the Depression-era Federal Writers' Project – remains a place in place.
It’s as independent, decent and private as it was in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural black people in Florida often resist sharing their thoughts with the white man, that “knowing so little of us, they don’t know what they’re losing.”
Even now, in a year when a black presidential nominee, Senator Barack Obama, was called for an opening speech on the race, many here remain disappointed by the outsider’s look.
"We are very cautious about how our story is told," said Hortense Jones, 59 years old, a lifelong resident and member of the city's oldest church.
“He must be right.”
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and difficulty.
It is both a historic model of black power and a community of 2,400 where poverty rate is twice the national average.
It is a literary center but also an example in the shadow of the cracks of the rural culture of the Southern Black – sometimes disdigned, sometimes rewarded – born by American slavery.
Not surprisingly, the residents here are both proud and protective.
And the concern for the image of Eatonville really started with Zora, who all here call Hurston.
She presented the world to her native city through sincere, rich in dialect books, such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs of the Florida guide transformed the city, just out of the Rout 17, a road that runs through the often forgotten center of Florida within a black history and human drama scenario.
Just like a grass in both life and literature, Hurston brought the readers to the store owned by Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then moved to more private areas.
"Outside from the street to the left," he wrote, "is the modern public school, brown with the shells in white, with its well-holded gardens and courts, which Howard Miller was always swallowing, thinking he could just read and write."
She also mentioned the new husband of the widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "sales drinks of all kinds and whatever is suitable for the passing rooms."
So in just a few hundred words, Hurston connected Eatonville with self-government but also with analphabetism, second marriage and sex.
This was not of Fodor.
It was not a portrait that everyone appreciated.
"Zora said it as it was," said Ella Dinkins, 90 years old, one of Johnson's girls that Hurston immortal cited men who sing gross songs about their beauty.
He added, “Some people don’t like it.”
Hurston is still remembered here as a vivid excentric who frequently returned from his family transferred to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77 years old, recalls that when Hurston flooded in the city, he usually arrived unpreviously in a triumphant Chevrolt, smoking and wearing pants in a city that even today enjoys decent clothes.
Many inhabitants were fascinated, says Mr. Franklin, while others wrapped.
“People were always very happy to see Zora,” said Mr. Franklin.
But, he added, hanging on his chair on the courtyard on the back overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was very likely baptized, "they never stayed long."
When Hurston died in 1960, he was poor and his books had gone out of the press.
Together with the rest of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten her.
Although once she was a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 20s, she was buried in an untouched tomb in Fort Pierce, Fla., where she lived.
In Eatonville, there were no great commemorative ceremonies, and no great conferences.
"I don't think they understand his contribution to the world or his leaving to everyone," said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows," a Hurston biography published in 2003.
A change occurred in the 1980s.
Orange County officials wanted to place a five-course highway through the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the main two-course road.
The expansion of Orlando has already pushed the Interstate 4 through the western border of the city.
The proposal came when Eatonville was still regaining from a difficult period of his history.
The forced integration, among other things, had ended the idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the battle for racial mixing brought hatred to the gate of the community.
“Thro that time, a group of white boys came and throwed arance and things to the people sitting on one side,” says Mr. Franklin.
"In fact, we had a girl who was killed by that once.
They took a cowboy out of a car.”
In a 1955 letter to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston filed a request to the Supreme Court for forced integration, calling his decision in Brown against the school office “a insult rather than an honor for my race.”
Residents now say that the disintegration of schools, despite being positive in some aspects, dilutes the cohesion of Eatonville and undermines the confidence of its young people.
"Black children were used to be embraced - I remember this - embrace your teacher in the morning, embrace your teacher in the evening," said N. Y. Nathiri, the daughter of Ella Dinkins and the executive director of Preserve the Eatonville Community, a non-profit group.
This lasted, he added, until teachers and students came from the same place.
“You didn’t embrace your white teacher because your white teacher... – I mean, there’s a cultural division there,” said Mrs. Nathiri.
Civil rights, in any case, helped and created space for many other Zora Neale Hurstons - black writer, actress and artist who surpassed the prejudices, as she did, with joyful self-confidence and lines like: "How some can deny themselves the pleasure of my company!
I can’t really understand it.”
In 1975, the writer Alice Walker began a long journey to Hurston's untouched tomb and began to struggle for the resurrection of her reputation.
Five years later, an acclaimed biography of Robert E. Hemenway’s Hurston hit the bookstores, reintroducing it into the American canon.
The project of the highway arrived just as his most famous daughter had again interrupted the lights of the river.
And this time, the old neighbors of Hurston saw her as a savior.
The community began to design in 1988 a festival dedicated to Hurston to show what could ruin the state with its highway.
Thousands of fans came to the opening event two years later, and every January, many return to the commemoration.
Many years later, the state pulled back from its project for the road.
“The five corridors of the raised highway, brought what would be said high speed, a real pride for the city,” said Ms. Nathiri.
Mrs. Boyd puts her in a simpler way: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory on the highway project has helped to change the image that the city has of itself.
Those outside the city like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who began to come to church here in 1993, began to appear in large numbers, and residents began to re-examinate the past.
Eatonville joined the public historical register in 1998.
A new one-floor library (called Hurston, of course) opened in 2006 on a Kennedy Boulevard rebuilt and embellished.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly of Florida: just six miles from the center of Orlando, it can give the feeling of a secondary road under summer rain, small as when it was founded with just 27 black families in the 1980s.
(It is 90 percent black today.)
The outsiders who come to look for the story of Eatonville, for its meaning, are often still treated with caution.
A permission requested in advance is required for the majority of the interviews, to some things - such as the walls on the oldest church of Eatonville, painted by a white man, which make black men see in the fields - have no permission to be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Ms. Jones, a fat teacher, with a weak for bright red, still fear that their island community will be misunderstood.
However, as soon as the Hurston festival has expanded, a high level of citizen pride has also emerged.
Young people, in particular, tend to see Eatonville with Hurston saw his entire race: beautiful, problems and everything, neither better, neither worse and proud, creative, great worker, foolish and confused as other races and ethnic groups in America.
It is sincere civic affection what can be heard in the voice of Mr Franklin's grandson, Edwin Harvey, 18 years old, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work in the local government or for the Police Department, who said he might need help.
And even those that are younger, such as Alondra and Alexia Kenon, 11-year-old twins from Winter Park, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
“Many people, if they’ve just entered here, will think, ‘Oh, this city is nothing compared to all the others,’” said Alondra Kenon after putting in a recent Sunday.
“But if you really stop and take a moment to look at history, it’s really a lovely city.”
Here in New York we all talk fluently about finance
On the surface, nothing has changed.
If the tourists in Manhattan stayed away from the banks of the newspapers and the huge Times Square TV screens, they would not realize that they were in the eye of the cyclone.
They would never convince that the glass offices, the bankers and hedge fund managers that monopolize New York live every day the worst “brut day in office” since the collapse of 1929.
The farmers shoot metal wheels for the tea through the walks, carrying muffin vessels for breakfast meetings.
Latino-Americans trace their feet between condomins carrying, like human mules, 50 and broke stretched t-shirts attached to a stick on their shoulders.
Employees are still waiting in a row for their morning bagel to the food wheels on the march, and it is still impossible to take a yellow taxi between 16 and 19 of a working day.
It didn’t seem that there was a real crisis, until, with all the speech of ruin and sadness, I decided to open a new savings booklet on Thursday afternoon.
Even though I had planned the deal so that it coincided with the late afternoon break at my JP Morgan Chase branch, a coat of about twenty was already waiting in a row.
Not in front of the wallet,to withdraw money or make deposits, but in front of the customer service wallet, where old customers order booklets, tourists ask for directions for the big Macy warehouse and new customers open accounts.
Many of those who are in front of me, I would have learned from Starr, my “trust banker,” were in line for my own reason.
Unlike me, however, they have already taken the savings from the smaller banks from the places from which the pendlers do, such as those from New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They took the money from the so-called thrift (a little like a building company), credit cooperatives and types of citizen savings banks whose branches operate only within a state, and they say to treat customers as family members.
Over the past few years, 15 of these banks have failed.
In recent days, the Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion in assets, was subjected to the controlled administration, and while the New Yorkers went home for a weekend a Friday afternoon, another bank, Wachovia, with $440 billion savings deposits, was looking for a buyer to save it.
The employees and commands that were in front of me, scared of another collapse, were moving their money to a bank perceived as a safe port, the bank that is asking for more cautions on Wall Street.
Common New Yorkers in the last few weeks have become competent in finance.
A woman in my trusted Chinese supermarket, speaking at the phone, referred to Lehman Brothers, the bank failed, and to her empty chief executive Dick Fuld in all familiarity, as if she laughs of a crazy colleague.
And Lyn, the coat in uniform, almost fifty of my condominium, changed theme compared to our usual conversation topic about Brad and Angelina or the delivery of my expenditure.
She told me, after my visit to the bank, "Now I have all my savings in market funds!.
I’ve changed, I’m not running any risks.”
Muslim tombs profanate while Austria turns to the right.
Heinz-Christian Strache, left of the Austrian right wing of the Freedom Party and Filip Dewinter of the Belgian right party Vlaams Belang, take part in a demonstration to present the organization "City against Islamization" in Anversa, Thursday, January 17, 2008.
They bring signals such as those road representative mosques with a red line that passes in the middle.
Police accused right-wing extremists of murdering a Muslim cemetery in Austria, the same week that extreme-right political parties earned a lot in national general elections.
More than 90 tombs were seriously damaged at the Traun Cemetery, near Linz, in a few hours between Friday night and this morning, in what the police believe was an organized action.
The guilty traced with the spray Jewish symbols like the Star of David over some tombs, but detectives believe it could have been a attempt to mask the extremist motivations led by a hatred for Muslim immigrants.
It is unclear whether the incident is in any way linked to the elections.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said they were "deep shocked" by the news of the profanation, which took place towards the end of Ramadan, a month of religious relevance for Muslims.
In the meantime, Austria has embarked on a spiritual search journey following its right-wing turn in yesterday’s parliamentary elections.
The two extreme-right parties that took almost 30 percent of the votes, the Austrian Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, made a campaign with a veemely anti-immigration ticket and some of their slogans were defined by xenophobic critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party who won more than 18 percent of the votes, made a campaign against the veli and the burka and also expressed his opposition to foods that are perceived as linked to Islam.
At the final meeting in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties seem to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, making them political symbols of a continued Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Surveys and analyses made immediately after the elections, which established the extreme right as the strongest political blockade of the nation, indicating that the change was brought to dominance by young voters who are worried about their future in the European Union.
Travel abroad forbidden to Gary Glitter.
In Gary Glitter, the glamour rock star guilty of sexual abuse on minors, was banned from traveling to France and Spain by court.
The judges imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after he had informed the authorities that controlled him that he wanted to go to Spain by passing through France.
The foreign travel ban was granted to the Kent police last Thursday after it had provided the proof to the judges of Glitter's previous arrest for sexual abuse on minors.
Glitter, the real name Paul Gadi, was not present at the Ashford Court in Kent but was represented by Corker Binning’s lawyers.
A spokesman for the Court Service said: “On Thursday, September 25 at Ashford, the Kent police submitted a request to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd from travel abroad to France and Spain until March 25.
“Paul Gadd was not present in person.”
Glitter, 64 years old, had informed the authorities that he wanted to travel abroad as he is requested from the register of the convicted for sexual assault.
He must notify the authorities if he wants to travel abroad for more than three days.
He is also asked to give the police a seven-day notice on his scheduled departure date.
Failure to notify the authority may lead to a sentence of five years in prison.
Kent police said they did not want to discuss the individual cases or the possible movements of Glitter in the country.
A spokesman for Kent police said: "Kent police will do everything necessary to protect children in this country or abroad.
From our point of view, it is easier to control someone who remains in the UK because we have suitable comprehensive systems to manage any potential risk more effectively.
“Protecting the residents of Kent is the main concern of the Kent police and we work carefully to monitor the behavior of the condemned for sexual assault registered in the country to minimize any possible risk for the public.
Glitter returned to the UK last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abusing two 10- and 11-year-old girls.
When Glitter arrived, he flew to Bangkok where he had to get on a flight to London.
But he said he was sick and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities would not make him pass pass check and eventually take a flight to Hong Kong.
Even Chinese authorities did not let him enter and returned to Bangkok where Thai police and immigration officials insisted that he would return to England.
He finally arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3 on August 22 and stayed there as his lawyer David Corker went to the Uxbridge, west of London, since Scotland Yard had successfully filed a request for an order to enter him in the register of the convicted for sexual assault.
Glitter was previously imprisoned in the UK in 1999 for possessing images of child abuse.
A source from the Ministry of Internal Affairs said that Jacqui Smith, the Secretary of Internal Affairs, felt secure and happy that Glitter had been stopped from traveling to France and Spain.
“I photograph the master away from the scene to extract his character” – Günther Bauer
No clothes, no clothes, no clothes before.
Only the essence of the great masters of Flamenco, dressed out of the concentration that characterizes the interpretation, to look at the relaxed appearance of man or woman.
On the one hand the artist.
On the other hand, the person.
Two inseparable faces, except in the private, in those moments far from the public, when the intimacy of a gesture, the depth of a stolen look or the expressivity of the hands, are natural because they don’t have to go into the scene.
German Günther Bauer in "Flamenco-People" alters the theatrality of some scots to singers, dancers and guitarists on the stage with the least known side of these masters.
With this goal, the photographer offers an original Flamenco iconography, capturing it from various visual angles.
The exhibition, included in the programming of the Month of Flamenco Photography, reflects the international importance of this dance, every day increasing," explains the artist and clarifies that in "Flamenco-People" it might also be common people, but seeing the photos, the observer realizes that they are not the typical images of artists, interpreters or executives on the scene.
These people portrayed "on the road" are "artists able to transmit passion, sadness, joy when they are on stage ... and to catch the audience.
To capture the personality of these great people it is not necessary to bring them back to the scene,
Their personality and character are inherent.
What interested me was creating an intimate atmosphere that allowed me to capture with the camera the personality of the Grandes of the Flamenco.”
With the passion for the festival "Cante de las Minas", Bauer started in 1997 a long journey aimed at retrieving singers, guitarists or dancers using a layer camera.
They are portraits that, due to the type of machine and material, remind the classic photography.
The application of various stylistic techniques breaks with the traditional principles of the image, giving the photo modernity, according to an idea that reflects the Bauer’s own flamenco concept: “A music with very traditional roots that evolves and is able to surprise every day.”
Not the dancing, singing or playing in itself, but the artist’s personality, his character, capable of conquering the audience with his art.
The search for a meeting with the essential elements, with the magic that becomes visible in a certain way of feeling and being, are and have been the constant of this work, exposed these days at the gallery El Fotómata.
Famous Flamenco artists such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, figure in this selection of about seventy portrait artists.
The project has become a sort of flamenco antology, and will soon be published in a book that will collect the portraits exhibited during the exhibition.
The passion for portraits led Bauer to repeat the idea two years ago with "Portraits of Veteran Athletes" ("SportARTproject").
Although in "Flamenco-People" the concept is different, the photographer acknowledges "I like to retrieve people, know them and be able to penetrate for a moment in their lives, whether this is a long or short moment.
I think the portrait is the hardest genre in photography.
You meet or confront people, characters that you sometimes don’t even know or who give you just a few minutes to take the photo.
Beyond these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to concretize my ideas.”
The collection of portraits of contemporary Flamenco, entitled "Flamenco-people" is held at the gallery El Fotómata, at number 20 via de la Mata, parallel to via Alameda de Hercules, and will be open to the public until next 16 October.
Vargas Llosa reveals that the novel he’s writing is a “game”
It is situated in places that he still doesn’t know and deals with unknown topics: despite this, Mario Vargas Llosa is at the foot with a new project he’s working on, a novel whose protagonist, Roger Casemant, is an Irish nationalist who has lived twenty years in the Congo and has crossed the Amazon.
He has always been a favourite for the Nobel Prize for Literature, the writer confessed yesterday at the Hay Festival in Segovia, that the project he’s dealing with today “is a gamble” and that “all indicates that I shouldn’t write it.”
"If I had good sense, I't write it, but I'll do it the same and I hope to finish it as soon as possible," he concluded his intervention at the festival for the exchange of ideas, thoughts and words that for four days he saw passing through the city of Acquedotto a hundred writers, historians, journalists and thousands of people.
The author of "La ciudad y los perros" was, as forecast, the highest figure at the third edition of the word festival.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival Award for being the most voted writer by the participants – an ancient edition of Dickens’s book “Our mutual friend”, filled the Juan Bravo theatre places.
Presented by Félix Romeo, the writer found himself in front of a audience to whom the time was flying when the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and with great doses of humor, revoked as it was born in him the literary vocation, derived from the "extraordinary adventure" of the "pleasure of reading" and "to live beyond what I lived"; as he writes in "disciplined mode" to pray to the "threateness of inspiration", with an intense work of documentation, drawing and continuous reflection; as Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas have influenced his vocation and as the "images of memory" are the basis on which his stories put on.
The Spanish-American novelist, acknowledged that "there is no way" to measure and know if books can change the lives of people, "but I refuse to believe that literature is a pure entertainment, an effimera experience," Vargas Llosa emphasized, claiming that, on the contrary, "there has effects" and that "there makes the people most anti-conformist."
The weather blocks the Festival of Pozoblanco, depriving it of the corridors
The celebration of the corridors that would have to suggest the days of the Pozoblanco Festival was suspended yesterday morning, after the towers selected for the corridors had verified that the ground conditions of the square were not appropriate.
Therefore, the company, in agreement with Fermin Bohorquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernandez, decided to suspend the celebration of the race.
The weather has stumbled against this festival preventing you from celebrating two of three days.
On Saturday, the rain prevented the second tours race.
In the cartel were Jose Luis Moreno, Curro Diaz and Juan Bautista, who had to face a tower of Castilblanco.
Therefore, the festival was held regularly only on Friday.
In this occasion, Daniel Luque was triumphing, cutting three ears and coming out to triumph, after smiling with taste and aesthetics.
In the same afternoon, Alejandro Talavante completed his two races with greetings and an ear, granted more by the public than for the merit of the race itself.
The worst of all was El Juli, passing through the Los Llanos arena without glory and without pity.
With the second bull, after a tremendous mulet, it gained the fishes of a large portion of the audience.
A car with two thousand pounds of hashish crossed the blockade in Alava
Five less than ten in the morning.
The officers intimate the alt to the two occupants of a furgon who instead of stopping they go to the flight.
The officers intimidated the alt to the two occupants of a furgon who instead of stopping fled.
Their load, more than two tons of hashish, is a good reason not to stop.
The agents after pursuing them, succeeded in arresting one of the two occupants, a 28-year-old man, identified as A. A. J., according to a statement from the Basque government’s Interior Department.
The person arrested is accused of drug trafficking and falsification of public documents.
The incident occurred when some Alava road officials were carrying out transport controls on the N-1, at the point where it crossed the municipal circle of Armiñón.
They were hoping to stop a truck for inspection when the driver, transgressing orders, suddenly accelerated and crossed the lock.
The officers gave themselves to the pursuit until the vehicle, after a couple of kilometers, stopped on the edge of the road and its two occupants gave themselves to flee into a forest area.
The agents of Ertzaintza then managed to arrest one of the fleeing and to seize the 2,178 kilograms of hashish they carried and to take action once the furgon was inspected, an Iveco Daily.
The hashish panels, which were located on the back of the vehicle, were subsequently placed under police custody for a thorough investigation and weight detection.
Furthermore, since officials found that the registration was “doubled” because it did not match the one in the furgon documentation, the arrested was also charged with the crime of falsification of public documents.
The Ertzaintza is continuing investigations to arrest the second suspect, who managed to escape as already said, and to determine the origin of the kidnapped drug.
The 28-year-old prisoner A. A. J. was taken to the police station to carry out the appropriate procedures and be at the disposal of the court in the coming hours.
Actress Heather Locklear arrested for driving under drug effect
Actress Heather Locklear, the Amanda of the popular Melrose Place series, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) for driving under the effect of drugs.
A witness saw her performing risky maneuver while trying to get out with the car from the parking lot in Montecito, according to the People magazine by a spokesman for the California road.
The witness specified that around 16.30 the Locklear "shake down the accelerator, making a lot of noise, and trying to take the car out of the parking lot with sudden maneuveres forward and back.
Shortly after, the witness, who at first glance apparently had not recognized the actress, saw that the Locklear had stopped on a nearby road and had gone out of the vehicle.
It was this person warning the emergency services, because "he was worried about the life of the Locklear."
When the police pattern arrived, he found the actress sitting inside his vehicle, which partially blocked the road.
"It seemed confused," and for this reason the agents led her to a drug and alcohol use specialist center to submit her to a test.
According to a police spokesman, the actress proved collaborative and the hypothesis of excess alcohol was eliminated from the beginning, although "as observed by officials at the beginning, we believe that the Locklear was under the effect of some medicine."
The Locklear was arrested with suspicion of driving under the effect of some substance not better specified and was locked in local prison around 19.00, to be released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear was recovered from a specialized clinic in Arizona after being recovered after an episode of anxiety and depression.
Llamazares calls on the Andalusian Federation of the IU to assume its responsibilities in the Silva case
The general coordinator of the IU and member of the Izquierda Unida party, Gaspar Llamazares, confirmed today that he will ask the regional training federation to make a decision on the case of the former adviser to Youth and Sport of the municipality of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned the resignations last week following the accusation of clientelism.
"In these cases I am federalistic, and it will be the Andalusian organization to have to take on its responsibilities," Llamazares said as regards the resolution that the party will have to adopt against what has been so far adviser in the Civil Council.
However, the UI leader emphasized the need for "transparency" in all possible investigations regarding the irregularities that Silva would commit. "UI has always wanted that this type of investigations we have the maximum transparency."
In the same way, he emphasized that training is regulated by "very strict ethical codes for all public tasks."
“Blood of May” is Garci’s epic bet.
Inspired by Benito Pérez Galdós's Episodios Nacionales, Jose Luis Garci replayed in Sangre de mayo the famous Spanish rebellion against the French, in what is the most ambitious film of his filmography, with almost 15 million euros in budget.
With this film, the director tried to "illustrate the torrent of characters and at the same time the social analysis" that he always admired in the work of the famous novelist, explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutierrez and Paula Echevarría headed by a wide cast of interprets.
Blood of May, more than two and a half hours long, debuted this Friday in the cinemas, to become in the future a more than four-hour television miniseries on TeleMadrid.
The great admirer of Galdós literature, Jose Luis Garci claims that he has realized with this rotating "a dream of his childhood", and believes he must thank Esperanza Aguirre, who from the Community of Madrid had commissioned him three years before rotating a commemorative film for the second centenary of the 2 May co-release.
The 15 million budgets allocated by the Community of Madrid represented for Garci a "unicity opportunity" to recreate the scenarios and costumes suitable to retrieve a "a sturdy Spain that mistaken the choice of the leader for which to fight and the fact that the struggle for independence brought to the people a huge delay in development under the kingdom of Ferdinand VII" noted Garci.
However, the director regrets that he has not received funding equal to those of Alatriste or Los fantasmas de Goya - more than twice than Sangre de mayo, so it was not possible to turn some scenes provided by the scenography he himself had signed along with Horacio Valcarcel, a collaborator of almost all his career.
This, for the director of Volver to Begin, influenced what is his usual work practice, putting it on stage with the actors, with whom he often uses to try before turning together with those who won’t be part of the cast, because he considers it “humiliating,” considering that “part of the director’s work lies in going to theatre and to the cinema to know what’s going on in the industry in which he works.”
Many of the interprets, some of whom belong to the cast of Sangre de mayo, try in front of his machine, such as in the case of Michael Rell, Carlos Larranaga or Fernando Guillen Cuervo.
Candidate for the Oscar for four times - winning one - Garci believes that no one of the three candidates to represent Spain this year at the Hollywood Academy - his Blood de Mayo, Siete mesas de billar francés and, the last selected Los girasoles ciegos -, do not represent the youngest generation of Spanish cinema "which should instead be known."
This film does not expect any awards.
“In the beginning you think you’re working for the back, then you realize that you’re working only for prosperity, and at a certain point you agree to just turn a movie more,” explains Garci after more than 30 years of career.
Isabel Bayon re-covers the civilian essence of the dancer Tortola Valencia
A civilian dancer honors another dancer equally from Seville.
Carmen Valencia Tortola, Catalan father (Firenze Tortola Ferrer) and Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana neighborhood, and at the age of three moved with the family to London.
She was a free dance dancer and an Eastern dance specialist.
She lived a fascinating life and was a pioneer of the female emancipation, the calibre of Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was Buddhist and vegetarian, and defended the cause for the abolition of the corset that prevented women from moving freely.
The life of this woman, which marked a revolution in the field of dance and aesthetics in Europe between the two wars, has always fascinated Isabel Bayon.
“I would like to work with Pepa Gamboa and she proposes me this character.
She said, “We don’t intend to tell her whole life, but to gather her spirit.
The titles of his dances suggested me some basic elements of Flamenco.
So, "the dancing of the butterfly" suggested me a guajira, or "the dancing of the serpent" some tanghi.
His dance was sensual and I was told that even my way of dancing belongs to this aesthetics,” he explains.
The stage includes two exceptional contributions: Miguel Poveda, who will again sing Isabel in one of his shows, as he does "The Open Door"; and the teacher Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to work with the one who was his student.
"Matilde plays Tortola as an adult, the character of maturity.
I am happy that he agreed to work in my work and I feel very honoured of this.”
The award also includes the musical composition and guitarists such as Jesus Torres and Paco Arriaga, the song of Miguel Ortega, the Pulga y Moi of Morón; the percussions of El Pájaro, as well as the viola of Rafa La Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfran Juárez "who plays the role of eternal accompanying of these artists who have been dive to all tone, and who have always had a lot of passengers."
In the work is present in some way the life of this woman that takes place in remote places, especially for that time, such as India, the United States or Russia, and then all Europe, since, usual, she resided in London.
“I wanted to remember her because I think she’s one of the women who had an enormous influence in a given historical period and now no one remembers it and much less considers her work as something of value,” Bayon says.
The show will start today, at 20:30 am at the Lope de Vega Theatre.
This is the case with the publication of "Diario de un poeta recién casado" which also ends the Triennio.
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Diario de un Poeta Reciencasado" at the church of Saint Stephen (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities scheduled by the Council of Culture of Andalusia to celebrate the "Triennal of Zenobia and Juan Ramon" (2006-2008), organized to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize for Literature and that of the death of both.
Thus, the "Triennal of Zenobia and Juan Ramon" ends with the re-edition of this work, with the International Congress that took place in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel House-Museum and with the itinerant exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: Aquel chopo de luz", which was inaugurated last May and which, after touching the various provinces of Andalusia, is expected to arrive in New York in concomitance with the International Congress.
In addition, the Culture Advisory Board of Andalusia has acquired a total of eight hundred copies of the "Diario de un Poeta Reciencasado", under the care of Peter Tabernero and illustrated by James Perez-Enciso, to continue the dissemination of the figure and work of one of the highest-value Andalusian poets.
America likes a little less without Paul Newman
Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them.”
The phrase is of the actress Sally Field, who worked with him in "Ausencia de malicia" and gives the idea of the impotence of American cinema, and of all America, faced with the shocking idea that Newman has gone.
However, it cost him a lot to give him an Oscar.
He was retired since 2007.
He also knew he was very sick.
Despite this, it was a very hard blow for everyone.
“Sometimes what one tries goes beyond any expression, and I now have lost a great friend,” Robert Redford cried, “my life and my country have been better thanks to its existence.”
No one was afraid to be ridiculous or to exaggerate.
A father of the cinema and the homeland died in a dark moment, for the fear of terrorists and markets, with self-esteem from the American people on earth, desperate search for new motivations to feel worthy.
When times are so difficult, men so without virtue and are still good people to admire, you don’t need to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For everyone, he incarnated the platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official opponent of Richard Nixon and defendant of lost and lost causes, from the foundation for the fight against the drug created in honor of the dead firstborn of overdose to the creation of the home and organic food brand.
Everyone gives it to a country that costs a lot to go beyond a suicidal food culture.
The wave of admiration went beyond Hollywood, without taking care of neither nationality nor passports.
The last James Bond, the English Daniel Craig, observed that no man was dead, a time is over.
Another Englishman, Sam Mendes, Oscar-winning director, said working with Newman was nothing less than the peak of his career.
The bad guy arrived from Australia, Russell Crowe, has shaken to define Paul Newman his greatest inspiration.
"He left an example of very high level for all of us," says George Clooney, one of the few who today tries to live as Paul Newman did: keeping in high consideration the need for righteousness and to have a serious and private life away from the cameras.
This is not always easy or possible in today’s media jungle.
However, some try us and Paul Newman is a good example for them.
He divorced once but remained married for fifty years with Joanne Woodward, to whom he remained faithful even though he did not miss the opportunities to not be.
“Why am I going out to eat hamburgers today, if I have a bulk at home?” she laughed.
In heaven he is accompanied by the pride that on earth his daughters are also his admirers, which is not so common in America.
“In all the great roles he played, no one was as proud as one of a devoted husband, loving father, praised grandfather and passionate philanthropist,” they say.
The Imperfect Race of an Olympic Madrid
Yes, the dream of many of us is that early or later the Olympics will be held in Madrid and, after the failed attempt for 2012, this could happen in 2016.
I wonder, are we ready?
If we follow the example of yesterday’s race, I’ll say no!
They have called it the “perfect race”, but I think it has long been the worst one I’ve seen.
A lot of foolishness, which would later be taken into account in the act of the assessment and I would have to examine them, the response would be absolutely negative.
But let’s go by order and start from the beginning.
The foolishness began with the withdrawal of the dorsal, which supposed to go first.
It didn’t seem to be a wrong idea, but if you were forced to go, that’s to withdraw everything (including the chip to avoid the codes during the race).
Instead no.
You had to go only to take the back (first foolishness, go only for this) and (after the relative coat), surprise! they had t-shirts only of size 'S' (second foolishness, because I need a size XL).
In which world do we live?
Is it the fault of the crisis if they decided to buy only small shirts, made with less fabric and thus less expensive?
Well, things of this kind are inadequate compared to the day of the race.
In addition to having to go very early to take the chip, the waiting box was 15 minutes and, in addition, you had to deposit the zain.
The waiting lasted more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible for a race to which more than 11,000 people are expected.
So, as it was predictable, the race began that we had not even still deposited the zain, although, once they succeeded in the company, the recovery resulted even worse.
In addition, the rain threatened more than 40 minutes of waiting, which was added to attempts of popular rebellion and the stand assault.
In at least 500 people tomorrow we will definitely have pneumonia, and some, like me, will not even result in the ranking in the right order due to the chip that, I suppose not properly recorded the arrival.
In the future, if they ask me for the perfect race, this will not enter my thoughts.
So I think we will continue to dream of a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft is looking for a receptionist (virtual)
At the MIT conference on emerging technologies, Microsoft presented in advance a new image recognition and human interaction system, a kind of artificial intelligence, but without much intelligence, capable of performing some basic tasks, such as calling a taxi (or, in the case illustrated by Microsoft, a shipping service to move within the company’s campus) assisting the phone user.
Thanks to a camera and a form and face recognition system, this "receptionist" is able to know how many people there are in a room, who they are - including remembering their position in the company - and to listen and understand the keywords in a conversation with them.
You can also group those present into conversational groups.
In the example video the receptionist detects a third person, but it understands that he does not belong to the group with which he is talking and that he is not a company employee.
He asks her if she is there to visit someone and tells her that it will be available to her soon.
All without a blue screen.
It is impressive.
But this, of course, is the future.
Now the company has better to focus on, for example, on the next version of its Windows operating system.
This week we talked a lot about a strategy change in Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and will not have so many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer discovered that if the computers were equipped with essential functions and less charged with commercial scratching, they would be five times faster – oh!
All a discovery, if taken into account that Microsoft, version after version has continuously added to Windows features and “extra”.
The change of direction is appreciable.
Microsoft is right: the operating system is increasingly losing importance, and with it the software.
When Google launched Chrome on the network, I was one of those who supported the theory that was Google’s first step to compete with Windows.
Many rightly emphasize that a browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is an essential element for hardware and software to communicate.
Do the same function as your wife or husband when you have something to say to your sister.
It is true.
It will never disappear, but it is necessary to think of the "death" of the operating system not as an absolute truth, but relative.
What Ballmer said this week confirms this idea.
People pay less attention to the operating system, and more and more to the web browser.
You take the computer only to launch Explorer or Firefox – or Chrome – and daily we spend more time browsing in the network than in a remote window environment.
What does half of the operating system applications do?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 should be less, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, less overloaded, less complex.
Microsoft is more interested in integrating its online services so that they are a valid alternative to Google.
They have a desperate need for it, in fact, and I bring here a small example.
I took the photo inserted in this post in one of the Microsoft employees’ recreation premises, in Redmond, at the beginning of this month.
On the beverage machine a poster asks them to use their own search tool - "Your search, our future".
In 2006, an independent study came to the conclusion that 66% of Microsoft employees use Google to do a network search.
Last week, on the other hand, the delay in the development of the new version of Windows Mobile 7 was confirmed.
It will not be placed on the market in the early months of 2009, but probably at the end of the year, if not even in 2010.
Microsoft will try to launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 together.
After all, mobile phones are becoming more and more a computer.
But the delay, with Android and iPhone already on the market, is penalizing.
The Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso carried it to the Blue Coast, Leonardo di Caprio glowed in Edward Zwick's 'Diamante de sangre' as well as Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's 'The Father' as well as being part of the typical uniform of the gay muscular parish.
And if we try to list the appearances of the stars, we can revocate the image of the forced with the boots that raises the weights in the ambulant circus.
It is, in essence, the typical man's shirt, with the interior of cotton, stained and without manicures.
It’s the ‘tank’, as the Anglofones call it, though, the Belgian Fabuleux Marcel highlights above all.
The "Marcel" is superior to others for the high quality of cotton, for its unisex cut, for its distinctive stem and for the small Belgian flag (just recognizable), which the most emblematic patterns of the jacket carry as a detail on the neck.
The "Marcel" is superior to others for the high quality of cotton, for its unisex cutting, for its distinctive stem and for the small Belgian flag (just recognizable), which the most emblematic shirt models carry as detail on the neck.
And be careful, because the production of the Belgian company does not concern only the famous "tank".
It also includes college shells, retro boxer, cashmere cardigan, cotton pants, marine t-shirts, baby-dolls, mini short...
Clothes designed to be comfortable.
And it is a pity to use them as intimate clothes.
They are too beautiful.
“I want to be a young mother, the candidate doesn’t worry me.”
The great likeness with her sister did not prevent her from developing her personality.
Monica Cruz is small, but full of vitality.
Currently, Cruz sisters have taken their new activity in the fashion field very seriously.
For Monica, they are much more than beautiful girls and celebrity who lend their own name.
It was in Paris for the promotion that the Mango signature made of its new headquarters, as well as the presentation of the most important awards that the Spanish fashion house sponsors.
Heatful and shy, you get quickly.
Tell us what you are doing in Paris.
I came to present the new collection that my sister Penelope and I designed for Mango's autumn-winter season, as well as to participate in the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and dinner at the Opera in honor of Valentino.
Let’s say, a very intense, but at the same time, exciting day.
What is your new collection for Mango in this fourth season of work for the Spanish home?
I like the films of the 1950s and 1960s, and I love the films of the 1950s and 1960s, and I love the films of the 1950s and 1960s.
Then I love to lose myself in the city and observe how women dress, how they combine and mix their clothes.
Ballerina, actress and stylist, you are a very versatile woman, right?
I think yes, although at the end, everything conflues and there are many elements in common.
I liked the clothes since I was a child; I wanted to go to my grandmother’s house to go to my grandmother’s boats and see her clothes.
It was a bomb, even better than going to the game park.
Then, once dancer, I always paid a lot of attention when dressing.
It is known that dancers like to have their own style to go to class and to the wise, to look in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of actress, when you are delivered the guardroom is the time you really meet the character.
So, everything goes together, yes, with a lot of respect for the stylists and the professionalism.
You’ve been 30 years old, you’ve been in crisis.
But not.
I never feel better, I like the idea of 30 years old.
I find that at that age women are mature and have a good experience to do life by making less mistakes.
The biological clock doesn’t scare me.
I did the things I wanted from childhood and this gave me a lot of inner happiness.
So you think you’re going to be a mother, right?
Of course, I know I’m going to be a mother because my own body asks me and I also want to be a young mother, this I don’t want to miss.
As for the candidate, I don’t worry too much.
What I will do will give a lot of happiness to my son and educate him with a lot of love.
When it comes to the cinema, you are waiting for several films filmed last year to appear in the halls.
Just so, and I have a lot of desire to scan.
Being a woman coming from the theatre, I’m very impatient and anxious, I’d like everything immediately and clearly, but it can’t always be so.
I want to come out “The Last Hour” and “In Search of the Tomb of Christ.”
Let’s see if you will like it.
A few days ago you debuted on the gate with Naomi Campbell, right?
Well, not to say that.
It is not that I was in the gate as a model.
Simply Naomi Campbell, who I have known for a long time, called me to invite me to go to London to participate in a charity parade for her organization "Give for a better world" and the clothes we performed – I brought two pieces of our collection for Mango – were put on auction to collect funds for this Naomi NGO.
People don’t know that side of Naomi.
So many things are said about her, that I, who know her for a long time, can confirm that they are not so true.
In addition, I find myself with this good part in which you are involved.
He asked me to parade for a noble cause, but if he asked me to make the pine, I would do the same.
If it is to help the women of the third world, you can’t get back.
Recidive alcoholism drivers will have to install the "alcoholock"
The Ministry of Internal Affairs requires that drivers with three administrative penalties for excess alcohol in the blood, install in their car the system that prevents the driving of the vehicle in the state of abbreviation or if they do not breathe in the appropriate device.
The measure was announced last June and is already included in the annual report of the General Prosecutor’s Office, according to which it will be a pilot project of one year.
The purpose of this project is the reintegration of the driver, since this will have to attend a rehabilitation course on the road.
In addition to the General Prosecutor's Office for Road Safety, the General Directorate of Traffic (DGT) and the Foundation Institute of Technology for Automotive Safety (FITSA) will participate in this initiative.
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of drivers more than once by driving in a state of abbreviation then return to driving the car.
Alcoholock would avoid it, because it is a vehicle-connected system that measures the alcohol rate in the breathed air and prevents the car from moving if the driver does not breathe, or when a higher alcohol concentration is detected than permitted.
The cost is more than 1000 euros and it would be on the charges of the sanctioned.
In this regard, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with such devices allow a reduction of up to 65% of the infringements committed during the first year of introduction.
And in Spain it is calculated that it could save the lives of 115 people a year.
The measure is limited to administrative penalties for two reasons: to stop these behaviors before they become criminal offences.
And to facilitate its development, since the legal reform can be carried out by ordinary means, and, without a doubt, the reform necessary for the criminal proceedings would require an organic law.
However, the device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial solution, although it has already been experimentally introduced in some industrial and public vehicles.
Just tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote on a PSOE initiative in which it proposes to install this system in school buses, as it has already been done in France.
In Mexico, and without “peep-toes”
With British punctuality, at 17.40, second program, the Spanish aircraft in which the Principles of Asturia travelled landed in the presidential hangar at Benito Juárez Airport in Mexico City.
The sun was sunriseing but the rays still compelled to use the hand as a visitor to see the real couple descend from the plane.
At the foot of the scale, the Spanish ambassador and the other authorities.
A few hours before I had asked a taxi driver, on the road, if he knew that the Spanish princes were going to visit the city to formalize an official trip.
- Ah, very well, so you won't be able to go to the airport to load people at that time ... You're from here or ...
- No, no, she is Spanish, but she lived here for a couple of years.
Oh, very well...
The Mexican press, however, knows very well who are the principles of the Asturie and the importance of the journey.
There are many who wait in the airport hangar shattered on the red carpet and the military cord composed of 27 Navy soldiers offering the greeting of honor.
The prince appears smiling, dressed in sea blue, and she, the princess, climbs to the wind, very sober, does not use her usual "peep-toes," they that Mexico City threatened bad weather.
They give the photographers a smile and a short stop before they go through the room where the official committee awaits them.
At the door of the hotel in which they stay, one of the four largest in the city, a spiritful Mexican television reporter awaits them.
The best award offered by fashion
Probably there is no place in the world the most suitable to present a fashion award, which is not Paris and probably there is no more scary stylist and good vivan of Valentine.
Mango has just presented the second edition of El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards, to promote the international promotion of new talents in the field of fashion.
It offers a prize of €300,000.
Yesterday, Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, watched her drawings in the Mango vetrine at No. 54 of Haussmann Boulevard in Paris and almost cried from the emotion.
Moreover, it is the company’s second-largest store in Europe and has just been opened with 1.335 square meters of extension.
The first is in London.
The many events, united with the desire of pleasure to the stylist Valentino who chaired the jury of the competition, began with a luxury dinner at the Garnier Opera in Paris.
With the vicinity of Chagal’s most squisite tele, the presidential gala table prepared by Mango was even more spectacular.
Nati, with the heart broken and making necessity virtue, due to the brother's recent death, wearing a house dress and some ELAH supplements to remove the fiat and at his son Luis's arm - a girlzone of two meters high - accompanied Valentino to the presidency of the homage dinner.
Andik, the owner and lord of Mango, made the honours of the house and of the rider which it ended, along with the Baron Rotchil, without a jacket, because both had ceded it to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who managed the shop in pants and t-shirts – drawn by her hand – turned to dinner, wearing a long black dress very sensual and was excited during the night walk accompanied by Goya Toledo inside the opera, when they showed us the room for the ballet wise and she, remembering other times, caught a bar and busted a "great plie".
Inés Sastre did not stop for the walk in the palace premises, but had first shown us the photos of his son on the cell phone.
The next day we were delighted by the presence of Olivier Martinez – another boy who moves on a motorcycle – and John Travolta, who had arrived at the Intercontinental Hotel in Paris, with his lens, his towels and had been assured in advance that there were no odors in his room.
Star under the star sky of Paris.
This is the way.
1001, the anti-stress number
There are not 1,000 but 1,000 and a way to forget the chaotic and frenetic daily life.
And as if that wasn’t enough, they’re all gathered in a book that will bring relaxation in the library on September 30.
The awakening is almost a punishment when it climbs every morning at 7 a.m., but it is even worse to imagine engaged in the frenetic rhythm determined by modern life.
The office is called tension and the computer's back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
However, there is no one or even two methods to combat daily exhaustion and difficulty getting out of the world of work.
No, this number assumes nothing more and nothing less than 1001.
Beyond yoga positions, classical massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott collects in the pages of her book, a whole "menu" of options on-middle by taste and time of each.
The anti-stress work is titled "1001 ways to relax" and its calm will reach the library thanks to the publisher Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If someone thinks that it is not possible to conquer calmness in areas such as work or in personal relationships, this “manual” denies that belief.
In addition, it suggests alternative solutions, such as being in contact with nature, or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If adrenaline doesn’t already flow into your veins to find back the body’s balance and stress has become a problem, it’s time to sit on the sofa, turn off your mind and focus on reading.
Talking in the sleep
Some children talk during the night.
I am not referring to those who wake up very agitated to tell us something that happened to them the previous day, but to those children who speak while sleeping.
The first time it happens, at the maximum you take a fear, but in reality it doesn’t matter much.
This is a benign sleep alteration called somniloquium.
It manifests with a certain frequency, especially in children and adolescents.
Certainly, most of you’ve been told that you’ve talked in sleep.
This phenomenon can occur very sporadically (one time in life, for example associated with an episode of high fever) or with a greater regularity (every day, once a week, once a month ...), the next day the child no longer remembers anything.
There is no single reason to explain this phenomenon.
Sometimes they are episodes associated with other sleep disorders such as incubations, night fears, night enuresis (doing the pipe to bed), or sleepambulism, but it’s not necessarily so.
As mentioned above, it can be associated with very high fever stages, stressful situations or overwhelming.
In any case, it is a phenomenon still little studied.
The intensity with which it appears is also extremely variable.
It may happen that the person speaks with a very quiet tone of voice, with loud words, almost in a whisper, or that the opposite happens (hurry, scream, long speeches ...).
In cases where the event is intense, it would turn to observe the child and eventually consult a specialist to verify if there is any issue that is generating an abnormal state of anxiety as an outbreak to the situation.
We said that this is a beneficial alteration so there is no treatment unless it is associated with other sleep disorders that can be treated (for example, if associated with insomnia or stress situation).
What you can do, instead, is to take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to exaggerate the child before he goes to sleep.
Providing quiet games and avoiding programs or TV series that cause fear or suggest violence.
With very nervous children for whom it is difficult to relax, you can use relaxation techniques to help them acquire some inner calm.
This will allow the child to sleep more calmly.
Once the sleepy clothes appear, try to keep calm.
Remember that they are harmless for the child and that the next day will not remember anything of what happened.
useful advice
Do not wake him up.
It’s useless, because he’s not aware of what’s going on, and you’ll interrupt his sleep.
Although he is talking, he is sleeping and then he is resting.
Remember that if it appears very anxious and the episodes have a certain frequency it is better to consult a doctor or check from where such a great anxiety comes in the child.
If you understand what he says (which is not the most common situation), don’t fall into the temptation to make him an interrogation to get information.
You won’t get anything, because he’s sleepy and therefore unconscious to organize his thought.
In addition, you are able to hear what he says but not to see what he is dreaming to say it, so you need to pay a lot of attention to the interpretation of the information and the conclusions that these could lead to.
Never tell the child that you can ask him questions during the night to know his secrets.
Not even for a joke.
Such a thing causes a huge anxiety.
In short, don’t worry, it’s nothing serious, it’s an episode that lasts just a few minutes.
Illhaeusern, finally
The Illhaeusern finally found the way of victory at home after a long infructuous period.
Without playing a formidable game, the Yellow-Black have created the largest number of network opportunities by turning one into the game’s victory.
The rhythm was not much sustained during this meeting in which the attackers expressed themselves in trouble.
After a first attempt by the captain of the host team Kauffmann who broke the seventh with a shot from a distance, the Illhaeusern began to get the best and one after the other provoked the defense of the Dannemarie, Fonderflick from a distance, then Hirn high, Romain top and still Diebold.
The Dannemarie responded with a block at the center of the field, leaving only the scattered Riahi at the point of attack.
The beginning of the second time was decisive with two initial occasions signed Riahi and Temporale for the Dannemarie, and immediately after the first network of Marais for the Illhaeusern, well positioned, played a rejected ball on a first attempt of Diebold (53').
But the Illhaeusern cannonier will not be able to suffer his happiness for a long time and will be expelled a dozen minutes later, leaving his team companions in numerical inferiority.
But the Dannemarie will not be able to take advantage of it and will not put big trouble to the Illhaeusern's Eighth, dismissed just to "forceive" the defense, except in the last minutes of game when, after a rocambolesque action, the ball broke the cross.
Sarkozy met the fishermen in anger
Before leaving the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will take a stage in Britain.
Before the demonstration of the fishermen who on Monday brutally prevented access to several Britain and Norwegian ports, the President of the Republic decided to go on Tuesday morning to the port of Guilvinec, in the department of Finistère, to celebrate its representatives.
The latter has promised to welcome him "with a constructive spirit" and hopes that he will "present with concrete proposals".
A presidential visit that takes place just simultaneously with the general assembly of the “Crisis Committee”, created by British fishermen in order to take measures to cope with the oil price impaired, which has reached its record with an average of more than 1.14 euros per liter.
According to Eliseo spokesman David Martinon, the president will “debat with them about the possible solutions to help companies regain competitiveness and to make secure the working conditions and wages of sailors.”
The fishermen are waiting for Nicolas Sarkozy.
On Tuesday morning, they conducted "light operations" in Morbihan and Calvados, causing 10 km of stumbling.
The port of Quiberon was also blocked, but the connections to Belle-île were not interrupted.
On the Peninsula of Quiberon a road block was implemented.
On Monday, the sailors already proved their determination by burning, starting in the morning, tires and palettes in front of the fuel deposits at the ports of Brest and Lorient, while taking foot demonstrations in Concarneau and Saint-Brieuc.
The movement extended to the ports of the Atlantic coast and the Manica, such as Sables d'Olonne, in the Vendée, where the fishing vessels remained on the mole, or to Havre, where about twenty ships prevented the ships from moving.
The fishermen of La Turballe et del Croisic, near the Loira Atlantica, stopped the blockade of the Donges Total refinery.
In Boulogne-sur-Mer they decided to wait for the meeting that will be held on Wednesday at the ministry to decide any actions.
In Guilvinec, the “Crisis Committee” will decide on Tuesday the future actions of the movement and the event of participation in the meeting scheduled for the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Britain fishermen don’t want to be represented by officials of the National Fisheries Committee, which did not support the movement.
“The strike will continue” because “fishermen will not give up” and “they don’t intend to move to Paris,” Liliane Cariou, chairman of the Lorient Fishing Committee, said.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay gasoline taxes, are currently paying about 50 cents per liter, but they estimate that the performance limit of a boat is achieved only with a gasoline less than 0.30 euros per liter.
Paul Newman is the great.
The unforgettable interpreter of "Butch Cassidy" has died of cancer, at the age of 83, in his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes have greeted the film legend and committed actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer keeps delivery forecasts in 2008
The aircraft manufacturer has 215 deliveries this year, despite the threats of recession that raise the world economy.
Embraer, the world’s fourth company in the industry,ins delivery forecasts for 2008 with the delivery of 215 aircraft, confirmed its president Fredrico Fleury Curado.
During the first half, it delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian company is largely trusted in the Chinese market, especially for aircraft of the range between 30 and 120 seats.
Until today, Embraer has delivered in eight years 41 aircraft to Chinese customers.
AIG would give up more than 15% of its assets
The insurance company American International Group, withdrawn by the U.S. monetary authorities, would give over 15% of its assets in order to refund the $85 billion loan, according to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
The AIG is ready to consider the sale of much of its activities, in addition to the delivery of life insurance branches to the international market and the United States, the newspaper said on the basis of more than authorized sources.
The board of directors of the AIG met on Sunday evening to examine any cessions, according to the FT.
There was no confirmation at AIG.
The assets that the AIG intends to transfer include the air leasing subsidiary International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% share of the Transatlantic Holdings as well as its real estate portfolio and its private equity investments.
There is no definitive decision about these concessions, the FT continues.
The AIG must find in rapid liquidity in order to refund the loan of 85 billion concessions from the Federal Reserve, at the expense of seeing the U.S. authorities failing 80% of its capital.
History of Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange accused a historic collapse on Monday, after the House of Representatives spoke against Paulson's plan to rescue financial institutions: Dow Jones lost 6.98%, a ever seen drop, approaching 800 points, and Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Media (DJIA) ended at 10.365.45, below 777.68 points.
In terms of points, the worst loss in its history (684.81 points) greater than that of 17 September 2001, the day of the reopening of the Stock Exchange following the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
Nasdaq, the leading technological securities index, lost 199,61 points closing to 1,983,73 and the expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 8,81% (or 106,85 points) closing to 1,106,55, standing at the final closing figures.
Demoralized at the beginning of the session, Wall Street is deepened after the unexpected rejection of the bank rescue plan, designed to bring back stability to the markets.
With 228 votes against the plan and 205 in favour, the representatives rejected the funding requested by Treasury Minister Henry Paulson.
Approximately two out of three Republicans rejected the plan.
“It’s a negative signal sent to the market, that it sees Congress unable to adopt a plan,” said Lindsey Piegza, FTN Financial.
“All this indicates how much the market relied on the project,” he added, fearing that in a few days it might be “too late” to adopt one.
“If the project was indeed deadly (...) then the witness would quickly pass to the Federal Reserve and other central banks to resolve the crisis, which would further limit credit conditions,” said Brian Bethune, head of finance and economy at Global Insight.
And further highlighting the state of emergency," every day that passes leads to the collapse of a financial institution" in the United States, the Piegza emphasized.
After Washington Mutual failed on Friday, the authorities organized the purchase of Wachovia’s banking assets by the rival Citygroup.
In Europe, the crisis has accelerated suddenly, calling for urgent intervention in favour of the banks of the UK, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, a sign that the markets are “not just facing an American crisis, but a global crisis,” added FTN Financial analyst.
The bond market has grown strongly.
The yield of the Treasury Goods with a 10-year expiration is back to 3,632%, against 3,827% on Friday evening, while that with a 30-year expiration is 4,161%, against 4,357% on the previous day.
Obama in the first TV duel
After the first Friday debate between the two White House candidates, there is a second to know who, between John McCain and Barack Obama, was the winner.
Without any surprise, the general districts of the Republican and Democratic campaign proclaimed their respective victory in the television duel, followed by a third of the American families.
Politologist David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, though deserving, was not brilliant enough to allow him to stop the decline in the five-week polls from the presidential elections.
The Gallup Institute, whose opinion survey published on Saturday gives a five-point advantage to Obama (49% against 44% for McCain), demonstrates that the democratic had the best.
An instant survey conducted by CbsNews on a sample of indecised voters found that 39% of them believe Obama is the winner, while 25% target McCain.
A great performance by her list companion Joe Biden, expected during the first and only debate with rival Sarah Palin, should confirm Thursday Obama’s advantage.
Subestimating it would be a mistake.
He has a good intuition,” Bill Clinton warned this weekend.
The 70-year-old McCain has never ceased to promote his indisputable foreign policy experience, emphasizing the opponent’s “ingenuity” regarding the topics addressed during the first face-to-face.
“Senator Obama doesn’t seem to understand that,” he often stated in multiple screens.
“I don’t think Senator Obama has the experience and skills needed to become president,” he said.
This has since been a continuous target for the Republican television campaign.
Obama, from his side, emphasized how his election would represent a new future.
Without to dilute, it has been concise and accurate.
It promoted its predisposition to the right decisions and the intention to restore the image of the United States on the world scene.
“McCain has never understood, contrary to Obama,” he reiterated, this weekend, a democratic spot, reproaching the Republican that he has not taken the necessary measures to cope with the impact of the financial crisis on the American people.
During the 90 minutes of debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you, Obama denounced yesterday, in front of 20,000 people gathered in North Carolina, under a blowing rain, for a election meeting.
The financial crisis goes in favor of Obama, considered by the Americans as the most suitable person to save the economy on the hole of precipitation.
“The next week could represent a decisive turn,” said influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former Clinton administration member, compared Obama's economic intuition to what Clinton demonstrated during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic candidate, the current collapse is "the final verdict after eight years of bad economic policy adopted by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain."
Reaffirming the intention of reducing taxes for 95% of Americans despite the Wall Street rise, the senator of Illinois also mentioned among his priorities the achievement of a possible energy independence of the country through the promotion of renewable energies and the implementation of a health insurance system.
McCain plans to build a park of 45 nuclear centers by 2030.
With caution, the two candidates dismissed the requests focused on the $700 billion ($470 billion) financial rescue plan adopted yesterday evening by Congress and extremely impopular.
In Minsk, “Do you not notice that there were elections?”
Youth and opponents demonstrated on Sunday evening in the main square of the capital of Belarus to challenge the results of the legislation in advance.
A few hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday after the closure of the electoral seats in the central square of Minsk to protest against the fraudulent nature of the legislation.
While the results were still waiting, many young people had come to demonstrate against the power of President Alexander Loukachenko: “the dictator, resignations.”
Some acknowledge that they have not even voted: "Which pro? so much will they do what they will, of my vote," says a boy.
They do not believe that that regime that has made a good figure in front of foreign observers with the aim of regaining dialogue with the European Union is ready to undertake a democratic turn.
The sanctions, including the visa prohibition for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of property, could be removed if these elections were considered legitimate by the observers.
They did not, according to the opposition.
“We have been removed from the electoral committees and our observers have not been able to participate in the votes,” Iouri Potemkine, a spokesman for the Democratic Forces Union, a heterogeneous alliance of twelve parties, complained.
“It’s a change of facade,” said Alexandre Milinkievitch, former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential elections and head of the pro-European movement, as the important thing is who counts the cards and in this case is the executive.
If opposition members enter Parliament, it is because they have been nominated, not elected.
But their entry into parliament can involve a television space, regional meetings and legislative proposals.”
The opposition therefore has the duty to enter the political game because "the dialogue with the European Union must be started.
Because if our economy, which is heavily in debt with Russia, comes into crisis, and we do not make any reform, we risk becoming a Russian protectorate.
We want to be independent.”
The opposition is concerned that the Security and Cooperation Organization in Europe, which has followed the electoral process, recognizes the validity of the vote.
He emphasizes that the participation quotas appear too high, and that the generalization of voting in advance (the 26% of the voters in Minsk) has given way to any kind of manipulation.
He asks the social-democratic leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners released this year, in August.
There was no one in the electoral seats.
And there will be a maximum of five MPs from the opposition to the parliament, the most convenient to power."
The night silence falls on the October Square.
In television, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Electoral Commission are pleased with their success.
The Meeting - The Blood Is Back Safe
Héma-Québec celebrated its 10th anniversary yesterday, and its president, Dr. FrancineDécary, had all the reasons to be happy, since Héma-Québec has become one of the safest and most effective blood suppliers in the world.
And above all, it has regained the trust of the public, seriously scared by the infected blood scandal in the years between 1980 and 1990.
As we know, the national blood reserves managed by the Canadian Red Cross transfusion service were infected by the acquired immunodeficiency (HIV) and hepatitis C virus in the 1980s.
Faced with such a drama and the people's protests, the government of Canada conducted in February 1994 a public investigation, led by the judge Horace Krever, aiming to reveal the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to spread recommendations to prevent the repeat of a similar disaster.
While the Krever court was delayed to draw up a report, some provinces established a committee with the aim of conceiving a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, this mandate was executed by the Gélineau Committee.
Following the Gélineau et Krever reports, in Canada two suppliers were created: Héma-Québec to supply Québec and the Société canadienne du sang (Canadian Blood Society) for all the other provinces and the two territories.
In 1998, when Héma-Québec started its activities, just 38% of people said they still had confidence in the donation system in Québec, recalls Dr.ssa Décary.
The situation was mortificating.
Thanks to the continued efforts to improve the safety of blood clots and field research over the following years, we have regained the public’s confidence,” she explains before saying proudly that at the beginning of 2008, about 94% of the population of Quebec had already confidence in Héma-Quebec.
Dr. Decary, however, is convinced that “the confidence is something extremely fragile.”
Since its establishment, on 28 September 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the principle of precaution.
At the time, there was a number of cases in Europe of the human variant of the mad cow, a new manifestation of the disease of Creutzfeldt-Jakob, tells the president of the country since 1998, year of foundation.
"And we didn't know at all if that disease could be transmitted through infected blood.
It was therefore based on one of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gélinau reports, according to which when you have doubts and could a serious disease, in this case the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease that manifests with a degeneration of the brain that inevitably leads to death, measures of exclusion are taken.
In April 1999, the blood of those who had spent more than a month in the UK since 1980 was rejected.
Now, for a few years, it has been shown that without any doubt this disease is transmitted through infected blood.
This episode has shown us that it has been meaningful to apply the principle of precaution.”
In 1999, a much more efficient technique for the detection of HIV appeared on the market: nucleic acid (TAN) tests that allow to recognize directly in the blood of donors the presence of the virus and not that of antibodies against it, on which the tests used so far were based.
TANs have allowed to reduce the window period, i.e. from the moment the person has contracted the disease to the one where the first viruses can be detected in the blood thanks to our techniques, the specialist explains.
This period could be reduced to less than a week.
The risk of ignoring the presence of infected donors and of not being able to identify them is thus significantly decreased.
These improvements have allowed to significantly reduce the risk of getting AIDS with a blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million people are at risk of receiving HIV-infected blood.
In other words, this means that you will need to distribute 12 million blood samples before someone is infected with HIV.
Since Héma-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood samples each year, it will take more than 24 years before a HIV case transmitted with a transfusion will occur.
I think today we can feel calm in receiving or prescribing a blood transfusion to recover health, says the head of the direction of Héma-Québec.
“Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
It is never known which pathogen will emerge in the system.
Not later than a year ago the Chikungunya virus appeared on the Island of Réunion which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted into the blood by a insect.
We need to be constantly vigilant,” continues Dr.Ssa Décary before emphasizing that in addition to having safe resources, Héma-Québec must also ensure that it is sufficient.
“The needs are increasing as the population ages.
As the cancer treatments are most aggressive, patients often need a red blood or platinum intake.
The ageing population also has consequences on the number of donors that in average accounts for only 3% of the inhabitants of Quebec acceptable as donors."
However, all healthy people who have reached the age of 18 and meet the eligibility criteria can donate blood every 56 days, or six times a year.
On average, 14% of people offering themselves as donors are not accepted, because they are affected by AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have travelled to a country where the latter is spread, they will be rejected for a period of one year.
“With this 3% we are able to maintain an inventory capable of meeting the needs of hospitals.
The cases of dementia are very rare.
But we need to renew the members of this group of donors as they age and can no longer do donations.
It is now difficult to convince people to donate blood, but above all to keep them back and encourage them to become regular donors.
"Today, life is so frenetic that you hardly find an hour to donate blood," said Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Héma-Québec not only distributes blood samples, but also human tissues, including bone transplants, eye globe heart valves, and skin which is used almost exclusively for severe wear.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before they are deposited at the Héma-Québec which manages the only public blood bank of humboldt cord in Québec.
In the ombelical cord, which once was considered a biomedical deficit, abundant blood rich in stem cells that can serve to cure serious diseases, such as leukemia.
“We celebrated, a few weeks ago, the banking of our thousand cord blood samples and we expect to take more than a thousand each year.
We should start proposing them for transplants at the beginning of next year,” says Dr.Ssa Décary, who describes this cordon blood take practice as very popular.
“Many mothers are disappointed that they can’t have access to you,” as Héma-Québec doesn’t have the necessary means to propose this complex and expensive program in all hospitals in Québec.
Football - The impact in the semi-finals
The Impact Montreal qualified for the semi-finals of the Serie A, winning 3-1 against the Seattle Sounders, yesterday, during a second decisive match of the quarter-finals, at the Saputo Stadium.
The midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal in the 90's.
After a first time without a goal from both sides, David Testo and Rocco Placentino marked the subsequent networks for Montreal.
For the Sounders, Roger Levesque was ready to mark Matt Jordan.
Remember that at the first match on Friday, the Impact had suffered a 2-1 defeat at the Starfire Complex, in Tukwila, in the outskirts of Seattle.
The Impact will face the Whitecaps of Vancouver in the semi-final.
On Saturday night in Minnesota, the Thundler filled a first 3-1 in the return match winning 4-3, but the Whitecaps will still participate in the semi-finals.
The Impact will face the Whitecaps both Friday and Sunday, but further details will be confirmed in the day.
In short - Kovalev's decisive network
The Canadian and his axes are ready to start the season again.
The trio formed by Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn animated the offensive phase of the game winning 3-2 against the Panthers, Florida, yesterday evening at the Bell Center.
Kostitsyn, the star of the first match, scored a goal, made two steps, and collected a passage for victory, in the fourth of the preparing games of the Habs.
It was the only network signed by Kovalev for the victory.
“I’m not ready yet,” the Russians warned.
I need another game to feel comfortable.”
"He tried to punish in the first period, noted Guy Carbonneau.
I think he appreciated the outcome of the game.
It was a good ovation.”
Charest goes to the north
The Prime Minister does not exclude the opening of elections before the end of the year.
After the Liberal Party’s general council, Jean Charest visited Jean-Talon, Quebec, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc, (left), tries to make himself elected on the occasion of today’s partial elections.
“Elarge the boundaries of our last great northern border”: this is Jean Charest’s long-term ambition, presented yesterday in Levis, through instruments of strong visual impact, on the occasion of the General Council of the Liberal Party of Quebec.
Behind him, during his speech, the projection of a kind of "Mulino in images".
On three maxi screens, spectacular negative of hydroelectric digues, mining cultivations, images of Quebec seen with "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Great means as in full electoral campaign.
During the press conference, on the other hand, the prime minister refused to exclude the beginning of autumn elections, although he noted that he was very committed.
The "North Plan" is the fourth point of a "project" that the Prime Minister claims to have for Quebec, that of a "new economic space", which includes a first deal with France on labour, a second deal between Canada and Europe and other agreements with Ontario.
Often nominated in Prime Minister's latest speeches, the opening of the North - the northern territory to the 49th parallel - was never the subject of a presentation.
The prime minister, however, only explained why the North would be "a jewel of the enormous potential", but did not speak about timetables or investment quotas, as well as did not explain what will be the precise priorities in the implementation of future projects.
Moreover, it has limited itself to reporting what it believes deserves a priority: hydroelectricity, forests, but above all the mining sector, which has experienced several improvements as a result of the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
On the list by Charest, the North contains “niquel, zinc, rubber, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds.”
That “territory big the double of France” is here, it is Quebec.
It’s not only here, but it’s in us,” he insisted, as to ask for a national founder myth.
The foundations of Quebec are rooted in its relationship with the North, he emphasized: the gold fever in Abitibi, the national engineering, the Bay of James.
“It’s up to us, it’s our future,” he added, after a theatrical break to contemplate the immense map on his back.
The north, 70% of the territory of Quebec, comprises a part of the Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, the Prime Minister said during the press conference.
“This is a position traditionallyined by all governments.
“There is a border line on which there has been no agreement for a long time, and when the opportunity is present, I will repeat that position on behalf of the government,” he said.
In addition, "with regard to climate change, we need to re-evaluate the North," he said, speaking of the north-west passage, which will be open for the whole year due to the collapse of ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister considers that occupying the territory is a duty.”
What about the inhabitants of the place, the First Nations and the Inuit?
He said that the Quebec government would be very careful about this and that the project would meet their interests, especially those of the youth.
Two former ministers from different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former MP of the Hungarian QP), have already given the way to the consultation of about thirty communities.
A interministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Traffic and Natural Resources) occupies an important role, started the work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude a large meeting, "not necessarily a summit," but a moment when "common visions will be provided."
The development of the north would be attached to the principles of sustainable development.
The Northern Plan will be "concorded, ordered and respected the environment," he promised.
Jean Charest described this “project” as a continuum with that of the first liberal ministers who preceded it.
“As the liberals who have preceded us, we know how to distinguish ourselves to turn challenges into new opportunities for growth and development.”
This was one of the recurring topics of the weekend, which began Friday with a great cocktail in honor of the 50th anniversary of the arrival of Jean Lesage as party leader.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to repaint the Beauharnois Centre in Diga Adélard-Godbout.
“From Godbout, the creator of the Hydro-Québec, to Lesage who nationalized hydroelectricity, to Bourassa, the creator of the James Bay, our party has always been able to forge the future,” said Jean Charest.
During the press conference, it is recourse to another reference, conservative this time, the "Roads to the North" program by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
Facing the project related to the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric deck, Charest stated that it would be planned for 2012.
“All this remains among us, but I feel that we will do it,” he confessed to his militants, raising feelings of applause.
In fact, the Prime Minister, who in April claimed that there would not be elections in 2008 and probably not even in 2009, did not dismiss the possibility of starting a vote in autumn, which could happen in accordance with the law.
It claims to be very engaged, especially in a federal council mission in China and in the Quebec-New York summit.
The general council of the weekend provided the liberal chief a platform of nationalist resolutions, in particular of the "constitutional aspirations" that have passed smoothly like oil: the PLQ claims above all the recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
He also hopes that Quebec will appoint Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council members and that they will have a veto on the decisions taken in Quebec.
As for the opposition, the abyss of the Northern Plan was welcomed in a skeptical way.
The PQ leader, Pauline Marois, rejected the Northern Quebec Development Policy launched by the Landry government in 2001.
According to her, the liberal government, which came to power in 2003, would not respect its application.
If he did, "we'd be progressing today," Marois commented alongside Jean-Talon's candidate, Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ has stated that it supports the adoption of the North Plan by the government.
"What we hope is that all of this is not simply perceived as a show," said leader Sébastien Proulx, Mario Dumont's replacement, returning from the holidays.

It was Vic Toews, former Minister of "Justice" (irony of the fate) of the Harper Cabinet, to allow himself to declare, last summer, that Louise Arbor was a "vergy" for Canada.
Dishonoring in this way a woman who has continually fought for justice and who deserves all our admiration says a lot about both the prime minister’s entourage and Stephen Harper himself.
Here is before a government that is the only, among all the Western countries involved, to have not returned a citizen detained in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that doesn’t take into account the fact that Omar Khadr was a simple teenager at the time the imputational facts occurred.
The only government that, despite signing the Geneva Convention, denies its word and let a child-soldat march in unhuman conditions.
The only one who confides in a parody of justice to establish the guilt of the accused.
We remember, for information, that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Order of Canadian Lawyers, in particular, call for the return of Omar Khadraffin so that he may be subjected to a regular trial in Canada.
It’s just the same government that closes the eyes to torture: it doesn’t matter much for him that a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, forever, after so many years of overthrow.
It’s not yet realized, but we’re witnessing an insidious erosion of our rights, freedom and “democracy”, a word that Harper does not cease to ostentate and that sounds so meaningless on his lips.
This is the moment when there is no more morality: you can abuse, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen according to the discretion of a so far minority government leader (to see what will happen after October 14...).
Many voters believe that a party that preaches the Virtue, the Respect of the Law and the Order represents salvation: they do not see that this government has renounced what constituted the reputation and dignity of our country.
Here is the shame, Mr. Toews, in giving up all this, and none else.
Free Opinion - Barrick Gold's Orwell's Speech
In the September 17 edition, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, Vice President Director of the Canadian mining company Barrick Gold.
Following an orwellian logic, the latter affirms that the world’s largest aurifera company has sported a six-million-long diffamation dispute against three authors and a small editing house squattrined with the intention of launching a “transparent public debate.”
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth they judge, especially in the case of a dispute for defamation, but the law.
Without any surprise, this substantial difference is completely hidden by Garver.
Because for Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate would be to ruin anyone who will support a position contrary to his own.
No matter the result of the trial, the writers and the publisher of the book Canada Black will have to spend a sum of money in order to organize their own defense and fight, with decisively learned weapons, against an army of lawyers funded by the pockets practically without funding of the mining company.
On the other hand, in these arms-learning struggles, the tactic is often that of destroying the agreed in order to impose a consensus regulation that disadvantages the opposition in addition to frightening anyone who is hesitating to react on the matter again.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it is before the public that it would have to present its own vision of the facts.
Contrary to what is happening in many countries where Barrick Gold works, in Canada the debates are normally taking place with the exchange of opinions and not with the manganese.
It would therefore be enough for the society to open its books, its documents, and establish a real debate, through newspapers, media, publications and the financing of teams of independent researchers that could have made light on the issue.
But Barrick Gold doesn’t seem to have too much trust in the public and rejects in a bad way the petitions and letters to support the authors of Canada Black.
Per Garver could explain how he can ask for a “public” debate when his contempt for that same audience is quite obvious?
In the world of the Vice-President, it seems that this word indicates exclusively the profoundly paid lawyers and not the whole of the Canadians; here is a rather narrow view of the concept.
In a democratic system, even denigrators have the right of speech.
What Barrack Gold doesn’t understand – or doesn’t want to understand – is that the audience that supports the authors and publishers of Canada Black does it first and foremost because it rejects the brutal means adopted by the mining company.
This audience is ready to listen to Barrick and to judge, but on the basis of civilian exchanges of opinions, and not in the perspective of what many perceive as a kind of disadvantage (requesting the "public debate", Barrick Gold just gave the authors of Canada Black an ultimatum intimidating them to suspend the use of that word...)
Beyond Garver’s surreal speech, the Barrack Gold’s sports dispute constitutes a direct attack on university research freedom and the pursuit of truth, indispensable in every democratic society.
It denies in block the right to the citation of authentic sources and to the debate on facts and interpretations, which constitute the basis of intellectual work itself.
If in a country like Canada it is impossible to study and discuss on uncomfortable topics to the richest companies in the world, pen many disputes, who can do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could do so by following the scientific rules as the authors of Black Canada do.
He has the right to reply.
For a long time, the university environment, of which we are part, is able to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold’s excessive measures clearly show that, contrary to his claims, it does not seek a transparent debate at all.
This goes out of the university world, as is the same public debate in Canada, and it is now that governments take measures that can limit abusive disputes.
Operation – Rescue for Wall Street – Dialogue between Republicans and Democrats
The Bush administration and the chiefs of Congress, representatives of the Republican and Democratic Shield, finally reached an agreement on the largest rescue-finance plan after the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the $700 billion plan, which aims to hinder the financial crisis that has been on Wall Street for months, is still to be ratified by the two chambers of Congress.
In particular, it provides for: verification of its actual implementation by elected leaders, new mechanisms to guarantee the refund of public money, new provisions to contain the number of houses pignored for failure to pay, as well as a right of inspection on remunerations paid to the managers of protected enterprises.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, President of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi and Republican representative at the negotiation table Senator Judd Gregg announced the good news a few minutes after midnight, yesterday, at the end of a two-day negotiation marathon.
“We’ve made great progress towards an effective market agreement,” Bush administration representative Henry Paulson said.
“Every decision has been made in such a way as to safeguard the American economy and people from the current crisis in Wall Street,” he said.
"It's the crucial point: if we didn't act in this way, unprecedented discomfort and disturbances would have risen to the everyday life of the Americans," said Republican Judd Gregg.
The conclusion of the negotiations was marked by concerns about the impact of a new failure on investors.
The agreed deadline corresponded to the opening of the markets this morning.
United later to the negotiation, the two candidates for the U.S. presidential elections showed themselves quite favorable to the agreement, without however avoiding expressing their dissatisfaction before the adoption of extreme solutions.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama is deserved to have added some provisions to the agreement, in particular the one that will allow owners to maintain their domicile and the one inherent to the remunerations intended to the leaders of state-covered enterprises.
“When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures due to the irresponsibility of others, there is nothing to rejoice.
But these measures are necessary," he commented on the screen of the American television.
Interviewed on another channel to know if he will vote for the plan, his Republican opponent, John McCain, replied: "I would like to analyze the details, but I hope yes."
“As I have read, it’s something that we all have to digest and that will allow us to move forward.”
The option of a non-intervention is simply unacceptable,” he said.
The $700 billion plan aims to recover with the money of taxpayers the doubts, risky and invendable assets of the U.S. financial institutions.
The plan comes after 14 months of crisis due to the outbreak of a real estate bull that first led to the collapse of risk-of-risk mortgage credits (mutui), then extends to other more common forms of credit securities (PCAAs) and throw into liquidity freezing and banks and financial institutions dismissal.
It was a group of Republicans in charge to send to the air the first draft of an agreement, last week.
They seem to have come out of that blind gap since the Democrats have accepted that the “toxic” asset of some difficulties is only protected by the government, rather than purchased.
In order to meet everyone, the Congress added a provision that, if the government had to face losses over the next five years due to such a program, it could impose new taxes in order to maintain its balance.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first amount of 250 billion, which can be added to another 100 billion if the president considers it necessary.
The payment of $350 billion is expected to be ratified by a further vote by Congress.
In exchange for his aid, Washington will get share quotas in protected companies that will turn his dividends in case of profit and that will be able to sell when the waters are calmed.
In accordance with the plan, the federal government will have the opportunity to delay the pignoration procedures relating to real estate loans and to set limits to the remuneration and departure fees paid to the managers of the companies involved.
Starting today, the architects of the plan would want to submit it to the House of Representatives vote, and to the Senate vote on Wednesday.
Despite all the efforts, it is still uncertain that the free path will be given to their plan.
In fact, yesterday there were several votes against the project, both at the Republican and Democratic square.
“Obviously, Washington doesn’t hear you,” Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House’s financial committee, said in a statement.
“We have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
Not to take advantage of taxpayers.
Leader of a small group in Congress called "the caucus of the skeptics", Democratic representative Brad Sherman presents the situation differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
“Four hundred prominent economists, including three Nobel prizes, have written to us to say, ‘We ask Congress not to draw disturbed conclusions and to carefully examine the way to take,’ he said.
At the same time, in Europe, the test of the global nature of the crisis was witnessed again.
After an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion dollars).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary when the French bank BNS Paribas announced that it would give up the purchase of its competitor, in full failure after the loss of 2 billion euros (2.9 billion dollars) for the risky real estate loans crisis in the United States.
Fortis has 85,000 employees and is one of the 20 largest banks in Europe and the ten largest insurance companies.
“It’s not money lost,” said Dutch finance minister Wouter Bos.
In return, influence and voting rights in banking matters are recovered.
It is something that savings and families appreciate now that the times are uncertain.”
During this period, at the other end of the Manica, the British government seems to be on the way to nationalize another bank in the midst of the financial crisis.
According to the British press, the government would take charge of the total of current loans to the Bradford and Bringley bank, of which more than 41 billion ($75,5 billion) of real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it will buy the British bank’s subsidiaries and customer accounts.
From the beginning of the economic crisis, Bradford and Bringley will be the second bank, after the Northern Rock, to undergo a process of nationalization by the British government.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of an Icon
The beauty of the blue eyes was for a long time his axis in the manic, for others his weakness.
He was released from the narcissistic mirror, the American actor from the bleeding smile?
Yes and no.
His discretion, sensitivity and obvious talent would have expelled him from that circle of powers dedicated to true and own sacred monsters.
What a constant!
Paul Newman, who died on Friday, at the age of 83, in his ranch in Connecticut, following a lung cancer, remains one of the last icons of American cinema of the past few years.
Less monumental of Brando, to whom he liked and of whom he was a kind of rival on the screen, more prudent in his game, more fragile, but he also speaks of freedom and the development of dramatic convictions.
Of mixed couples often are born magical children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, by a German Jewish father and mother of Hungarian origin.
From these European roots will be born one of the glorious visions of the American dream.
A humble ego, the last mark of quality.
Since in him it was recognized a whole country of the safe made man, the Pacific war fighter, proud of fighting, who at the beginning of the 1950s studied dramatic art in Yale, later attended the Actor Studio of New York, before triumphing in theatre, television and early in the cinema.
The same human rights activist was also the car driver who ranked himself according to the 24 Hours of Mans in 1979, as well as sex symbol, although part of a model couple since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
If you go with him the shadows of a secret, discreet, engaged star, allergic to the scandals of the show-business, whose mystery will never be able to fully reveal.
A honest man, in the most noble sense of the term.
This weekend Paul Newman's disappearance has been a turmoil in the heart for filmmakers, while his great characters populate the black screen of memories.
More than half a century of American cinema in full transformation is repeated through its interpretations.
They confuse in memory the fascinating cowboy of Butch Cassidy (1969) and that boy unable to desire the focused wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in The Cat on the Roof Shooting adapted by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
More recently, we remember it in the bricks of the sensitive Mr. Bridge (1990), disturbed by a marriage that did not keep as promised.
Many other Paul Newman have passed into history.
The boxer Rocky Graziano, criminal, tormented, violent, unforgettable in Lassou someone loves me, by Robert Wise, a role destined to James Dean and replay after his death, which officially launched Newman in 1956.
The sympathetic disappearing in the excellent Stangata, Oscar for Best Movie in 1973.
A bitter and vengeant billard player in The Spacey, a magnificent film by Robert Rossen (1961), The Color of Money by Martin Scorsese, who was awarded him in 1987 the only Oscar on 9 nominations.
That face through the years, was yours.
And yet he.
The times pass through their path.
The young people know him mostly for the cult movie Slap Shot – George Roy Hill’s Dry Shot (1977), in the role of Reggie Dunlop, trainer of an unorthodox ice hockey team.
His fans found him in 1994 in Mr. Hula Hoop, the Coen brothers.
The circle was closed with a last role as the master of the Irish mafia in Era mio padre, in 2003.
Unlike the greatest film legends that soon abandoned the profession, Newman will stay long in the halls, denouncing Hollywood throughout its shadow, holidays and concessions.
Bertrand Tavernier, a French filmmaker, called it, with an irony point, “a living challenge to underplaying,” judging exaggerated his performances.
The profession has not always been a game for the beautiful Paul Newman, to which the roles seemed to fall like a manna from heaven.
However, he often preferred the role of the marginalised than that of the young actor: neurotic, alcoholic, or desperate characters, whom he expressed throwing and rebellion with his perfect traits.
As a director, Newman revealed unknown nuances of his true, pudic sensitivity.
The first time Jennifer, in 1968 (based on the novel of Canadian Margaret Laurence), with her wife Joanne Woodward in the role of the protagonist, traced a thin female portrait of melancholia.
He, who lost his son Scott for a overdose, dedicated him in 1984 the film Harry and Son, a discreet and sad film.
Among the countless tribute on Newman yesterday, his great friend and old arms companion Robert Redford (he had recited together in La Stangata and Butch Cassidy) said with infinite sadness: "His presence has made my life and this country better."
Generosity and love for life, two great features of the missing actor.
Beyond a legendary career, a great activist for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, a controversy of the Hollywoodian deriva is thus shut down.
We’ll have stretched her face spike on bottles of acetate, sauces, biscuits and other foods, judging her a choice of bad taste, although born as gag.
The revenue of those sales was, however, intended to its Children’s Foundation in Difficulty.
Newman, instead of adjusting to his myth, chose to commit to the end.
He left to his five daughters a letter saying, “Always and until the end, your father was incredibly grateful to his good star.
It was a privilege.”
And the same privilege was for us to follow the path of such a clear and generous American artist.
Citizen model, so, and much more.
What was produced in Zuschlag Factory & Partners?
In short, on 8 October, the hearing of the criminal proceedings against János Zuschlag and its partners will be discussed.
The politician and his members are accused of repeated commercial fraud committed within the framework of a crime association that caused significant damage, and of other crimes, including the falsification of documents.
According to the Prosecura the money obtained by bands of competition, was used by them for private purposes, and they often certified the performance of the activities through false invoices.
The state and municipal money, in a total of 65 million flowers, has ended in part in the Fiatal Baloldal’s funds, in part in the pockets of some people.
According to the method, which was made known by the investigative authorities, they took the money obtained from competition bands on the basis of invoices for non-existing transactions and the associations never fulfilled the obligations assumed.
According to the accusation, much of the bills were false.
To do so, the bill blocks were purchased at the Józsefváros market, and the circular stamps were manufactured in Kiskunhalas.
And to decide on behalf of which companies to issue the invoices, it was established among others during the tour between the hills above the Balaton where János Zuschlag had sent István Lados.
According to the confession of this latter he had to choose pensions and restaurants.
He asked for a bill for the consumptions, on the model of these then the bills to be submitted to the competition bands were prepared, among others, to those of the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs and the Municipality of Budapest.
Most of these are works by István Lados and András Őri who, according to our information, has prepared above all the reports necessary to obtain the funding.
One of the choices of Lados’ “Travel Studies” was a beer store.
According to two bills issued by Zuschlag and partners in 2003, the restaurant provided meals to a group of 90 people from the Biztos Pont Egyesület Association.
So so many people, however, according to the restorator, would not all come together into the site.
Similarly, the bill issued in the summer of 2002 to the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, later named Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért, a bulk of formal errors and content.
A pension in Badacsonytomaj has only three rooms, more than 10 people could not stay, but in the bill were 130 guests.
But the compilators of the bills full of fantasy exaggerated when they the Pigal Kft., also the restaurant, in which accounting – according to the information issued to the judicial authorities – did not even contain the documents on behalf of the companies Jobb Jövőért and Hoppá.
Győző Farkas, the company’s manager, told hvg.hu that when he was called to prosecutor’s office and the bills were shown to him, he immediately realized that it was false documents.
"On the stamp the name and the Iva game of our company were in a wrong point."
He added: In addition to formal reasons, it was not even the fact that according to the invoice hundreds of people were housed, when in total they have eleven rooms and there are not so many beds.
By the time the invoice was a restaurant and their restaurant was no longer in operation for a long time.
The taxpayers did not worry about informing themselves that the Budapest travel agency of their choice, organizes only travel abroad, so they shockedly indicated on the invoice with cash travel to Hungary, which did not agree with the practice of issuing the company’s invoices.
In addition, as shown during the investigation, the invoice also included the IVA, while the activity of travel to countries outside the European Union is exempt from IVA.
Among other things, the amount of the IVA was wrong on the four documents issued by Hotel Révfülöp Kft. in favour of the Jobb Jövőért foundation, in fact on the services offered by the company the IVA should be applied at 15% and not at 25% as indicated on the invoices, in addition, the hotel employees issued only printed invoices, while the made invoice was handwritten.
In addition to this, the “emittents” destroyed other invoices, in the case of a company they indicated as the activity carried out the transport of goods on the road, as it comes to know from the Prosecutor’s procedure, the activity that was not carried out by the company founded originally for investment advice.
Furthermore, for formal defects - cause inappropriate invoice format, false stamp - it was found that the invoices issued in favour of Együtt in Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, of XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont are false.
The same happened in the case of the Ravenna Bt. or the Kunfehértó Sports Camp, whose representatives refused to have issued the bills in question.
The counterfeitors did not pay attention even to the fact that the HIB Kft. of Nyíregyháza was in liquidation when (2001) a group of Fiatal Városért Egyesület took it, just for this reason the curator of the liquidation of the company, according to our information, denied that he had issued that invoice.
They made bills consciously.
Another group of invoicers consists of those who were aware of having to issue fictitious invoices.
The Esély Budapestért Alapítvány issued a bill on request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták in favour of the Együtt Foundation in Harmadik Évezredért of 4 million florins.
Ludovic Györfi, one of the accused, according to the accusation act, persuaded the director of the Collab Kft. to issue fictitious invoices.
He has collaborated with Zuschlag and members also the Biogate Kft currently in liquidation, which in 2003 provided bills issued for a value of approximately 5 million flowers to the Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány foundation, the Atlasz Egyesület association and the Vörösfenyő Egyesület association, behind which there was no real economic activity.
Not even money movement because the prepared invoices were then stunned, but the associations forgot to make this aspect appear in their documents.
The following group of companies issuing invoices belong to those that are connected with the accused.
For example, Ivan Kubatov, authorized at the headquarters of the General Director of the Delta Trió Kft, headquarters in Budapest but not found there, who is engaged in fuel and car trade.
The company issued various bills in October, November and December 2005 concerning the sale of computer media, for a value of about 18 million flowers.
According to the data of the investigation, Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas under liquidation since September 14, 2005 purchased these invoices.
The CEO of this company was a Romanian to whom between 2002 and 2005 Ivan Kubatov would submit the documents relating to the company.
As we know, Kubatov, during the investigation, acknowledged that he issued bills on behalf of the company to the companies Atlasz, Hoppá and Együtt at Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány and the countervalue was taken by him.
On the express request of Ivan Kubatov, Romanian murators founded the Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
In fact, none of the companies were operational, because according to the accused they had not received work.
However, the companies became useful to him because at the request of the co-advocate Zsolt Szente, editor of the founding documents of the companies, in the name of the companies were issued invoices to the associations related to Zuschlag: atlasz and Y-Generation.
On behalf of the companies Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade Kubatov issued 15 invoices for a total value of 14.2 million flowers.
The prosecutor's opinion is that Kubatov has lost 10% of the amounts indicated on the bills, as well as the IVA.
The man also used the Szi-Beri Bt. to issue fictitious invoices, made for the competition band of Biztos Pont.
Y-Generáció and Szövetség in Modern Magyarországért in January 2006 presented a ban for the Socialist Party’s public utility body, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA).
They also won 500,000 flowers at the head but the amounts were not used for the purposes indicated in the band.
For this not to come to a glimpse, they presented to TMA five fictitious invoices received by Works Team Kft.
These bills were found during the search of the office of Árpád Kemecsei at the Ministry of Public Education.
At the hearing, some of the accused, as they have already done in the prosecutor's office, will probably report the progress in the production of the invoices.
However, the most interesting thing could be if the number one accused, János Zuschlag, would decide to lift the veil over everything.
His confession so far has not been very detailed and although he has promised several times to talk about everything extensively, he has not yet done it.
It needs to be seen if it is in his interest, it could also be that the socialists have signed agreements with Zusi, who - in exchange for a compensation of 50 million flowers, much of the damage - would be willing to make the spying bear.
Zuschlag could have also offended himself for now because his requests for relief of his prison conditions, i.e. the concession of domestic arrest, have not yet been fulfilled.
While the perpetrators of non-refundable commercial crimes and causing much greater damage can freely walk or at least wait at home the end of the proceedings against them, which is not granted to him.
The psychology of excess tendering: why spend more money?
At the auctions, buyers are likely to spend more, to overestimate the goods.
Neurologists and economists researchers at the University of New York have managed to discover the neuroeconomic bases of this known and apparently irrational behavior.
According to their study appeared on the Science magazine men don’t want to stay behind in a race such as the eBay auction, so they’re available to pay even a higher price.
The research sought to track the nervous scheme of this "party" at the nervous system level through experimental exchanges.
A group of volunteers played the lottery, the other group of players participated in an auction while using the functional magnetic resonance method (fMRI) they examined the active areas of the brain of the people participating in the experiment.
In both games the participants could win money, but in the auction game, where the essential element is to offer more than the other, the striated body under the brain cortex intensely enters into function when you lose the game.
This area of the brain, in addition to other functions, plays a role in the mechanism of the nervous system’s “autogramation”.
Therefore, according to the researchers, the price rise is explained by scanning the vein reaction of the striated body.
To support their theory, the research group’s economists conducted a financial follow-up survey.
In this investigation, three groups complained against a partner under different conditions.
The control group how much the actual value of the product in question was and they made their pointing.
In addition to this, they promised that in case of victory they will receive another $15 prize.
The third group would receive $15 before the auction, but the group members would lose the money in case of loss at the auction.
The difference between the two groups consisted in the fact that for one of them the victory was highlighted, while for the other the loss.
Understood the hypothesis of the neurologists, the members of the group that played "contra loss" were willing to score higher than the control group or "vinced".
"These findings are not deductible from any of the previously existing economic theories.
In fact, these so far explained the phenomena that can be met at the auctions with the joy of winning and with the avoidance of risk.
Only the methods of creating the neurological image helped solve the contradiction between the two theories, so we came to a third explanation,” said Andrew Schotter, professor of the Faculty of Economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When to go to a doctor?
Nearly half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, but in Hungary among the first causes of death are mentioned chronic liver diseases.
In Hungary, the number of patients with hepatitis rises to a hundred thousand, of which only 7,000 are treated: the reason is that many patients do not know that they are infected.
The definition of hepatitis is the collective name of infectious liver diseases caused by various viruses.
There are many similarities between the symptoms, typical are hepatitis and irritis, but their pathogens and caused diseases differ from each other.
Hepatitis viruses spread in two main forms depending on the pathogen: hepatitis A and E through the food channel (e.g. water and infected foods), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with blood and organic fluids (sperm, vaginal loss, saliva).
For travelers it is useful to vaccinate against the virus A and B, against the C there is no vaccine.
The symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after eating infected foods, accompanied by general discomfort, weakness, abdominal pain and nausea.
After yellow spots are formed on the skin and on the white of the eyes, the spots become clear and the urine is dark, healing takes place within two to three weeks.
A million people die every year worldwide for hepatitis B, the most severe variant of the disease, which causes liver tumors and liver cirrhosis.
The main reason is, according to estimates, that only one in ten people receive pharmacological treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: if not treated, it can cause liver cirrhosis and liver tumors.
Most infected people don’t know they’ve contracted the disease because the pathogens sublimely destroy the liver cells, in many cases the first symptoms appear after 20-30 years.
Therefore, it is very important to prevent and perform regular medical tests.
This disease is much more common than the average in three groups: those who had a blood transfusion before 1991, drug addicts and tattoos.
In the world, the number of people infected with the virus of chronic hepatitis C is 200 million.
Since even a routine laboratory examination reveals the disease, it is worth contacting the family doctor when you notice any symptoms of unknown origin.
Recognized in time the disease is healable, the virus can be removed from the body, so the infectious power ceases and the formation of tumors can be prevented.
September 30 is the World Hepatitis Day, organized for the first time in the world in 2004 by associations of patients.
The aim is to draw attention to chronic viral hepatitis, the causes of its development and the early recognition of the disease.
Who believes in God feels less pain?
According to the results of a recent investigation, the religious faith works as a species of analgesic that made the death of Catholic martyrs more tolerable.
Scientists at the University of Oxford conducted an interesting experiment, examining how faith in God influences the feeling of pain, the British Telegraph.
In the framework of this bizarre investigation, a electro-shock was carried out on 12 Catholic believers and atheists, while all of them observed a painting of the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to reject much of the pain.
Thanks to the exploration technique of the human brain it was discovered that Catholics were able to activate the part of the brain responsible for control of pain.
The test is the first of a series of research in which in addition to the academics also participate scientists, philosophers and theologists of the University.
The test took place exactly this way: an instrument that emits outputs and passes the electroshock was connected to the left hand of the subject of the experiment.
The researchers asked the participants to focus on two paintings, the Virgin Mary painted in the 17th century by Sassoferrato and the Lady with the herd of Leonardo da Vinci painted in the 15th century.
The authors of the examination hoped that the image of the Virgin Mary originated a kind of religious state among the believers, while the picture of Leonardo was chosen because it didn’t differ too much from the other and they thought it was a calming effect.
The subjects of the experiment spent half an hour in front of the MRI scanner and in this hour of time they received 20 electroshocks in four consecutive series, while observing either the religious theme painting or the other.
The Catholics that the vision of the Virgin Mary made them feel “safe”, as if “somebody took care” of them and “they were calmed and pervased by peace.”
Looking at the image on religious theme they realized 12% less pain than when they had the work of Leonardo in front of themselves.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who took part himself in the test, believes that a similar result can be achieved with any image of the strong effect even for the atheists, but it is necessary to find the right image.
“We have to look for an image to which they feed very positive feelings, such as a mother or a father,” the psychologist said.
Anglican bishop Tom Wright was pleased with the result of the research.
“The practice of faith should change, and in many cases it manages to change our personality,” Wright added.
After the great results remains the question if the painting of a Madonna of Leonardo or another painter of a similar calibre is presented to the believers, what effect could it have on pain control?
The vision of a quality Virgin Mary would bring better results?
You are what you say about yourself.
On the day of their 10th birthday, Google can say they are both in people’s pockets and in heaven above their heads; they know where they have spent their holidays, what ambulance they attend and what interests them.
This, however, according to Eric Schmidt, one of the company’s directors, is not enough yet.
As for the skeptics who make a comparison with the orwellian hole, they don’t see exactly the substance of the web 2.0.
Recently, Eric Schmidt told the Financial Times that Google’s main purpose is to collect as many personal data of its users and this is necessary to adhere to the original goal of Google’s founders that was: “Let us insert all the information of the world into a system!”
According to the director of Google interviewed the company, after 10 years of revolutionary work, it is still at the beginning of being able to manage all the information.
At the question what will happen in five years Schmidt replied: he would like if Google knew how to answer questions like "what do I tomorrow?" or "what would be the job right for me?", but the software doesn't know how to answer apparently simple questions because they don't know enough about users.
Not all internet users are aware that during their internet searches exactly the searched words are recorded, from which IP address they are searched and on which page the interested parties stop after the search.
Through the Personalized Search launched two years ago users to e.g. can store their browsing history, they can refer to what they have sought and clicked, these then long go will generate results on the scale much better; on this same logic it is based on Recommendations with which the system offers us products and services according to our previously declared and registered preferences.
What happens if my data is used against me, if they look at what I’m careful about? – they ask concerned users about Google’s data monopoly.
In the majority of cases, the internet users’ controreations are caused by the fear proven by the size of the potential power represented by the company, and not by the sense of guilt, by the fear of punishment, by the desire for freedom or even by the rebellion to power.
However, one fact is confirmed and that all the expressions sought are not only recorded but in reasonable cases can also be provided to third parties, in such legal cases nothing defends the personal rights of the Internet users.
The most brilliant example of this in recent times was the coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, in which Google submitted to the Brazilian government the information that made possible the identification of pedophiles from the Orkut community pageined by Google.
Internet users worried about personal rights, however, suspected of relief in May when the company – in agreement with the electronic legal protection association EFF – successfully demonstrated the truth in court against the FBI: not even later it can not force Google with no point of the constitution to provide any information secretly requested by the FBI.
(At the same time, the federal government has successfully removed 50,000 web addresses and a thousand search expressions obtained in reference to the confirmation of the child protection law approved years earlier, but yet it failed to get the search lists of individual users and the entire list of web pages and keywords from two months.)
Google’s judgment is, therefore, quite contradictory: those who fear to provide their personal data shrink Google because they believe that thus their intimate sphere and privacy will be inflated by starting to use its services and rise up with the spectacular rebellion to the multinational companies that shrink for the conservative image.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and the proliferation of fans, activists and computer users appearing in many countries see in them the future generation of big companies, the “cool corporation”, unlike their rival, the Microsoft liquidated as the world conqueror because of Windows, as long as both fight for the same goal.
This can happen because Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask its users for an identification code, does not ask for money for its services, the source code always kept up-to-date and the program package is much more accessible, young and cool than the official practice of the huge software.
But it can also happen because geeks see exactly the problematic relationship between personal rights and the internet, which implies just one of the most frequently repeated keywords in recent years, the web 2.0.
Web 2.0 is nothing more than collaboration, intentionally leaving traces behind us and exploiting the communication channels available to us and while the size of these changes for each individual, the substance is the same: showing ourselves.
A young medium can create profiles on multiple community pages, from Facebook to Xanga, can link them with other services such as Twitter or last.fm that lists his music tastes, all of these can insert them into systems such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, can also write blogs on which automatically appear his latest photo galleries stored on Flickr or Picasa.
At the same time, we read a number of examples from which it turns out clear that the girl, seeing the series of photos taken in the morning from the common circle of friends, comes to know easily with whom she spent the night her foolish guy or a company can release her employee because she wrote a sincere opinion on the business summit: one thing is safe, the concept of private life now has been completely reconsidered.
Who lives an online life makes way to show himself and so we can formulate the fundamental thesis that is hiding behind the behavior of young people.
Those who want to hide something or just want to avoid Google's monopoly can do it (for example, starting with Scroogle using Google's search system but who at the same time does not voluntarily leave traces).
There are few people who don’t log out to community pages to not be found, Google’s online applications, from text processing to image management and news collection, can be replaced with alternative versions not linked to huge server parks and which do not make up our best profile so far.
The public opinion is not even so secretly waiting for the time when Google will pull out the papers.
Currently, the company with its $156 billion worth is more valuable than IBM (140 billion dollars), Intel (124 billion dollars) or Coca-Cola (110 billion dollars), AdWords/AdSense advertising spaces threaten advertising agencies’ revenue, and record-time services instead cause great disadvantages not only to Microsoft but also to numerous software developers.
However, the critical observers next to all this find some alarming points: for example, the corporate summit has completely rejected employees’ protest after doubling the corporate asylum right, considered too expensive the repeated daily restoration to the pleasure of employees, but all this decreases in front of the fact that in 2006 Google chanted the head to the Chinese government and in accordance with their agreement the company will filter all the results that offend the good taste and interests of the Chinese regime.
An internal rule of the company seems to be not to announce a new service in advance but only when it will be usable, one thing is, however, certain, that the predictable problems of the coming months and years will turn the world to a point: while some believe that the scanning and archiving project of books and magazines of Google will take proportions such that the company will soon be facing the Supreme Court of America, others are afraid of the Health system, faults in this we can create our health profile with our referents, doctors and problems.
The fact then that Google is building a genetic database can offer good material to the next generation of science fiction writers, the Scroogled story of the famous Cory Doctorow describes the future with orwellian accents, in which a man with Google data can be approached in an alarming way.
Two minors helped the double killer of Ózd to make the traces disappear
Police have interrogated two minors about the double assassination of Ózd, reasonably suspected of helping to disappear the traces of the crime, the spokesman for the Police Investigation in the Borsod region said on Tuesday.
The young people have acknowledged the crime and are currently accused of favour.
The two minors, two girls, according to the MTI information, defend themselves on a free foot.
Promotion is punishable up to 5 years in prison.
The suspect of the double murder of Ózd, a 23-year-old man on the site, was placed in pre-arrest on Sunday.
He is suspected of a premeditated murder committed for profit.
The investigation found that the young twenty-three had a big debt with a man of 53 years old.
The suspect did not want to pay the debt, for this reason last Wednesday he caught his creditors in an Ozd farm where he killed him and his nine-year-old daughter.
According to the MTI information the young man was prepared to commit the crime, a signal is that he committed the murder with a hidden weapon on the place.
Police are examining the weapon and the circumstances of use with the involvement of an expert.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange made an offer for the purchase of the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered 200 million euros, about 5 billion Czech crowns, for the purchase of 100% of the stock list of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, chairman of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer advanced by the Poles despite the Czechs had previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange as a possible buyer of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason for the exclusion is the fact that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is owned by the state.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which intends to sell over a few months more than 60% of its securities.
The Czech financial newspaper E15 says that the Polish offer represents the highest figure ever advanced for the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Transatlantic Stock Exchange Nasdaq, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the German Stock Exchange have presented an offer.
Petr Koblic, director of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that among all stakeholders the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst owner and did not exclude that this could lead to the closure of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange in 5-10 billion crowns.
According to the agreement of the shareholders would be sold almost 90% of the securities.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is Patria Finance with a share of 25%, followed by Banca Česká Spořitelna with 14.7% and Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5%
Economic crisis from the European newspaper’s perspective
The major European newspapers in their comments on Tuesday dedicated to the international economic crisis already speak of "a second 11 September."
The global financial disaster took place thanks to the U.S. president – accuses the Republic – who was unable to compete his party behind a rapidly overwhelmed law, whose purpose is to remedy a desperate situation.
Instead of a second Pearl Harbour, as the billionaire superfinancer Warren Buffett said, it would be more accurate to talk about a second 11 September.
Even a part of the Madrid press sees the spyware capro in Washington.
According to El Mundo, the lack of U.S. political leadership has thrown the world economy on the corner of the bar.
The risk of the collapse of the U.S. financial system is increasing and the world will suffer from it.
Bush's plan was not perfect but as a result of Congress voting there is the danger that Washington will not offer a political means to manage the crisis.
The world economy is suspended in the air, just when the greatest transformation in the history of capitalism is taking place.
It is no longer possible to overthrow the threat, says the Geneva Tages-Anzeiger.
Some states today can still offer a rescue pillow to the bankrupt financial institutions and with the money of taxpayers can save them from failure.
But if more and more banks collapse like in a domino effect then neither financial means nor new improvised solutions will be enough.
On the long run, it is necessary for the EU member states to overcome their national egoism and to concentrate control on the fragmented financial markets.
Only on Monday the weak financial institutions received more than 100 billion euros, the Vienna Der Standard reminds that the concerns that even European taxpayers, like the Americans, will have to put their own portfolio in order to remedy the crisis appear more and more real.
Until now, the EU has not been very concerned about the crisis that has crossed the old continent as a tsunami.
The "savers" do not have to waste the 100 billion euros immediately, yet it would be better if they determine in which case it is appropriate to touch the taxpayers' money to prevent greater damages.
The smart car imitates the flight of the calabrone
What could be the best method to develop collision technology if you don’t imitate the sensors of obstacles that are in nature?
For example, the bees.
In the surprising project presented to the CEATEC in Japan, the calabrons gave the initial strategic point to Nissan engineers on how to build the next generation of collision anti-system.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built the biomimetic robot BR23C, a robotic mining car equipped with bee properties, with the final purpose of creating a system that can scan all collisions.
Flying bees form their own personal oval space that really resembles our protective shield – explained Kazuhiro Doi, director of the PR technology and research and development industry.
Important is the role of the eyesight of the apes, capable of a vision of 300 degrees in each direction.
The engineers have focused on the idea of telemetry laser to copy the function of apes vision.
The BR23C detects barriers up to two meters away within a radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance and sends a signal to the board microprocessor that immediately turns it into a command to avoid collision.
In a fraction of a second the robot perceives the obstacle and then, imitating the beef movements, immediately changes direction by turning the wheels to the necessary measure to avoid the accident.
This avoidance maneuver, in a way different from the current system, takes place in a completely instinctive way.
"If not so, the car robot would not know how to react quickly to avoid collisions," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and the robot car project.
It must react instinctively and immediately because this technology corresponds to the damaging and more internal layer of the protective shield, within which the collision is currently considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect what a bee does to avoid the other bees.
This process must take place in an eye bite.
But unlike the bees, the deviation cannot go up or down or in diagonal, it can only be two-dimensional and in the direction of wheels.
In this way, instead of the infinite possibilities available to bees to scan the other bees, the robot, as a possibility available, can rotate on himself, accelerate and slow down.
The BR23C is powered by lithium polymer batteries, lighter and high energy density, which means their duration is greater than the lithium ions.
According to Andoh, the instantaneity of the intelligent reaction is important, not the processing of data or even less the ability to store them.
This robot must process some input in a few seconds and react.
There is no need to store them and respond with intuitive logic based on previous maneuver data, so it uses only a memory of a few dozen Kb.
There is no need for a gigabyte or megabyte memory.
This is the first step towards the development of a technology for immediate collision prevention that, according to Nissan, will be installed on serial vehicles within 10 years.
Further possibility of application can be represented by the unification with the GPS satellite navigation system that avoiding the obstacles on the road leads to the destination.
They also found the baby’s name very expensive.
The written version of the $700 billion economic rescue law for the purchase of disproportionate loans, to be applied in multiple parts, has been drawn up.
In the first step, half of the amount is spent.
In the new agreements negotiated until midnight on Saturday according to the Eastern Coast time, Congress leaders decided the $700 billion rescue plan after a debate that lasted for days, Reuters.
“We’ve made serious steps forward,” said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic President of the House of Representatives, saying it’s only left to put the agreement on paper.
Both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain, supported the compromise of the plan.
The Treasury Minister Henry Paulson speaking of the result of the compromise said: the program will work and will be effective, but there’s still a lot to do. According to Pelosi, it’s not the rescue of Wall Street but the inversion of the economic car.
The written version of the plan was made public before the opening of the Asian markets at 8 a.m. Washington (the 2 a.m. Monday night according to the Central European time), but did not bring a great growth in stock exchanges.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will vote for the first time the designated 2008 economic stabilization bill on the programme, then it will touch the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke with the Pelosi on Saturday evening, then welcomed the news of the deal with the White House with pleasure.
We are pleased with the progress achieved in the afternoon and we appreciate the efforts of the two parties to stabilize our financial markets and defend the economy, White House spokesman Tony Fratto said.
The program, however, differs from the original proposal of the Bush administration, which predicted that the $700 billion would all be spent on the purchase of securities with disproportionate loans behind.
Now as the first step we will be able to spend up to half of the amount of $700 billion, 250 billion immediately after Monday's Congress vote, with these the Treasury Ministry will buy securities with disproportionate loans behind, the fate of the remaining $100 billion will be decided by the president.
A special college will monitor the program, which also takes part by the President of the Federal Reserve.
The other half of the $700 billion expenditure depends on a new decree of Congress.
According to the law, the Treasury Ministry can apply a combined tactic: it can at the same time buy credits, mortgages and securities with mortgages and other types of "poisoned" credits.
The purchase can take place through auctions and directly - the ministry's competent officials announced.
The legal rule makes it possible for stakeholders to participate in an insurance program where the Treasury Ministry guarantees the means that cause concern, for which companies will pay an adequate price to the likely damages.
Henrz Paulson said: the law gives the means necessary for $700 billion to come to the urgent needs of the U.S. monetary system, whether it is the purchase of wrong financial means, or their insurance, or to avoid the risk of the collapse of a large financial institution.
We will take all the necessary steps to make us ready to introduce the newly signed law - he added.
The directors of the banks in crisis and waiting for state aid think instead that the government will limit their well-being, defined by the overseas slang simply as gold paracadute.
Limitations of payments will only occur in some cases, in addition, the limitations depend on how the Treasury Ministry will offer the help.
In essence, the limitation means that if the ministry will buy under an auction, it will impose a surcharge on the gold parachute, if they will not retire the bank director decayed.
At the time of the direct purchase of disproportionate loans the government will intervene aggressively to ensure that the money of the directors is not exaggerated.
It should be added that the already existing contracts of the Golden Paracade will not change, the limitation is valid only for the new ones to encourage participation in the program.
This is the first case in American history of the entry into force of a legal limitation regarding the salary of the general administrators - commented the measure the democratic Barney Frank chairman of the committee responsible for the financial services of the House of Representatives.
Furthermore, the state has the right to appropriate a share of the banks participating in the program, reducing the risk of taxpayers, since in the end they can also earn us if the economy, and along with it the saved bank, will recover.
The proposal includes that in the next five years the president must submit to the Congress a proposal that has the way to refund to taxpayers the expected losses resulting from the financial sector.
Of course, there were those from both sides who expressed their doubts about the project.
This is not what US citizens have asked us, not to defend the dollars of taxpayers, California Republican deputy Darrell Issa said.
His Ohio Democratic colleague Mary Kaptur believes that the measures were taken by the ones who are responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.

Next year in the United States without a visa?
Kinga Göncz sees the possibility that around January 12 the U.S.-Hungarian visa exemption agreement may enter into force - the Minister of Foreign Affairs talked about it in Chicago with the Hungarian representatives of the place.
According to his opinion, “now everything depends on the fact that the electronic system of entry and control is built over the ocean in time.”
However, it has attracted the attention to the fact that in the new system there will no longer be entrance permits, however, before departure tourists will have to register.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy will continue negotiations in Washington from today.
He will meet with the Minister of Foreign Affairs Condoleeza Rice, to whom he will deliver the Medal of the Cross of the Order of the Republic of Hungary with the Star and will engage in talks with the foreign policy advisors of Democratic candidate Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and John McCain also supported the bank rescue plan.
Barack Obama and John McCain, the presidential candidates of the two major U.S. parties, guaranteed on Sunday their support to the government’s $700 billion plan for the rescue of banks, but there are politicians who claim the resignation of the Treasury Minister.
The representatives of Congress and the administration after the days-long marathon talks, Sunday night, announced that they had concluded a principle agreement on the bank rescue plan.
The Wall Street crisis and the frozen financial package of the frozen credit market have become the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain want to show themselves more suitable than their rival to get the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the latest surveys with the putting on the top of the economic issues Obama has again recovered some advantage, despite the advantage of McCain, obtained after the Republican convention with the nomination of Vice President Sarah Palin, has dispersed.
In a speech in Detroit, Obama expressed hope that Congress will quickly approve the $700 billion plan law.
He stressed that the proposal contains those consumer protection steps that were also supported by him.
“Now we have to act responsibly (...), the danger threatens your work, your savings, all industrial sectors, the complete economic stability,” he said in front of a crowd of 35,000 people.
It was not allowed to escape defining McCain’s economic ideas overcome.
McCain in an interview with ABC explained that “all of us will send this situation down with difficulties (...) but not doing anything is not a way to go.”
The Republican senator that the proposal includes the creation of a finance minister’s control committee and the limitation of the good outcomes of top managers, things on which he was to insist.
Obama told CBS that McCain had no role of merit in the agreements, he was in daily contact with the minister.
President Nancy Pelosi said on Sunday that the House of Representatives is likely to vote on the bill on Monday.
Press Release of the German Language World
The right pole is intact, only inside the pole voters have become more self-conscious - thus Der Spiegel analyzes the weak result of the CSU in Bavaria.
The Haider party is ready to rule Austria to prevent the red-black coalition.
The Spiegel (spiegel.de)
Franz Walter, in the internet edition of the German left magazine, in the article The Bavarian Revolution divors its parents analyzes the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU.
According to the well-known politologist, CSU’s erosion began long before the sad couple Beckstein-Huber entered office.
The Christian-socialists have modernized Bavaria for decades and this is now that these modern citizens are leaving away from them.
The change of time is at the same time a problem of all Christian democracy, as well as Angela Merker.
The defeat was not a big surprise for the CSU, but a process that exactly ten years ago was realisable ended on Sunday: the indisputable hegemony of a party-state ended.
10 years ago, in 1998, the CSU was precipitated to 47.7%, for the first time below the 50% threshold since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago at the 2005 Bundestag elections even in the time of the so-called Stoiber.
The reason for this is the modernization carried out consequently in the region, which distorts the parents.
But the secularization, the results of education, the settlement of the Eastern and Northern Germans in the developed Bavarian region could not remain without consequences on the voters' loyalty to the CSU.
Modernization goes along with the increasing possibilities and the political consequences are obvious.
The right pole is intact, only inside the pole the voters have become more self-conscious, critical, obsessed.
It is also surprising that in the last few weeks the classic bourgeois groups have gone away from the CSU: free professionals, craftsmen, graduates and graduates.
Here the support to the CSU has fallen below 40%.
The publication (diepresse.com)
The Vienna conservative newspaper "Who with whom?" In the article "Party presidents are blocked in coalition issues" it deals with the confusing Austrian internal political situation created after the elections.
The SPÖ intends to deal with ÖVP.
The ÖVP prohibits the intervention of the SPÖ in its internal affairs.
The BZÖ is open to negotiations in all directions, the Greens still do not want to discuss coalition.
The elections were made, now it is all around the coalition; in the discussion broadcast by public television the leaders of the parties did just see the maps.
Werner Faymann, Chairman of the SPÖ, confirmed he wanted to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to demonstrate that cooperation between the two parties is possible, in some regions and in the social partnership already exists.
Faymann left open the question whether he can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of the ÖVP, as vice-cancelier.
As he said, the Schüssel-Molterer course was in any case rejected.
The repetition of this direction is not considered.
Molterer responded cautiously to the red offers.
As he said, the collaboration will not succeed if Faymann tries to intrude in ÖVP’s internal affairs.
If your party chooses the opposition or enters the coalition is still an open thing in the party, the issues should be discussed in any case within the ÖVP.
Jörg Haider leader of the BZÖ has repeatedly been open in all directions.
"To prevent the red-black coalition, we are ready to assume the responsibility to govern," Haider said.
Járóka: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today in Paris begins the European Summit on Opportunities, which this year is organized by France with the European Union’s turn presidency.
Lívia Járóka, a Fidesz member of the European People's Party in the message addressed to the plenum as the chief congressman, drew attention to school segregation because it is the most serious legal violation that affects Roma children and, by the way, the most serious obstacle to their affirmation.
French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs Xavier Bertrand, on behalf of the French presidency, and European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities Vladimír Špidla opened the conference at the highest level.
The guests to the conference included governments, European social partners and representatives of the major European civil and rights organizations in the framework of equal opportunities.
Járóka, according to the press office of the parliamentary group Fidesz PE, reminded, in addition to discrimination in employment, that Roma are extruded from the labour market first due to their low schooling.
“Most young Romans don’t have a middle-level degree and as a result of poor quality elementary teaching, only an irrisory number of them can a higher degree.”
Járóka also emphasized, as a fundamental human right, the key role of education in promoting human rights.
Investing in the education of Roma children can mean strengthening the economy of the EU member states.
According to the deputy, it is necessary to make awareness in the broader scope between the Roms and non-Roms these connections.
Indeed, the sooner the school begins a rom, the greater its chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market; through the taxes paid for income and consumption contribute to the national budget.
“The right of European citizenship of the Roms must guarantee their right to quality education and the elimination of low-level and segregated schools,” said Lívia Járóka.
According to the deputy, it is necessary the union of objectives and actions of the European Union to accelerate the processes of disregarding schools and for this reason it is crucial to properly comply with the existing and planned anti-discriminatory directives.
“The vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment must be interrupted, we must give Rom children the opportunities granted by the democratic space so that they can contribute as citizens fully to the future of Europe,” Járóka said.
In the sign of the "European Year of Opportunities" to guarantee for all, the objective of the European Summit on Opportunities organized every year, from the last year's Berlin Meeting is to ensure a unique forum to promote the objectives of anti-discrimination and equal opportunities set at the state and European level.
CSU: Mercy for a Transitional Period
At the end of October, the fate of the Huber-Beckstein couple will be decided.
Despite the bad election defeat, the heads have not yet fallen down, at the top of the Bavarian CSU the discussion of personal issues has been delayed for the moment.
The party president Erwin Huber and regional governor Günther Beckstein are still on their place, the question is until the mercy lasts.
On the fate of the tandem that has suffered a catastrophic 17% vote loss will decide the party’s extraordinary congress in the last weekend of October.
The two very criticized politicians made it known in any case that they were not attacked with all the forces at the chair.
They have so tried to humble the angry subscribers of the parliamentary group and the base that one day after the “Bawarian tsunami” claimed the personal consequences for the loss of the absolute majority.
5 years ago, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber then at the peak of his career, the Christian-social Union achieved 60.7%, now instead after the coup against Stoiber they fell to 43.4%.
The CSU for 46 years has been a “absolute monarch” in Bavaria which accounts for 18% of Germany’s GDP.
Although the conservatives in the southern region are always of fundamental importance for the Hungarian economy, they will be forced in any way to coalition in the future.
That first sign of reorganization within the party the Vice President and Federal Minister of Agriculture Horst Seehofer, considered possible heir of Huber, gets a place in the narrow exploration group that will start negotiations with the FDP liberals and with the Free Electors exhibiting right values for an eventual government coalition in Munich of Bavaria.
For a strange joke of fate in the list of the Free Electors enters the legislature that Gabriele Pauli whose attitude against Stoiber had been exploited as a blow opportunity by the couple Huber-Beckstein to then treat the woman without concerns from the great ambitions.
The CSU leaders now concentrate all their forces to somehow stabilize Beckstein.
In the meantime, Stoiber will also take an active role, which so far is sinking in the shadow. The former regional governor and former CSU president has defined September 28 the bitterest day in his political career.
On Monday, Huber issued some declarations to the CSU, according to which they would deserve more support from the brother party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a warning to the CDU and Angela Merkel.
Merkel will not be canceled after the September 2009 Bundestag elections unless the CSU, which played a decisive role in the 2005 national victory, will be put back together.
According to Merkel, which does not hide the disappointment for the fiasco, CSU’s land loss will not be negatively reflected on the great Berlin coalition.
What is relative: it will not be easy to manage the wounded CSU, but the social-democratic crisis still lasts.
The SPD reached its lowest outcome since 1946 in Bavaria with 18.6%.
Lukaschenko opposition: 110–0
Neither opposition representative entered the Parliament of Belarus after Sunday’s elections.
According to Russian observers, it is a sign of well-being and stability assured in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) instead it is explained with the bullets committed in the number of votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, has not recognized the elections.
Although the legislation of 110 people in a country of 10 million inhabitants has been without opposition for more than a decade, before yesterday’s elections the opposition gathered under the name of the United Democratic Forces (ODS) hoped seriously that Lukashenko, with the presidential term renewed for the fourth time after the constitutional amendment to the 2006 elections held in discussed circumstances, “conced” some seats in the Parliament to representatives of the opposition.
The ODS has thus renounced a previously evaluated boycott.
Behind the expectations of the opposition was that Belarus, increasingly economically dependent on Russia, which asked for a loan to reduce the increasingly expensive Russian natural gas imports and agreed to give the Russians the gas supplies in possession of the Beltransgaz that cross the country, intended to improve the relationship with the EU where Lukashenko and other high-ranking politicians cannot enter for the political situation of Belarus considered antidemocratic.
It referred to a distinction that the OSCE, evaluating the election campaign, has emphasized on positive movements and not the shortcomings, such as the ban of appearing for one-third of the opposition candidates.
The OSCE’s fast Monday report, however, also criticized the campaign, during which opposition candidates in practice could not appear on the press, and in particular that the opposition could not be present at the counting of the votes.
Despite this, according to the opposition, a improvement in the political climate is perceived: political prisoners have been released, Minsk is also willing to a small confrontation with Moscow continuing to deny the recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia by Georgia, although Russia, with which Belarus forms on the paper a federal state, considers the two countries independent for a month.
“We’ve made two steps forward and one back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU is beginning,” Aleksandr Milinkevich told our newspaper.
According to the 2006 opposition presidential candidate, it is desirable that he remain despite "the power had feared to make even one opponent enter a parliament without weight."
The opposition does not plan protests for the results but rather tries to get the message of the need for economic reforms to the voters.
Obviously we have a lot of problems, we have to print the opposition newspapers in Russia, for the distribution the local authorities raise difficulties, but also so I see that more and more people support the change, even among the elderly - said Milinkevich referring to the fact that not even the officially most helped quote, that of the retirees, considers appropriate the Lukashenko regime that considers its main result the creation of social security.
Because of the country’s debt and the increased economic deficit is just a matter of time the disregation of social security “which reminds the funeral silence” – believes Milinkevich.
Unlike the opposition’s policy, Russian observers judged the elections democratic.
President of the Commonwealth of Independent States Sergey Lebedev told the Russian news agency RIA Novosti: "Men believe not in words but in facts", so the lack of opposition is nothing more than the proof of the maturity of the Belarusian voters.
Brunei: “From now, breakfast before work”
It has never happened in the history of Chigi Palace that there were open doors for the entrance and exit of employees.
But from today this new measure takes the way against the frogs, against those who stamp and then goes to drink a coffee at the bar at work time.
The anti-fannulonial novelty was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and the Secretary-General of the Presidency of the Council, Mauro Masi.
"The gireveals - says Brunetta - are a tool to work better, with more productivity, more presence and more services," the minister said.
Now we are opening a new season of responsibility and transparency.
This is reformism,” Brunei continues.
With Palazzo Chigi, the installation is completed in all the palaces of the Council Presidency.
For Masi, “the choice of courtyard doors is also important from a symbolic point of view.”
There was no resistance from the employees, assures the Secretary-General: “It was a process shared by the workers and there was the collaboration of all.”
No more breakfast at work hours; no more coffee and cornet.
Brunetta’s word, which suggests, smiling, “a beautiful cappuccino at 7 a.m. is a holy hand.”
During a meeting at the Higher School of Public Administration
“In three months, the absence of public employees due to illness has decreased by 50%, i.e. 60,000 more people to work in a year.”
He added that it is necessary to make public administration more efficient.
Italy, whose salary dynamics have been double over the past 8-10 years compared to the private sector and well above inflation rates.
Meanwhile, thousands of public employees gathered together to challenge the rules of the Brunetta decree by joining the lawsuit supported by the Codacons.
“As the Minister of Public Function today releases numbers about the minor absence at work for causes of illness – writes the consumer association – the people of ‘working fools’ are continuously growing.
There are thousands in Italy of correct and productive public administration employees who have joined together to declare war to the illegal rules contained in the decree.”
In particular, the Tar will contester the exclusion of additional economic treatments for sickness due to employment; the extension of the timetables of the sick worker, within which inspection visits are carried out, and other aspects contained in the new provisions desired by the minister.
Employment Accidents, Napolitano: “Critial Prevention”
Every day, in Italy, 2,500 accidents occur at work, 3 people die and 27 remain permanently disabled.
In 2007, the Inail data confirmed that white deaths were about 1,200.
These figures show the severity of a phenomenon that remains one of the main causes of death and causes twice the number of deaths compared to the murders.
To attract the attention of institutions, social forces and media on this dramatic issue, today the Anmil celebrates in all the provinces of Italy the 58th National Day for the Victims of Occupational Accidents, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
“The worrying data spread by Anmil and the same tragic chronicles of these days confirm how crucial is the question of prevention at work,” said President of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano, in a message sent to President of the Anmil, National Association of Mutilated and Disabled Workers, Pietro Mercandelli.
The head of state expresses his "live appreciation for the constant associative commitment to the prevention in the workplace, the protection of the unfortunate workers, the assistance of the families of the victims and the awareness of the public".
“Naturally, an angry ‘just’, honestly shared, has emerged in the face of tragedies that, by their size, raise the clam of the media and the involvement of the public opinion but the everyday reality brings us dramatic, even repeated cases in their dynamics.”
Napoleon does not hide that "there is undoubtedly also a problem of resources: it is decisive to invest in education and information.
Particular significance take the numerous initiatives promoted in the school field for a more direct awareness by the young people who are concerned with the world of work.
It is necessary to keep the attention to the phenomenon alive, not to go down in the alarm on its social gravity, to apply and improve the legislative rules.
The President of the Chamber, Gianfranco Fini, said: “How the phenomenon of white death constitutes an absolute social emergency, which offends the consciousness of each of us and imposes on all institutions a decisive commitment to urgently end it.”
“Data on work accidents seems to indicate a slight positive progress, but this does not remove that the number of white deaths is still impressive,” said Anmil President Pietro Mercandelli.
“We’t want this ‘down trend’ to result in less attention, because it’s exactly when the attention is slowed that the tragedy explodes.
“We believe that at the general level there is still too little to do to counter the phenomenon of accidents and the contrast can be exercised through multiple actions.
It is necessary, in our opinion – Mercandelli emphasized – more controls and inspections, but also a stronger intervention on the training of workers, and this from the world of school.”
"It serves an additional effort - he added - with regard to the communication and awareness of the public.
But it needs, above all, a greater sense of responsibility from the employers over a phenomenon that represents a social emergency.”
Mercandelli then denounced “the progressive deterioration of the levels of compensatory protection for the victims of work” and “the assistencialist outcome to which the system is pushing over the past years.”
“The goal is, therefore, to return to the worker the insurance guarantee – he added – because the fate of the victim should not depend on spontaneism or time-to-time elargation provided by the legislator.”
MP3 readers under accusation, put the hearing at risk
Listening to high-volume music for a long period of time using portable music devices such as Mp3 readers can cause permanent hearing injury.
This is what the European Commission reports, which in a statement broadcast in Brussels quotes the opinion of the EU Scientific Committee on Emerging and Recently Identified Health Risks (Csrseri), published today.
"From this scientific opinion - it is read in the note - it turns out that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music with portable music devices weekly for more than an hour a day keeping the high-volume device risks a permanent loss of hearing capacity."
“I am worried that such a large number of young people who frequently use portable music devices and cell phones at high acoustic levels can unconsciously damage their hearing in an irreparable way,” says Meglena Kuneva.
“From scientific findings – the EU official continues – there is a clear risk and we must react quickly.
What’s more important, we need to raise consumer awareness and make this information public.
We must also review the existing control systems, in the light of this scientific opinion, to ensure that they are fully effective and keep the step with the new technology.”
Brussels had asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, given the large use of portable music devices and the increased number of young people exposed to the noise from them.
"The scientists confirm that there is a reason for concern and the European Commission will now examine together with the Member States and stakeholders what measures could be taken to better protect children and adolescents from exposure to noise from portable music devices and related equipment."
Currently, there is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable music equipment to 100 dB, but concerns about hearing damage that may result from excessive exposure to such noise sources are increasing.
You can greatly limit these damages by using solutions such as reducing levels and the duration of exposure to noise.
In its opinion, the EU Scientific Committee notes that users of portable music equipment when listening to high volume (more than 89 decibels) music for only 5 hours a week exceed the current limit for maximum permitted noise at workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for longer periods risk a permanent loss of hearing capacity after a period of 5 years.
This would affect 5-10% of users of such devices and their number can be quantified between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Germany gives the way to the Commission for the future of the capital
Today it starts, in March it closes, in June the amounts will be drawn.
This is the calendar set by the Campidoglio for the work of the "Commission for the Future of Rome Capital", which has settled this morning in its new headquarters behind the Termes of Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will develop the guidelines for Rome.
After the battles are closed in March, the Board and the Municipal Council will evaluate analysis and projects, so that they can present in June the Strategic Plan for Rome with the "official balloon" of Campidoglio and its mayor Gianni Alemanno.
“The Commission is absolutely independent and there are represented all political, social and cultural ideas – it must emphasize Alemanno – It will have to submit proposals for an idea of development of Rome which the political decision makers, who remain the Board and the Municipal Council, will then be able to take advantage of.
There is no overload of roles but only the will to have a place to elaborate a great project for Rome.
In March he will finish his work and then dissolve, because this experience must have a precise deadline.
In June – announces the mayor – we will present the strategic plan using the work done by the Commission for the future of Rome Capital.”
To those who accuse the Commission of inutility, since its opinions will not be binding, Alemanno replies: “All depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do and the quality of its proposals.
If the quality will be there, as in France with the Attali Commission and as I am sure also in Rome, its contribution will be crucial.
Too often the policy is swallowed on the management of the newspaper and on the emergencies that from time to time manfest.
We, on the contrary, want to look longer and further, in a deeper perspective, working seriously on the development of Rome and its future.”
Moreover, the mayor of Rome has to point out that “this Commission is neither an useless entity nor a carrossing: it is absolutely free, it will not cost a euro to the Romanian citizens and will serve to reason and to engage the best intelligences that the Capital expresses.”
“It is necessary to have a strategic reference design, neither closed nor immobile, to allow our city to make an authentic level jump, which it absolutely needs, thinking with a united spirit to its future.”
“A future that will not be limited to the current municipal borders but will look far beyond” not only in the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal status of Capital but “in consideration of the role that Rome can and must play as the Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean.”
Obama is the first anti-American president.
He wrote a well-known American politician who takes us to pass for independent: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who with his decisions decimated the U.S. economy and had relations (as he does today as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam.
The attacks on Obama are rising as the date of the election is approaching.
A lady from Miami wrote on a web page: “This person is full of ambitions.
Obama has a big face: he believes he will win the highest post of a nation that has had in all two governors and five black senators!
In fact, they are attacks that don’t say much; they are clearly racist attacks and don’t answer the voters’ question: will he be a good president?
In this case, there are people who speak with the heart but not with the brain.
A newspaper in the Mississippi, in the US’s southern visceral, wrote a editorial: once in the cabin to vote we know well to whom the American patriot will give his vote.
It comes out one side of the U.S. mentality kept covered until the last.
“Say what you want, then we’ll think where to put the crocette, whether on Obama or on McCain.”
There are people who swear: if Obama had to win, we would leave America.
What I never said before, that almost appears the success of the black candidate.
However, despite all these reasoning, the winning weapon for Democrats is George Bush.
They asked 1,500 people: What were the mistakes Bush made during his term? 89% replied: Iraq.
It changes America.
In Vietnam this nation lost 50 thousand soldiers and was sent home to football in the seat.
In Iraq there are 4500 soldiers who have lost their lives and the Americans have not been forced to make their bags.
However, Iraq for the majority was Bush’s weakness.
Whoever will take the place of George W will have a huge task to do.
The U.S. economic trail makes it heard also on journalists: in the newspapers it is time of cuts. And many do the fault to the internet, "kill" of the printed paper.
Five hundred American journalists have been interrogated by the PEW Research Center on the state of their profession and mental control regarding the future.
Nowadays, journalists are almost all pessimistic about their future.
However, newsmen did not openly say they were less concerned about credibility.
They don’t feel isolated like once.
The problem for US journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a crisis of a destroyed economic model.
Moreover, the cuts made in the newsroom, in the room where the editors work to put the newspapers together, is a big problem.
It is a problem that needs to be solved, according to the interviewed journalists, if we don’t want that traditional journalism as the large public thinks to be substantially reduced.
A clear but complex pessimism is overwhelmed today by the American journalist.
Six out of ten newspapers and senior executives are convinced that national journalism is on the wrong path.
In the local field the executive group is 65%.
Pressed against broadcast.
It is not difficult for journalists to see where the web is going.
The major publishing houses open up a curve to the internet, for many viewed as the “killer” of the printed paper.
The “economic pressure” that journalists warn has risen to 79%.
The 500 interviewed journalists have admitted that they are embracing technology in the hope that it will “do something good” for their journalism.
The biggest gap today in American journalism is between those who lead the newsrooms – that is, the directors – and the reporters who work for them.
56% of executives at national level are sure that their reporters divide their values, while at local level the percentage falls to 23%.
For some, this has to do with ‘work safety’.
Executives who think they will lose their jobs within 3 years are at 47% nationally.
For the staff reporters it goes to 30%.
That of "safe work" at staff level (our editors, ndr) in America is always on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work with a contract.
In an enormous country like the United States, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio, television and the internet employers often offer what they want and thus becomes a matter of “take it or leave it”, take or leave.
The directors almost always receive large salaries, while the editor can also earn $10,000 a month, in addition to retirement and insurance payments.
For holidays, then, reasoning becomes complicated: all days after the first year, all after the third to reach 15 total days after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, because of their admission, often "make" during the year.
It is a matter of climate.
UNIPOL: Court of Rome, Danilo Copola remains to the ground
The chairman of the second criminal section of the court in Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the instance of the real estate designer Danilo Coppola who had requested to be able to move from his city, Grottaferrata, to a home in the city of Rome.
Coppola is investigated for bankruptcy in the framework of the investigation on the Unipol-Bnl scale.
In the course of the trial on his behalf, last week, he obtained the discharge from the households transformed into a residence obligation in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked the real estate owner to travel from the city of the province to a residence in the capital.
According to the court, however, these shifts (which the PM has given the opposite opinion) would allow him to influence his company and access the evidence that accuses him.
The Elites in Danger
The phenomenon was already manifested a few days ago with the House of Representatives voting against the $700 billion rescue plan from the White House: a significant portion of Americans was, and is, more interested in punishing Wall Street than in saving the economy.
This is confirmed by the New York Times yesterday informing us that the current crisis is scattering the Republican Party, increasingly divided between its old soul East Coast, moderate, favorable to federal institutions and the business community, and its new soul, instead, conservative, hostile to "the Washington" and the world of finance, strong especially in the Central and South States.
The soul, for the point, that became prepotently alive with the vote that I said at the beginning.
But this just mentioned is only an example of the changes, of the great changes, which the current economic earthquake may predict or already leaves out: not only in the United States but throughout the West and not even here alone.
Both in the United States and Europe the crisis seems to work as an accelerator of incubating phenomena for a long time that in the new climate solidify and finally comes to light.
The first of these phenomena is the re-actualization, the extraordinary rise, of the double category of state sovereignty in relation to a kind of re-nationalization of the economy.
The crisis, in fact, is a crisis of banking and financial institutions which, yes, have close ties with abroad, but that first of all see involved in a very broad scale the budgets of people and families living in one country, in one state.
This immediately creates a political problem for those who govern it: and that is, how to respond to the difficulties and protests of those people and those families who, among other things, are also a electorate.
The economic crisis appears globally, but politically it is almost exclusively national.
Political internationalism seems substantially out of play or has little to say: the brilliant proof is given by the European Union that divides as usual between the different interests and between the different state strategies fails to decide any common political line.
And so is from the government of each individual state that everyone awaits interventions, rescue and rescue plans, new rules, and above all funding: since when it comes to the narrow are only the states that possess the economic resources, the mass of financial resources able to try to put things back in the sixth.
And they also have the necessary means and the legitimacy to use them: two resources of immeasurable value, under certain circumstances, which probably no market and no international organization will ever be able to have in the same extent.
This new emphasis that the crisis put on the statual-national element is by the rest perfectly in line with the increasing importance that the latest developments of the economy tend to attribute to a factor quite closely linked to that element: the territoriality.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we have already entered the kingdom of the network, of the increasingly sophisticated technology, of the immaterial, while we were convinced that globalized finance was now intended to dominate the world, we realized that our future will instead have to make accounts increasingly with those very little immaterial things that are water, harvests, oil.
Everything that, look at a little, can be transported from one place to the other of the earth but is nevertheless completely connected to a circled space, to a territory.
So whoever finds himself to be sovereign, he possesses many more cards than whoever is not, whoever has the fortune to live in a place without harvests, without oil and without water.
I am coming to the second news that predicts a fracture.
Whoever says Territory, State, Government, inevitably says Politics, and thus Leadership.
In this regard, the economic crisis seems to produce two convergence phenomena.
On the one hand, the consciousness of the objective need of authority leadership, the demand of someone who knows how to take the situation in hand.
On the other hand, a wave of discretion for existing leadership, economic species, revealed so inappropriate and full of shadows.
And together something even deeper and in a certain sense annoying: a discretion, an insufficiency, an image of inadequacy, a sense of distance, which tends to involve the entire ruling class in a growing number of Western countries.
Therefore, it seems to be more and more a way, in the widespread sectors of the population, the conviction that before their actions are the same ideas of the social elites so far emerging, their way of feeling and being, their culture in the overall acceptance of the term, to have done their own time and to be increasingly strange to the opinions of the majorities.
The demand for leadership, in turn, feeds undergroundly a ramified but possible movement of delegitimation of the ruling classes and the traditional political assets, which manifests itself in the sudden “revolutions” of the elections or in the sudden events of the collective humour of these last and last times, from the conservative rise in Austria-Baviera to the collapse of the Labour consensus in Great Britain, to the rebellion of the American congressmen against Bush (and even the victory of the right in Italy has something to do).
There is the impression that traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their formats would say someone, make it increasingly difficult to understand, and thus to represent, what is not now taking shape in the deep layers of Western societies and that the economic crisis weighs, increases, potentially agits to dismissure.
In the face of all this, talking about a "mass shrinking" on the agenda would be frankly exaggerated.
But keeping your eyes open is not for anything.
The superhole to walk on the walls
Configure the laws of gravity thanks to a super collar and in the future walk on the walls like Spiderman.
It is the target of several American research centers and now a team of four institutions has gone very close to us.
With a stick of only 2.5 square centimeters, the researchers managed to hold a body of 100 kilograms hanged on a vertical wall.
The American Science magazine has published the findings of some researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the team of researchers is an evolution of the existing ones that use a particular carbon structure, called carbon nanotubes.
“The column principle can be imagined as a series of tubes arranged like a pile of spaghetti,” explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists have inspired the legs of the geeks, covered by microscopic hair that succeed in ensuring a perfect adherence to the animal.
Tests carried out on various materials, such as glass, Teflon and glass paper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the legs of these reptiles and at the same time"there is easy to climb from the wall," explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Dayton.
"This material could be useful as a transitional adhesive" adds Liming Dai.
Maybe to walk on the walls just like Spiderman? Maybe yes, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use like the connection between electronic devices, because carbon nanotubes are heat and electric current drivers.
Other applications may concern aerospace engineering.
No superhero at the moment.
The ALTRA RICERCA – Also the University of Berkeley, California, is dedicating itself to the search for a new adhesive.
In an article on the American Chemical Society magazine, California scientists presented a micro-fiber-shaped adhesive as hair that self-push from the powder while moving on a surface to always maintain a perfect adhesive.
Remedies: Never with fruit juices
Attention to the juice of pepper, the juice of orange and apple.
These beverages, consumed especially in the summer because dissetants and rich in vitamins, if taken simultaneously with some preservative drugs alter their absorption by increasing or decreasing their effectiveness depending on the cases with serious health consequences.
To reiterate the risks of both packaged and fresh fruit juices associated with the use of some medicines David Bailey, professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, that from the 236th National Meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia launches a new alarm: a glass of pompe juice, orange and apple is enough to reduce the absorption of some medicines savior, annulling the beneficial effects and putting the health of patients at risk.
The pompe juice was already ended under accusation because it was considered responsible for increasing to the levels considered toxic the effects of some anti-arithmic, antibiotic, anxiolithic, anti-histaminic and neurological drugs.
The same Italian drug agency had this in a newsletter two years ago warning doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger derived from this mix and to be careful about what you drink in case you take drugs such as Diazepam or Metadone.
NOT ONLY POMPELM - According to experts, the juice of orange and the juice of apple also contain substances that inhibit drugs.
The list of active ingredients inhibited by the pump and other juices.
This is the appeal of Michele Carruba, director of the department of pharmacology of the State University of Milan:"These discoveries are usually immediately to the various international and national pharmaceutical agencies that eventually provide to change the information notes of the drugs.
So always read the illustrative leaves of the medicines you take and if there is something that’s not clear, don’t make us impress but ask for clarifications to the doctor or pharmacist,” the expert emphasized at the agency Ansa.
Nobel Prize in Economics by Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize in Economics was awarded to American Paul Krugman for his studies on business models and on the localization of economic activities.
Krugman, 55 years old, is a neokynesian who teaches at the University of Princeton and is a famous New York Times publisher.
Krugman is one of the major critics of the Bush administration’s economic and foreign policy choices.
A few months after the 2001 September attacks, in the days when Enron failed, Krugman had predicted in a newspaper published in the New York Times that the second event would be more decisive than the first, in terms of consequences on the history of the United States.
A forecast that triggered not a few polemics and that for years was relieved to the economist, but that now has turned out to be accurate.
“I’m surprised and even a bit shocked by the speed with which the memory of scandals such as the Enron collapse or Worldcom have disappeared from the audience’s attention,” Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, the executive committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "great-value economist", but also a discloser with a "very aggressive style, critical against the excessive liberalism of the Bush administration."
Open Office, here is the third edition of the anti-Microsoft package
It is the day of the release of OpenOffice.org 3.0, the open source personal productivity suite that aims to reach more and more users, from home to office, from professionals to public administration, as a free alternative to the most famous Microsoft Office.
After a year of work by volunteer developers, behind whom SUN Microsystem is watched, the new Open Office is shown to the general public with several novelty: to the welcome screen and to the revised and less spartan interface, adds more substantial such as the native compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system and the support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest standard version of ISO.
Also pay attention to interoperability with the Office 2007 suite, Open Office is able to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting some specific features of some modules such as which allows you to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, useful for example to send them by email, or the possibility of importing PDF files into the graphic processing module, keeping the original appearance of the page.
Always on this front you can create "hybrid PDF" documents, which accumulate the typical graphics of the Adobe format with the elements of a calculation sheet or a text processor.
Collaboration is an element that has received several improvements within the applications: in the calculation sheet you can intervene multi-handly between different users, avoiding conflicts on the changes, in the text processor, each collaborator is assigned a color in the comments for better recognizability in the process of review.
Some companies are also working to bring some OpenOffice features to the Web (on the cloud, on the cloud), and in the coming weeks they should release the final result.
The English version is downloadable at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and has been added to the English version that was on the mirrors since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, as usual, the suite is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request, the installation CD can also be sent home or on the workplace.
And if the theme of free can be a train for broadcasting in the houses, it is just in the business sphere that Open Office the suite tries the big bet, already able to rely on several projects carried out in the public administration and in schools.
And they don’t even miss the realities that offer an ideal training, counseling and assistance service for small and medium-sized enterprises, which could open business prospects.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for the corresponding video writing of Word; Calc, is the calculation sheet that aims to replace Excel; Impress, for Powerpoint emulate presentations; Dbase, as in the case of the most famous Access is the program that allows you to work on the databases; Draw, is finally the graphic form.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that today we are almost 3 million and 600 thousand, with the release of the new version it is likely that you can also exceed the expected figure.
Kohl is the fourth case of doping.
A new case of positivity in the last Tour de France: it is the Austrian Bernhard Kohl, the Gerolsteiner team, third ranked and winner of the best scalator shell.
The news is on the website of the newspaper The Team.
The 26-year-old Kohl is the fourth positive rider to the Cera, the Epo of the third generation, after the Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli and the German Stefan Schumacher, also those of the Gerolsteiner.
Kohl’s blood samples are among those conducted in recent weeks by Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry laboratories.
If the counter-analysis confirm the positivity at Cera, the Austrian will lose the third place in the Tour and will meet the two years of canonical squalification.
To confirm the news of Kohl’s positivity to the Third Generation Epoch is the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who told the Associated Press that he the positivity to the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian was placed on the final podium on the back of the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, also awarding himself the best scalator t-shirt.
Immigrants: New York Times is disappearing, Italy is racist?
Italy "from a country of immigrants has just recently become a privileged destination for immigrants" welcomed with reluctance.
This is what is asked in a long article in the New York Times that dedicated a long article to the debate on the topic of racism in Italy starting from the case of the young Abdul William Guibre from Burkina Faso killed last month in Milan for stealing a box of cookies.
This case highlights what the Nyt calls the “northern paradox”: the northern regions are at the same time those where “more integration and more work” is recorded but also “the country’s highest anti-immigrant feeling and the highest support for the Northern League.”
To confirm the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the Nyt also quoted the intolerance episodes in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not only.
Also the new legislation desired by the League that stretches the barriers on immigration and facilitates the expulsion of clandestines is quoted as a paradigm of climate change in Italy.
This trend was highlighted by both the Pope and the President of the Republic: "Georgius Napolitano in meeting with Benedict XVI at the Quirinale asked the State and the Church to work together to defeat racism."
Students victims of the car-lease up to 900 euros for a room
The rental market for university students does not know the crisis.
According to the latest survey of the Sunia, the rental union, taking a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
“The phenomenon has now taken very serious characters to the point to exclude entire gangs of young people from the right to study for the very high overall costs that the families of origin should support – explains the head of the study office of Sunia, Laura Mariani – in these cities the strong demand by students has so deformed the market to trigger a process of generalized growth even for residents.”
In most cases, rental offers then contain a number of violations: free type contracts, unregistered, unlimited, sub-rental connected.
Sunia requires extraordinary interventions that, through the review of the taxation, can calm the prices.
Looking at the detail of the survey, we see that in Milan, for a bed in the area of Brianza, it takes about 450 euros; for a single room you go from a minimum of 650 (zone Bande Nere) to an average value of 800 (zone Lambiate, Udine and Fiera) to a maximum of 900 (zone Vittoria).
In Florence, a bedroom costs an average of 350/400 euros, a room about 700.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in the areas near the University, they need 250/280 euros for a double bed, from 370 to 500 for a single.
In Rome in areas near the central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna) are required about 600 euros for a single room, 450 for a double bed.
Only slightly lower values (550 euros for a single room) in areas near the other Universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
You save only if you move to peripheral areas: 300 euros for a bed and 450 a single in areas of Prenestina, Centocelle and so on.
In Naples for a bed place it takes 300/450 euros, for a room it spends from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the areas of Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari for a bed is required 250/350 euros, at least 350 for a single.
In smaller cities prices are lower in absolute terms, but they have a greater weight in the city economy.
In cities where the phenomenon of lease to extra-community students is more common, such as Perugia, a further anomaly is finally recorded: the increase of about 25/30% of the canon requested to foreign students compared to that applied to Italians.
Goodbye old cinema Paradise, the cities cancell the historic rooms
The historic cinema rooms are closed in favour of the Multiplex.
“A city without cinema is a blind city, it’s like a face without eyes.”
The image offered by director Giuseppe Tornatore effectively photographs what is happening in the major Italian urban centers but also in the cities of the province.
The process of marginalization of the cinema, with the birth in the peripheral of the great multisals and the consequent death by consumption of the monosals in the central areas of the cities, is one of those events that seem unavoidable and uncontroversial to us but also has all the characteristics of a true cultural crime.
“It’s like a friend, a acquaintance with whom we shared a piece of street and so many emotions,” observes the director of New Paradise cinema, the film that twenty years ago wins to Tornatore the Oscar and the Grand Prix of the Jury of Cannes, and that tells the poetry of a province hall and the nostalgia for a way of living the lost cinema forever.
The figures provided by the ANEC, the main association of artists, speak clearly: in the last five years they have closed the 316 traditional-type movies, and to pay the highest score are mainly the rooms in major cities: 10 in less in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in less in Turin, 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by the closures is the Emilia-Romagna with 82 monosal films lost, followed by Toscana (44) and Lombardy (41).
And to demonstrate that the first responsible for their disappearance is the advent of the multiplex, these are the three Italian regions that have made the largest number of new multisala movies recorded: 195 more screens in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in both Toscana and Emilia-Romagna.
“The Italian exercise has evolved irrationally,” observes Paolo Protti, chairman of the ANEC, “it is useful that new structures are built but it should be guaranteed the survival of those already existing, because when a city hall closes, not all its visitors are willing to move to the multiplex.
In addition, it is not possible to mention the failure to allocate the fund in favour of the executives: the state’s debt is approximately 10 million euros.
It is a shame, from an ethical and moral point of view, that the Government does not comply with the existing laws.
To support the sector, it would serve between 16 and 18 million euros a year.”
Interesting is the case of Bologna, the first Italian city that, concerned about the closures, decided to run to the repairs with the signature of a protocol between Comune and Anec, the first of this kind in Italy, to protect and promote the monosal cinema both in the historic centre and in the periphery.
Among the rules provided are tax facilitation measures in favour of managers and advantages for the public in terms of mobility: viewers will be able to enter the area with limited traffic and have special fees for the stop and in some parking stations.
“It’s an initiative that I like,” observes Giuseppe Tornatore, “and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna by setting up other measures.
It is certain, however, that to counter the strapower of the multiplex traditional salts also need to improve the quality of sound and image, because the audience today is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a topic that has always been important to me: the closure of the Super Cinema of Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the scintill that convinced me to make "New Cinema Paradise", which I thought for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I walk in front of the Rialto or the Quirinale of the National Road now closed, there I have lived so many shared emotions, so that I can’t see the cartelons stumbled by the dust turning me from the other side.”
It is a great opportunity for you to find out what is going on in your life.
“The mayor of Gioia Tauro was available to uniform the municipality’s choices to the interests of the Piromalli coast.”
It is heavy the accusations that the judges of the Anti-Mafia Directorate of Calabria address to the mayor and vice-president of Gioia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and to the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, who have been arrested at the same time for external competition in a mafia association.
In the hands also Gioacchino Piromalli, the elderly mediator between the clan and public administrations, and his grandson lawyer, homonym of the boss, already convicted of association for mafia stamp crime, convicted of refunding 10 million euros.
“In spite of any legal and moral rule, as well as of good sense,” the prosecutors write, the two local authorities had expressed their willingness to pay advice to the lawyer Piromalli.
“It would have been permitted to the COSCA – writes the judges – to enter officially within the municipalities facilitating the possibilities, already enormous, of control and address of the public administration.”
The chairman of the regional council Agazio Loiero does not hide that “colusions between local authorities and organized illness are many” in his region: “There are areas where the mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where the collusion is almost inevitable.
But there are so many local politicians who resist the pressure of 'ndrangheta, heroes who keep themselves clean.'
The night arrest follows those of last July with which the police announced that they had decapitated the Piromalli cottage.
From the end of April last year, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro was dissolved but already in 1991, and always due to alleged conditions between organized crime and local administration, local politicians had been lifted from the task of administering the municipality.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, mayor of the UDC at the time of the dissolution, was elected to the head of a central-right coalition, after the vote in May 2006.
It cried to the scandal when the Prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
He called the then Deputy Minister of the Interior Marco Minniti, accusing him of having architected everything for a political matter, but the judges, in the arrest order signed at the same time, explain that the Piromalli cottage had even come to ask for the change of the project of the A3.
From the environmental interceptions ordered against Dal Torrione, PMs write, it emerged “the willingness to marry the needs of an entrepreneur, representative of a larger group notoriously near the Piromalli, uniforming the choices of the public administration to the interests of the cottage.”
When the energy is born from the waves, now the big ones fall into the field.
It is an extinct plant, which occupies more than 70% of the planet’s surface and is now being discovered by the world’s largest energy companies.
Waves, currents, mares are the new renewable sources on which they have put their eyes, and now they are trying to put their hands, colossal like the Chevron.
The possibility of getting energy from the sea movements has been studied for a hundred years and in the 1970s, in concomitance with the first oil crisis, the research intensified.
When oil prices dropped around 1980, the idea of exploiting marine energy was put away, but now environmental instances and the new oil rise give impulse to the industry.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimated in 2007 that 15 percent of the world’s electricity demand could be covered by sea wave engine exploitation plants.
This amount would be twice the amount produced by nuclear power plants.
In addition, there will be rains and mares.
Close to the attack.
The first company to bet on marine energy was Enersis, which in 2005 signed an agreement to build a plant in northern Portugal.
When the agreement was announced it seemed to be a revolutionary step.
A two-year distance to bet on marine energy are increasingly more and among these companies have always voted for traditional energy.
“Chevron is studying the technologies on ocean energy,” a spokesman for a company associated with the U.S. oil giant told the Wall Street Journal, “and he is evaluating the possibility of cooperating with us.”
The cooperation concerns the obtaining of a permission from the U.S. Energy Commission, necessary to launch a project for the exploitation of marine energy in Alaska.
This is a sign not recently, especially if it is considered that in Alaska the U.S. continues to extract oil and recently President Bush has launched a plan for new trivelations.
In addition to Chevron, there are the Verdant Power Inc. in New York and the Ocean Power in New Jersey on the way of the energy that comes from the sea and the amounts invested so far, as unknown in the details, indicate, according to the observers, an increasing interest.
Technology to be developed.
Experts talk about a technology still in the woods, even because marine energy does not escape all doubts about the environmental impact.
For now, plants such as the Portuguese or some in Scotland are small and don’t seem to create big problems to the ecosystem.
To produce energy on a large scale, however, we need to use technologies with greater environmental impact.
And the choices are different: the Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of boe connected to each other.
The wave push, which makes the boe move up and down, is converted into hydraulic pressure by pistons and cylinders inside the gallegants.
The pressure makes a turbine rotate which in turn feeds a generator.
Electricity is sent to the shore through submarine cables.
For now there are four plants of this type in the way of design, waiting only for federal approval and part of the energy could serve for a military installation.
The Verdant Power, in turn, already produces energy for a shopping center and a parking area using six submarine turbines in the East River in New York.
The movement of water when there are mares makes the balls of the turbines rotate, creating a rotative movement that feeds a generator.
Verdant said it has a long list of customers waiting for the necessary authorizations to use energy.
After the waves, the mares.
A particular interest, they say to the Institute for Electricity Research, deserves at this time the potential of the sea.
Although this is an intermittent phenomenon, the marea is more predictable than the wind, the sun or the waves and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
It’s just on the energy of the seas that were like that of New York, Maine and Alaska, along with others that appear on the coast, have already invested $7.5 million in 2008 and predicted investments up to $35 million in 2009.
