USA Gymnastics supports the letter from the United States Olympic Committee and accepts the absolute need of the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all our athletes.
We agree with the USOC's statement that the interests of our athletes and clubs, and their sport, can be better served by making progress with significant changes within our organisation, rather than by removing certification.

This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had scales, an already widespread theory, but provides details that fossils generally cannot give, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists state that the animal's feces were brownish brown at the top and light or carotenoid at the bottom.
The finding also provides information on the evolution of litter in birds.
Because dinosaur rachis do not have a well-developed shaft, called a rachis, but have other features of  feathers   barbs  and  barbules  the researchers have deduced that the rachis was most likely an evolutionary development that occurred after these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight but rather for temperature regulation or display.The researchers suggested that, although this is the tail of a small dinosaur, the specimen shows an adult feather and not a thin, soft young one.
The researchers suggested that, although this is the tail of a younger dinosaur, the specimen shows adult feathers and not the hair of a phallus.

The work done was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to stimulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by the tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon pulls on the earth, causing tides, so the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have concluded that dark matter affects other dark matter just as regular matter does.
This theory says that the majority of the dark matter around a galaxy lies around the galaxy in a kind of diatomaceous earth and is made up of many small particles.

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth and place a sheet of pre-printed paper indicating their choice of candidate in an envelope.
After the identity of the voter has been verified by the officials, the voter opens the envelope in the ballot box and signs the list of voters' names.
French electoral law codifies procedures in a rather strict way.
Since 1988, the voting boxes have to be transparent so that voters and observers can see that no envelopes are present at the start of the vote and that no envelopes are added except those of the duly counted and authorised voters.
Candidates can send representatives to witness each part of the process.In the evening, the votes are counted by a volunteer under close supervision, according to specific procedures.

Police Superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the accused appeared in court with his face covered.
Although three people were inside the house when the car hit her, none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the collision occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services rescued the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged with killing her son at Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
She is in custody pending indictment and trial, but any eyewitness testimony may be influenced by the fact that her photograph has been widely published.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK but Scottish justice works differently and the courts consider the publication of photographs to be potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that "journalists seem to be putting themselves in danger if they publish photos etc. of suspicious people".
The Crown Office, which is in charge of prosecutions in general, indicated to journalists that no further comments would be made at least before the indictment.
The document, according to the disclosure, will refer to the border dispute, which Palestine wants based on the borders before the 1967 Middle East War.
Other topics covered reported to include the future state of Jerusalem which is sacred to both nations and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years once an agreement is signed while the PA agrees to leave this presence for only five years.
The additional test strip for pest control had to be closely monitored by forest guards, as the test was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In a partnership between  NPWS and Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited, under the Sporting Shooters Association's shooting programme.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the Parks and Heritage Conservation Director with the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received comprehensive safety instruction and training.
Martelly swore in a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) yesterday.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP (Provisional Electoral Council) in four years.
Last month a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
The sometimes violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which were due to be held in 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of iPod damage due to overheating were reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) of Japan said that it had been informed about the 27 incidents related to the appliances.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed it of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company called "not serious".
The Ministry responded by calling Apple's postponement of the report 'really regrettable'.
The earthquake struck Mariana at 7:19 a.m. local time (9:19 p.m. GMT on Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands emergency management office said there were no reported injuries nationwide.
In addition, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre said that there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer held Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle in the direction of the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and elderly, were released early, as well as the Filipino photographers.
Photographers later took the place of an elderly woman because she needed to use the toilet.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began investigating premature birth in his spare time.
His research showed that hormone administration accelerates the maturation of the fetal lung.
Xinhua reported that on Wednesday government investigators found two 'black boxes' that are the flight recorders.
Her fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said "Luna was the first Queen of the Extreme. My first manager. Luna died on the night of the two summits. Truly unique in her kind. Strong woman".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was unusual like me...maybe even more than me...I love and miss her...hope she's in a better place".
Of the 1,400 people polled before the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic have increased by 8 percent since 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard argued that she believed Australia should become a republic when the reign of Queen Elizabeth II ended.
34 percent of those polled agree, and would like Queen Elizabeth to be Australia's last monarch.
At the end of the voting, 29 per cent of those polled believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 per cent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was expected to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and three Commonwealth Games relays, but his complaints raised doubts about his health.
He could not take the medicines needed for his pain as they are banned from the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number by January 25.
Many people verified the discovery using different hardware and software until early February and it was announced on Tuesday.
It is possible that comets were a source of water delivery to Earth along with organic matter that could form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed, since comets struck the Earth many years ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rhetoric as "political talk and stupidity".
He is speculated to run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA is supporting that will allow aircraft to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to  an older ground-based radar technology to enable air traffic controllers to identify aircraft with greater precision and give pilots more precise information.
No extra transport is being put in place and ground trains will not stop at Wembley, and car parking and park-and-ride facilities are not available on the ground.
Fears of lack of transport raised the possibility that the game would be forced to be played with the doors closed without the team's supporters.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science provided a report on the creation of a new bird species in the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in only two generations, although this process was thought to have lasted much longer, due to the mating between the endemic Darwin sponge, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant cactus sponge, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be made into any shape, and it can be rolled into small shapes.
It can be pulled into thin wire, which can then be crushed and polished.
It can be made very thin, and bonded to another metal. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-printed images in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The juice of the cabbage changes colour depending on whether the chemical is acidic or alkaline.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H at pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed from them (as hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Turn the two dry drops together and then, with wet and clean hands, put them in a balloon.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will feel strange and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flush toilets in almost every home, connected to a sophisticated drainage system.
Remains of drainage systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets were also found in ancient Egypt, ancient Persia and ancient China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bath houses where men and women met together in mixed company.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you are using satellite.
The space satellite receives the call and then reflects it back down, almost instantaneously.
The satellite was launched by a rocket, and scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
A giant rocket more than 100 feet long is needed to launch a satellite or telescope into space.
The bicycle has changed the world in incredible ways. The biggest thing it has done for us is to make transportation easier and faster.
He brought with him the train, the car, and many other means of transportation.
Under them are more medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free-ranging domestic cats) that eat much more numerous small prey such as insects, rodents, rodents and birds.
The key to their success is the concept of niche, a special task that each cat has and that keeps it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of cats, living in large groups called prides.
Groups (prides) are made up of one to three related adult males, plus a maximum of thirty females and young.
Women, in general, are closely related to each other, as they are a large family of brothers and sisters.
Ion packs act like packs of puppies or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and are also very fatal to their prey.
A good all-round athlete, the tiger can swim (though not very well), jump great distances and pull five times the force of a strong man.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars.
The tiger's roar is not like the roar of a lion's loud voice, but more like a sentence of clumsily uttered words.
Ocelots are small predators, preying on snakes, lizards, and birds if they can, and almost all of the animals they hunt are much smaller.
Scientists think that ocelots follow and find prey by scent, holding onto the ground where they were.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision, and move around in hiding, too.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it came (as if it moves over a mountain range or river, or if it moves to a new island so that it cannot move back easily) it often finds itself in a different environment than it was before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a strong competitor than they did before.
The original population has not changed at all, still needing the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it begins to look less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot even be called the same species.
This process is called speciation, which simply means the formation of new species.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe in, and they absorb the carbon dioxide that humans breathe out (i.e., exhale).
Plants make their food from the sun by photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our homes from plants and we make our clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals cannot survive.
The mosasaur was the top predator of its day, so it was not afraid of anything but other mosasaurs.
Her long jaw was filled with over 70 sharp teeth, as well as another set of years with her roof, meaning that anyone who came in her way had no chance of escaping.
We cannot be sure, but he may have had a tongue split in two, a diet that included beef, big fish, other mammals, and possibly even a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that went into the water; even a giant dinosaur like T. rex would not have been able to defeat it.
While most of their food is familiar to us, the Romans actually had a number of holiday items that were strange or unusual, including wild boar, the pagon, the baby, and a type of rodent that resembled a sleeper mouse.
Another difference was that while the poor and the woman ate their meals sitting on the chairs, the rich men enjoyed having a lunch together where they would lie on their sides while eating their food.
The cuisines of Ancient Rome could not include the food brought to Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no wheat, tomatoes, potatoes, or cacao, and no ancient Roman ever touched a turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each of their gods that was considered the house of the god.
People made sacrifices to the gods and priests tried to satisfy the gods' needs through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard within the temple and, behind it, an inner sanctuary that only the priests could enter.
Special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were sometimes built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the goddess.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, home was not so important.
Most of the Jewish family's life was spent outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; shops were simply open counters facing the street.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so timber was very expensive.
Greenland had a small population. In Norwegian sagas it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and when he travelled further west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But whatever he discovered, Eskimo tribes were already living there.
Although each country was 'Scandinavian', there were many differences between the people, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think there was a treasure map on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
Written on the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776".
While no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that early in its history, the large document made of parchment (measuring 293⁄4 by 241⁄2 inches) was rolled up for storage.
Therefore, it is likely that the notation was added simply as a label.
The D-Day landings and the ensuing battles had liberated Northern France, but the South remained unfree.
It was led by French "Vichy"s, Frenchmen who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders rather than fight against them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded Southern France, the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
Within two weeks the Americans and Free French forces had liberated the South of France and were turning towards Germany.
Civility is a singular culture shared by a large and significant group of people who live and work cooperatively, society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, related to the Latin words civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and which also defines the size of society in a certain way.
Cities are the forerunners of nations.Civilized culture implies the transfer of knowledge across generations, a persistent cultural imprint and fair dissemination.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and are not recognised as proper civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government with Congress as its sole component under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, and, because there was no national executive or judiciary, it depended on state authorities to enforce all its acts but, often, they did not cooperate.
It had no power to overcome tax laws and interstate fees.
The Articles required unanimous consent from all states before they could be amended and the states did not take the central government so seriously that their representatives were often absent.
Italy's national football team, along with the German national football team is the second most successful team in the world and were the 2006 FIFA World Cup champions.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international games and Olympic events.
The Japanese have almost 7,000 islands (the largest one is Honshu) and, therefore, this makes Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Because of its location in Japan, Japan is often called, on a geographical basis, an "archipel".
Taiwan's beginnings date back to the early 15th century when European sailors passing through recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in South Taiwan, and began a transformation in its native wheat production practices and employed Chinese workers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) forces took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after losing the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of Three Windows.
Much of the buildings at the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a clearer idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration continues today.
For example, the most common fixed-image photography format in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size at the close of the analogue film era.
It is still produced today but, more importantly, its aspect ratio has been overtaken by the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
The 35mm format is actually, somewhat confusingly, 36mm wide by 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to obtain the highest ratio of prime integers) is therefore said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. family of APS formats) are as large as this aspect ratio, or very similar to it.
The often abused and ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining a measure of order in images.
This states that the most effective location for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, came under scrutiny.
For more than a thousand years the Christian religion has united European states despite differences in language and customs.
His great power affected everyone from the king to the common peasant.
One of the key Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church's monetary funds are there specifically for that reason.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether this principle was being met.
Shortly after hostilities broke out, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, halting vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted international law codified by several international agreements of the last two centuries.
Britain had sealed international waters to prevent ships from entering entire sections of the ocean, thus causing danger even to neutral ships.
As there was limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were those of pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, the nations desired to prevent a repeat of such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla went to the United States to accept a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with a four-cent bill in his name, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former job manager) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing the different time periods; each stage of China and each ruling family were distinctive dynasties.
The most well-known of these periods was the Three Kingdoms era, which lasted 60 years between the Han and the Jin dynasties.
During these periods of time there was a fierce war between many nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest eras in the history of Ancient China where thousands of humans died fighting to take the highest seat in the grand palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Even after the Revolution, jobs were opened up to all male applicants and this allowed the most ambitious and capable to succeed.
The same applies to the military because instead of being based on class, army ranks were now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working class people of other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in matters beyond this mundane life. He frequented a cave that became known as Hira on the Mountain of Noor (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which has survived through time, clearly shows Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
On the top of one of the mountains in the North of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, nothing is easy to find even if someone knows it exists.
Nothing can be seen but a beautiful clear sky above and many mountains around. Little of this world can be seen or heard from the inside of the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders of the ancient world that still exists today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramidal structures built in honor of the deceased Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead contains several pyramids (the great pyramid being the largest), several small crypts, several temples, and the great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, crypts, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The 'up' mark is V-shaped and the 'down' mark is a square or triangular shape without a bottom.
Up means starting at the tip and pushing the arrow, and down means starting at the syringe (where your hand is holding the arrow) and pulling the arrow.
The upper beat of a stringed instrument generates a softer sound, while the lower beat is louder and more assertive.
You can make any marks you want with the lapels, but remember that bow marks are there for a musical reason and therefore, normally, must be respected.
King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two children (Marie Therese, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged 4) and the King's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were bewildered, on 6 October 1789, when they were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a violent mob of market women.
They travelled back to Paris in cars surrounded by a mob of people shouting and threatening the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to keep their carriage windows wide open.
At one point a member of the crowd was beating the head of the royal guard who was killed in Versailles in front of the distraught Queen.
The war costs of US imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the US colonial regime to pay the bulk of the expenses and interest on bonds issued on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking institutions.
Of course, the surpluses derived from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people constitute the basic achievements of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars you must understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The time in which the events occurred was commonly called the High Middle Ages, the period of European history in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (AD 10001300).
The Early Middle Ages were preceded by the Late Middle Ages, which is generally accepted to have ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technological push or technological imperative to the narrow sense that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Many interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path largely beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology, in turn, has "effects" on societies that are inherent, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, one might say that cars necessarily lead to the development of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically viable for only a few cars, so new production methods are developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The ownership of the mass of cars also leads to a higher occurrence of accidents on the roads, leading to the invention of new techniques in healthcare for repairing damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a large element of cultural determinism, taken from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals and, over time, resulted in customs and culture related to that geography, and these, being in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of western Europe.
Its fame as an epicenter of luxury began around 400 A.D. and lasted until about 1100 A.D.
Its status deteriorated during the 12th century, largely because the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices that were valued more highly than what the Byzantine markets offered.
At this time the title of Capital of Fashion was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak in the period between the 10th-11th and 14th centuries.
First, the dress was heavily influenced by Eastern Byzantine culture.
However, because communication channels move slowly, styles in the West may lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
towards the end of the Middle Ages Western Europe began to develop its own style. one of the biggest developments of that time as a result of the Crusades was that people began to use buttons to lock clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture carried out for the production of enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic, system that uses raised seeds that are native to the ecoregion in combination with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximise yield.
Historically many farmers were involved in subsistence agriculture and this is still applicable in many developing nations.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel forgotten by society's standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be distinctive because of the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The qualities that determine a subculture as distinct may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often indicate their membership by using a distinct and symbolic style, which includes manners, manners, and language.
One of the most commonly used methods to demonstrate the importance of socialization is to use a few unfortunate cases of children who, due to negligence, misconduct or intentional abuse, were not socialized by adults while growing up.
Some feral children have been abandoned by people (usually their own parents); in some cases this abandonment of children was due to the parents' rejection of the children's serious intellectual or physical impairment.
Wild children may have experienced child abuse or severe trauma before being abandoned or run away.
Others are alleged to have been bred by animals; some are said to have lived in the wild alone.
When raised entirely by non-human animals, the feral child shows behaviour (within physical limits) almost entirely that of the particular animals that have taken care of it, such as its fear of or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, the learning method called scaffolding is more effective.
Escaffolding is not a learning method but, rather, an aid that provides support to individuals going through a new learning experience such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a kind of scaffold but even the little man of the paper clip in Microsoft Office is a scaffold.
The Virtual Scaffolding is internalised in the software and aims to ask, prompt, and explain procedures that may have been too challenging for the learner to handle alone.
Children are placed in foster care for a wide variety of reasons ranging from neglect, to abuse, and even extortion.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring and educational, but it still happens.
We consider the Foster Care System to be a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, caring guardians, stable education, and reliable health care.
Foster care is supposed to provide all the needs that were missing in the previous home.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of the uses and satisfactions approach.
For example, learning and socialization are suggested as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
Personal involvement and continuous relationships were also identified as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when investigating audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements lasting a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is said that one can tell if a person is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his document The Presidents Speech, indicated how people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage are, however, able to assess sincerity accurately.
He even suggests that such abilities in interpreting human behavior also exist in animals such as domestic dogs.
20th-century research has shown that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
The mutation adds a new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the set of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination blend the variation back and forth between the two groups with each generation.
In the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans to meet its amino acid needs from available plant resources.
Moreover, failure to do so has serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most readily accessible plant resources would be the proteins available in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal feed (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible, but provides a high amount of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
After all, it should come as no surprise that our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way that savannas today do.
Sleep interruption is the process of deliberately waking up during your normal sleep period and falling asleep a short time later (10-60 minutes).
This can be easily done by using a relatively quiet swallow that will bring you to sleep without completely waking you up.
If you find yourself resetting your watch during your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, and this will get you out of bed to look at it.
Other biorhythm-based alternatives involve drinking plenty of fluids (in particular water or tea, a popular diuretic) before bed, thus causing the person to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely correlated with the amount of tension in the person's body and spirit.
The lower the stress, the more positive the present life force. Each person has the potential to find absolute peace and happiness.
The only obstacle to this is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but was enriched by the Mahayana path of love and many techniques from Indian Yoga.
As a principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Yoga Kundalini, meditation and the idea that love accepts everything.
With Kundalini Yoga the Kundalini energy (enlightened energy) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
At the heart of Tibetan meditation is God Yoga. Through the visualization of various gods one clears the energy channels, activates the chakras and creates consciousness of enlightenment.
Germany was still common in World War II, and led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA.
Just two years after the war ended, former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
It would last for the next 40 years and would be fought in real, alternate armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defense was already divided, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Rumen bridge.
However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight, when more than 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships for freight transport is undoubtedly the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and goods across oceans.
The job of the navies has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move your people and goods, while at the same time, interfering with your enemy's ability to move its people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. The Americans were trying to move men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German fleet, which mainly uses U-boats, was trying to stop this traffic.
Had the Allies failed, Germany would probably have been able to defeat Britain as it did the rest of Europe.
It turns out that goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes kept them to provide an easy source of milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats were generally kept in herds pasture on hillsides or other grazing areas, often attended by goat herders who were often children or adolescents, similar to the better-known sheep herders.
Wagonways were built in England in the early 16th century.
Although the wagonways consisted simply of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses that pulled them to gain greater speeds and to pull greater loads than on the slightly shallower roads of the time.
Crossties were introduced rather early to hold the rails in place, however, gradually it was realised that rails would be more efficient if they had an iron strip on top.
This became common practice, but the iron gave us more friction on the wooden wheels of the carriages.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first all-iron lines were introduced.
The first known means of transport was walking, humans began walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus (standing man).
Their predecessors, Australopithecus, were not habitually upright.
Bipedal specialization is found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus could walk on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even be activists to reduce future suffering to some degree.
This is similar to symptomatic treatment in many cases.However, if we do not want only a temporary solution, we must find the source of the problems, and we must deactivate it.
It is obvious enough that the world has been greatly changed by mankind's scientific and technological advances, and the problems have been exacerbated by mankind's overpopulation and extravagant lifestyle.
Following its adoption by Congress on July 4, the bill was handwritten and signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson then sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's print shop.
During the night between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as "the Dunlap broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on 8 July.
One was sent to George Washington on 6 July, who ordered it read to his troops in New York on 9 July.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document.
Most paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and still exists today.
Most people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have fangs and they can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have scaly legs and pointed claws, lay eggs, and walk on their hind legs like a kingfisher.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits - or bits, in computer language.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent.Symptoms such as vomiting are general enough that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that specific poison.
The term bug is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term comes from the ancient familiarity with the bugs, which are insects well suited as parasites on humans.
Both Assassin-bugs and Bed-bugs are nimble, adapted to live in a nest or in the place of their host.
Around the United States of America, there are about 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has found that women are twice as likely to have MS as men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interests, or in the best interests of their child, to raise a child.
These couples may choose to make an adoption plan for their child.
In an adoption, the biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can become the parent of the child.
The main goal of science is to understand the way the world works through the scientific method.
However, it is not alone, experimentation, and an experiment is a test used to rule out one or more of the possible hypotheses, to ask questions, and to make observations is also a guide for scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, in particular, on the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all subjects of science, including psychology, were accepted.
When knowledge of the Greek language declined, the West found itself cut off from its philosophical and scientific Greek roots.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behaviour often depend crucially on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic indications, have been documented for most living creatures, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-supporting oscillators that will continue a period of free running cycling even without external indications.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main suggestions that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to insert their own DNA into a bacterium.
They performed two experiments by labelling either the DNA in the bacteriophage with radioactive phosphorus or the bacteriophage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the piece of genetic material affected and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in the germline cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts interested people to visit actuarial areas to enjoy the scenery, including wild plants and animals.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, and visits to parks and the study of ecosystem information.
An example of this is visiting, taking pictures, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people drive from the country's small towns to work and pass by other people whose workplace is the one they just left.
In this dynamic transport shuttle, everyone is somehow linked to, and supports, a private car-based transport system.
Science now indicates that this massive carbon economy has shifted the biosphere from one of its stable states that supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transport systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear similar levels of complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transport systems generate such complaints, why do they fail every day? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two locations and their interactions with each other.
Unfortunately, the study of traffic flow is difficult because the behaviour of drivers cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a reasonably consistent range; therefore, traffic flows tend to have a reasonable consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically.
In order to better represent the traffic flow, relationships between the three main characteristics were established: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly, and their ability to fly helped them avoid predators more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back into place along their body.
This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot flap their wings are the mackerel and the mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System revolves around the sun.
Some people thought he was right but many people believed the opposite; that the Solar System walked around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
That seems sensible, because the Earth doesn't feel like it's moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river in the world. It carries more than eight times the water of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, at some points six miles wide.
In all, the Amazon provides 20 percent of all the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although stone pyramid building continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the Giza pyramids remained the largest in size and the best in technical excellence of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their predecessors, which, at the time, were well over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is about 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the least populous.
The Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the daily language used by many of those working in the state while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper since antiquity, as they can all be found in nature in native form and are relatively easy to mine with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything is made up of a combination of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized that they change into new substances to form what we see.
An alloy is basically an alloy of two or more metals.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
It may also contain an alloy containing small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, and all matter is made of very small particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly tiny that trillions of them sit at the end of this sentence.
Thus, the lapis was a good friend to many people when it came out.
Unfortunately, as newer writing methods emerged, the lapis was relegated to a lower status and less use.
People now text on computer screens, never having to go to a tempera.
Who knows what the keyboard will become when something new is invented.
The fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to combine a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Similarly, when you push a heavy cart up a hill, the fission of the nucleus releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they tend to split with little effort.
The surface of the Moon is made of rock and dust.
The shell is about 70 km wide at its nearest point and 100 km wide at its farthest point.
It is thin under the maria and thick under the highlands.
There may be more lunar seas on the near side because the crust is thinner.
Content theories are centered on finding what makes people happy or what attracts them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they mature into adulthood.
These theories analyze what makes certain people want the things they want and what things in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Hertzberg's Two Factor Theory.
In general, two types of attitudes can arise when managers start managing their former partners.
This type of manager finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions, conduct disciplinary action, conduct evaluations, assign responsibilities, and hold people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, you become an unknown individual who feels compelled to change everything the team has done and mark it as his own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behavior often creates divisions between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are expected to meet the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are some subtle differences.
Virtual team members often function as the point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members as their teams may meet according to different time zones and this may not be understood by their local management.
The presence of a real 'invisible team' (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The invisible team is the management team to which each member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organisation want to go through the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organisation?One of the goals for putting the concepts of a learning organisation into practice is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively in the functional departments of an organisation, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
As a result, the process of an organisation's working together to overcome a barrier can lead to a new innovative process that meets the customer's needs.
Before an organisation can be innovative, management must create a culture of innovation as well as shared organisational knowledge and learning.
Angel (2006), explains the Continuous Sequence approach as a method being used to help organisations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical proof of the theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition.
The correlation between brain pathology and behaviour supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, trauma, injury and tumour affect behaviour and cause changes in some mental functions.
The development of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes that we have never seen before.
This provides us with a wealth of information and material for building simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although Artificial Intelligence (AI) has a strong fantasy connotation, AI forms a very important branch of computer science, dealing with intelligent behaviour, learning and adaptation in a machine.
AI research involves the creation of machines that automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to diagnoses and customer inquiries, as well as calligraphy, voice and facial recognition.
Such things have become separate disciplines, focusing on finding solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the military, as embedded in various applications of home computer software and video games.
Travel is a big part of every classroom.Too often, teachers like to take their students to places where there is no chance of taking the bus.
Technology offers the solution with virtual field trips, where students can look at museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while sitting with their class.
Sharing a virtual field trip with others is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, each year students from the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the State Capitol, each year the website is redesigned, but the older versions are kept online to serve as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing.Although students often start their blogging experience with poor grammar and spelling, having an audience usually changes this situation.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blog writer starts working to improve the writing so as not to be criticized.
Also blogging "makes students become more aware of the world around them". The need to satisfy the audience's interest inspires students to be more creative and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration, encouraging students to extend their learning far beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs "can empower students to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to Internet materials, students will be able to define their positions in the context of other people's writings and explain their perspectives on particular issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the charming, bilingual capital of Canada and is home to a range of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south are Niagara Falls and to the north the unspoilt natural beauty of Muscat and beyond.
All of these and more highlight Ontario as the perfect example of what is considered Canadian by foreigners.
Larger areas further north have a rather sparse population and some are areas in a natural state almost uninhabited.
For a population comparison that may surprise many people: There are more African Americans living in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the coast of East Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest one, and a continent unto itself when we talk about wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam into the land, and it spread widely in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
The region is bounded to the north by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that any woman traveling states that she is married, whatever her current state regarding marriage.
It is useful to wear a ring as well (just not one that looks expensive.
Women should understand that cultural differences can result in what they may consider to be harassment and it is not uncommon to be followed, abducted, etc.
Be firm when rejecting men, and do not be afraid to insist on your preference (whether there are cultural differences or not, you do not want to accept everything as good!).
The modern city of  Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century B.C.E., and the Phoenicians, Romans, and Meridians used it as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese demolished and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, but then abandoned it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan king rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya and it was named Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the ancient Medina, it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan items, such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and a full spectrum of geegaws, but all are tourist-friendly.
Goma is a tourist town of the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano that covered most of the city's streets, particularly the city centre.
While Goma is reasonably safe, any visit outside Goma should be researched to know the state of ongoing fighting in North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for snorkelling with the Nyiragongo volcano along with some of the cheapest Mountain Gorilla trekking in Africa.
You can use the bodaboda (motor taxi) to get around Goma. The normal (local) price is ~500 Congolese francs for a short round trip.
Along with its relative lack of accessibility, "Timbuktu" has been used as a metaphor for exotic and distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, though its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of world heritage sites in danger, due to the threat of desert sand.
It was one of the main stops during the PBS special series Wonders of the African World by  Henry Louis Gates.
The city contrasts sharply with other cities in the country, as it has more Arab than African elements.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in North West South Africa and borders Mozambique to the East, Zimbabwe to the North, and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park is spread over 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each containing different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered the model for South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African National Parks, daily fees are applied for conservation and park entry.
It may also be beneficial to purchase a Wild Card, which provides entry either to selections of parks in South Africa or to all South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the place that many tourists consider to be the main focus.
The building layout that forms Hong Kong's stairway has been likened to a brightly lit smooth bar because of the presence of Victoria Harbour waters.
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the Kowloon waterfront on the other side.
Most of Hong Kong Island's urban development is densely packed on reclaimed land along the northern shore.
This is the place that the British colonizers took as theirs and so if you are looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest coastal mangrove forest in the world, stretching 80 km (50 mi) from the coast to the interior of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest in the Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
Forests are not just mangroves  wetlands  they include some of the last remaining stands of the impressive forests that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, about a third of which is covered by water/wetlands.
Since 1966 the Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Royal Bengal tigers and some 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses leave the inter-district bus station (river-long) during the day, although most of them, especially those going east and Jakar/Bumthang depart between 6:30 and 7:30 in the morning.
Since buses between districts are often full, it is recommended to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Many districts have small, comfortable and robust Japanese Coaster Bus services.
Shared taxis are a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (No 150) and Punakha (No 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 metres high, 378 metres long and have two runways 3.50 metres wide.
The vertical void under the bridge is 15 metres. Construction was completed in August 2011, it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs control points are expected to be ready.
The Guarani were the most significant indigenous group living in what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region contained other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived by hunting, harvesting and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly called "The Giant Province of the Indies", was born as a result of the meeting of Spanish conquistadors with native indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a three-century period of colonization.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known to have one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Tournaments and smaller games can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For news on tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, check the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falklands pound (FKP) whose value is equivalent to that of the British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank in the islands located in Stanley next to the FIC West store.
British pounds will generally be accepted everywhere on the islands and in Stanley credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
On the outer islands, credit cards will probably not be accepted, although British and US currency may be accepted; speak to owners in advance to see what an acceptable payment method is.
It is almost impossible to change the Falkland currency outside the islands, so exchange the money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo lies south of the Equator, it is summer when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics; in the summer months, temperatures above +30°C are common.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no particular 'rain' and 'dry' seasons: the amount of rainfall remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are used to seeing humans, wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, keep at least 100 yards/meter away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meter away from all other wild animals!
No matter how docile they may seem, bison, elk, moose, bears, and almost any large animal can attack.
Each year, dozens of visitors are injured because they do not keep the proper distance. e animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so they have their space.
However, be aware that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking food with strong smells and keep the countryside clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the mid-19th century and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of the infamous naval conflict in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to leave the port.
All but one British cruiser was sunk, and nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the Mau movement's independence struggle, a peaceful meeting in the town resulted in the assassination of the main leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many sandy beaches, as Auckland is located between two ports.
The North Shore beaches (in the  North Harbour district) are located in the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the North to Devonport in the South.
Almost all are sandy beaches with safe swimming, and the majority have shade provided by pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of  Tamaki Drive are located within the Port of  Waitemata, in the prestigious suburbs of  Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These are sandy beaches for the family that are sometimes crowded and have a good range of shops along the shore.
The main local beer is Number One, not a complex beer, but it is pleasant and refreshing.
There are many French wines to be found, but New Zealand and Australian wines probably travel better.
Local tap water is good to drink, but you can easily find bottled water if you have any concerns.
For Australians, the idea of coffee being called flat white is unfamiliar. Short black is espresso, cappuccino is filled with lots of cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is Belgian by Belgian standards.
Many trips to the beach are made throughout the year, and injuries from any of these beaches are rare.
However, you should take advice from the authorities, follow all signs, and pay close attention to safety messages.
The box jellyfish is found near beaches and near river estuaries from October to April in the north of 1770 and can sometimes be seen outside these times.
Although shark species exist, they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away from them.
Saltwater crocodiles are not active in the ocean, their primary habitat is in river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
If you book in advance, you can rest assured that you will have a place to sleep when you arrive at your destination.
Travel agents often make agreements with specific hotels, although you may find it possible to book other forms of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agent.
Travel agents often offer packages that include breakfast, transport arrangements to/from the airport and even packages that combine flight and hotel.
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need more time to think about the offer or to obtain other documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
Any amendment or request for a fee shall first be forwarded to the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the vast majority of music festivalgoers decide to camp on site, and many consider this an essential part of the experience.
If you want to see the action up close you have to get there early to have a campsite close to the music.
Remember that although the music on the main stages may be over, there may be sections of the festival that continue to play music late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you are crossing the North Baltic in winter, watch the cabin location carefully, as crossing the ice makes a horrible noise for those most affected.
The cruise ships in St Petersburg include time in the city.
Casinos typically make great efforts to maximize the time and money spent by guests.There are usually no windows and clocks and it may be difficult to find exit places.
They usually have special food, drink and entertainment offerings, to keep guests in a good mood, and to keep them on the spot.
Some venues offer free alcohol, but the drunkenness distorts judgment, and all good players know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone who will drive at high latitudes or cross mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy roads, there is little friction and you cannot drive as if you were on exposed asphalt.
During heavy snowstorms, you may get enough snow to get stuck in a short time.
Visibility may also be restricted by falling or flying snow or condensation or ice on the windows of vehicles.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues to run largely uninterrupted all year round.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the focal point of many visitors.
The term safari in popular usage refers to traveling on land to observe African wild and wonderful animals, particularly in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach cars and near standard equipment that allows good views.
Lions, cetaceans, and leopards are sometimes scattered and best seen with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "bush walk", "hiking safari", or "going for a walk") consists of a hike, either for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some events will be organized in other locations in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, having already hosted the games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may have a complicated situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March most coronavirus-based cancellation policies do not extend to July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
Most event tickets are expected to cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with typical tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Walking on wet clothes can help them dry.Many hotels have a walking path and board available for you to use, even if you do not have one in your room.
If a walking stick is not available, or if you do not want to wear socks that are worn, you can try using a hair dryer, if available.
Be careful not to let the fabric overheat (which may cause it to shrink, or in extreme cases, burn).
There are several ways to purify water, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, if boiling water for a minute is sufficient, in others several minutes are needed.
Filters vary in their effectiveness, and if you have any concerns, you should consider buying your water in sealed bottles from a reputable company.
Travellers may encounter stray animals that they are not familiar with in the regions where they stay.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or worse cause allergic reactions, give poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people by force, generally do not qualify as pests.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to buy goods exempt from taxes and excise duties in certain places.
Travellers going to countries with heavy taxation can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on products such as alcohol and tobacco.
The road between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Freeway, as it often passes through isolated expanses of backwoods.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, beware: steep hills, narrow lanes and heavy turns predominate.
The maximum speed limits are noticeably lower than in the previous and subsequent sections  commonly 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h)  and their strict compliance is even more important than otherwise.
However, curiously, mobile service is much stronger here than in many other parts of the route, e.g. the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German cuisine is quite good, and in Bavaria, it is rich and varied, similar to that of its southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastes are common, and boiled apples are used in pastes all year round, and cherries and pears start in the summer.
Many German dishes also contain onions, jelly, and nuts from other trees.
If you want small but rich meals, try those called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen depending on the region.
Curry is a dish based on spices, along with meat or vegetables.
The carrier may be 'dry' or 'dried' depending on the amount of liquid.
In the inland regions of Northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in South India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
Because there are 17,000 islands, Indonesian food is a general term covering the wide variety of regional cooking found throughout the country.
However, if used without further qualifiers, the term tends to mean food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cooking, now widely available in the archipelago, includes a range of simple spiced dishes, and the predominant flavourings favored by the Javanese are peanuts, chilies, sugar (especially Javanese nut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The legs are a support for the rider's legs extending on either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider but may have safety issues due to the potential for the rider's feet to become stuck in them.
If a rider falls off a horse but has his foot caught in the stirrup, he may be pulled over if the horse runs away.
First, many riders wear riding boots with a thick, loose, rather narrow heel.
Subsequently, some exits, in particular English exits, have safety bars that allow the leather strap of the staff to be detached from the strap if pulled back by a falling rider.
Cochamó Valley (Cochamo Valley) - Chile's main breeding destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, with several large granite and rock walls.
The highest points offer spectacular views from the peaks.Shoppingpers from all parts of the world are constantly setting new routes among the endless potential of its walls.
Snow sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports involving skis or an ice board attached to your feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity with many amateurs, sometimes known as "ski booms", planning a full-day holiday around the skis in a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old  cave paintings showing skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by the Norwegians in Australia.
Backpacking with skis: This activity is also called backcountry ski, touring ski or ski hiking.
It is related to, but generally does not involve, alpine-style skiing or mountain climbing touring, where the latter is done on steep terrain and requires much harder skis and boots.
Consider the ski route as a similar skiing route.
Under good conditions you will be able to cover slightly longer distances than if you were walking but it is only very rarely that you will have the speed of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on the ready tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent but it contains many independent countries.Normally, to travel from several countries you have to go through visa applications and passport control several times.
The Schengen area, however, functions somewhat like a single country in this respect.
As long as you are in this area, you can generally cross the borders without having to go through the passport control points again.
Similarly, by having a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for visas for each of the Schengen member countries separately, thus saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition for what manufactured goods are antiques.Some tax agencies define items that are over 100 years old as antiques.

Reindeer farming is an important livelihood among the Sámi and the culture around trade is also important for many people with other professions.
Even traditionally, however, not all Sámi were involved in large-scale reindeer breeding, but lived off fishing, hunting and the like, and had reindeer mostly as animals to pull heavy loads.
Today, many Sámi work in modern trades.Tourism is an important source of income in Sámi, the Sámi area.

Severe weather can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different types of weather, which can depend on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, ice, excessive rainfall, and fires in uncultivated areas are types and effects of severe weather, such as thunderstorms, windstorms, sea-thunders, and cyclones.

Travellers are strongly advised to be aware of any severe weather risk that may affect their area as it may affect their travel plans.
Any person who organises a visit to a country which may be considered a war zone must undergo professional training.
An internet search for a 'Hostile Environment Course' will probably yield an address for a local company.
A course usually covers all the issues discussed here in much more detail, usually with practical experience.
A course usually lasts 2-5 days and involves role play, extensive first aid training and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines on wildlife survival are common, but there are few publications on war zones.
Travellers planning surgery for sexual reassignment abroad must ensure that they carry valid documents for the return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passport with undeclared gender (X) or updated documents to match the desired name and gender varies.

Preoperative transgender people should not expect to pass the scans with their privacy and dignity intact.
Rip currents are the return flow of waves cut off from a beach, often in a rip or similar manner.
Due to the underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated in a few deeper sections, and can form a fast deep water current there.
Many deaths occur from fatigue after trying to swim backwards against the current, which may be impossible.
Once out of the current, it is no more difficult than usual to swim back.
Try to aim where you won't get caught again or, depending on your skills and if you haven't been noticed, you might prefer to wait for rescue.

When you return to your home country after living abroad, you have adapted to the new culture and lost some of your cultural habits.
When you arrive, at first people will probably be patient and understanding, knowing that travelers in a new country will need to adapt.
People may not anticipate that patience and understanding are also needed for travelers returning home.
The pyramid's sound and light display is one of the most interesting things for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in the silence before the show starts.
The history of sound and light is like a storybook.
The Sphinx is used as the backdrop and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are shown on the pyramids and the different pyramids are lit.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several nations and have the most bases, with seven active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the Peninsula.
Others include Livingston Island, and Deception where the submerged caldera of an active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbour.
Ellsworth Land is the region in the south of the Peninsula, surrounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The Peninsula mountains here merge in the plain, then rise again to form the 360-kilometer-long Ellsworth Range, split in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part or Sentinel Belt has the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, with a peak reaching 4892 m at Mount Vinson.
In remote areas, without mobile phone coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone is generally no substitute for a mobile phone, as you have to be out in clear view of the satellite to make a call.
The service is often used by ships, including pleasure boats, as well as shipping companies that need to communicate remotely by voice and data.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide you with more information on how to connect to this service.
Travel and learning is an increasingly popular option for those planning a year-long break from school.
This is particularly popular with school leavers, allowing them to take a year before entering university, without compromising their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a course during a year of study abroad can actually improve your chances of progressing to higher education back home.
Typically there will be a tuition fee to register for these educational programmes.
Finland is a very good destination for sailing. The Land of a thousand lakes also has thousands of islands, in lakes and coastal archipelagos.
In the archipelagos and lakes you do not necessarily need to sail.
Although the coastal archipelagos and the larger lakes are indeed large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Sailing is a national pastime in Finland, where there is a boat for every seven or eight people.
This also applies to Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but is otherwise quite unique (e.g. in the Netherlands the figure is one in forty).
Many of the distinguished Cruises within the Baltic include an extended visit within St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for a couple of full days while returning at night and sleeping on the ship.
If you leave on land only using boarding trips you will not need a separate visa (since 2009).
Some cruises show Berlin, Germany in the brochures.As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not by the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Air travel can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, particularly if they have never seen or experienced a traumatic event before.

For some, a little understanding of how airplanes work and flight habits can help them overcome fears based on what they do not know or on things they cannot control.
Courier companies are well paid for delivering things quickly.  Time is often very important in the case of commercial documents, goods or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, the large companies have their own aircraft, but for other routes and smaller companies there was a problem.
If you have sent the goods by air, some routes may take days to clear through unloading and customs.
The only way to get through it faster was to send it as checked baggage.
The obvious way to fly first or business class is to spend a hefty amount of money for the privilege (or, even better, get your company to do it for you).
However, this is not cheap: as a rough rule, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy fare for business (business class), and eleven times more for first class (first class)!
In general, it makes no sense to seek discounts for business and first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet established the existence of an advantage in the form of State aid.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.

Rare fauna such as European brown bear, wolf, eagle, cockerel, lynx, wildcat and wild deer can be found there, along with many other common species
While visiting the monasteries, women are required to wear knee-covered robes and to have their shoulders covered as well.
Most monasteries provide a shawl for women who are not prepared, but if you bring your own, especially one of bright colors, you will receive a smile from the priest or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men are required to wear knee-length underwear.
This can also be borrowed from the stock at the entrance but those clothes are not washed after each person who wears them and so you may not feel comfortable wearing these clothes.
Majorcan cooking, like that of similar areas in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil in every dish.
A popular and simple dish, especially in summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes, and available condiments such as cheese, oil tuna, etc.

Since light pollution at its best was not the kind of problem we have now, they are usually located in cities or on campuses, and are easier to reach than those built in modern times.
Many modern research telescopes are huge facilities in remote areas with favourable atmospheric conditions.
Cherry blossom display, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.

All animals originally brought to the islands came here by swimming, cattle, or floating.
Because of the long distance from the mainland, mammals could not make the journey and so the giant seagull became the main grazing animal in the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of humans in the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced including goats, horses, cattle, rats, cats and dogs.
If you go to the Arctic or Antarctic areas in winter, you experience polar nights, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This offers a good opportunity to see the Aurora Borealis, since the sky will be somewhat too dark all the time.
Since the areas are sparsely populated, and light pollution is therefore often not a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than that to which Westerners are accustomed.
