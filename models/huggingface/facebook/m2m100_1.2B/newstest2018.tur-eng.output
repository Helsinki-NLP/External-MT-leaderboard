Previous articleGreat Asteroid 2014 JO25
There are billions, even more, of giant asteroids in the solar system that orbit empty and can cause serious consequences when they hit.
These objects, which may have closed or open orbits left from the formation of the sun, can sometimes pass through the Earth.
The 650-meter-diameter asteroid 2014 JO25 is also such a visitor and will pass by 1.75 million km away, which is the closest to Earth at 14:24 am today.
As the day goes on, we hear this kind of news more and more often.
The main reason for this is the advances in observation techniques and observation instruments.
This allows us to identify smaller asteroids that have not been identified before.
In January, for example, an asteroid the size of a bus passed only half the distance between Earth and the Moon (~250,000 km).
And even more interesting, it was possible to identify the asteroid just a few days before its passage.
So there may be other cosmic buses coming over us right now.
What would you do if you heard that an asteroid of 20 meters in diameter would fall into the middle of your neighborhood?
In fact, asteroids of this size will not destroy your neighborhood, but they will probably blow up the windows of all the buildings.
This will be due to shock waves from asteroids that will infiltrate the atmosphere.
For example, the asteroid that fell into Russia in 2013 was of this size and was enough to break the windows of buildings in several cities.
But if you are near the target of an asteroid with a diameter of 100 meters, you should go at least 50 kilometers beyond your neighborhood.
Criteria such as the size and impact angle of the asteroid are the depth of the crater and the factors determining the damage the impact will cause.
According to the simulation of the European Space Agency, let’s look at a few scenarios.
If an asteroid of 100 meters in diameter hits Earth at a 45-degree angle at a speed of 60 km per second, a crater with a depth of about 250 meters and a diameter of 1200 meters will form.
The impact is equivalent to an earthquake of magnitude 6 on the Richter scale, and even if you are 10 km away from the point of impact, a 3rd degree burn occurs in your body.
50 km away, there will be broken windows.
If an asteroid strikes 1 km in diameter, the situation becomes even more obscure.
If such an asteroid hits Earth at the same angle and speed value, a crater of about 600 meters in depth and 12 km in diameter will form.
So a large district turns into a crater and immediately disappears.
Even if you are 100 km away from the impact point due to the resulting heat, a 3rd degree burn occurs in your body.
The Richter scale is equivalent to an earthquake of magnitude 8.
The damage the asteroid will cause depends not only on the asteroid’s chemical composition but also on the rocky structure of the area it will hit.
The above values are based on the scenario of a hard rock-like asteroid falling into a region of tortured rocks.
If the asteroid is mostly made up of iron and falls to a surface that has been formed by the cooling of lava, the crater will grow three times in size and the disaster will be multiplied as a result.
66 million years ago, dinosaurs suffered an even worse catastrophe, which resulted in an asteroid impacting about 10 km in diameter.
As a result of an asteroid collision, 75 percent of marine and terrestrial life was instantly destroyed.
If an asteroid of this magnitude that destroys dinosaurs has targeted Earth, be sure the most robust option will be to leave the planet.
Tons of matter fall on Earth every day from space.
Most of them burn in the atmosphere.
Some asteroids, which are large enough, burn in the atmosphere, causing flashes known as star slides among the people.
Let’s finish with another reassuring news.
Studies show that a giant asteroid that will cause very serious destruction in the next 300-400 years is not expected to hit Earth.
As an average living creature for 70 years, I’m sure you’ll find yourself relieved.
Flash claim for Medel: 10 million euros!
Gary Medel, whose name in the black-and-white agenda is determined to leave Inter, wants to supplement the Stoper region.
The 30-year-old footballer, who went on holiday after wearing his Chilean form in the Confederations Cup and recently started working with Inter, is waiting for future offers.
The prestigious Italian newspaper Gazzetta dello Sport suggested that for Medel, which could take part in both the stop and the front libero region, Beşiktaş made an offer of 10 million euros to Inter.
While the black-and-white players who offer their offer to Medel are expected to answer from both sides, it is said that the Chilean footballer is looking warmly to live with his family in Istanbul.
Despite the Gazzetta's claim, it is quite difficult for the Black Dwarf, the FFP restriction, to pay a price of 10 million euros for Medel.
The black-and-white players are likely to add the star player to the staff if they go to Medel through hiring, as in Caner Erkin's transfer, or if they go to a serious discount in the conserve.
Negredo announces transfer to the stock exchange
Human rights group issued a travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Color People has issued a warning for colored people to travel to Missouri due to the state’s discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
“The Missouri State NAACP Travel Advisory Statement, valid from August 28, 2017, calls on African-American travellers, visitors and Missourians to be careful and careful when traveling from the beginning to the end of the state as stated there, given the recent suspicious, racial-based incidents occurring across the state.”
The NAACP said a new Missouri law made it harder for people to win discrimination cases, but also that the state’s legal practices targeted minorities disproportionately was effective in promoting the group’s journey.
“There are human rights violations that happen to people.
They are being stopped, beaten and killed because of the color of their skin," Missouri NAACP president Rod Chapel told Kansan City Star.
“We hear complaints that we have never heard before.”
This is the first time a warning has been issued for a state in the United States.
The group illustrated the incidents of racist insults against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, a black man from Tennessee.
Earlier this year, Sanders was arrested by Missouri police without being charged with a crime and died in suspicious circumstances after the fuel was exhausted while passing through the state.
The advisory report also draws attention to a new report by the Missouri Attorney General showing that black drivers are 75 percent more likely to be stopped in the state than whites.
Chapel said: “The advice is to keep people awake and warn their families, friends, and co-workers that they may be in Missouri.”
“People should be prepared to bring with them the money they need, to inform their relatives that they are going to pass through this state.”
In Missouri, 100 hate crimes were committed in 2015, according to the latest figures in the FBI’s reporting program for hate crimes, placing the state 16th in the country in terms of the number of similar violations.
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law where it is more difficult for a workplace to sue for discrimination when renting housing or doing a job.
The American Civil Liberties Association (ACLU) has previously issued travel recommendations for Texas and Arizona after the local enforcement authorities of these states passed immigrant enforcement laws ordering people to be arrested for immigration violations; the ACLU says this will increase practices by race.
Travel alerts are typically issued by the State Department for other countries, but recent protests have resorted to this practice in response to a range of laws and trends within the United States.
Demba Ba in Beşiktaş
Demba Ba, who transferred the Chinese team to Shanghai Shenhua for 13 million euros two seasons ago and hired to the Black-White between the turn of last season, returns to Beşiktaş free of charge.
Black Eagle, who requested a detailed health report from the Senegalese player last week, took action following a report from the star footballer.
The black-and-white administration, which started working for the 32-year-old player that the Chinese representative did not think of next season, knocked the door of the Shanghai team.
Not listed
Demba Ba, who was not included in the list because of his foreign status in China, told the administration that he wanted to return to the Black-Whites.
The Chinese team has approved the 32-year-old player’s resignation.
The Senegalese footballer is expected to come to Turkey in the coming days, signing an official contract.
Castillo was operated in Trabzonspor.
In a statement on the website of the Bordeaux-based club, it was stated that Castillo underwent an arthroscopic meniscus surgery from his left knee at the Istanbul Liv Hospital, "Our post-operative player, performed by Prof. Dr. Uğur Haklar, is expected to start training with the team within 4 weeks."
Castillo was injured from his right back in a preparatory match against the Dutch team Heerenveen in the Slovak camp.
The Colombian player, who was announced to stay away from the field for 3-4 weeks due to treatment, was also decided to be operated because of the meniscus problem he had previously experienced.
Announcement of Barzani!
Barzani delivered a speech at a commemoration ceremony held in the city of Duhok due to the 3rd anniversary of the terrorist organization ISIL’s attack on the Ezidis in the Sincar district of Mosul.
In his speech, referring to the referendum on independence that IKBY wants to hold on September 25, Barzani said: "I have to say this with sadness, we have no hope that Iraq will be a just and decent country."
We tried all the ways with Iraq but we were completely desperate and hopeless.
Our past experiences with Iraq have brought us to this situation and there is no guarantee that we can take our rights and protect them.
Therefore, together we must show that we can determine our fate for the whole world through a referendum to ensure life and security.
I also need to draw gold for this; my referendum is not a goal for us, but a tool for us to a greater goal.
Barzani, who recalled that the Iraqi central government had many promises to the Kurds after the collapse of the Baas regime in 2003, said that a direct referendum was made after the struggle with ISIS, saying that the disaster in Sincar had occurred very soon.
Barzani stated that the people of the IKBY want to determine their fate in a peaceful and democratic way for self-defense and development, "The documents showed that Iraq cannot or does not want to protect us as a state."
“He doesn’t want us to move forward,” he said.
Barzani, who reacted that during the fight with the terrorist organization ISIL, the Iraqi central government did not give them weapons, but in a short period of time a fetva established by Khashoggi Shabi was immediately legalized and all weapons were provided, noted:
The defence system of Iraq has not been discussed.
The central government did not do to Peşmerge what Hasdi had offered to Shabi.
Peshmerge is recognized by the Constitution as part of Iraq’s defense system.
But while Hasdi Shabi had no presence in the constitution, all possibilities were dismantled by violating the laws.
We are not saying that we are against Shabby.
Peşmerge and Haşdi Shabi fought on the same front, so why, on the one hand, when Haşdi Shabi is legalized, the existence of Peşmergen and the fight against terror is covered up.
These are our deep wounds with Baghdad.
On August 3, 2014, ISIS attacked Ezidis in Mosul’s Sincar district and killed many people, including women and children.
He returned after 10 minutes.
According to the BBC, the Boeing 777 passenger plane owned by Air France was in the west of Hokkaido in northern Japan while a North Korean missile was in the air.
Officials who recorded that the missile fell to the area where the plane was 10 minutes ago noted that the missile was estimated to be approaching the plane 100-150 kilometers.
Air France said the missile did not cross the route of the plane and there were no problems with the flight.
“The information we have at this stage shows that the missile fell into the sea more than 100 kilometers away from the plane’s route,” the statement said.
Nothing is sacred, right?
Trump's White House is now targeting the Statue of Liberty
The most obvious sign of regime change is that they are beginning to attack statues.
Americans know it as well as anyone else, such as the overthrow of Saddam Hussein in 2003 at Firdos Square in Baghdad.
Stephen Miller, one of the key theorists of the Trump regime, knew exactly what CNN’s Jim Acosta and the president were doing in a chaotic debate over proposals to severely restrict legal immigration while symbolically destroying the Statue of Liberty.
To be fair, Miller’s statue did not attack him.
If he did, the owner of a full boat tour and the imitator of Freedom would lynch him.
But he attacked his essence, and especially the essence attributed to him after adding Emma Lazarus's famous poem to the monument base 17 years after the monument itself was completed in 1903.
Miller, speaking to Acosta, said: “I don’t want to talk about history here from beginning to end, but the Statue of Liberty... is the absurd symbol of light to the world of American freedom.
The poem you mentioned has been added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty."
Miller is really right, but as he says, it’s not really about history.
This relates to the contemporary resonance of Lazarus’s frightening words, in which a state appears to invite not only some elderly immigrants but also the poor of the poor: “The tired, the poor, the oppressed masses desire to take a breath of freedom, the unwanted of the wretched land of the oppressed.”
There has never been a time when the “unwanted unwanted” was so visible on our screens.
Miller didn’t bring literary criticism; he explained that these people are not welcome in Trump’s U.S.
The conflict over the meaning of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural war: it is actually a conflict about the meaning of America.
Lazarus and his friends who campaigned to put his words at the base of the statue after his death knew very well that they had entered a rather political action.
The statue was intended to stamp the links between French and American republicanism and celebrate by representing the arrival of Freedom in the female form with a mosque.
Lazarus changed this meaning: in his poem the female figure was no longer abstract, there was a voice.
And she gives her a very different name: The Mother of the Exiled.
His marriage to the image of the poem is a ghostly feminist blow and a devastating attack on the American immigrant antithesis.
And just as the same Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the right-wingers have long wanted to change it back.
Rush Limbaugh, one of the great speakers of the Baptist John style for Trump’s arrival, argued in 2010 that Freedom didn’t invite anyone in, but was a early-era neocon that kept the American fire in a world left in darkness: “Madame Freedom stands out.
He has to move the mark of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
It’s not to illuminate the way to the United States.”
In a very unusual way, Limbaugh had actually discovered something.
The meaning of the statue was entirely related to the perceptual angle.
The magnificent creative act of Lazarus was to see it as seen after long and mostly horrific journeys by the exhausted, destroyed but hopeful people on the deck of the ships.
It was really about seeing the world from the perspective of people looking for a place to refuge and wanting to heal their lives.
His statue responded to them with words of hope and the warm welcome they needed to hear.
Of course, this is not a perspective that Miller and Trump will find right in any way.
Not to guide them, but to curb hatred, which is their only source of power.
World Championship 2017: Neil Black praises the Scottish members of the UK team
Eilidh Doyle remembers the time when only two Scots could enter the UK team
UK Athletics Performance Director Neil Black says the 16-member Scottish team in the World Championship team will make a “enormous contribution” to the team.
The record-breaking Scottish athlete was selected for London 2017 starting on Friday.
Black believes that "something is developing" in Scotland and that UK athletics should learn from it.
Black said, “We’re adopting this and we’re trying to understand it and we’re going to work until we get out of the job.”
“I’m talking to people at the Scottish Sports Institute and they think it’s about what they’re doing.
Scottish Athletics thinks it has to do with what they do.
British athletics: They think it has to do with what they do.
The man in the corner.
Whatever the combination of conditions, it’s definitely great.”
Many Scottish athletes compete for medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who will compete against Sir Mo Farah at 5000 meters, while Eilidh Doyle was selected as captain by the staff.
“They are a bit humble.
The captain’s speech was incredible,” says Black.
“Whether they’re Scottish or wherever they live or train, a few athletes came out of that room so proud and really motivated.
Eilidh’s natural passion and true feeling was amazing.”
The silver medal athlete from the Commonwealth of Nations, who will compete in the 400m barrier in his fifth World Championship, says it is "unbelievable" that 16 Scots are in the British team.
Scotland's top overall athlete score in previous World Championships was seven achieved in 1983 and 2015.
Last year, he broke five British and two European records.
It will be 1500 m and 5000 m.
Chris O'Hare, who has had a very good season, including British Team trials and victories at the New Year's Games, will be followed by another Scottish, running at 1500 meters.
Doyle remembers his first champion, Lee McConnell, the only other Scottish on the team.
The captain says he is "very proud" of the move because many nurses will not only enter the team but in some cases compete for medals and fight to stay in the finals.
“The special thing about being the captain of the team is that it’s done with the votes given by the other members of the team, so it’s already a huge honor, but knowing that your teammates voted for you and chose you has made it extra special for me.”
"Of course, I am proud of all the Scots who have joined my team.
This shows how far we have gone.
And they are here, as self-proven athletes, as athletes trying to get on the podium.
The Captain’s Speech?
Yes, I think it went well.
I’ve benefited from the fact that we’re very lucky in this situation, because we have a world championship at home.
That is, it’s actually the effect that we can only take advantage of this in-field support and succeed with the fact that we’ve returned to the Olympic Stadium.
I’ll get a second chance to go out there and fight and there will be such a wonderful atmosphere.”
Blocking Critics on Facebook: Don’t Candidate for Government If You Can’t Remove Critics from Voters
Our country’s father had some information about taking a negative place in the press.
Americans loved George Washington, but it didn’t take long for the newspapers to criticize him heavily about everything from domestic politics to political principles.
Of course, I was upset by the criticisms.
But the critics did not silence him.
Because in 1783 Washington said, “Freedom of speech can be abolished and we can be driven to the shore stupidly and quietly.”
This brings me to Maryland Governor Larry Hogan who needs to work harder to be like Washington.
Hogan’s staff blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who expressed their views on his official Facebook page.
The American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit against him earlier this week.
The governor’s staff didn’t care because the case was insignificant, and online comments were full of “who cares?” responses.
Many people say, “This is just Facebook.”
But that is important.
This is especially important when you are someone like Hogan.
This is a Republican governor who is surprisingly popular in a state that is mostly Democratic.
It has the second highest percentage of votes among the country’s 50 governors.
Hogan is not a reactive crazy fireplace.
He demonstrated mastery in leading his state and firm devotion to principles.
He was also quite skilled in using Facebook as his primary tool to connect with his voters, by jokingly introducing his hairless head after chemotherapy.
So preventing people from coming to the governor’s page, which is a public forum, officially designated and run by staff members who pay the people’s taxes dollars, is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan’s female spokeswoman, Amelia Chasse, defended the governor’s executive by arguing that blocking comments was nothing more than regulating them.
But it’s easy to use images of trolls or spammers or hateful people making verbal attacks online.
The Post spoke to some of the real people blocked by Hogan.
And these are only real people who speak to their chosen leaders: a teacher, a job owner, and a priest; not a troll.
They all said their comments were not respectful, thoughtful and contemptible.
The priest made a quote from the Bible referring to Hogan’s Catholic faith in his sharing.
Maryland Bowie's lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani was not full of hatred but asked questions about hate crimes.
In the post’s comment section, he wrote, “I’m slightly disappointed that he didn’t respond to hate crimes and other recent news.”
“I also don’t like the idea that when a lot of people comment on the same topic, some are immediately overlooked as a collective effort from a large group of concerned citizens to a very prominent one.”
What the governor’s staff calls “consolidated spam attack,” others will probably call “thought defensive.”
The Facebook era makes it easier to easily fit a message by blocking an opponent or deleting a negative message.
Much cleaner than the old days when staff were sent out to collect and burn newspapers with critical writings, or arrest and silence protesters.
But even if it’s digital, that’s exactly what happens.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticized for deactivating Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is being prosecuted by Twitter users who have been blocked on Twitter.
One of the decisions that could be referenced in the future on this issue came from Virginia last week.
Loudoun District Administrative Auditors’ Board chairman, U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, said he acted against the First Amendment when he banned a voter on Facebook.
Also in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (Republican) was visited by ACLU due to his use of Facebook and Twitter.
It should not be so difficult.
At the time of Washington, the reasonable-priced postal era had a very similar effect to the Internet.
Between 1775 and 1800, the number of newspapers quadrupled, and unknown writers overwhelmed his leadership.
Even then Washington had unknown trolls.
People who used nicknames such as “Juricola”, “Valerius”, “Belisarius” and “Portius” all wrote letters to the newspapers that undermined Washington’s decisions.
According to the online George Washington Articles Project, which gathers historical documents, petitioners who criticized his stance on the Friendship, Trade and Travel Agreement with Britain had upset the office.
But he did not silence them.
Freedom of expression, opposition and remuneration are at the heart of our nation.
True leadership means accepting it.
Ronan Rafferty hopes to be at the comfort of his home at the Renaissance Club
Ronan Rafferty, a former number one in Europe, hopes that in the next three days, the Renaissance Club in South Lothian will be home to his comfort while hosting the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
Leading the next door before losing to Paul Eales at Archerfield Links, the finalist Northern Ireland feels dedicated to the new venue and acts as the ambassador of the tournament on behalf of club founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
Rafferty said, “I watched the building of the Renaissance Club and we see it regaining its glory with this organization.”
The players will see the field in the best way possible.
Jerry did a great job building this place.
He is an unforgettable defender of this game and is proud of his success here.
It’s a great show for this field.”
Despite winning both the Europen Tour and the European Challenge Tour, the British Eales will fight to defend a championship for the first time in their 32-year career.
The Southport-based actor said, “It really feels special.”
“I didn’t have the chance to defend the Extremadura Open because it was removed from the calendar the following year I won.
It’s great to be back in this part of the world.
A great place to play golf.
The memories of last year are reviving and it was very special to win last year for me and my wife Sharon.
It was a truly special time and we will always remember it with love.”
Earlier this year, Gary Orr, who took part in the European Senior Tour after turning 50 years old, is returning to his field.
This will be the first competition in Scotland since the 2013 Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open.
Helensburgh man Orr said, “When you struggle inside, it always means a little more meaning.”
“You want to do good, but you also feel the extra pressure.
I really playing again and played basically golf.
I’m happy to go so far.”
The three players are former Masters champion Ian Woosnam and Senior Major champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six Scots on the pitch; the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Participation is free and there is parking; £5 per car with one person and £10 per car with two or more people.

I found the answer
It has a budget of 6 billion 867 million Turkish Liras, more than ten ministries, including the Ministries of Economy, Development, Energy and Natural Resources, Science and Industry and Technology, Environment and Urbanism, Health, Culture and Tourism.
The number of employees is 117,378.
Turkey’s biggest propaganda base!
Yes, I am talking about the Chairman!
Yes, I’m going to talk about the Minister of Foreign Affairs Mehmet Görmez!
I’ve been searching for answers to questions in my head...
I wonder what the real reason for the removal of Mehmet Görmez’s seat is.
I have read every article about it.
and no.
I cannot find the answer to the question I was looking for.
At the beginning of this year...
Mehmet Görmez prepared the 2017-2021 Strategic Plan of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (DIB).
The 1 million-pound S 600 model Mercedes was withdrawn under President Erdogan.
There was no problem with Erdogan.
And what happened?
“You can’t say that you’ve been in office for seven years.”
The first President of the DIB, M. Rıfat Börekçi, served for 17 years.
Mehmet Nuri, whom you all know, has been sitting in that seat for 11 years.
The term of office of the President is open.
I ask myself again: Why did Mehmed not leave his seat?
Work is done...
Close to Shia
A source close to the authority said: "According to the traditional rule, Mehmet Dönmez did not possess the royal birth!"
The code for this phrase is: He has no birth!
The person who spotted this phrase tweeted behind him: "The modernist was found by traditional ulema!"
Meanwhile, he was seen as an innovator.
What does it mean to innovate?
The answer to the question was hidden during Mehmet Görmez’s trip abroad.
Date: 27 December 2015.
Mehmed Görmez went to Iran to participate in the 29th Vahdet Conference, which will be held in Tehran - aimed at bringing Islamic factions closer together.
Iran’s religious leader, Ayatollah Ali Hamaney.
He prayed with his people.
And at the conference, he said: “Meshhepler are timely texts that represent different ideas and beliefs in the understanding of Islamic religion.”
All of them are determined by God.
Every one of them is on a path toward the main path, but they are on the same path.
It is never acceptable to mimic the religion of the Mesopotamians or to see the membership of the Mesopotamians above Islamic affiliation.
Separation, isolation and conflict based on the psalm is a reflection of commitment and ignorance.
It is the religion itself that has suffered the most in the past.
I want to emphasize the gold here again:
Poets and Gentiles are one nation.
“No one can deny anyone else because he does not perceive Islam as he understands it.”
A year later...
Only the Turkish leader Selahattin Özgündüz from Turkey attended the 30th Vahdet Meeting.
I mean...
Not birth, but birth
Mehmed Görmez’s trip to Iran and his speech at the conference made him the target of “traditional ulema.”
No one who represented the Turkish state at the next Tehran conference – again – was obliged to participate.
He hasn’t been invited four times since he arrived.
The reason was obvious; Shi’ite-anti-Iran “traditional ulema” in the DIB!
Immediately after the visit to Iran, Mehmet Görmez’s seat began to be demolished from the beginning of 2016.
At the beginning of this, Deputy Prime Minister Numan, who was responsible for DIB, was rescued!
Mehmet Görmez drowned so much that he asked “to bind him to the DIB president.”
In the work...
There was a different view of birth within the state.
As the theoretical worlds were formed in Saudi Arabia and Egypt, the "traditional ulema" identified the birthplace - in the shadow of the United States - with the Vehhabi-Selephilism!
These were Iranian opponents who did not tolerate even Tehran travel.
Cuban Ahmet’s words about Mehmet Görmez were not surprising: “There has been no danger to Dianet from this.”
“O my Lord, let your people have a righteous and faithful righteousness.”
"Elisynneti" was used as a symbolic concept of Iranian hostility.
For a period of time, the FETO – supported by the CIA – has now led the Iranian opposition with new names.
In addition to the fetish...
A photograph of a young man with whiskey in his hand was served to the media with a lie "Mehmet Görmez's son"!
What a coincidence!
Who made the biggest opposition to Mehmet Görmez in the media: the newspaper of the United States-led Lightmakers’ Society in Turkey!
After all...
- Resistance to bringing his birth to the Saudi Vehhabi-Selefi line...
The one who does not divide...
Modernist... A religious man whose consciousness was destroyed by a “traditional ulema” created during the Cold War.
American cultural imperialism continues to rapidly Arabize Turkey.
Do not hesitate that the next President of the Dianet Affairs will be the Vehhabi-Selefi representative!
“We want to protect Turkey’s sovereignty.
Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu has traveled to China for an official visit.
A joint press conference was held in Beijing with Chinese Foreign Minister Vang Yi.
Vang said: “We hope that Turkey will be more actively involved in international affairs.”
China will support Turkey in its efforts to safeguard its sovereignty, stability and security.
“We hope that the issue of Palestine will be resolved with the international community, including Turkey.”
Mr Çavuşoğlu said about the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, “In the search for close cooperation with regional and international organizations, international organizations are not alternatives, but complementaries.”
Officially begins the second phase
Hassan Rouhani’s presidency, who won the May presidential election in Iran, was confirmed by the country’s leader Ayetullah Ali Hamaney.
Hassan Rouhani, who was elected president for the second time in Iran, swore at the ceremony at which the country’s religious leader, Ayetullah Ali Hamaney, also attended.
The ceremony, attended by senior military and political names as well as foreign representatives, was attended by Turkey’s Tehran Ambassador Rıza Hakan Tekin on behalf of Turkey.
Ruhani, who will serve as president for another four years, will officially take office after his oath ceremony in parliament on Saturday, August 5.
The ceremony is expected to be attended by the Turkish Minister of Economy Nihat Zeybekçi.
Security measures at the border gate
From the Cilvegözü Border Gate in Hatay's Reyhanlı district, humanitarian aid, food, medicines, cleaning materials and other materials will not be allowed to pass through.
According to the information obtained, the Babel Air Border Gate, located near the Turkish border, and the Cilvegozu Border Gate, due to negative security conditions in the region, have been closed to transfers other than humanitarian aid, food, medicines and cleaning products.
Assistance from the border gate is allowed.
It is not known how long the restriction will last.
Poverty and Death in Indonesia's Golden Country
Bardina Degei doesn’t use January to cook.
He rarely even uses a container.
The housewife puts a sweet potato, often known locally as a “note”, directly on the fire in her wooden house in Enarotali in Papua, the uncomfortable region of Indonesia, in the Paniai district.
After half an hour, the stitch is taken and wiped out of the appetite, without washing hands.
Degei is sitting on the muddy floor, doing clothes, such as washing clothes with blurred water from a nearby dungeon, with no furniture.
A roofless house in the Sahara has a duty.
As the youngest of his four wives, he was not in charge in any field.
Freemasonry is common here.
Of course, working until late can be dangerous: most men in the village are unemployed and most drink a lot, and there are soldiers.
“No one walks around the village after 5 p.m.”
After a controversial referendum before the units invaded, only 1026-year-olds were forced to vote by force lifting their hands in public, a rare instantaneous glimpse of everyday life in the mountainous regions of Papua, a former Dutch colony absorbed by Indonesia in 1969.
A current movement that propaganda independence against the Dutch government has quickly directed its anger to the government of Jakarta, which hasined strict control over the region and banned foreign journalists or rights organisations.
In 2003, the region was officially separated into Papua and West Papua as independent Papua New Guinea would occupy the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is as deserted as far away; the trip includes a 90-minute flight from the regional capital Jayapura to Nabire and a 5-hour drive with a rental car.
No public transportation.
The cottage of 19,000 people contains wooden houses covered with bamboo fences, roofed iron roofs transformed into various yellowish brown tones by rust.
Let the journalists, very few Indonesians have travelled here and almost no foreigners have travelled here.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, the Mee Pago Papals worshipped a god called Uga Tamee.
There were other changes as well.
Degei, referring to her vibrant, touched coat, dark shirt, and bright coat, says, “We weren’t used to wearing these clothes.”
"We used to wear only leaves on our bodies."
Papua is the poorest region in Indonesia with 28% of people living below the poverty line and the worst mortality and literacy rates in Asia.
But it is also Indonesia’s golden land.
Grasberg, the world’s largest and most profitable gold mine owned by Phoenix-based Freeport McMoran, is located just 60 miles away from Paniai, a mountainous area the size of New Jersey and home to 153,000 people.
In 2015 alone, Freeport extracted gold and copper worth $3.1 billion.
In addition, Papua has an estimated $78 billion in search reserves.
However, these riches, which are a source of misery for the Papuas, allow the powerful Indonesian army to sustain a suffocating existence.
A 2005 study by the New York Times that Freeport paid local military personnel and units about $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 given to a single officer.
The call for more autonomy by the Papals threatens this golden-egging chicken and relentlessly denies its rights.
According to rights defenders, more than 500,000 Papuas have been killed by the Indonesian army since 1969, and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned.
Mass killings in Papua’s mountainous regions in the 1970s have reached genocide numbers, according to the Asian Commission on Human Rights.
Last year alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters in the region.
The 2016 “We’ll Lose Everything” report by the Archbishopate of Brisbane includes testimonies of post-mortem committed in the previous year, such as unlawful executions, torture (according to another report, rape and electricity executions are popular) and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations.
“It’s hard to calculate the number of victims because events happen every week,” says Andreas Harsono, an Indonesian researcher at Human Rights Watch.
Pressures increased as Papua's resources brought settlers from elsewhere in Indonesia.
The region’s 3.5 million population is 83 percent Christian but Indonesia’s crowded islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi are changing demographics as Muslim immigrants come for economic purposes.
Javali warung buffaloes sell gado-gado served with roasted chicken and peanut sauce mixed with vegetables.
Local people are competing.
“Immigrants sell chicken and vegetables cheaper on traditional markets than indigenous Papuan,” says Abeth You, a 24-year-old native of Paniai, who moved to regional capital Jayapura for business.
"This caused indigenous Papuas, Papuan moms (women) to lose the market."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, better known as Jokowi, promised to address inequalities and rights violations in Papua during his 2014 election campaign.
As the former carpenter proceeded along the way to the presidential palace in Jakarta, he took 27 of Papua's 29 districts, including Panaia.
But little has changed in Papua and today the local people feel deceived.
“Our hearts are broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014 with the expectation that it will fulfill our hope that justice will be restored,” says You.
In fact, Paniai experienced his worst condition just two months after Jokowi took office in October.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children crossed two Indonesian military darkness on a motorcycle while singing Christmas songs outside in front of a feast fire at Enarotali.
The frightened children told them to open their lanterns.
One of the soldiers entered his army and later returned with four soldiers, according to local priest Yavedt Tebai.
Victims and eyewitnesses said alcoholic soldiers were chasing the group and beating them with their rifles.
Then one of the soldiers shot a group of children.
One of the children, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was so badly beaten that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the nearby government election commission building was set on fire and the next day events escalated.
Around 1,000 Papuan men, women and children gathered to demand justice on a football field in front of the local police station and military command center.
They carried ceremonial hunting lanes and performed the waita dance of Papua’s Mee Pago tribe (running in the form of a crowd and imitating bird racing).
Some protesters started throwing stones at police and military garrisons.
While the nerves were tightening further, the soldiers were sent orders via internal radio: “If the crowd showed more than three times resistance, kill them by hitting them.”
Yeremias Kayame (56), the head of the Kego Koto neighborhood in Enarotali, saw the imminent danger and urged the crowd to return home, demanding calm.
No one intended to listen.
In the presentation of a wooden house painted in bright colors, he told TIME, “I was suddenly hit by my left wrist when I turned my back.”
Kayame still doesn't know who was shooting but says the bullet came from the gathered military army.
“He was shot many times,” he added.
According to his cousin Alfius Youw, who witnessed the attacks, he was shot three times.
John, who, like many Indonesians, was only known by his name, told TIME, "I ran to him and examined his body to see if he was."
“I saw her dead... I kissed her.”
Papua Police Chief Inspector General Yotje Mende told reporters that his officers only "safe the squad" because the squad was under attack.
Papua police spokesman Pudjo Sulistiyo, head of the branch, said in 2015 that “we have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us.”
“This is a matter of death.”
Human Rights Watch said five young protesters were killed and many were wounded.
The news of the deaths reached Jakarta only the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi delivered an enthusiastic speech in Jayapura, stating that he shared the sorrow of the victim’s families and promised to resolve the historical bullying in Papua.
“I want this vacancy to be resolved immediately so that it won’t happen again.”
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he had established an unjustified mechanism for historic human rights violations.
But the excuses started almost immediately.
“Most of the incidents occurred long ago.
Some are in the 90s and some in the early 2000s.
The point is that we are determined to resolve these violations, but we have processes to go through.”
Speaking to TIME on June 5, Wiranto retreated, saying there was no plan to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, he said, “Everything will be resolved by law.”
Wiranto, whom B.M. accused of "crimes against humanity" related to more than 1,000 deaths during East Timor's bloody independence referendum in 1999, said 11 human rights violations in Papua, including the Paniai incident, had already been resolved.
The families of the Paniai victims have welcomed such claims with painful suspicion.
“I’ve been interviewed four times in the last three years, but there’s been no progress,” says John.
“I am tired.”
Years later, he still lives in fear.
“I am afraid,” he says.
“I’m afraid of being arrested by a soldier, I’m afraid of being shot.”
His brother Yacobus reiterates the view that people in Paniai were afraid to discuss the incident.
He says he was beaten by the soldier after helping to bury four of the victims.
“After I buried the monkeys, the soldier came to look for me.”
The attacks have not stopped yet.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot villagers in Paniai's neighboring Deiyai district.
During a clash between the villagers and the director of a construction company, who refused to help bring a man who was not himself to the hospital, one person died, and 17 others were wounded, including children.
Ravianus Douw, 24, who drowned in a nearby lake while fishing, died on his way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested in front of the company’s construction office.
Police said villagers threw stones at officials, who also reacted with warning shots.
But indigenous people say that the activist tiger (Indonesian paramilitary police) fired at the crowd and killed someone.
Dominggu Badii, 29, who lives near the hospital and witnessed the wounded being raised, told TIME: "We were very panicked, we were afraid that revenge would be taken."
“I’ve been hiding in my house for two days.”
The Deiyai Parliament called for accountability of the officers involved in the matter and the withdrawal of the active police officer from the area.
Paniai has always been a problematic region for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development fuels the dissatisfaction of the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribal peoples who live scattered across Papua’s green mountain center.
Many of them joined the rebel Army Free Papua Movement (OPM), which claimed to defend the rights of the Papuas by random attacks and abduction of Indonesian soldiers.
Some senior OPM leaders, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya, come from Paniai.
In response, thousands of people in Paniai were arrested and held for pleasure by soldiers in recent years under the slogan of “protecting national sovereignty.”
Some are never seen again.
Among the people of Papua, Paniai is known as a “tragic and forgotten place.”
Poverty breeds dissatisfaction.
A little rice for sale in Enarotali is too expensive for indigenous people to buy.
Bread is not available.
People here grow everything they eat: mainly the note, as well as some fruit and leafy vegetables.
Farming is the work of women who can kill four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
They usually store most of the harvest for the family, the rest they sell on the local market.
10 notes are equivalent to only 10,000 Indonesian Rupee (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities between more and more new immigrants have grown since the opening of new air routes to indigenous Papua and Nabire Airport.
Jobs that are already less often go to better-educated and richer immigrants.
It is very rare for Papals to have the capital or necessary qualifications to conduct their own business competitively.
John Gobai, chairman of the Panai tribal council, said, “Young people are not interested in staying in the village because there is no work or money here.”
Tecrit keeps the world’s eyes away from Papua.
Furthermore, the restrictions on information for international media stand strictly.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were expelled from Papua for lack of coordination with relevant agencies, despite the rare permission to film them.
According to Phelim Kine, deputy director of Human Rights Watch Asia, Jokowi’s reporting restrictions to lift and development promises to increase election campaign transparency have not been fulfilled.
In a statement, he said: “There are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Papua and West Papua, Indonesia’s unrestricted eastern provinces: visa waiver and blacklisting.”
The absence of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is mostly limited to its neighbors near Papua.
In March, six Pacific nations (Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands) urged the B.M. Human Rights Council to investigate “varied and widespread violations” in Papua, including the Panaia attacks.
The same countries have historically supported OPM.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Arrmanatha Nasir told reporters in Jakarta that the group's claims "are still valid in the democratic system and there are free media in Indonesia, so it is difficult to cover up evidence in human rights cases."
Local people want more interest from foreign governments.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by the country’s human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on May 4, a source who attended the meeting and did not want his name to be revealed said the local people broke their silence with pleas “We want freedom.”
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but Papuas say it’s unlikely they’ll vote for Jokowi again.
Gobai, chairman of the tribal council, said, “Jokowi is a person with good intentions but is turned over by people who are involved in the Paniai attack.”
Jokowi wants the people of Paniai to know that besides living under the imminent threat of the zorba soldier, they are rounded up in a poverty-stricken barrage with a lot of education and health services.
Gobai says that like other Papuan people, the Paniai people also see their stakes as a "loan" they have given to pay back to Jokowi.
“They don’t need money, they just want justice.”
Despite the threats and intimidation, the families of the victims of the Paniai attack carried out a final symbolic action of resistance: buriing a victim’s body on the ground opposite the police and military station.
They will ensure that, knowing that justice may never be enforced, at least the culprits of those responsible are not forgotten.
“A member of our family has been killed,” says Yacobus, bowing his head forward.
“What else can we do?”
Fire hit Dubai's "Meşale" skyscraper for the second time
A fire in Dubai on Friday destroyed the world’s tallest towers and forced hundreds of residents to flee a 337-meter-long 79-storey building.
This is the second major fire in two years that quickly spread to a high-rise building called the Meşale Tower.
The building was evacuated, no injuries were, and no explanation was given about the cause of the major fire.
“We were sleeping and we woke up to the fire alarm, people were screaming.
We ran down the stairs and it took us about 10 minutes to get to the 50th floor," a resident named George told Reuters.
Dubai's civil defence authorities said the fire team extinguished the major fire around 4 am (0:00 GMT) local time and they were cooling the building.
The government said it was trying to provide shelter for those affected.
This event could raise questions about the safety of materials used in the exterior of high-rise buildings around the world.
The investigation carried out by the Meşale administration following the 2015 fire found that most of the damage was in the coatings, i.e. the exterior panels used for decoration and insulation.
UK police say they believe the insulation and coating system on London’s Grenfell Tower, where 80 people died, may have contributed to the rapid spread of the June fire there.
More than 4,000 chronic patients receive social assistance
From the social assistance program initiated by the Ministry of Family and Social Policy for poor citizens and their families who struggle with chronic diseases, 4,300 tuberculosis and SSPE patients will benefit in the first phase.
The Ministry, which plans to provide monthly support for two-thirds of the minimum wage to patients through the aid program, will also provide regular psychosocial support.
According to the information obtained, the details and principles of implementation of the "New Social Assistance Program for Families Struggling with Chronic Diseases", which began work some time ago under the instructions of the Minister of Family and Social Policy Fatma Betül Sayan Kaya, were revealed.
The social assistance program, initiated in cooperation with the Ministry of Health in order to support citizens who are struggling with chronic diseases and are experiencing economic and psychological difficulties, has the characteristic of being the first in the world in many respects.
Completing all the necessary preparations for the launch of the program, the Ministry will provide families with social assistance program not only cash but also regular psychosocial support.
Thus, it is aimed at ensuring that poor citizens and their families who suffer from chronic illness and continue their treatment processes at home are not left alone, both financially and spiritually.
According to the studies carried out, in the initial stage, poor citizens struggling with subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), a brain disease caused by tuberculosis and rubella, will receive regular psychosocial and monetary support under the new social assistance program.
In the advanced stages of the program, the aid program will cover poor citizens struggling with other rare and at-risk diseases.
In addition to the planned support of more than two-thirds of the minimum wage, additional payments may be made to tuberculosis patients who are unable to afford medical self-care, who are dependent on bed, or who are identified by the health unit concerned as having to improve their home living conditions.
To be eligible for the aid, the minimum monthly income per person must be less than two-thirds of the monthly net amount.
Also, citizens who have SSPE patients should have a health council report organized according to the procedures and principles specified in the "Regulation on tolerance measurement, classification and health council reports to be given to exempt persons".
More than one in five U.S. passengers carries illegal substances on board
According to a survey of airline passengers, more than 20 percent knowingly or unwittingly hijacked illegal substances from U.S. Transportation Safety Administration checkpoints onto the plane, including at least 6 percent carrying illegal knives or other sharp objects without knowing it.
Less than 1 percent claimed that they later noticed accidentally travelling with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
A survey of more than 1,000 people conducted by the jet rental service Stratos Jet Charters also found that younger passengers are more likely to break the rules.
Among the participants who admitted intentionally trying to fly with something prohibited by the TSA, 19.7 percent were from the Y tribe, while therefore fewer than 15 were members of the X tribe.
The most common substances deliberately kidnapped from TSA agents are food and liquids.
More than 3 percent admitted to deliberately carrying dangerous vehicles, while 2.2 percent of women and 3.7 percent of men admitted to deliberately carrying illegal drugs on the plane.
The company said it has surveyed passengers across the country to find out how many people accidentally brought smuggling goods from airport security and avoid doing so deliberately.
It is not surprising that the most likely people to smuggle from security without knowing it are the most flying.
Nevertheless, as the company notes, TSA rules are a bit square and confusing.
People are often unsure of which fluids or how much of them they can carry.
So it is not surprising that the largest amount of substance handled by TSA appears to be banned liquids.
For a while, people thought that TSA might be treating books as smuggling goods.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights but not on international flights.
China welcomes U.S. statement
Chinese Foreign Minister Vang Yi said at a press conference in Beijing that he was “not looking for excuses for changing the regime, the collapse of the regime, the rapid reunification of the peninsula and sending our troops north of the 38th parallel.”
Chinese Foreign Minister Vang said Tillerson reiterated the Washington administration’s principles on the North Korean issue and expressed hope that the United States will implement these principles effectively and in a policy focused on concrete outcomes.
Noting that the security of the Korean Peninsula is a priority, Vang stressed that the parties expect them to find a middle way to resolve their concerns through equal dialogue, and that the Beijing administration has insisted on the purification of the peninsula from nuclear weapons, the preservation of peace and stability, and the solution of problems through dialogue and negotiation.
EPA President Pruitt Refuses to Delay Obama's Emission Reduction Laws
One day after being sued by 15 states, Environmental Protection Organization Chairman Scott Pruitt withdrew his previous decision to delay the implementation of Obama-era laws that reduced air pollutant emissions caused by dirty smoke.
Pruitt represented the change by making its own organization more sensitive to the needs of state environmental regulators than previous governments.
He never mentioned any legal objection to his previous position in a federal high court.
The concern is that the states will begin to meet 1 October, which is the end of the period of 2015 standards for ground level ozone.
Pruitt had announced that he would postpone compliance in June for one year to give his organization more time to work on the plan and avoid "interfering with local decisions or hindering economic growth."
Prior to being appointed by President Donald Trump, Pruitt, Oklahoma’s state attorney general, had long served as a reliable ally against stricter environmental regulations.
Pruitt has acted on numerous occasions since he arrived in Washington to block or delay regulations that the chemical and fossil fuel industries oppose.
The sudden change on Wednesday was Pruitt’s latest legal defeat on the agenda to revoke regulation.
Last month, a federal high court in Washington ruled that the EPA’s executive’s attempt to delay the practice demanding that oil and gas companies, a Obama administration law, control and reduce methane leaks, would go beyond the limits of his authority.
In a statement released on Wednesday evening, Pruitt argued that the return to ozone standards only reinforced EPA’s commitment to meeting new standards on time with states and working through complex processes.
Pruitt, who sued the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job, said: “Under previous governments, the EPA often fails to meet the deadlines for decisions, awaits to be sued by activist groups and others, and has agreed to resolve the dispute to set timelines for the decision.”
“We don’t believe in settling through lawsuits and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take the law seriously and the authority it gives us.”
Nevertheless, the EPA’s statement noted that Pruitt could once again use his “delaying power and all other legally available powers” to ensure that regulations are “backed by secure policies and the best available knowledge.”
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a wider rewrite of ozone laws.
A parliamentary draft passed last month seeks to delay the implementation of 2015 laws for at least eight years.
The motion has not yet been submitted to the Senate for voting.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that sued the EPA this week, said the group intended to continue legal pressure.
Schneiderman said: “The EPA’s change of decision after our lawsuits is a significant gain for the health and safety of 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by dirty smoke flowing to their communities.”
He participated in the case from California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington and District of Columbia.
When general pollutants are released by automobiles, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources that react to sunlight in the atmosphere, ozone is created at ground level.
The resulting dirty smoke can cause serious breathing problems in a rapidly affected group of people and contribute to thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health advocates and environmentalists applauded Pruitt’s surprise decision change.
Lori Ann Burd, from the Center for Biological Diversity, said: “It’s disturbing that so much pressure is needed from the person in charge of protecting the air we’re seeking to this sensible step.”
“We must continue to fight the Trump administration’s ideological struggle to undermine those who pollute the environment and interest groups.”
Inflation only
Turkey, which captured the largest increase in exports in 6 years in July, brought unemployment of 13 percent in January to 10.5 in April and the economic confidence index rose to the peak of 3.5 years, inflation also dropped to a single household.
According to data released by the Turkish Statistical Authority (TÜİK) yesterday, the Consumer Price Index (TÜFE) rose 0.15 percent in July, while the annual inflation also fell to 9.79 percent for the first time since January.
As for the main spending groups, in July, the highest monthly increase was in restaurants and hotels with 1.75 percent, while the most declining group was clothing and shoes with 3.51 percent.
The highest annual increase was in the transportation group with 15.24 percent.
In July, Business Investment Economist Muammer Kömürcüoğlu, who noted that inflation fell in a single house in parallel to expectations, said: "In the moderate course of inflation, the impact of the fall in food and clothing groups prices has."
But in the core indicators, the manche has a rise compared to the previous month.
"We do not expect a relaxation in the central bank's tight position."
Despite the decline in manchet inflation, there has been an increase in core inflation indicators.
From the special comprehensive TÜFE indicators closely monitored by the Central Bank, the B index rose from 9.07 percent to 9.46 percent in July, while the C index rose from 9.20 percent to 9.60.
Enver Erkan, Deputy Director of Capital FX Research, said that the inflation year could be closed at 9.3 percent level, "Inflation could fluctuate until December and fall to a single house in December."
“It may pass the opportunity into the hands of the Central Bank as of the first months of 2018,” he said.
Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Şimşek: Inflation will close the year-end with a single house.
The tightening of the central bank will continue until inflation falls below 7 percent.
We will give the final shape to the reforms in the nearby Food Committee.
Minister of Economy Nihat Zeybekci: We are pleased that inflation is down a single figure, but it needs to be permanent.
In the fight against inflation, food prices must be reduced as well as the supply must be increased.
Development Minister Lütfi Elvan: There may be some upward trend in annual inflation due to the base effect in the coming months, but a drop in inflation will be evident from the first months of 2018.
We expect the annual inflation will fall further.
I wish Fenerbahçe success in the next match.
Sturm Graz Technical Director Franco Foda said his performance in the second half of the match with Fenerbahçe 1-1 in the UEFA Europa League 3rd round of the match was not enough to jump round.
Speaking at a press conference after the meeting, Foda stated that Fenerbahçe is a top-level team, "We couldn't use the wings in the first half."
We played in the second half.
We had a chance for the second goal.
I am proud of my team.
They changed the course of the game in the second half.
We could have been a little better.
Small things were decisive in the game.
“I wish Fenerbahçe success in the next game,” he said.
Foda said that as long as they were in Turkey they felt very well and were happy with the hospitality they saw.
Fernando in Istanbul
Brazilian footballer Fernando Francisco Reges, who started transfer talks for Galatasaray Club, arrived in Istanbul.
The Brazilian footballer who arrived at Ataturk Airport was welcomed enthusiastically by fans.
Fernando, whom yellow-red supporters were showing love with demonstrations, left the airport in a private car waiting for him under security measures.
Fernando, 30, who started his career with the Brazilian Vila Nova team, wearing the forms Estrela Amadora, Porto and Manchester City, is serving in the midfield.
The Brazilian footballer is expected to sign a contract with the yellow-yellow team after passing a medical check.
Galatasaray signed an agreement with Manchester City for 5 million 250 thousand euros for Fernando, whom he has been trying to add to his staff for a long time.
U.S. Military Forces: Internal Security Force.
Colonel Dillon, who has been linked to the U.S. Department of Defense (Pentagon) with video conference management from Baghdad, said the coalition-trained Raqqa Homeland Security Force (RIGG) has begun to settle in areas cleaned from ISIS in the city.
Dillon said: “The Raqqa Homeland Security Force, which consists of mostly Arabs and local anti-ISIS volunteers in the cleansed areas of the city, continues to maintain order and prevent terrorists from fleeing or returning.”
Dillon, who said that 230 people had completed their training this week and joined the group, said that "currently the number of those forces is 850."
Dillon said the coalition trained the group in basic weapons training as well as first aid, armed conflict, scanning and checkpoint operations.
Dillon, who expressed a very intense interest in the Raqqa Homeland Security Force, noted that the coalition would continue to scan applicants for training and employment.
The US-led coalition is cooperating with the Syrian Democratic Forces, which form the main backbone of the PYD/PKK in taking over Rakka.
The PYD/PKK terrorist organization has appointed a PKK terrorist named Leyla Mohammed to the co-chair of the Raqqa civil governance council.
It is said that among the military forces in Rakka will be members of the PKK/PYD.
Dillon also announced that he had gathered heavy weapons from the opposition group Shheeda Karyateyn in the southern Syrian camp of El Tanif, where the U.S.-led coalition cut its support last week.
Dillon said: "After meeting with leaders last week, Shuhuk returned heavy weapons and equipment given to them by the coalition, but some small weapons and light vehicles were allowed to remain in them."
The U.S. said last week that it had withdrawn its support from Shuhuk on the grounds that it went outside the non-conflict zones it had agreed on with Russia and was in operation and was in activities not related to fighting ISIS.
It is stated that the group “desires to fight against the Bashar al-Assad regime as well.”
According to the leaked phone call notes, Trump has pressured Mexico to pay for the border wall.
Notes of phone conversations between U.S. President Donald Trump and Mexican and Australian leaders have been leaked by the Washington Post.
In a telephone conversation on January 27 with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, Trump pressured him not to publicly say he would not pay for the proposed border wall.
The U.S. president haunted the Mexican president who held the wall openly on the ball and said, according to the rumor, "You can't tell this to the press."
Trump launched his presidential campaign on building a wall along the U.S. southern border and promised to pay Mexico for the project.
The first meeting with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull was also released.
Mr. Trump told Mr. Turnbull that the U.S. deal to take refugees to Australia was “masquerade,” “broken” and “stupid,” and that the deal under the Obama administration after it offered the U.S. a ban on the resettlement of refugees would appear to be “stupid.”
Mr. Trump ended the speech by saying to Mr. Turnbull, “This was the most embarrassing speech I’ve had all day.”
Patient broke doctor’s nose
The doctors and staff of the Turkish Higher Education and Research Hospital quit their short-term work yesterday morning in response to the shaking of a doctor's colleagues by relatives of patients.
The crowd gathered in front of the main entrance of the hospital with the "No to Violence in Health" notes they carried in their hands reacted to the incident.
Prof. Dr. Feyza Aysenur Paç, Chief Clinical of Children’s Cardiology at the hospital, said that the slogan “No to violence in health” is inadequate to me, even as a side slogan.
There is no place for violence in health.
"If it goes this way, this people will soon not find a health team that will serve them."
Ankara Provincial Health Director Dr. Kamil Turkmen, Ankara First Region Public Hospitals General Secretary Prof. Dr. Öner Odabaş, Turkey Higher Special Education and Research Hospital Chief Professor Prof. Dr. Mustafa Paç and patients in the hospital garden also supported the actions of health workers.
The man who condemned the incident said:
Violence against health workers is increasing.
One example of this event was resurrected yesterday evening, when our cardiovascular surgeon was struck by a patient’s close.
Although we take the measures we can as our state, ministry and governorate to end these events as soon as possible, we demand that our people also increase their sensitivity on this subject.
I condemn the events of yesterday on behalf of my hospital and my health workers.
Odabaş, who stressed that society should be aware of health violence, said, "Unfortunately, this time we are living, it has become a professional complication."
“We will take our own precautions, but most importantly, our people have their own health workers.”
Turkmen also said that the judicial proceedings related to the incident have begun, "Our laws regarding violence in health have been sufficiently effective."
Government officials are implementing this.
He is currently working on security.
In the past, these were always empty, but now there is a direct public case and the state is appointing a lawyer, following the case.
"There are also examples of severe punishments taken in connection with this," he said.
After the explanations, the workers continued their work.
The incident occurred at 17.45 a.m. the previous day.
The relatives of the patient who lost his life in intensive care attacked Dr. Hamdi Mehmet Özbek, who worked in the Heart and Damar Surgery department, which the death.
Uzbek was evacuated from the scene by doctors and assistants, and police were called to the hospital.
During the incident, when Usbek’s nose was broken, the attackers were arrested.
A witness to the incident said:
When our friend went to his sick relatives to report the condition of a patient who lost his life, the sick relatives attacked our friend and us responsible for the situation and attacked our two friends.
My friend’s nose was broken and he was in blood.
Then we took our friend into the surgery room and hid him.
He pulled the security set between us for 15-20 minutes.
If the sick relatives had crossed that security wall, things would have been much worse.

The YPG in Syria.
The US intervened.
According to information obtained by the AA from local sources, YPG terrorists, with U.S. military support, robbed the houses of residents of Tel Semin in the northern countryside of Rakka, where they entered for the purpose of fighting the terrorist organization ISIS.
The reaction of civilians who robbed their houses and took hands turned into conflict with the terrorist organization.
U.S. troops in the area entered the city with armored vehicles.
"Cougar MRAP" type armor, personnel carrier vehicles and Husky type mine detection vehicles were seen to form a buffer zone in the area.
The terrorist organization YPG does not allow civilians fleeing death in Rakka, which was shot in the framework of the anti-ISIS operation, to enter the cities under its control.
A local activist network called "Rakka is being silently slaughtered" announced yesterday that 121 civilians were killed in the organization's artillery fires in July alone.
Don’t move the old world to tomorrow.
The delayed perception of domestic and world realities can lead not just ordinary people but also countries to crises.
One of the reasons for the delayed perception of the world realities of the backward East, which we refer to as "charming", may be that the reflection of these realities in the geographies of the East is blocked by certain focuses or announced in a non-real way.
Don Quijote and Oblomov's Facts and Change has also been a subject for the literary world to perceive delayedly or not at all.
Cervantes' "Don Quijote" is a compilation that, at the beginning of the formation of the bourgeoisie, still considers himself a knight.
Or Goncharov’s “Oblomov” is a lazy legacy that believes that when facts are ignored, everything can go on as before.
China, for example, was closed to the end of the 15th century as a country open to the world and dominated by the seas, as a result of the passing of a dominant dynasty.
This was until the execution of the captains of ships leaving Chinese waters.
We Turks, who have one foot, eye and ear in the West, and another foot, eye and ear in the East, have experienced constant doubts about perceiving the facts and change, starting with the Ottoman period.
We tried to bring our old and new part of yesterday to today, to understand today with concepts that match old circumstances, to think yesterday tomorrow.
Some of us were able to act as quickly as the focus of thought in developed countries when it comes to perceiving domestic and world realities as well as change.
This has been a constant source of conflict and tension.
The university with Medrese, the modern army with its innovators, the encounters of doubt with faith, has caused a dramatic dialysis.
Even worse, the positions that were new and advanced in a period were not accepted to be old at the end of certain periods and to remain behind.
The advancers of yesterday, after a period of time, began to proclaim the new and advanced "Dangerous", while those who tried to interpret domestic and world conditions in accordance with the current reality began to proclaim the "Hain".
The most important lesson in the Ottoman Empire was that those who delayed the perception of the realities of the country and the world and finally dominated the thought and state life, the empire broke up, collapsed, and the people became impoverished.
The most important lesson our Ottoman past taught the Republic was the fact that the rapid perception of the world’s conjuncture and change was an inevitable prerequisite for its survival.
Because this course was so well embraced, we were able to be an exemplary country of this geography that managed to maintain its unity, integrity, stability in peace from World War I to the present day.
In order to survive the process of global change that has entered into a different approach, we must leave the memories behind and act in accordance with the facts.
In other words, no one will benefit from carrying away the meaningless camps and blood cases that in the past caused the collapse of our democracy.
In today’s world, the smallest mistakes lead to very large and dramatic crises.
The biggest problem is the Middle East in which we live.

The wind of Turkey
Global giants who trusted in the future of Turkey fought the crack that broke the wind farm bid that took place yesterday.
The world record was broken in the tender for the model that the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources set up to ensure the transition to national energy by reducing its external dependence.
With the tender to reduce Turkey’s energy costs, $1 billion of investment and close to 4 thousand jobs were opened.
By 2019, domestic wind turbines will be included in the system.
The renewable resource fields (YEKA) wind farm license tender opened by the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources was attended by 8 consortia including U.S., Chinese, German and Danish giants.
In the tender, financial bidding envelopes were opened in order to first identify the 5 bidders with the lowest bid.
After the first envelope, the lowest bid was $4.19/kWh.
The open margin was set at 0.01 cents.
After the auction began, the joint venture groups of Enercon, Gold Wind, GE, Senvion and Vestas decided not to participate in the open auction.
The competition was held by Siemens, Nordex and Mingyang.
After the withdrawal of the Nordex consortium, MingYang-First Construction and Siemens-Turkers-Kalyon were the last two.
MingYang-First Construction took a break 11 times.
The Siemens-Turkers-Kalyon Energy consortium has never taken a break.
Minister of Energy and Natural Resources Berat Albayrak: a record day for Turkey.
Opening continued for 30 rounds.
The winner of the intense dispute between the two consortiums was the Siemens-Turks-Kalyon joint venture group, which made the lowest bid with $3.48 cents/kWh.
While the consortium offered $3.49 cents/kilowatt-hour at the auction, Deputy Minister Alparslan Bayraktar pulled his bid to 3.48 at the request of the bidding commission at the chair.
With a two-hour YEKA tender, Turkey set a world record.
The $3.48 per kilowatt-hour offered at the auction became the lowest figure in the world in this area.
The previous record was held by Mexico with $3.84 per kilowatt-hour.
Berat Albayrak, Minister of Energy and Natural Resources, who hosted a press conference after the conclusion of the deal, stated that the victory of the German company Siemens is an important message to the region and the world, "When we also look at the 200-year historical cooperation between Turkey and Germany, I think this outcome will make a significant contribution to Turkish-German relations."
Our goals are big.
Today’s findings showed how robust and sure the economy and energy markets are moving towards the future.
No matter how many regional crises there are in the world, I was very proud to show that Turkey is at the forefront of the region and the world’s most reliable investing countries.
“All of Turkey, with 80 million, will be proud of this picture, the biggest contribution, within 15 years of power and leadership, is our President who has brought Turkey to this point.”
Albayrak, who stated that they launched a new era with the tender that was open, transparent and competitive, said: "One of the most important steps of this was the purchase cost of $10.3 per cent per kilowatt-hour with the share of the domestic contribution in the wind until the end, falling by a historic record of $3.48 per cent, a world record price."
I am proud of this in the name of my country.
Minister Albayrak, stating that they aim to take the first domestic production panels in solar energy before the end of 2018, said, "I hope we will also include our domestic wind turbines in the system until 2019.
The turbines will be installed in five designated areas.
The winner of the competition will receive a total of 1,000 megawatts of installed power in each of these 5 regions with the requirement of installing a wind power of at least 50 megawatts.
Siemens-Turks-Kalyon Group’s total investment will be over $1 billion.
With the entry into operation of the domestic wind turbines, at least 3 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity will be produced each year and the annual electricity needs of approximately 1.1 million households will be met by wind.
Thanks to the installed wind turbines, an average of 1.5 million tons of CO2 emissions per year will also be reduced.
The winning company will build a factory with an investment of over $100 million.
The plant will produce an average of 300 to 450 domestic wind turbines with a power of at least 2.3 megawatts.
The consortium will conduct R&D work over 10 years in at least three of the areas of wing, generator design, material technologies and manufacturing techniques, software and innovative gearbox in a total of 5 areas.
A budget of $5 million will be allocated each year for R&D, with 50 technical personnel employing 80 percent of local engineers.
The factory will be established 21 months after the contract is signed.
The license period of the project is 30 years.
Kazim Turker, chairman of the Board of Directors of Turkers Construction, which is part of the winning consortium, stated that the project will be around 64 percent of domestic production, 35 percent of the equipment will come from abroad, "We plan to provide the financing of the equipment from foreign sources, and the rest from domestic banks."
Turker said the bid reflected confidence in the Turkish economy.
Murtaza Ata, president of Kalyon Holding Energy Group, said: “It was a bid to reduce Turkey’s dependence on the outside world by another 1,000 megawatts.”
He said, “We are pleased with the outcome.
Hakan Yıldırım, senior executive of SIemens Gamesa Turkey, said that they have been operating in Turkey for 160 years, saying that "we will do our best to further reduce the cost of electric units."
The local percentage of wind turbines produced at the factory will be at least 65 percent.
65 percent of the 8,000 industrial parts in the wind turbine will be domestic (at least 5,200 pieces).
In each of the five regions, installations of at least 50 MW with a total of 1,000 MW will be installed.
3,750 employment opportunities 10 years R&D obligation $5 million will be allocated to R&D activities each year

Moore’s Ford Massacre: Activists Revive Racist Lynch Affair for Call for Justice
A 1948 model Ford Mercury was passed by a group of spectators in Monroe, Georgia’s countryside, and advanced toward the small Ford Bridge in Moore.
The car, with four black passengers and a white driver, advanced to close the road before reaching the bridge by a group of armed white men.
A middle-aged man in a thin striped dress took a long breath from the head of the gang, and looked carefully inside through the front window.
The people inside were frightened.
“We want that, Roger!” the man cried.
“Take him out of the car!”
As a young black man was dragged out of the front passenger seat, the screams swept through the darkness.
Fortunately, this terrifying scene played on June 22 is just a resurrection.
But when a sci-fi was thrown around "Roger"'s neck, everyone from the audience immediately breathed quite realistically.
Since 2005, human rights defenders have been returning to the Ford Bridge in Moore to revive the lynching of two black couples (Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey) by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
So far, no one has been charged with murders.
Tyrone Brooks, who helped organize the revival, said: “While we see them in our societies, we know who they are, it doesn’t make sense that in all these years not a single person has been arrested.”
“This is a stain in history, but a burden in our souls.”
At the age of 71, Brooks was a former state congressman and a lifelong human rights defender.
For him, this revival is a dramatic call to action and an annual reminder to Monroe’s society that an injustice has never been corrected.
“We want prosecution, we want the outcome, we want the wounds to be covered, we want reconciliation, but we have to get justice first.”
“We cannot have justice until the wounds are wrapped and reconciliation is achieved.”
On July 27, 1946, a prosecutor puts a blanket on the body of one of the victims of the Ford linen in Moore.
According to FBI files obtained by NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding areas were suspected of lynching.
One of them has never been investigated.
While the suspects have remained smugglers for decades, human rights defenders say the twins’ motives have always been well known all over the city: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a high court ruling allowed black citizens in Georgia to vote for the first time in preliminary elections at the end of that summer.
Almost at the same time as the election, according to the FBI, black partner Roger Malcom stabbed a white landowner, Barnett Hester, during a fight for apparently a woman.
Brooks argued that the rumor in the town was that Hester was sleeping with Malcom's wife Dorothy, and that the baby she carried was not her husband.
According to the FBI, on July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a leading white landowner, paid $600 to get Malcom out of prison.
Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey went to prison.
But as they moved away from the prison by car, when they arrived at the Ford Bridge in Moore, a gang of linchers surrounded the car.
An FBI report concludes, “It seems that it was Harrison who arranged and ordered the killings.”
“It is also apparent that there was a covert agreement between state and local law enforcement that not only involved in the murder, but also destroyed evidence and concealed the identities of eyewitnesses.”
Brooks was shorter and more self-explained.
He said, “This was a massacre of the right to vote.”
“They were all killed to send a message to black people in this society: ‘If you record and vote, that’s what happens to you.’”
For a decade, Cassandra Greene has been managing the revitalization of the Ford Bridge lenses in Moore, which take place every year.
Its performance takes into account all the details, is remarkable, and is based on a profound kind of racism that many believe no longer exists in America.
It’s hard to watch and even harder to turn their eyes, but Greene says that’s the purpose.
He said, “We don’t want to talk about linen because it confronts all of us with the ugliness within us.”
“But if you don’t listen to me or listen to what’s happening to me, I can’t develop a relationship with you.”
This year’s production trials began in June, and on the first day, almost 30 actors (a dozen white and the rest black) filled up a room and listened when Greene was eager to enter the well-tested general lines of the game.
Wade Marbaugh is the assistant director of Greene.
He has played the role of President Klansman for years, but he says the role never gets easier.
Marbaugh said, “I feel irritated because that’s not me.”
“But I think it’s important to keep this past alive because we don’t want to go back to that time.”
Actors who played Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester throughout the room, Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, were testing their own rows.
The game begins with Malcom shouting at Hester, who is so angry that he slept with his wife Dorothy.
“I told you, go out of my property!”
Rascona is reacting.
There is a sound of shooting.
And then everyone (at least black actors) drowns in laughter.
Greene is laughing.
Rascona asked, “What?”
He was surprised, surprised.
Am I too hard?
Greene said “No” in jokes.
“I don’t think that white people just called Z.”
One of the black actors threw a mixed stone with a joke saying "Yes."
“You have to push R.”
So the energy in the room changes and a kind of intimacy takes the place of restlessness.
Everyone is dedicated to doing it right, not only for the memory of the game but also for the memory of the four people who were killed.
The stage begins again.
This time he says the word that starts with Rascona N, sharp and accentuated.
Definitely no one laughs.
The revival ends violently and quickly.
There are screams, gunfire and then silence.
A woman dressed in the funeral black stands on the bodies of the actors and reads Billie Holiday’s sadly metaphorical “Strange Fruit.”
One of the two words is broken.
A hundred yards behind, an average group of four dozen spectators sweat their eyes and wipes their tears.
The spectator is divided almost equally into black and white.
A couple came from Ithaca, New York, to see their performance, many of them from the front of the road.
While Brooks takes them on a sacred journey to the cemeteries of Malcom and Dorsey, they all rely on Georgia’s oppressive moisture for almost eight hours.
Until this point, the murders had remained an anecdote, but now standing in the same place as the lens means the air sounds like a curse.
As the final notes of her song weaken, Greene invites the crowd to get closer and examine the bodies.
Children spit on their hands, grabbing false blood and immobile bodies, and whispering to each other.
A little boy whispers, as if reminding himself, “They didn’t really die.”
After a few minutes, Greene thanked the crowd and suddenly finished.
The actors throw the liners and wipe their tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, who plays President Klansman.
Nick Rascona embraces two of his actress-friends and leaves ages in their arms, and the emotional price of the performance eventually comes to him.
One woman whispered, “It’s no problem.”
“We know that’s not what’s in your heart.
You did it for a reason.”
Afterwards, the spectators eat dinner with the actors.
At a table, a white couple from Atlanta is chatting with a black couple about revitalization.
Denise Duplinski finds it hard to find words about how her performance made her feel.
He said, “Hearing these terrible, awful words and those behaviors... come from people who are like you and they do this because they are like you.”
“What this has done to me is to make me think that the lynches are still going on,” he added, “they’re just being tried by police-armed attacks now.”
At the end of the room, Tyrone Brooks eats at the table and tells about her memories of human rights.
He said he has already started planning for next year.
He said, “The resurrection is somewhat inspiring because it describes what we have endured, but it is also instructive.”
As if you don’t learn from it, it can happen again.
Those who do not study their own past, those who do not know their own past, are condemned to repeat it.”

In order to revive the business, Pearson laid off another 3,000 jobs, cutting its profit share
While the British training group Pearson is launching another restructuring program to overcome the pressures the business faces, it has said it will do more 3,000 job cuts on Friday and cut its intermediate profit share by 72 percent.
According to CEO John Fallon, the majority of dismissals in late 2018 and early 2019 will add to the 4,000 positions lost in the previous rebuilding.
In May, Pearson announced a plan that would save an additional £300 million ($394 million) by trying to reboot the fast-moving business to digital learning with a third cost reduction program.
The company, which agreed to sell its stake in Penguin Random House to its partner Bertelsmann last month, said there was no change in this year’s outlook after reporting a 1 percent increase in its basic sales in the first half.
Metin 2 leads to death again!
According to the first report of the Forensic Medical Agency, according to the first findings in Hakan’s preliminary autopsy report, his death was suicide.
In the detailed examination, no traces of scarring and scarring were found on the child’s body.
The cause of suicide is the stretching of the elastic bandage on its neck.
It was also determined that the gland that his family described as the gland was used as an elastic bandage in the injuries.
According to the news from the newspaper Habertürk Muslim Saryar, after the preparation of a detailed report on the death of the child, the report stating that the incident was suicide will be sent to the Prosecutor’s Office of the Republic of Büyükçekmece, which conducts the investigation.
While the police are investigating the child’s suicide with all the details, they are also conducting surveys on the computer in hand after the incident.
It is also said that Hakan’s friends will appeal to the statement.
It is also stated that the information that will be obtained from the computer of Hakan, which his relatives call "improved", can be reached by third parties or a gang.
Police estimate that Hakan may have been driven by a gang to commit suicide.
Having gained certainty that Hakan had committed suicide turned his eyes to a violent Metin2.
Metin2, which responded on the grounds that it led to addiction and violence in children, was banned last year by the Antalya Governorate for children under the age of 15 in 2009" again came to light with the murder of the 13-year-old "mini-hacker" Metin Kang.
In order to play Metin2 designed in Korea in 2005, you need to enter the site and register a member.
Players try to bring peace and justice to the world with the dragon god in the game.
As they do, there are wars, and the dose of violence increases.
In the game, there are also images of battle with cutting machines, such as rows, swords, sticks, clay, delicious weapons, as well as images of people being defeated by the meat of wild animals.
The player buys characters with money to become stronger.
The family who gave their children to the ground the following day after the incident in the house on the Köknar Street in Esenyurt Istiklal District continued to claim murder.
Father Mehmet Ekinci, "The whole dream was to be a doctor, we don't think it could hurt him or anyone else because of the game," said, "They wrapped an elastic hood in their neck and threw a knot on the side."
This is how I found it, my son.
We definitely don’t think our son could kill himself or hurt him or someone else because of a game on the Internet.
I knew he was playing such a game.
It wasn’t a game of great joy.
When he gets bored, he leaves the game.
Mother Grizzly says, “There is no one inside the building.”
My son came home at a certain time.
None of them hold each other.
He had a chair when he came home.
“But when he was at his funeral, he had two chairs beside the computer.”

Parents generally do not pay attention to this.

Children communicate with many people through games.
There may have been a borrowing situation, or a bribery.
Or he has invited a person in the game home, there may be trouble between them.
It may have been influenced by problems with other people who communicate with them through the game, not directly from the game.
The visuality of the game, the fiction of the child may have thought real.
Suicide trauma may be related to blackmail.
If the child is faced with the situation of being complained to the family, the problem can not be solved.
He could not commit suicide because of the game.
It is also possible for the child to be infected.

Information systems consultant Füsun NEBIL: Families need to know the interaction of their children
I can’t say that games are harmful.
Studies have shown that games are beneficial for children’s development.
The important thing here is that parents pay attention to what their children play and how they talk to players online.
Parents should know and take precautions about what kind of content children are affected by.
In the last five years, only two children have died due to gambling.
This also shows that ending a child’s life is not just the effect of games.
What caused this boy to do that?
We need to find out this first.
It is necessary to look at the sociology and psychology around the child.
Eight-month returns at Istanbul stock exchange reached 50 percent
The BIST 100 index continued its upward trend starting in December 2016 in July, bringing it to its eighth month at the top.
For the first time since July 2007, the index grew by 45.3 percent for eight months in a row.
With its performance since the beginning of the year, the BIST 100 index, which has left behind the world’s major exchanges, including Germany, the United States, Britain and Japan, did not leave the lead in terms of yield in July.
The BIST 100 index, which completed July with a rise of 7.06 percent, was followed by the Dow Jones index in the US with a rise of 2.54 percent and the FTSE 100 index in the UK with a rise of 0.81 percent.
In Japan, the Nikkei index ended July with a loss in value.
As per the January-December period, it was seen that the BIST 100 index performed higher than the main world stock exchanges and emerging country stock exchanges.
This year, according to the closing of 2016, the BIST 100 index, which gained 37.6 percent of value, was followed by the Dow Jones index with a 10.76 percent increase, the DAX index with a 5.55 percent value gain, the Nikkei index with a 4.55 percent increase, and the FTSE 100 index with a 3.21 percent increase.
The MSCI EM index, an indicator for emerging country stocks, yielded 23 percent.
Looking at the historical process of the BIST 100 index, it has shown similar performance in the past.
The BIST 100 index, which last completed the 8 consecutive months between December 2006 and July 2007, increased by 38.3 percent during this period.
In addition, the BIST 100 index completed the eight months between August 1996 and March 1997 and the nine consecutive months between May 1997 and January 1998.
Meksa Investment Research Director Eren Can Ümüt said in a statement to AA reporter that the BIST 100 index has continued to rise for 8 months, noting that since the beginning of the year the rise has exceeded the 37 percent level.
Umouth noted that the MSCI emerging markets (EM) index recorded a 23 percent rise, noting that even when we look at these rates, there is a positive divide:
The flow of funds to developing countries has continued since the beginning of the year.
Particularly those in search of high yield funds prefer countries with higher interest rates.
In this case, domestic markets are influenced in a positive direction.
Of course, the appetite for risk on a global scale is also quite high.
In this way, the index of equity stocks in the status of risk assets is appreciated.
In the U.S., we see new record levels being tested almost every week, while the S&P 500 index has risen by 11 percent since the New Year’s Eve.
At the beginning of the year, Uhmut stressed that the U.S. Central Bank’s (Fed) forecast to raise interest rates by 3 puts markets under stress but removed the uncertainty by using the Fed’s verbal guidance policy quite well, noting that there is a market that is unaware of the Fed’s interest rate hike.
Uhmut said that the expectations that inflation in the U.S. is not yet at the desired level, that the Fed will not rush to raise interest rates and avoid radical moves are also quite effective in current pricing.
U.S. President Donald Trump’s failure to cancel the health reform known as “Obamacare” has reinforced his perception that expanding fiscal policies will not meet their promises, saying, “Al the expectations for the faster growing U.S. economy thanks to Trump have a positive impact on the stock markets for a period, the failure to fulfill the promises is strengthening the hand of the Fed and the market in response to faster growth and faster inflation.”
Umüt noted that in terms of Turkish markets, 2016 was a year where many negative events were experienced, and said that it was in an effort to close the difference between the similarities of the BIST 100 index that divided negatively and sold over.
Umouth, who that they did not see a strong recovery with the domestic source news stream, noted that the current outlook could be interpreted as triggering the desire to close the difference between the increased appetite for taking more risks abroad and similar domestic markets.
Technically, Umouth tracked some profit sales in the BIST 100 index, which tested new records with levels of 108,600, stating:
In particular, the 109.500-110.000 region is a critical short-term zone.
It is normal for snow sales to take place after approaching these levels.
We believe that a new local or global story needs to be created in the short term for prices of over 110,000.
So far, the move down of the 107,500 support could trigger snow sales.
In this case, if we follow the 107,000 intermediate support, I think we can see relaxation up to 106,000-105,500 regions.
In particular, breaking the support of 105,500 could lead to a retreat to 104,300 levels, which is equivalent to 50 percent of Fibo’s rise from 100,000 to 108,600 levels.
Noting that the decisions of both the Fed and the European Central Bank (ECB) will be the focus of the global market, Ohmut said that the expectations for the Fed are already clear but that the possibility of the balance sheet cutting program entering into operation could trigger the strengthening in U.S. dollars, although it is not expected to raise interest rates at the FOMC in September.
Umüt said that this situation could trigger profit sales in the developing country (GOU) stock index, which is in the shadow of excessive purchases in the short term, "In addition, the most important thing is what the ECB will say."
Following the July Monetary Policy Board meeting, ECB President Mario Draghi said that he would discuss the course of monetary policy in autumn, bringing the euro/dollar parity to the level of 1,1700.
Thus, statements that the monthly €60 billion asset purchase program will be reduced or can be terminated will mean that post-Fed liquidity will also be reduced by the ECB on a global scale.
“Therefore, in the name of the country’s markets, such as Turkey, the high-pricing and obligatory access to foreign funds can result in negative pricing,” he said.
Erol Gürcan, director of Gedik Investment Investment Advisory, said in November 2016 that there was a very serious rally in terms of global stock markets after Trump’s election as president in the United States.
Gürcan noted that the key element that triggered this rally move is that it is possible to say that developments that boost global growth expectations, including Trump’s promises to reduce taxes, were initially:
The stock exchange in Istanbul was also at the forefront of the global rally.
One of the most important reasons for this is that while the BIST 100 index has remained quite short-lived compared to similarly emerging country markets in recent years, it is worth noting that the steps made by policymakers to support the economy and financial markets have also played a serious role.
In particular, we can say that the Loan Guarantee Fund (KGF), which became active as of March, has had a serious impact on the rise seen so far in the index.
In the rest of the year, however, Gürcan that the positive developments significantly reflected in pricing and that the KGF, which has a significant role in this rise, has also gradually reached saturation, but the BIST 100 index is still stable compared to similar country markets, although the search for a new story for the rest of the year could also gradually come to the fore.
Gürcan noted that the 180-day action plan, which has been looking forward to sharing details for a while, such as increasing the limit of the Credit Guarantee Fund, making adjustments in the direction of supporting the company's profits, and developments such as a possible tax reduction coming to the agenda in the near future could contribute positively in this regard.
Gürcan stressed that major developed country central banks such as the Fed, the ECB and the Bank of England (BoE) will also gradually but slowly tighten existing expansionary monetary policy positions, but also are among the critical risk factors for developing countries, "The Fed, which has continued to increase interest rates for a period of time, is very likely to start the process of balance sheet reduction after September, the possibility that the ECB will end its asset purchase program in the near future and the BOE will be the main developments to be followed in this sense, the possibility that the Fed will be a major developed country center that will increase interest rates after the Fed."
In the possible corrective movements of the index in the upcoming period, Gürcan said that the support area of 104,150-104,600 is quite critical, which corresponds to the 200-hour moving average with the upward trend seen since the beginning of the year, and that the corrective movement could continue to the levels of 101,700, 100,000, 99,200 in case of breaking of this support area.
Gürcan said that if the current uptrend isined and the current historical peak level of the 108,605 resistance is broken, the index could rise up to the range of 110,000-112,000.
Kabil Convoy Attack: NATO Military Killed in Suicide Attack
Authorities say a suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital Kabul, killing a NATO soldier and wounding several.
A NATO statement said five soldiers and a translator were injured.
Unconfirmed local sources say three civilians were killed in the incident in the city’s Karabakh region.
The bombing was the last violence in Afghanistan this month, with more than 30 people killed in an explosion in a mosque in Herat on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
In a NATO statement, it said the explosion on Thursday evening was attacked by a "personally driven handcrafted explosive" in a joint operation with the Afghan army.
The statement said all the wounded are in good condition and are being treated at the U.S. military hospital at the Bagram air base.
Reporters say the growing power of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (IS) in Karabakh are a major source of concern for NATO forces speaking near Bagram.
According to the United Nations, in the first half of 2017, Afghanistan witnessed at least 1,662 civilian deaths, including an average of 20% in the capital.
At the end of July, a suicide bomb car killed at least 30 people in the mostly Shiite region of Kabul.
The Taliban said the attack was carried out by them.
On May 31, a massive bombing in the city center killed more than 150 people in the country’s deadliest militant attack after the US-led forces removed the Taliban from power in 2001.
The act of violence highlights the unstable security situation in Afghanistan, while U.S. President Donald Trump puts the weight on increasing or not increasing the number of U.S. troops helping the country’s military and police.
Reporters say the suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have led to a crisis in public confidence in the government, its policies, and in particular the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA ceases to delay air pollution rule after cases
The U.S. Environmental Protection Organization has retreated from a decision to delay the bill, which is an Obama Act, which demands states to stop emissions that cause dirty smoke, a day later, with 15 states filing lawsuits against the organization over the initiative.
EPA announced its decision to continue with the "2015 Ozone Decisions" on Wednesday, saying the organization showed its determination to work with states late.
EPA President Scott Pruitt said in a statement, “We believe in dialogue with our state partners and being receptive to them.”
In June, Pruitt announced the EPA’s intention to delay ozone decisions by a year until October 2018, with these decisions measuring existing dirty smoke pollution in various parts of the country and determining where cessation is mandatory to meet more stringent air quality standards.
The 15 mostly Democratic states and the District of Columbia filed a lawsuit on Tuesday saying the attempt was illegal.
President Donald Trump’s administration is continuing its quest to reverse the wide range of environmental regulations put in place by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda that Trump calls revitalizing economic growth.
But these efforts have led to a reaction from Democrats and conservative groups concerned about the effects of more emissions on public health.
EPA’s website says ozone-containing air inhalation “could reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms such as asthma.”
The forest is blessed.
Stop and wing transfer.
Beşiktaş president Fikret Orman told Bein Sports about the transfer of Dutch footballer Jeremain Lens and the stopper.
The forest said this.
No surprises in the transfer.
The goal is not a transfer, but a point shot.
We will now make a stop and wing transfer.
We have Champions League matches, I hope we score a good goal.
We have to make the necessary transfers.
10 million euros is easy, but we don’t have such a budget.
If we come to the budgets we call, we transfer, and if we don’t do, we don’t die.
I can’t tell you anything about Lens.
We are a public company.
The end of patience is good.
Is there no threat of ISIL for the festival only for August 30th?
The Ankara Governorate continues to react to the prohibition of all mass events, including sitting, commemorative meetings and other events, including concerts, during the month of August on the grounds of the “Islamic State threat.”
In the prohibited ruling of the governorate, the phrase "all mass activities" is included, while in Ankara 7.
The Grand International Festival of Ankara continues.
CHP Group Vice President and Ankara MP Levent Gök said in a statement to SÖZCÜ that "the 30th of August can not be affected by the prohibitions" and said:
There is serious confusion.
The government is still in doubt about what decision it will take.
The task of the state is to create areas where the holidays will be celebrated.
CHP Ankara MP Murat Emir said: "All Ankara has security problems, only Gökçek's organizations do not have security problems."
Ankara’s Independent MP Aylin Nazlıaka moved the ban to parliament.
Nazlıaka, who suggested with the Prime Minister's request for a response, said: "Isn't this prohibited AKP clearly revealing the hostility of the republic and Atatürk?
“I learned from Edwina that I was betrayed.”
Demet Shener, who continued his divorce case with Ibrahim Celluay, was in Nişantaş with his lawyer the day before.
Shener, who filed a lawsuit against Edwina Sponza, who claimed to have destroyed her yacht, presented the photographs taken by Sponza and Kutluay to the court as evidence.
The socially beautiful Sponza also filed a complaint about Shener, saying "Demet illegally seized my private photos."
“I didn’t know how to eat.”
After this latest development, Shener, who met with his lawyer at Nişantaşı Delicatessen, came out of the scene when he saw the journalists.
Shener, who was very cheerful, was reminded of Edwina Sponza’s claim about the photographs and laughed, “Allah, I’ve probably entered your house.”
In fact, Hatemi also complained about Sponza’s complaint, “There is such a complaint, but the content is not true.”
“We’ve got everything in hand, we’ve put it in court.”
Shener told reporters, “In recent times everyone knew your spouse’s relationship with Sponza.”
“How did you not know?” he was surprised at the question.
What is ?
How is ?
He said, “I don’t know, I swear, I don’t know,” and he said, “Would I believe my husband who looks in my eyes, or should I believe the rumor of Elam?”
Before the journalists insisted on asking, “Have you never heard?” he said, “No,” he continued, “I didn’t hear it, of course I heard it the first time.”
But I did not believe such a thing at all.
Everything was normal, it was in place; there was nothing to suspect.
When I got everything in my hand, I learned everything new.
Answering “Yes” to the question “Was the person sending the evidence Sponza?” Shener confused his heads by claiming that the photographs and correspondence he presented to the court were sent to him by Sponza himself.
Sponza claimed that he had previously assembled his writing with Ibrahim Celluay.
He will sign a contract with Negredo tomorrow.
Spanish footballer Alvaro Negredo will be officially joined by FC Barcelona tomorrow.
The signing ceremony will be held at Vodafone Park for Negredo, which Beşiktaş has agreed in principle on with Valencia Club of Spain.
The signing ceremony, which will also be attended by the President of the Club, will take place at 12.00 a.m.
The Spanish footballer will undergo a medical check-up tomorrow morning.
Qatar: We broke the embargo with Turkey in hours
Qatar's Minister of Economy and Trade Ahmed Bin Jassim Al Thani expressed his gratitude to the Turkish people.
Al Thani: “Thank you very much for your honorable attitude and for your support to us.”
I also extend the greetings of the Emirate of Qatar to my brother President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
The Qatar economy has demonstrated its resistance.
While economies in many countries are negatively affected, our economy remains stable.
We must work with our strength to ensure Qatar’s independence and strength.
We broke the embargo against Turkey in a lot of hours.
There is no lack of anything at the moment.
Our natural resources, the export of natural gas, provide great support to Qatar’s economy.
Thanks to Turkey, we were not affected by the brutal and unlawful assault against us.
Today, Qatar is again continuing to produce natural gas and LNG worldwide.
“After the survivors, we saw a 30 percent increase, not a drop in our natural gas exports.”
Al Thani stated that the brotherly relations between Qatar and Turkey and the work in all fields are ongoing, "The volume of trade between us amounted to $554 million in the first quarter."
Decisions taken in the last few years have played an important role.
As a result of the proof of Turkish products in the Qatar market, the acceleration of the entry of goods from Turkey in all sectors, the making of investments in many areas is extremely important for us.
“I thank you very much for your constructive attitude towards us.”
The cost of the final disaster is 300 million TL
TSB Chairman Can Akın Çağlar said that after the flooding on 18 July, 116 million TL of 7 thousand damages were to insurance companies, that 12 million GBP 800 damages were in the Gökova earthquake on 21 July, and that in 27 July 168 million GBP in flooding and flooding in Istanbul were 22 thousand GBP, the last three incidents found that the insurance cost was 300 million GBP.
In terms of casco insurance, the damage caused by the fill is about 3 thousand 500 lira per car, while glass damage is about a thousand lira.
"The average household damage in the earthquake is 6 thousand lira."
Can Flow Ages, who stressed that they have made intense efforts to compensate for economic losses as a sector, said: “There is no housing insurance for 3 out of 4 people, there is no fire insurance for 1 out of 2, and there is no casco insurance for 2 out of 3 people, and there is an increased risk of natural disasters due to climate change.”
Due to the low insurance rate in our country, the risk of encountering serious damages to our citizens and institutions is growing every day.
These costs should not be allocated to the state.
Insurance policies are not as expensive as they are thought, and the insurance industry is not only a damaging industry; it also provides risk management advice.
Increasing insurance awareness and the rate of insurance is very important for our people and our country.
In the general terms of Kasko insurance, the insured must report their damage within 5 working days, and this period ended yesterday.
"Will the insured be the victim?" the question was answered as follows: "In general terms such a period, the time limit in the Commercial Law is 2 years."
“It’s also a natural disaster, so the insurers don’t have to panic, I don’t pay any company.”
This is how the German media saw the giant bid!
During a period of increasing trouble between Turkey and Germany, the German company Siemens won Turkey’s first wind energy renewable energy fields (YEKA) tender.
German media that the development was “winning the giant tender in Turkey by German Siemens.”
DWelle Turkey said in the news that the Siemens-Turkerler-Kalyon consortium has won the tender of YEKA, "My consortium will make a wind farm investment of over $1 billion."
"The tender opened for the creation of a thousand megawatts of wind energy capacity carries the characteristic of being Turkey's first YEKA tender" in the news used by the words, the number of companies competing in the tender fell today from 8 to 2, the Chinese Mingyang and German Siemens consortia faced, the Chinese Mingyang consortium also withdrew from the tender when the 30th round began.
Energy and Natural Resources Minister Berat Albayrak, who made a statement after the auction, made striking statements on Turkish-German relations.
The auction was concluded with the winning of the German company Siemens, and we can say that this picture is an important message to the region and the world.
If we also look at Turkey and Germany’s 200-year historical cooperation, I think this outcome will make a significant contribution to Turkish-German relations.
No matter how many regional crises there are in the world, I was very proud to show that Turkey is at the forefront of the region and the most reliable countries in the world that can be invested.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who will cross roads to show the most satisfying boxing match in the near future for 147 pounds, met each other for the first time on Thursday.
The invincible World Boxing Council light cycling champion Garcia was in separate rooms at ESPN offices in Los Angeles until he walked the corridor and greeted World Boxing Organization super hair cycling champion Lomachenko.
With a vote unity on Saturday in Showtime, former four-cycle world champion Adrien Broner, after defeating Garcia, both fighters are among the top five members of the list of non-cycle supervised.
Garcia stretched out his right hand and said, “How are you going, champion?
Good luck to you.”
Lomachenko will defend his belt against Miguel Marriaga on ESPN at 7 p.m. on Saturday night.
While the two posed for photos, Lomochenko’s manager, Egis Klimar, noted that a potential rivalry between the fighters would be “perfect size.”
Garcia reminded him, “I’m an old haircut.”
“I went high for Broner, but I’m not that big.
I am 140 years old.
I want to go down lightly.
He also has to pass the light cycle (135 pounds), then we can fight.
This is what the supporters want.
Let us give them that.”
Lomachenko has joined.
“The boxer needs this fight.”
Klimas asked if it should be in front and watch; setting a date with Garcia (37-0, 30 kWh) for the next battle and fighting Lomachenko in an opening match of 135 pounds this year is part of his strategy; Garcia is also interested in fighting with the winner of the Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell match for the light cycle title at the Forum on September 23.
Garcia said, “Battle can be on the front and watch because all fans want it,” and then expressed that it was open to him which channel would offer the best financial package.
We are the main names.
No other name brings such a degree of interest.
When they are ready...”
Garcia said she appreciated Lomachenko as a "huge fighter" and that he could attend Saturday's match.
But Lomachenko hesitated on the knee to praise Garcia, and said that he thought the three cycling champions from Riverside looked "too slow," "sorry, Mikey ... the nakavta you wanted."
Garcia said the focus was boxing after showing the punch power first.
Both said they felt the momentum was created for their own encounters.
“This is a fight that needs to be fought.
No other battle generates so much interest and rumor.
Garcia said, “I’m so happy to deal with this.”
Lomachenko said: “I’ve been waiting for the best fighters and he’s Mikey.
It will be a great fight.”
Turkey from Russia to America
The White House is not considering imposing sanctions that would affect Moscow’s pipeline construction, but sanctions against Russia could increase the cost of these lines.
This is due to the increase in debt costs.
Worried that Western investment partners would consider withdrawing from projects due to sanctions, the Kremlin in return accelerated the construction of pipelines.
The Swiss company Allseas Group, which is building the Turkish Stream line planned to reach Turkey from beneath the Black Sea, accelerated the construction at the request of Gazprom.
According to Reuters, Gazprom has also begun the construction of a second pipeline parallel to the Turkish Stream to be able to export more gas to Europe.
New results of Swedish age test revealed
The latest results of the assessment tests of refugees held under a new medical age assessment method in Sweden have determined that more than 80 percent of those tested are over the age of 18, but not everyone trusts the accuracy of these tests.
The Swedish National Forensic Medicine and Drug Administration (Rättsmedicinalverket) began testing earlier this year.
The tests were designed to make the Swedish Immigration Agency (Migrationsverket) more accurate in assessing the age during the flood process after criticism of the failures of some refugees in assessing their exact age.
To date, the Migrationsverket has submitted 6,880 cases for trial and the Department of Forensic Medicine and Medicine has now announced the results of a total of 2,481 trials from mid-March to July 31, 2017.
Of the 80 percent (2002 subjects) it was ruled to be 18 or older, and in 25 cases the Department of Forensic Medicine and Drug Administration ruled that the experiment was “probably 18 or older.”
In 432 cases, the result was that the person was “probably under 18.”
Tests were performed only in cases where the person's age was suspicious.
According to Johan Göransson of the Department of Forensic Medicine and Medicine, the results are consistent with the past few months.
He told The Local, “We don’t see much difference in statistics over the past few months, the figures are quite consistent.”
The high percentage of cases found to be over the age of 18 does not necessarily mean that refugees lie about their age.
In May, the department revealed the results of 581 tests and said there were 442 cases where "the subjects surveyed were shown to be 18 years of age or older."
When the Svenska Dagbladet newspaper examined the results of the 581 vacancies, it found that 243 vacancies explicitly declared that they were 18 this year.
The medical age assessment method, which involves taking X-rays of 20-year-old teeth and doing an MRI of knee joints, then sending them to dentists and radiologists to analyze them, is criticized in some circles.
One of the suspects was Claude Marcus, an endocrinologist at the Karolinska Institute, who assessed the biological maturity of people who studied whether they entered the period earlier or later than normal.
“I have reasons to think about this and I think that the type of measurement used shouldn’t be that.
It is very doubtful to decide on biological age in this way.
If we can’t say it for sure, we shouldn’t pretend it is,” he told the Metro newspaper.
However, Göransson of the Department of Forensic Medicine and Medicine argued for the accuracy of the tests: “In general, you can say that the risk of misrepresenting a child as an adult is small.
The highest risk is that the person is just under the age of 18, in which case the risk is around 10 percent.
The Temple of Stardust opens today
The Star Hamidiye Mosque, built by Abdülhamit in 1885 to architect Nikolaidis Jelpuylo, will be opened to worship today with Friday prayer after the restoration work.
Regional Director Mürsel Yuli said the restoration work started in June 2013 was completed and the mosque was ready for opening.
Yellow gave the following information: "The restoration work was carried out in 2 districts."
The first part of the mosque was the repair of the main building.
The second part was surrounding.
In the first part, about £16 million was spent, and around £11 million was spent on environmental regulation.
First, the bullets of the wooden cube were opened, after they were renovated, the outer walls, dirt from external factors, were cleared from dirt.
Drainage was done.
When we entered the building, we saw a lot of rich decorations.
This is a work with star motives, which is also very rich in pencil work.
There is a karma here.
"If we think that the Selçuklu traces are also seen, the Ottoman and 1885 were built in the architecture that began to be barocco and barocco."
Abbey has power.
The German Emperor II in the middle of the building.
It was partially damaged, renovated, cleaned and hanged instead.
A really valuable and important piece.
There are wooden cages on both sides of the temple that are symmetrical, called greetings.
We know that this was made by our own great mastermind, Abdülhamit Han.
So we know how it was made by its own hands and as it was mounted here.
Originally, they are still here.
Yellow said that President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan is expected to attend the opening ceremony.
Panic in the eye.
Ukrainian media that the 25-year-old Serbian footballer, who was unable to join Dynoma Kiev, could be hired to the yellow-red club.
Pantic, who started in Serbia’s Red Star team, wore the forms of Villarreal, Cordoba, Eibar and Alaves in Spain.
Pantic signed with Dinamo Kiev last season.
West Virginia Governor Will Change Party
West Virginia Democratic Governor Jim Justice announced on Thursday evening that he would change his party at a rally with President Trump.
Governor Justice said, “Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have left me.”
"Today I will tell you with many prayers and thoughts...I will tell you today as West Virginiaans that I can no longer help you as a Democratic Governor."
He drowned in the showcases.
Justice added, “So tomorrow I’ll change my record to Republican.”
"If I were the technical director, it would be time for you to make a different game."
Mr Trump has promised to make an important announcement earlier at a West Virginia rally.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia with 42 points and the Democratic candidate Justice did not support Hillary Clinton.
According to Forbes, Justice, the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes says he owns coal mines in five states because of the coal business he inherited from his father.
Its assets are approximately $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Congress issued a statement on Thursday evening, saying “Vali Justice’s change of party is another blow to the Democratic Party, which prefers to work to prevent it from making our country great again.”
RNC spokeswoman Ronna McDaniel told CBS in a statement, “With the control of only 15 governments and the least number of state legislatures in history, the announcement by Governor Justice is just the latest rejection of a party that is unleading from scratch to scratch and can’t find a positive, unifying message.”
I will do my best for Turkey.
Third Olympics in Turkey.
He was born in Cuba but came to Turkey for F.Bahçe to recognize his homeland.
He became a Turkish citizen in 2013 and wears the national uniform.
He was first European champion and then Olympic champion.
It is now one of Turkey’s most important medals in the World Athletics Championship.
Yasmani Capello, who raced in the 400 meters barrier, spoke to the AMAZON before the championship starts today.
They didn’t want you because they didn’t like their degrees in Cuba when they were young.
Improve your trainer.
Then they called Amab once you did not go.
Some people think you have chosen Turkey for your money.
What do you say?
The last thing I remember about Cuba was my departure from the national team.
From that moment on, I can tell you what I’ve been through, what I’ve been through.
I was invited to the Fenerbahçe club.
I entered the national team thanks to Fenerbahçe.
They gave me an offer for the offer.
I opened a new page with Turkey.
I had a lot of disabilities in my youth, but after the opportunities offered me in Turkey, I signed significant successes in Rio and Amsterdam.
I’m looking forward to making my best at the World Athletics Championship and winning a different title.
You have been at a press conference in recent days.
Can you tell us the reason?
Whenever a question is asked about Turkey’s ownership of me, I think of my childhood, when I am 23 years old, when I am thrown out of the Cuban national team.
And of course, people in Turkey approach me.
When I won the gold medal at the European Championship in Amsterdam, I felt the same thing when I was playing the Isteklal Marse.
I could not hold my tears.
I am grateful to Turkey for giving them the opportunity to realize my dreams.
I am very happy to be part of the Turkish national team.
I will be here until my feet run.
He said he could have been a Turkish friend.
Now you are with a Turk, and you have gone to Cuba together.
Would you like to share your lives?
The best thing to do with a Turkish man is to be calm.
Compared to the Cuban women.
Turkish women have a relationship.
Your girlfriend is also an assistant coach.
Are you busy all day with food, for example?
He eats more sweet than me.
(They both laugh) I don’t actually have a very strict diet, but it sometimes interferes with what I eat.
My coach, Massimo Matrone, also often has tough warnings with my diet, but I know it’s for my good.
How do you cook with Turkish food?
Turkish women are very good at cooking, but my boyfriend is better at cooking.
Dried beans are my first preference.
I only laughed at him.
My coach in Cuba didn’t believe me.
He took other young people in his place.
We met in Cuba after winning medals on behalf of Turkey.
Looking at my face, he showed me to the young athletes next to him and said, “Look, I raised him.”
I just laughed at him.
My eyes are nervous.
The glasses you wear in the competition.
I only use it for concentration.
When I put on my glasses, I cut off my relationship with the world and put a wall on both sides.
I just focus on the finish line and see nothing else.
What first comes to mind when you think of Tokyo 2020?
by Felix Sanchez
He won a gold medal at the 2012 London Olympics at the age of 35.
If he can do it, I can do it in Tokyo at the age of 33, why not.
Turkish support
Turkcell Deputy Director-General Ismail All, saying that they believe that Yasmani Capello will succeed in London, "We sincerely believe that Yasmani will also represent our flag in this championship in the best way."
We wish all our athletes success in London.
“We will continue to support the further development of Turkish athletics and bring greater successes to our country.”
Coe praises Russia's apology for doping scandal
Athletics chief Sebastian Coe praised Russia’s sincere apology for the doping scandal, but stressed that the time was not right for the country to be re-admitted to the sport.
Russia's athletics boss Dmitry Shylakhtin told the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World Athletics Championship that it was right to ban his country from sport and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said he apologized to all athletes who were forced to win gold and silver medals in the competitions.
Despite his own assessments, the IAAF Congress voted to maintain the ban in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
IAAF President Coe told reporters, “I think today was a very intimate response, a very intimate presentation.”
“The whole council and the whole congress were pleased ... that the Russian Federation has recognized itself, that it has surpassed the very hard days, and that it has done everything possible to ensure the re-establishment of the federation...”
Coe said he was also "convinced" that Russia would accept the criteria for his re-acceptance.
“I think it’s been a very constructive day and I think it’s been done, but Congress supports the mission’s suggestion that it’s not the right time to return Russia’s rights.”
"We need to do everything in the next few months to normalize this situation.
Our guiding principle has always been to want to separate clean athletes from a faulty system.”
Nine Russian athletes, who meet the strict IAAF criteria, will compete neutrally at the World Athletics Championship, which begins in London on Friday.
The head of the IAAF mission, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia has not yet met many criteria for the transfer of its rights.
After a presentation to the IAAF Council in London, he told reporters that drug testing was still inadequate and that banned trainers were still working freely.
U.S. denies tank news to YPG
The U.S. Embassy in Ankara has said no tanks have been deployed to any side fighting in Syria.
The allegations that hundreds of tanks and weapons were sent to the YPG were denied.
The embassy's statement, entitled "Explanation of the false news in the press concerning troops going to Syria", said:
In a series of untrue news reports in the past few days, the US has misleadingly claimed to have sent hundreds of tanks and weapons-filled tanks to Syria to support the YPG.
These reports ignore some fundamental facts about the current situation in Syria.
The U.S. has not given tanks to any group fighting ISIS in Syria.
Much of the U.S. military aid, consisting primarily of light weapons and seals, supports elements of the Syrian Arab Coalition (SAK) within the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDG).
The Syrian Arabs, including the SAK, are fighting to clear the Deaş area and regain their homes.
TYDTA President Ermut: Foreign direct investment will be above last year
Arda Ermut, president of TYDTA, said that 55 percent of all investments that came last year came after July.
Ermut said that due to the FETÖ coup attempt on July 15, there was no decrease in investments, but rather an increase, "Maybe there would be more increase, it hit the ket."
Per if these conditions did not occur, if some regional developments did not occur, we could see a further increase with a shocking effect.
We are more hopeful for next year.
I hope it will be a brighter year in terms of direct investment.
In the first five months of the year, we are going to increase by 11% compared to the first five months of last year.
But we do not find it enough.
“We hope that there will be more,” he said.
"It is not necessary to worry about global or regional developments," Ermut said, stressing that they are trying to diversify investors.
Hermut continued, recalling that 75 percent of direct investments normally came from Europe by 2010:
That number dropped to 66 percent.
Again, Asia’s share went from 2 percent to 7-8 percent.
Russia’s share has increased.
When we tried to do this, some problems arose between the Gulf countries themselves.
Turkey has good relations with all of them, especially Saudi Arabia and Qatar, two major players.
But the problem between these two countries annoys us and causes investors to delay their decisions a little further.
Not just in terms of investments in Turkey, therefore we may be experiencing some delays.
Arda Ermut recalled that some events were taking place over Germany last week but that the government, especially President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, showed a clear and definite reaction to this situation.
When they spoke to investors in countries with the worst political crisis, President Erdogan’s reaction was, “Look, problems happen between governments, not between peoples.”
These people came and invested in my country.
They are no different from Turkish companies.
On the contrary, when they have the smallest problem they come to us, we will solve it.
“We will definitely not allow them to be victims,” Ermut said in the form that they continued to support all investors with the convenience of this.
Ermut, “We can give it a guarantee in the coming period.”
You will see that neither German companies nor investors from countries where we have some political problems in any way will have trouble.
On the contrary, I hope that we will do our best to increase investments from these countries as well.
We believe that investments will continue to rise.
Of course, political developments can sometimes affect perceptions about the investment environment.
“But we will do our best at this point and our investors will do their best to ensure that the perception of the investment environment is not affected.”
TYDTA President Ermut said that after the single-generation single-way strategy, Turkey began to see great interest from China, but that if the problems in the Gulf were solved, they expected the biggest investment from the Gulf.
“In the relations with Germany, there is not even one investor who says, ‘We have had trouble because of these relations, we had investments because of this incident, we are fleeing,’” Ermut, using his statements, noted that there are companies coming, coming and following.
Ermut, "At the moment close to 10 percent of projects in our portfolio are German companies."
That is, almost 10 percent of the companies we meet from all over the world are German companies.
Some of these are companies that are currently investing in Turkey.
Man will grow his investment or have a topic, it also stands open as a project.
“So German companies actually still make up a significant part of our daily workflow,” he said.
Ermut, who stressed that all state agencies should be careful during the period of detection operations in Turkey, said the issue was sensitive and could be affected by the slightest miscommunication.
Ermut, stating that what has been a good lesson in the last 2-3 weeks, said:
Investors and politicians are always different.
We’ve always seen that economic relationships always lead to political developments.
Germany will continue to be our important trading partner and an important investor.
There are a lot of investments in Turkey.
Unfortunately, the election in Germany has increased the number of votes.
When I get there, I think it will go a little further.
In particular, Saudi Arabia has warned the two countries not to make negative statements.
Finally, an investor who invests in Turkey is targeting all surrounding country markets.
So there were some slowing processes not because of Saudi Arabia but because of the uncertainty in the region.
We are still in talks with investors.
In my personal opinion, investors are now waiting for a decision they may be able to make faster.
“I see uncertainty because of the crisis between Turkey and Saudi Arabia in a negative sense, we have no Saudi investor who says I’m leaving here.
On the contrary, we have Saudi investors who still live in Turkey, who visit us while they are on vacation, who follow all their processes.
Arda Ermut, recalling that last year the international direct investment (UDY) to Turkey was $12.3 billion, "I definitely think we will surpass it this year.
“But how far we go, these regional developments will affect global uncertainty.”
While hoping that the shocking effect will normally be more, Ermut stated that it could be a little more limited, pointing out that it went with an increase of 11 percent in the first 5 months, pointing out that it could be preserved, "I hope that if there is no bad development, I believe that this or that end of the year, we will definitely close better than last year."
Signalling that a significant part of the investments will continue to be real estate, Ermut said that new investments could be seen in the fields of logistics, healthcare, fintech, information technology, petrochemistry, food, energy and manufacturing.
Ermut also stressed that there will be new investments they will announce in the coming months, "We may soon be an investment in the sense of manufacturing."
Not a billion dollars, but a huge investment.
“There may also be investments from interested countries,” he said.
4 wine companies in 9 districts operations: 55 arrested
The teams of the Istanbul Branch of Combating Trafficking Crimes Division found that the foil coating that closes the fungal tapas located on the products sold by the 4 wine firms was not glued to the bottle, the TAPDK coatings that were glued to the coating were collected after the products were sold and marketed by sticking to newly produced wines.
OIL teams have argued that the state has lost £20 million and £400 thousand in taxes due to the repeated use of the suspected bandroller.
Police teams conducted a simultaneous operation at 55 addresses of 4 wine companies in Istanbul, Edirne, Tekirdağ, Bursa, Balıkesir, Manisa, Aydın, Denizli and Nevşehir.
During the operation, a total of 55 people were arrested, 15 thousand wine ready for sale, 52 thousand 480 wine bottles filled with TAPDK bandrolls, 12 thousand 890 TAPDK bandrolls, 3 guns and ammunition, 100 boxes of sexual pills, 992 cigarettes, 698 bottles of various types of fake drinks and 100 litre of anason were seized.
Fifty-five people were arrested and brought to the Department of Combating Trafficking Crimes located on Vatan Street.
The suspects are under security.
The operations of their teams in factories, warehouses and workplaces were reflected in police cameras.
Police teams were shown checking in a warehouse by removing the containers on bottles of wine ready for sale.
Packages filled with used bottles were recorded by police teams.
How will the financial rules of football affect Neymar’s move to Paris?
The rules aimed at preventing unlimited spending by European football clubs will not prevent Neymar from transferring the world record from Barcelona, Spain, to Paris-Saint Germain, France.
From UEFA, the governing body that has the power to eliminate teams from the prestigious Champions League tournament, which oversees the European game, to Paris Saint-Germain can come any sort of outcome.
The Financial Fair Play Rules issued by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG will have to show that he has finally financed Neymar’s transfer without enormous losses.
Barcelona has been paid 222 million euros ($262 million) to buy the Brazilian out of contract, and Neymar will be ruled by a salary that will get ten million dollars a year.
Some of the financial aspects of Neymar’s departure to France include:
Given the team’s energy-rich money coming from the Qatar family, PSG can, of course, sign Neymar and pay the money to add him to the other stars’ galaxy.
Clubs are allowed to spend installed money to buy players, but they also have to balance it with legitimate sources of income as they deal with their football-related business.
The FFP was designed by Michel Platini after being elected to the presidency of UEFA in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs who were heavily indebted in pursuit of his success were effectively cheating and were at risk of bankruptcy if the banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, the FFP began monitoring losses instead of focusing on clubs’ debt.
The change meant that the model that Roman Abramovich first used in Chelsea in 2003 (taking a club with potential, spending high on improving the team, and building a global brand) turned into a harder attempt.
During the three-year FFP evaluation period, which lasts until 2018, clubs could suffer €30 million in losses.
Though Platini was notoriously removed from the presidency in 2015, he is still determined to give up his successor at UEFA, Aleksander Ceferin, without excessive spending.
Andrea Traverso, who manages FFP at UEFA, told the Associated Press last week: “FFP is definitely not dead and we will definitely strengthen it by pushing the rules forward.”
Although PSG will pay Neymar’s purchase item in bulk, it could spread the amount over the contract period for accounting reasons.
Neymar has signed a five-year deal, so the transfer fee can be represented in the annual accounts for the next five years as a cost of €44.4 million.
The first wave of FFPs in 2014 saw the implementation of the heaviest arbitrations on Manchester City, which is owned by PSG and Abu Dhabi.
PSG was subsequently fined 60 million euros ($82 million for the time), reduced to €20 million, and ordered to limit the Champions League team to 21 players for the 2014-2015 season instead of 25 normally.
The UEFA is under investigation against clubs that may try to scam financial regulators by inflating their income through companies linked to the club’s owners.
While a Qatar company may sponsor PSG, if the value of the sponsorship is considered to exceed the standard market values, UEFA will not allow it to be considered a legitimate income.
This was the case in 2014 when UEFA ruled that the Qatar Tourism Authority’s PSG sponsorship was inflated.
Some of Neymar’s earnings from PSG may come through payments from Qatar’s 2022 World Cup organizing committee.
But PSG and Qatar have denied that Neymar will be the World Cup ambassador in 2022, and such a move can easily be exposed by UEFA regulators.
The sanctions imposed on PSG in the past mean that UEFA will be even more cautious against attempts to break the rules.
The founder said on Tuesday that UEFA is not in a preliminary conversation with PSG about Neymar's transfer.
Since they were not authorized to talk about the situation of PSG, they spoke to The Associated Press on condition of secrecy.
Recently released accounts show that PSG made more than 10 million euros of profit in 2015-16 with a turnover of 542.4 million euros.
Last year’s financial statements have not yet been published.
PSG expects Neymar’s arrival to contribute to sponsorship deals, gifts and shape sales.
The club expects the price to rise by at least 30 percent after the signing.
The Spanish league, clearly upset by the departure of one of the biggest players in football, has tried to block Neymar’s departure with claims that PSG has violated the FFP.
Javier Tebas, the president of La Liga, quoted the Spanish newspaper AS as saying that Qatar is the definitive owner of PSG: “This is an open ‘money doping’ case with the club and the state.”
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, who owns his own club from an American sports giant, shares his concerns about La Liga being funded by a state.
Wenger said on Thursday, “This is a result of having and it has completely changed the whole floor of football in the last 15 years.”
“Everything is possible once a country has a club.
It becomes so difficult to respect financial fair play because for a country such a big player representing a country can cause them to have different methods or different interests.
Insurance Insurance Insurgency
According to TSB data, the insurance sector has been damaging in the traffic industry since 2006.
The sector, which lost 2.35 billion TL in 2015, earned only 19 million TL of profit in 2016.
Aksigorta, Anadolu Insurance and Sun Insurance operate in Istanbul.
Speaking at the meeting where TSB’s first six-month results were assessed in 2017, Yeğlar said that the 11-year loss in traffic insurance reached 7.3 billion TL, and that they estimated that the loss of the sector this year will reach 2.3 billion TL with the ceiling premium application, the estimated damage-prim ratio will rise to 125 percent.
Age, who said that this year the 2015 figure will be captured, noted that the damage written in 2012 and 2015 also brought the profits of other industries, "This means that by financing the bad driver we are also raising the price of the citizen's housing policy."
"75 percent of the sector is foreign, our partners abroad are also financing the bad driver in a way."
The ages continued:
We don’t expect profit from traffic, but when we look at the past 11 years, we can’t show that we’ve made a profit any year.
“We also accept this, but we continue to hope that we can carry that damage in a reasonable environment, together with other police officers.”
Age, who said there were dramatic price increases when the damage in traffic also led to the profitability of other products, said: “In 2012, there were price increases of around 30 percent in traffic insurance, in 2015 it almost doubled, we wrote the biggest loss in our history.”
"Even in an environment where prices have risen so much, at the end of 2016 our profit in traffic was only 19 million TL."
Epochs, who said they expect the free tariff to pass next year, said, "We will lower the price of a good driver in the Serbes tariff and apply a high price to a bad driver."
"But the Treasury is looking at the general course, and the last word about when it will be is in the Treasury."
The Treasury Department stated that the rise in compulsory traffic insurance premiums since 2015 has affected a wide range of society, and from April 12, the maximum premium (standard price) has been applied.
According to this, the maximum premiums for compulsory traffic insurance policies to be regulated were determined on the basis of each vehicle group, stage and traffic density and accident statistics determined by the provincial groups based on compulsory traffic insurance.
On the other hand, as of July, the application "Risk Insurers Pool" for vehicle groups was implemented in compulsory traffic insurance.
The premiums and damages related to the traffic insurance policies covered by the pool will be shared between the insurance companies.
These insurers will be identified by the Treasury Secretary.
Age said that in the first 6 months of 2017 with the implementation of the ceiling premium in traffic, the premium production decreased by 11.5 percent compared to the same period of the previous year, and the number of policies increased by 4.9 percent to 8.6 million, taking into account inflation, the reduction in traffic policies reached about 30 percent.
The Times said that this year the traffic will bring the profits in other industries again, "This damage cannot be sustained with the ceiling prices.
How long can this damage bear?”
The capital of all companies in the sector is 9 billion TL, and when only 2.3 billion TL is damaged by traffic, the capital of the sector will be finished in three years, Çağlar says, "The foreigners are looking at 'Why does the good driver finance the bad driver, why do my thousands of shareholders finance the bad driver in Turkey?'
“We are trying to tell the Treasury about our problem at this point.”
On a question about whether foreigners have come to the point of reducing weight in the Turkish insurance sector after these developments, Çağlar said, "They have not yet come to that point."
They expect to invest more in Turkey because in the Netherlands it drops by an average of 6 polices per person, while in Turkey it is 1.3.
“So Turkey is a place to really grow,” he said.
So they did not give up here.
However, although the company makes a reasonable profit every year, it uses all of its profits to grow the company.
According to the TSB data, in 2016 the primary production in the sector will be 40.5 billion TL, while in the first half of this year last year was 23.1 billion TL with a 12 percent increase compared to the same period.
Years said it predicted that the industry will not complete the year with 15 percent growth in total primary production.
Hundreds of thousands of chronic patients
With the instructions of the Minister of Family and Social Policy Fatma Betül Sayan Kaya, the details and principles of implementation of the "New Social Assistance Program for Families Struggling with Chronic Diseases", which began its work a while ago, were revealed.
The social assistance program to be launched for poor citizens and their families will benefit 4,300 people with tuberculosis and SSPE in the first phase.
Patients will be provided with monthly support of more than two-thirds of the minimum wage as well as regular psychosocial support.
The Ministry will also make additional payments to tuberculosis patients who are unable to provide medical self-care, who live their lives depending on bed, or who are identified by the relevant health unit as having to improve their home living conditions.
Payments will be made through the Social Assistance Card.
Those who cannot withdraw money for reasons such as geographical conditions, illness, disability will be paid at the door.
The program carries the feature of being a first in the world in many ways.
One out of 10 companies that will invest is still German
Arda Ermut, chairman of the Turkish Prime Minister’s Investment Support and Promotion Agency, said that the fact that German firms in Turkey are seen as Turkish firms does not reflect the political tension between the two countries in the business world.
"In our relations with Germany, there is no single investor who says we are running away from this situation."
Ermut, "About 10 percent of the projects in our portfolio are German companies."
Some of them are in Turkey.
“The Germans make up a significant part of our daily workflow.”
Ermut said that Abraaj Group’s partnership with logistics company Netlog is a good example of this.
Abraaj Group partner Omar Syed said, pointing to economic growth in Turkey, “We have made a total $1 billion investment in Turkey.”
To be the Last Ottoman
It was that the experienced footballer, who was given two weeks to the management to find the club, agreed with the Ottomansport to sign an official contract in the coming days.
At the beginning of last season, Özer Hurmacı, who signed a contract with the green-black club until 2019 until the end of the transfer for 4 hours, had made a significant contribution to the team with 5 goals and 4 assisted performances while wearing the form in 29 leagues, 2 cup matches.
The administration, which closed the way back to Özer, agreed to replace this player with Brazilian Sergio Antonio yesterday.
The transfer of the century has happened!
Barcelona announced Neymar's transfer to Paris Saint-Germain for 222 million euros.
The transfer development that the football public has followed with excitement in the recent period has fallen to officials.
PSG has paid the Catalan team 222 million euros for the player's release.
Neymar was the most expensive transfer in football history.
Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) has signed a five-year contract with Brazilian star Neymar.
In a statement from the club’s website, it was said that Neymar, a 25-year-old who has been named the world’s most expensive footballer for 222 million euros, has signed a contract with PSG until June 30, 2022.
Speaking after the signing ceremony, Neymar said he was very happy to be in the form at France, saying: "Since I started my football life in Europe, PSG has always been one of the most competitive and ambitious teams."
The reason I came to this club was to join my teammates, to get as many cups as our supporters wanted.”
PSG will pay Neymar €45 million for each season.
Thus, the cost of the star player will cost the French representative a price of over 400 million euros.
Maritime workers' strike has ended
It was not possible to reach an agreement on the increase in the collective contract between Izmir Metropolitan Municipality company İZDENİZ A.Ş. and the Turkish-Business-affiliated Turkish Seafarers Union (TDS).
The workers’ unions went on strike on July 12.
The strike, which lasted a month, ended today at 3 p.m. after the workers were raised.
According to the signed collective employment contract, the salary of the employee will be increased by 12 percent.
Together with the income tax exemption obtained after the registration in the International Ship Registry of the IZDENIZ, which renews its fleet, the salary increases by 25 percent, the accepted increase rate for staff in the status of shipman is 5 percent.
The General Directorate of İZDENIZ announced that the flights in the inner Gulf will continue with the normal rate, with the flights in Yassıcaada starting on Tuesday, and the flights in Foça and Urla starting from next weekend.
TDS President Hasan Pekdemir said that they have blocked transportation with the strikes that lasted for 23 days, saying: "The people of Izmir will relax."
The strike resulted in improvements in the rights of our workers working on land and at sea.
We left the table pleased.
On average, 28 percent of the work on the sea and 20 percent on the land will fall into the pocket.
We also had employees with a minimum wage.
We have improved their salaries.
Nostalgia is linked to “Iconic Hot American Writing” and “Collaborative Detective”
So, for the bright days of the characters in the 80s, for the grunge era in the 90s (when brains like David Wain and Michael Showalter made the sketch comedy "The State" for MTV) and for himself, that is, for 2001, before the stars Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd continue with bigger things, this version of the story is nostalgic for all.
As a cultural product, this is both the capture and embodiment of our permanently memorable Facebook period.
But as a series, as if the time has exhausted.
"First Day of the Camp" was unexpectedly successful, and this was not only due to its absurd humor (in it was a story about the origins of a speaking box plant, chanted by H. Jon Benjamin.)
By concentrating on the main comic (playing the children of the middle-aged actors who are reckless) he realized that it was impossible to recapture the past part of the joke.
The parody is now more random, including the less emotionally-based and 90’s monologue about the perverted follow-up film, such as “The Hand that Shakes the Frog”, where adults play the adult “Ten Years Later.”
At one point, the character confuses an Apple Powerbook, some single-wheeled patins, and “many other things from 1991.”
Many of the stories are the same.
The soft-hearted Coop (Bay Showalter) is no longer a writer, yet he has not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) has not yet lost his solitude.
There’s also another crazy betrayal plan now embroiled by George H. W. Bush (a very well-set imitation by Michael Ian Black) involving Ronald Reagan (again Mr. Showalter).
The best part of the series, as usual, is words.
It’s especially nice to see the ever-young Mr. Rudd, who has the lip-sub-beard in Matt Dillon’s “Rabbits,” who’s Andy, the most popular kid in the old school, now looks like a morrow.
There may be occasional moments of madness that power this series (such as a sort of repeating "Seven Up!" series) until it reaches what I think is the logical result: "Islak Hot American Writing: Twenty Years Later" which in its final scene makes it possible for the crowd of friends to go to see the gala of the film "Islak Hot American Writing".
Meanwhile, Amazon’s “Collective Detective” refers to a different genre of nostalgia: “The Americans”’ Cold War resurrection, the film “Bomb of War” and even “GLOW” with its iconography against the struggle of East and West.
Created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, the comedy, directed by Rhys Thomas, appears to have been found on TV: a 1980s Romanian police friends drama in which two Bucharest police officers fought for the real, atheist and Marxist-Leninist path.
The lead roles are played by Wolf Gregor and the idealist Iosef, Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, and their dialogues are dubbed in English by Channing Tatum (who is also the lead producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
This is a very brilliant idea.
But that’s not much more than an idea.
There are some pleasant visual comics (Americans spend time watching soccer while policemen watch chess on TV)
The famous vocal artist staff, which includes Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny, is also a good material for the "who's voice's bill" game.
But the "Comrade Detective" is so devoted to simulating the reality of a propaganda drama that (including a killer wearing a Reagan mask) often plays just like him.
Six long episodes don’t pass and the comedy isn’t fast enough or frequent enough.
Gregor and Iosef were constantly visiting the American embassy where two fat men were eating a bunch of hamburgers like hungry wolves in their lobby, while the "Comrade Detective" would have better performed the propaganda hickey if shortened to a narrower length.
The message to the imaginary communist viewer is that Western culture can turn anything into mass-eating.
The Romanian creators are not wrong: we do this to our own recent past and even to theirs.
The Father’s Father’s Father
As a result of 50 years of experience, the British Government has seen that our family is vital and sacrificing.
The high authorities of the government have acknowledged that this family has since been sincerely attached to the British Government and has been in great service.
It is necessary for the British Government to act wisely and carefully with regard to this seed that it has planted with its own hands, to investigate and examine everything thoroughly and to make a careful decision.
When trying to understand the FETO, the organization of the Hashashis is considered as a starting point, but one fundamental difference that has been forgotten is that the FETO is an organization that emerged in the imperialist period and operates in colonial terms.
The first thing to do in this area is to take care of the women.
In the English praise at the entrance, the person who describes himself as the "Fidol set by the English Government's hands" is the founder of the Women's League, Mirza Gulam Ahmet Kadiyani.
Gulam Ahmed, a small town in India’s Punjab province, said: “On December 1, 1888, he that God had ordered him to take a biat from his followers and form a separate congregation.”
Going a little further, Gulam Ahmed said in 1891, according to the revelation and inspiration he received, that Isa b. Mary died with a natural death, like other prophets, and that God Himself sent him as the Messiah and Mercy that Christians and Muslims were expecting.
Thus, the Prophet (peace be upon him) and the Prophet (peace be upon him) are the same as the Prophet (peace be upon him) and the Prophet (peace be upon him).
The Encyclopedia of Islam, TDV
In India, which was completely under British rule after the 1857 Sipahi uprising, Gulam Ahmed, who wrote books defending Muslims under persecution against Hindus and Christians, reminds of the portrait of Gülen, who defended Islam against infidelity with the Presidency of the Association for the Fight against Communism in Erzurum, which was believed to have been founded with entirely confessionalist views, but the CIA support subsequently emerged.
Like Gülen, Gulam Ahmed’s most beloved idea by imperialists is that “jihad” is a struggle of Muslims with their own self, and if you can live their religion freely, there is no dimension of imperialism to be fought.
Even if you remember, Laughing a step further, he praised even the attacks of the Crusaders, whose wounds in our history are still open, in a "sermon" last year: "It is not very dangerous for the Crusaders to invade your country.
There are red lines between you and them.
They don’t relate to your wife or daughter.
They are not crucified, they are not crucified.
While the idea that Mehdi and Messianism are united in themselves, the idea that their own congregation will be the savior of Islam, the similarity of the theses with the FETO, as the concept of jihad means only the struggle with the soul, the spread of feminism has also occurred in the field of education and civil society in general.
The total number of women’s centers in the world, said to have exceeded 2 million, is 1869, and the number of countries where the emergency aid organization “Humanity First” is officially registered is 23.
There are 36 hospitals in 12 countries, 650 dispensaries in 55 countries, 8 women’s care facilities in Africa alone, 505 educational institutions in 11 countries and about 16,000 mosques worldwide.
Given that the Nobel Prize-winning “first Muslim scientist” Prof. Abdüsselam, President of the United Nations Court of Justice, Sir Zaferullah Han, the “first Oscar-winning Muslim actor” Mahershala Ali, is also female, we can see more clearly the depth of the global powers’ approval for female actors.
Let’s note that the women’s meeting in England last week with 30,000 people was also illuminated as a body show.
One of their slogans, “Love everyone, don’t hate anyone,” is a brief look at their history to understand what women actually mean “Love your invaders/colonists.”
It is possible to carry the starting point and motivations of organizations such as Hülasa, FETO or Tahir-ül Kadri to the Women, and all of these organizations are actually supported as matufs to express societies in order to pass into imperialism and serve colonialism.
The “last wish” came out.
Emily Pomeranz (50), who spent her last days in a Washington hospital due to pancreatic cancer, expressed her longing for a milkshake mixed with coffee and chocolate from a restaurant in her native town.
A friend of the woman contacted the owner of the restaurant named Tommy's.
Tommy Fello, who has been running the same restaurant for 47 years, put the drink on the dry ice and paid a fee of $123 (£435) to send it to a hospital 600 kilometers away with a "fast delivery" cargo.
Two new projects from Ahmet Kul
To date, Ahmet Kul İnşaat has implemented important projects such as Lavinya Park, Otoport, Vetro City, Ginza Lavinya Park, Dia Mare in Mimaroba in Istanbul, and Solse 7 projects in Bodrum Yalıkavak.
The geometry of the Dia Mare project, developed by Architecture Çamoğlu Architecture, was developed to get the maximum benefit from the sea.
Located on an area of 11 thousand square meters, Dia Mare houses a total of 188 residential and 17 commercial units.
The full-fledged project will begin to be delivered to the new owners in March 2018.
There are many types of apartments in Dia Mare ranging from 2+1 to 5+1
The company, which will operate two new construction sites in Mimaroba and Bitez this year, is preparing to sign two major projects in Topkapı in 2018.
$753 million for companies
He said that many programs in the TRT, where 6,760 employees work, were outsourced and high prices were paid.
The deputy of the CHP, "TRT 2016" again pulled the taxes of the nation to the AKP companies.
“This is called theft.”
The source transmitted by TRT to its affiliated manufacturing companies was revealed with data obtained from official documents.
The official response to the application made by CHP Istanbul MP Peace Yarkadaş within the framework of the Information Act showed how TRT’s resources were spent.
In the TRT, where 6,760 people worked as staff members, despite all kinds of technical possibilities, TL 753 million and 500 thousand were transferred to affiliated companies in 2016 through programs carried out under the name of external production.
The deputy chief used the phrase “This means emphasizing”.
Peace Yarkadaş: “The production companies of ACP journalists and businessmen are crushing TRT.”
"Millions are paid for unseen or untouched unknown constructions."
Recalling that the money transferred to companies was collected from the people's taxes, Yarkadaş said: "The institution with 7 thousand employees has returned to AKP's arpa."
“These companies signed programs that 7,000 people couldn’t do and they got that money?”
Yarkadaş, who explained that TRT's advertising revenue in 2016 was 224,456,182 TL, noted that when staff salaries and other expenses are included, the advertising revenue remains as an ear.
The TRT, which has become the voice of the AKP, does not receive advertising because it is not watched.
Nutrition journalists get money from TRT, they’re cuddling on behalf of AKP.
He said, “The people are burdened.”
CHP’s Yarkadaş continued his remarks as follows: “TRT pays staff 660 million TL per year, but all its jobs are given to external manufacturers.”
TRT, or the pocket of the people, has drawn 753.5 trillion followers.
This is shameful.
He fell to his knees before his wife and apologized.
The incident occurred at a car park in the town hall in the afternoon.
According to the information obtained, residents who saw the citizen bowing down from the fourth floor of the parking lot the situation to firefighters and health teams.
Firefighters who arrived at the scene opened fire to the area where the person was located, while the medical teams were also waiting.
The 34-year-old father of three children, Yunus G., who abandoned suicide after about an hour of persuasion by the psychologists and police teams called to the scene, apologized kneeling in front of his wife N. G., who was watching him in tears.
On the other hand, in the street where Yunus G. was in a suicide attempt, about 100 people watched sitting in the elevators, while some citizens registered with their mobile phones.

Bank of England to keep interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to decline its speculation that slow economic growth and a rise in moving inflation will soon explain that interest rates will remain unchanged.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will continue to be “slow” because of the shrinking family income, along with keeping their interest rates steady.
Decision-makers in the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) used 6 to 2 votes to keep interest rates at 0.25 percent, thus calling for fewer membership increases this month following the weakening of the growing support of slow economic growth.
In its three-month inflation report, the bank raised its growth forecast to 1.7 per cent in 2017 and 1.6 per cent in 2018 and warned that household incomes will continue to shrink as inflation is still expected to rise close to 3 per cent in the spring.
However, interest rate increases have signaled that it is necessary to curb the inflation that Brexit has plagued over the next few years, and he said borrowing costs could continue to rise more than expected in financial markets.
Members also voted to withdraw some of the huge economic recovery package launched a year ago after Brexit.
The bank said it would end its Periodic Financing Plan, which offers cheap financing to banks from next February, but expected to offer more than £15 billion (£115 billion) under the plan.
Minutes after the interest rate decision was made, the bank said: “MPC’s central forecast is slowly continuing in the short term as the contraction of real household income continues to be a burden on consumption.”
Regarding interest rates, he stressed that “a bit of narrowing in monetary policy” could be necessary to ease inflation, and that it would be “a bit higher” than the market expected.
Markets still predict that the first increase will be in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
But the bank emphasizes that any increase will be “step by step” and “limited”.
According to the May forecasts, the bank’s reduced growth forecasts for this year and next year are compared to 1.9% and 1.7% respectively.
The bankins its forecast of 1.8% in 2018.
After the news, the pound lost its value against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell 0.5% to 1.31 US dollars and 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The decision to change came after the latest growth figures relieved the multiplier growth expectations, which disappointed GDP at 0.2% in the previous three months compared to 0.3% in the second quarter.
Growth is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, but the bank says it will start to show a slight increase towards the end of the year.
While the bank says the shrinkage will get worse before it gets better, the latest inflation report leaves little to delight households hit by rising inflation and steep wage increases.
The bank said its monetary policy "cannot stop" the rise in revenue in the next few years, but expected wages to "significantly" improve towards the end of its three-year forecasts.
Increasing demand for British goods as a result of the weak pound will support the economy by balancing some of its declining consumer spending.
The decision comes a year after the shocking EU referendum, which dropped the pound to 0.25% in August.
The bank estimates that it will probably take four years before it affects prices and the economy altogether.
Prior to the bank’s latest interest rate decision, there was increased inflationary pressure on hard-working households, and three policymakers called for an increase in interest rates to 0.5% in July.
Inflation fell from 2.9 percent in July to 2.6 percent last month, but the bank said it was expected and would rise again in the coming months.
The bank said that according to their own 2% targets, obesity was "completely" related to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, director at Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: “Given the recent declines in interest rates, the mortgage market will once again become even more competitive while there is demand from lenders to do business and close the year positively.
The market looks especially good for those who are approaching the end of their existing contracts, with many free options and low interest rates becoming even more popular than ever.”
NHS to prescribe controversial HIV medication to 10,000 people
In the Supreme Court, after a struggle over the funding of the drug at the NHS, patients will be able to access 'reversible' HIV prevention treatment from September.
NHS UK has announced that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a pill taken before sex, which has been shown to reduce the risk of infection in high-risk individuals by around 86 percent, will be provided by healthcare services to estimated as many as 10,000 people through a 3-year preliminary trial.
The Supreme Court’s decision last year agreed to fund the experiment after approval by the Court of Appeal. The decision said that despite claims that the NHS was funded by local authorities, it had the power to pay for PrEP.
The move, announced on Thursday, was welcomed by NHS UK chairman Simon Stevens as a “new and serious intervention,” while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described it as a “turning point.”
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be the first to register clinics, with more clinics participating in the plantation being fully implemented across the UK by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a series of HIV medications that reduce the risk of getting HIV before sex.
Experiments have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission among those at risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before sex means there are enough medicines available to prevent HIV infection from settling in a person’s body.
These medications can be taken every day or up to two hours before having sex.
Those eligible for treatment are gay or bisexual men, transgender people and HIV-positive partners who cannot be treated successfully.
Clinics will identify suitable participants who will agree to the experiment from men, women, transgender individuals and unknown individuals whose partners have HIV conditions controlled with an anti-retroviral therapy.
Individuals who live in the UK and are registered with a practitioner will also be able to register for potential participation at participating local sexual health clinics.
The program will hold £10 million and the NHS has signed an agreement to supply the drugs this week with an international bid offered by the UK.
The experiment was designed to assess the full potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence on how PrEP is targeted, carried out and applied on a large scale.
Mr. Stevens said: “This new and serious intervention will contribute to widespread and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
This is another milestone in 30 years of development in addressing one of mankind’s major health problems.”
Deborah Gold, president of the National Aids Trust, said: “This is a milestone in the fight against HIV.
If it targets those in need and those at risk, PrEP offers the possibility of transforming the HIV outbreak in the UK.
Starting in September, people at high risk of HIV will reach a new and powerful tool that is truly personally controlled and not negotiable with a partner through this experiment funded by the NHS in the UK, which will lead to the healing of many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement.”
Ian Green, chairman of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: “Priority now should be to ensure that the experiment is delivered quickly across the country and that no one at risk is left behind.
As PrEP trial medication is now available, we are on the right path to protecting more than 10,000 people at risk of HIV.”
Shadow Public Health Minister Sharon Hodgson said: “We welcome the start of the PrEP experiment and are late with months of delays and then government footprints.
Evidence shows how transformative this drug can be in ending the infection of HIV as part of our view of blocking HIV and life-changing infection.
The experiment will take us one step closer to fully understanding the benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that this experiment be delivered nationwide as soon as possible to protect people exposed to HIV and bring us one step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society.

Two secrets of death
The daughter of former Minister of Industry and Trade Ayhan Çilingiroğlu, Umit Makbule Çilingiroğlu (51), born in Washington, lost her life falling from the 19th floor of a business center also used as a hotel in Istanbul Levent.
Koç University student Melis Salihoğlu, 24, was also found dead in her home.
Salem’s self-reliance has been lifted.
Two secret deaths have been investigated, which are considered suicide by police.
There was depression.”
The daughter of the first Minister of Industry and Trade of Turkey, Ayhan Çilingiroğlu, born in Washington in 1966, Ümit Makbule Çilingiroğlu, entered the Le Meridien Hotel in Etiler at 5 p.m. on August 1.
A Kuwaiti tourist who settled in the room on the 19th floor and saw the dead body of Chilingiroğlu, who was not notified for a while, was notified to the hotel management after an ambulance and police team were called to the scene.
The medical team determined that the Chilingiroğlu who fell to the hard ground from the 19th floor lost his life.
The mother, Mediha Chilingiroğlu, told the police, “I had a depressive state lately.”
He arrived in Istanbul from Ankara on July 31.
I have a child with leukaemia from my daughter.
“He was concerned about my grandson and was negatively affected by my grandson’s illness.”
Chilingiroğlu, who was removed to the Judicial Medical Institute, is expected to be executed in Ankara.
It is being investigated whether he was shot or killed by someone.
The Canina Kiydi
The other suspected deaths in Istanbul occurred in Sarıyer Zekeriyaköy.
Melis Salihoğlu, a student at Koç University, was found dead in her home.
According to allegations, the young girl’s father went to the house near the school where she could not get any news and her cell phone could not reach her.
The father found his daughter’s body at home.
It is argued that Melis, loved by her family, close surroundings and friends, has ended her life hanging herself in the house.
Melis Salihoğlu’s death drowned her family and relatives.
Following Melis, a friend of her on social media said, “A bright sunshine was hitting our faces.”
The green grasses under our feet, our best friend, Jack and his sister, Ishan, were enjoying running after that little plastic ball.
He shared his message “I needed to die now.”
Living a luxurious life: Hanging floors and smart design numbers have turned this small Earls Courts apartment into a spacious home.
Former banker Joanne Leigh, a passionate real estate renovator, moved from a spacious house in Knightsbridge to an apartment in Earls Court in 2014 to shrink.
The spectacular Queen Anne style is a proof of the new design on the first floor of a party and convinces Joanne without collecting her suitcases.
"I lived in a much larger area in Knightsbridge with my ex-girlfriend before," says Joanne.
“I was looking for something for my price.
The apartment at Earl Court was shown to me and had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with him and gave him an offer that day."
After the first glance, the 1000-square-foot apartment was renovated from scratch.
It was originally a single-room and complexly planned property; you had to go through the kitchen to reach the bedroom. Joanne generously wanted to add a storage area and a hanging floor to maximize the height of the ceiling.
“I wanted high ceilings, large windows and lots of light.
That was my condition.”
For this purpose, Notting Hill-based architecture and design studio Duck & Shed held Erfan Azadi to take advantage of the 12.5-foot ceiling and create not only a structure but also a place for Joanne to live.
The ceiling was not high enough to add two spaces in a row, so the architectural challenge was to create a hanging floor you could stand inside.
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the issue.
“The steel skeleton is quite complex,” he explains.
"We should have arranged the gaps so that they can build up without having to bend down on each other.
It was not just to build a simple platform, but the steels would bend so that they would be at the right height depending on the upper or lower function."
This arrangement brought many additional dramas, allowing Erfan to get two full-size rooms on top of each other.
The old type copper light window, taken from Retrouvius for the hanging floor, looks at the magnificent living area below.
Mirrored golden color furniture, silver accents, and the old type Serge Mouille lighting all define the style of the design.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding space, space and light.
The mirrors placed at both ends of the short corridor make it look longer.
In the kitchen, the mirror protective panel feels like a window opening to another room.
Antrede mirror units provide storage space for Joanne’s entire blade knife set and crusher.
The beauty of the living room, which creates a more spectacular space perception, is the ability to close the kitchen when it is not in use.
The kitchen is not new.
The main feature is a garage door that can be lifted up.
Erfan explains the stainless MDF door, "We used some engineering in this."
"It has a weight of balance so it really slips easily when you push the door up."
By using the space and storage space wisely, Joanne gained an additional 16 square meters, an additional bedroom and an improved sitting plan.
“It happens at the end of the day that you’ll sell the seating space, or that the value of your property is determined,” Erfan says.
"As an hypothesis, a real estate trader will enter and make a calculation on the basis of the session area."
Here, while increasing the floor area, they managed to use quality materials that gave the area a luxurious appearance.
Erfan says, “Materials are the objects you touch and thus help you establish an emotional connection at home.”
"At home, you won't fall in love with the electrical lines on the wall.
These are important, but they don’t shake your heart.”
This proves that through good design and increased square meters an apartment can turn from something standard to something quite stunning.
In fact, like Joanne, you can choose not to leave.
Jeremain Lens in Brescia

After intensive talks over the past week, Lens agreed with the black-and-white team for a reservation price of 5 million euros.
The Dutch player, who signed a five-year contract, will receive €2.2 million a year.
Beşiktaş is expected to make an official statement about Jeremain Lens' transfer.
Wedding photos of famous couples
Actor and singer Emre Altuğ, who has lived in a landslide relationship for about 4 years, entered the world home in Sortie.
The couple immortalized their wedding ceremony with a photograph that they said was “the most special memory of our lives.”
The couple divorced after seven years.
Brothers Fight for $500 Million Property Empire
Forty years after the dynasty founded by Italian families, the two brothers are at war for one of Victoria’s largest real estate empires, worth more than $500 million.
Colin De Lutis, former director of the Carlton Football Club and contractor, lives three doors away from his younger brother Paul, who gave himself to the Supreme Court about how to share property and business assets in a property in Toorak.
Paul has been trying to quit his family business since 2014, but he has been facing harsh debates in the Supreme Court over the breakup.
The Smith Street brothers, along with their mothers Anna and Anna, own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars accumulated since they bought a store in Collingwood in 1973.
There, the family founded Westco Jeans and grew it into a chain of 160 retail sales centers.
It was sold for $85 million in 1999.
This money was deposited in the property, and De Lutis’ portfolio currently includes city offices, Brunswick and Sorrento contractor sites, Gold Coast and Mt Buller apartments, and suburban shopping centers.
Under an agreement with his deceased parents, Colin (which Paul describes as "an important driving force and a dominant personality" in the De Lutis family) owns two-thirds of the company's assets, while Paul owns one-third.
A court file says this meant that Colin had $316 million in property and Paul had $176 million.
For Paul, the division of property and cash appears to be a controversial topic.
In his first oath statement to the court in 2015, he wrote: “The divisions proposed by Colin left him with the properties I have always bestowed on him.”
Last Friday, after many failed mediations, the first High Court hearing was held.
The brothers are also struggling about who will control the current job; Paul claims Colin has left him out of the job.
Colin argues that this is not true but accuses Paul of improperly managing some of the properties.
Colin, in a sworn statement at the beginning, says he hopes to resolve the dispute.
“My Italian roots dictate to me that family is the most important priority.”
The costs of the case, along with the hundreds of pages of pledged statements, emails, and top lawyers, such as Allan Myers, QC, and senior lawyers held by both sides, are rising, recorded by Deloitte, Pitcher Partners, and firms including Charter Keck Cramer.
Mrs. De Lutis and her poison husband Luigi were an Italian immigrant family that operated bakers and singers since the late 1950s and had bought a store in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They had taken their property hostage to buy the property of Collingwood, where Colin opened his family’s first shirt shop.
Colin says he founded Westco there, "in my last years in high school, when Paul was a young boy (10 years old).
Anna De Lutis says she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hope to leave their possessions friendly to their sons.
"Luigi often told me that he never wanted his brothers to go to court."
The other two brothers Mark and Luke are no longer part of the De Lutis group of companies; according to Colin, $10 million was paid to Mark when he left the job, and $26 million to Luke.
According to Paul, both Luke and Mark “were dissatisfied with the conditions of their financial separation.”
According to the 2015 biography of Eddi McGuire, the best friend of the television star, Colin tried not to pay attention, despite being a former member of the board of directors of an AFL club.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers on Friday.
Colin just replied by saying, “I can’t say too much,” because he was in court with a short message.
“It has been very sad that my brother Paul has chosen to sue me and to bring our family’s name to court.”
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in a court appeal that he was trying to meet his brother’s demands.
"Our father, Paul, didn't want us to fall into the current dispute," he said, adding that he was "still hopeful about the solution."
On Friday, the hope is gone.
Colin wrote, “Our problem will be resolved by the courts in the near future.”
Trump’s new private pen plans to restrict the president’s media diet.
Others tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can really do that.
If so, it will be the first.
Politico reports that the new White House private pen will restrict the flow of information to President Trump (including news media reports) in the hope of keeping his boss more stable.
A few small facts from reporter Josh Dawsey:
“When White House’s new private pen John F. Kelly met with senior staff on his first day at work, President Donald Trump summed up a key problem he planned to solve with the White House: the passing of bad news into the hands of the president.
Kelly told the staff that information should flow through him, whether on paper or through briefings, because the president would be able to make better decisions when given good information.
Kelly’s diagnosis sounds very meaningful but others have tried to accommodate Trump by controlling the media diet and have failed.
President Trump’s relationship with television goes back decades and he’s now in the White House, the TV viewer is still in good shape.
A former campaign advisor, Sam Nunberg, told Politico in February, “If Aday Trump is saddened that he hasn’t taken a fair place in the media, showing him that he has found a fair place in persuasive media organizations was productivity boosting.”
Tara Palmeri from Politico wrote at the time, “According to six campaign officials, the key to keeping Trump’s Twitter habit under control was to ensure that personal media consumption included a steady stream of praise.”
Okay well.
But the idea that Trump’s Twitter habit is “under control” at any time is ridiculous.
Per these campaign officials know something that the rest of us don’t know, such as that Trump’s tweets would be much more provocative if they didn’t intervene.
We’ll probably never know anything about the tweets Trump didn’t send.
If his elements were able to get him out of danger even several times, then his efforts were worthwhile.
But no one could stop Trump from constantly creating controversy.
Part of the problem was that the White House was made up of competing factions, that is, people who tried to advance their own agendas with the materials they offered to Trump in every case (these could be reliable or unreliable) and who highlighted their own world views.
Politico in May, throughout this story, a tendency of consultants to strategically convey suspicious information to the president.
An example described in detail by reporter Shane Goldmacher was:
“Existent and former Trump officials say that Trump has reacted sharply to negative copper from the press, especially to leaks that have a detrimental impact, and is dedicated to finding out where they come from.
It also happened in late February when someone gave the president a printed copy of an article accusing private pen assistant Katie Walsh of being the "source behind a series of leaks" in the White House, from the internet provocator Charles C. Johnson's site GotNews.com.
It did not matter whether Johnson was fundamentally banned from Twitter for harassment, or did not provide any concrete evidence, or did not matter whether he had directed outright accusations in the past and turned back from them.
Trump read the article and began asking staff questions about Walsh.”
Goldmacher added that then-private pen Reince Priebus and White House staff secretary Rob Porter were "attempting to deploy a system that managed and documented the documents Trump received."
How did this result?
Kelly tries to do the same thing three months later.
Per he will emerge as a more effective executive than Priebus, but Trump is still on his own impulse and his assistants are still competing for influence.
These unchanging factors will make Kelly’s task quite difficult.
Crypto FETÖ revealed its features with a special template
İzmir Republic Prosecutor Berkant Karakaya completed the investigation initiated by the secret witness named "Sarmaşık" code within the investigation carried out in connection with the "military espionage investigation" and the leakage of some information, saying that the Naval Forces Command Chief of Staff Allamiral Jihat Broadcaster was the FETÖ.
In the review, it was emphasized that the Admiral Broadcaster was not a member of the organization, but that he helped the investigative authority in the decryption of members of the crypto organization in the Naval Command and played an active role in the fight against the FETO.
In the decision noted that the broadcaster was attempting to be pacified in accordance with the alleged order of tightening in the coup attempt on July 15 by order of the Naval Forces Command, it was noted that the broadcaster had been actively fighting the FETO from the first day of the coup attempt.
The decision on non-compliance issued by Karakaya used the following statements: "It is understood that the Navy has worked on the identification of Crypto Navy Command personnel thanks to a special template for the identification of FETÖ members belonging to the crypto privacy services class and a special system created on the basis of 64 basic criteria and 209 sub criteria."
As a result of the struggle in which a particular and stubborn effort was observed, which initiated in the judicial investigations, the secret witness showed no evidence about the alleged except the affair and the statements that were not based on a foundation, a judgment based on the prediction of the Broadcaster, which is known to be an active anti-terrorist organization and has great contributions to this, is not possible to be valued by our prosecutor’s office.
The Admiral was previously charged with insult.
After that, it was revealed that there were once again FETÖs and that the alleged crime was perpetrated.
In the complaint that the broadcaster insulted him, former Air Pilot Kurmay Colonel Hakan Dinç, the former Adana Incirlik 10, who translated the complaint in the form of a note of information only into a document.
Tank Base Commander Air Pilot General Bekir Ercan Van, former General Staff Chairman Adli Müşaviri Colonel Muharrem Köse, former General Staff Chairman Intelligence General Mustafa Özsoy, former Judge Major Erkan Ağın, former Navy Chief Necmettin Aksoy, former Judge Chief Akif Us and former Judge Chief Serdar Çamiçi, former Judge Major Mustafa Çiçek, former Judge Chief Colonel Necmettin Aksoy, former Judge Chief Akif Us, former Judge Chief Serdar Çamiçi, former Judge Chief Serdar Çamiçi, former Judge Chief Serdar Çamiçi, former Judge Chief Major Erkan Ağın, former Judge Chief Major Necmettin Aksoy, former Judge Chief Chief Justice Akif Us, former Judge Chief Chief Justice Serdar Çamiçi, former Judge Chief Justice Serdar Çamiçi, former Judge Chief Justice Mustafa Çiçek, former Judge Chief Justice Mustafa Çiçek, exiled from TSK due to their links to the FETÖ.
Some members of the organization, including Tuncay Opchin, the FETO founder, appeared to have targeted the broadcaster with their social media posts before and after the July 15 coup attempt.
Travellers crossed the threshold, returned to the 'rich neighborhood'
Some of the wealthiest homeowners in the West Midlands are once again struggling with stubborn travellers who have crossed the fence excavated by the council to reclaim the area outside of their properties.
Travellers parked 20 of their caravans outside a area known as the "Rich Quarter", which was located on the street at Solihull's time.
They returned after the council had been fired in May, bringing horses, babies, and a full cargo car from the pit they had excavated to cut their streams.
The cleverly acting group found a gap in the defense, leaking into their vehicles by setting a path from a section left unbarred.
Angry residents criticized the Solihull Council in detail, saying it was "inutile in solving the problem."
An unnamed resident said: “They came there on Monday evening after they were sent from Bentley Heath to throw stones at the passers.
The council should be ashamed of their actions because they are useless in solving the problem.
The travellers were there in May, they were sent and now they are back again.
More came last night, and probably more will come today.”
He added: “The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with this with the long-term removal decisions taken to protect parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Street and I’m not happy to continue to pay my taxes while the council can’t even stop it.”
One resident of the area, who did not want to name it, said: 'As a joke, we saw that the last group of travelers had yet to be separated, and we were immediately destroyed by a new group.
The numbers had increased this time, and even a horse was seen riding in the park."
A female spokeswoman for the Solihull Council said: “We are aware that there is an unauthorized camp on Streetbrook Street land, and we are starting the necessary legal proceedings to remove them from there as soon as possible.
To support our collection of evidence, it is very important to report any anti-social or criminal behavior to the police by calling 101 of as many local residents as possible.
This will help to make the picture of the situation appear for the court to take into account when we submit your case to the court."
Galatasaray announced Ndiaye to the stock exchange

Galatasaray will also pay a guarantee fee of 11 million euros for each year to Ndiaye, which has a four-year contract.
In addition, Ndiaye will be awarded a prize of 5,000 euros for each point the yellow-yellow team receives in matches played in the TFF Super League and UEFA.
In the statement, it was also announced that the player has the right to unilaterally terminate the contract for €18 million from June 15, 2019.
The Last Day!
They went to fire stations.
Thousands of cars were damaged by the storm in Istanbul on Thursday.
While many drivers who from the fire department to cover the damage by insurance companies, drivers who haven’t so far have also been in the queue for the report.
Drivers who were not notified today came to the fire station and requested a report because this was the last day of the notice period.
Today is the last day
Drivers first took photos of their vehicles to firefighters to identify the damage to their vehicles.
Drivers who were identified as damaged their vehicles later to the officers.
Hasan Erol, who came to the fire station for the report, said, "I have registered and I will take a photo."
There was intensity when I arrived.
“There was damage to the front window.”
The driver said, “We’re on the run.”
It is our turn.
We took the photo.
“We’re going to wait for the report,” he said.
The walls between the sea and the land do not breathe.
CHP member of Parliament, Nadir Ataman, issued an earthquake warning related to giant structures rising on the coast, noting: "The knowledge report in the case clearly says that these structures will not withstand the earthquake at 6 severity."
It is said that the rocks where the solid rock is 25-30 meters below are not digged so deeply.
The high-rise hotels and residences on Istanbul’s Ataköy beach, walled between the sea and land, left the district breathless.
CHP Bakırköy Municipal Assembly Member Rare Ataman reacted to giant AVM, hotel and residential projects that rise one after another in the county.
Ataman, who noticed that the structures on the coast cut the wind, said: "80 years ago, those who planned according to the wind had created the Ataturk Forest for Florya.
After 80 years of urban conception, huge skyscrapers planted wind corridors and changed the climate.
“He didn’t breathe at first.”
Ataman, who stated that buildings that rise like walls on the Ataköy coast alter the climate balance, continued: "The temperature is felt 10 degrees more because of the skyscrapers."
These buildings must be made according to the direction of the winds.
But our skyscrapers are rising above Istanbul’s wind corridors.
The wind can’t get in.
These structures disrupt the natural balance of life.
Ataman said that these skyscrapers, which are harmful to the environment and human health, have also cut off the connection of the Bakırköy people with the sea, and that they will appeal to the Monuments Council on the matter and go to court.
Unchirurgical treatment is possible.
In the case of phenol, success is seen at 83 percent.
In this method, the diseased tissue is effectively cleaned and the tissue hole is filled with an agent that kills the hair roots.
One of the methods of non-chirurgical treatment is laser.
With various lasers, the hair roots and the tissue around them are burned by circular radiation, and during this burning the tissues are closed by sticking.
Thanks to these two non-surgical methods of hair reversal disease, patients can return to their social and work lives in a shorter time.
Dr. Mert Atak, who noted that excess weight, sedentary life, long sitting work, non-compliance with the rules of hygiene with tight hair and body hair, caused the hair to return, pointed out that among the symptoms of the disease there are disorders such as pain, infection, abscess and swelling in tail entrance.
Italy Strengthens STK’s Approach to Migrant Rescue Boats
Italy has warned NGOs operating migrant rescue boats in the Mediterranean that they will not be allowed to continue if they do not comply with new rules affecting their operations.
Interior Minister Marco Minniti, in an interview with the Torino newspaper La Stampa, said: "If the STKs do not adhere to the new regulation, it will be difficult to see that they continue to operate."
Minniti’s warning came a day after Italian authorities handled a boat operated by German aid organization Jugend Rettet, with the crew suspected of effectively cooperating with human smugglers to facilitate illegal migration.
The aid organization, which has been active for only a year, declined to comment on the content of the detailed charges directed against them by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
The organization said in a statement on social media: “For us, saving human lives is and will be our highest priority, so we are very sorry that we can’t work in the search and rescue area right now.”
"We can only make an assessment of the allegations that are currently being made after we have collected all the information and have been able to evaluate the situation."
Italian authorities have been monitoring Jugend Rettet’s boat Iuventa since October.
The crew is suspected of taking the migrant on board a boat full of tire boats delivered directly to them by human smugglers and allowing the smugglers to escape by boats for reuse.
According to the prosecutor’s files, which were published by Italian media, at least one such encounter was allegedly held at 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast.
The crew is concerned with neglecting the authority of the Italian coastal security, which has instigated rescue operations in the region due to more humanitarian efforts than any other purpose.
On the deck of vessels such as Iuventa, an Italian police officer would clearly have to oversee their activities.
Only three of the nine STKs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to comply with the mandate: Save The Children, Malta-based MOAS and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
The latter said on Tuesday that the new rules were considered unnecessary but acceptable because they would not cause any “serious changes or obstacles” to their rescue operations.
Among those who refused to sign was the Nobel Prize-winning organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Meanwhile, Minniti said the sharp decline in the number of migrants arriving in Italy after rescues in recent weeks indicated that efforts to strengthen Libya’s coastal security and cooperation with local governors have yielded fruit.
The minister said: "We have recently started to see the light at the end of the tunnel."
This month, he announced plans to discuss further economic development initiatives with Libyan governors and take action to reduce the number of migrants leaving Chad, Niger and Mali hoping to reach Europe.
The last minute!
As every year in the celebrations of the "Day of parachutists troops" in Moscow, the capital of Russia was drunk vodka defeated carpets.
Russian NTV reporter Nikita Razvozjayev, who was attending the event and was broadcasting live in a Russian Gorki Park, who smuggled too much alcohol.
The journalist, who the developments of the day in a live broadcast, warned the man, who suddenly appeared and disbelieved, saying, "We will zapt Ukraine", "Please be silent."
The drunk man, who was alleged to be a former parachutist, struck him hard on the reporter's warning.
The journalist, who was struck by a blow, tried to get away from the man.
The shock was watched live by millions of people.
Economic Coordination Committee Meeting
The Economic Coordination Board (EKK) was chaired by Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Şimşek, responsible for the economy.
After the cabinet change in the government, the EKK meeting, held for the first time under the chairman of Shimşek, began at 18.30 a.m. in Çankaya Köşkü.
Turkey’s macroeconomic outlook will be discussed at the meeting.
The meeting under the chairman of Shimşek was attended by Minister of Finance Naci Ağbal, Minister of Science, Industry and Technology Faruk Özlü, Minister of Labor and Social Security Jülide Sarıeroğlu, Minister of Customs and Trade Bülent Tüfenkci, Minister of Development Lütfi Elvan, Minister of Treasury Osman Çelik, President of the Central Bank Murat Çetinkaya and related bureaucrats.
It’s possible to get rid of the mushroom in 45 minutes.
Dr. Oğuz Kareminoğulları, who noted that only 5 percent of patients need to be operated in the treatment of pelvic arthritis, says: "The first step according to the patient's examination and imaging results is rest and medication."
In particular, in the patient group where the pain continues, it is necessary to try the initiative methods (such as epidural injection, radiofrequency techniques, in-disk interventions), Oğuz Karaeminoğulları warns, "If all of these methods are not successful, sleepiness and weakness in the legs are manifested, then surgery becomes mandatory."
Karaemino Sons, who today minimizes the risk of the "totally closed midsection surgery", also explains that it is possible to get rid of midsection disease in 45 minutes, stating that it is possible to reduce the anxiety of patients about the operation that cannot be achieved by interventional methods:
Although there are quite good results compared to open surgery with microscopic surgery, you can experience some complications such as a long period of recovery after the operation, adhesions to the spine, repetition of the scarring and midwheeling and infection that may develop in the future.
Microscopic surgery is often described as ‘closed surgery’, but microscopic surgery is performed in the same way as open surgery.
In the case of fully closed belly surgery, these risks are eliminated because the surrounding tissues are protected.
Completely closed thoracic surgery takes only 45 minutes.
Special commission work
The committee will include CHP MPs Mehmet Gökdağ, Cemal Okan Yüksel, Peace Yarkadaş and High Discipline Board member Turan Aydoğan.
Commission, Berberoğlu on 4 October in Istanbul 14.
He will also follow his hearing at the Heavy Penal Court and appeals to the Constitutional Court and the Regional Court of Appeal.
CHP Secretary-General Kamil Okyay Sındır and Vice-President-General Bülent Tezcan signed the appointment letter, "The independence and impartiality of the court, the absence of orders from anywhere other than the law, is the indispensable condition of justice."
“Our nationalist Mr. Enis Berberoglu did not demand any special status while serving as parliamentarian, did not seek refuge in the armor of inviolability recognized by his parliament, and wanted to preserve his belief in the independence and neutrality of the judiciary.”
It was argued that the trial process preferred the court to execute political orders rather than to judge.
The paper argued that, despite the Constitutional Court’s judgment that it found the arrest of members of the Constitutional Court wrong, the arrest warrant had been issued before the sentence was confirmed, was a clear evidence that the court ruled under influence.
Michelle Carter sentenced for messages prompting Conrad Roy to commit suicide
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years for encouraging her boyfriend to commit suicide through messages and phone calls.
Michelle Carter, who is now 20 years old, will face a 15-month sentence behind the fingers and five years of lawful eviction.
Carter was convicted of killing Conrad Roy on July 13, 2014.
Mr. Roy’s father said at a trial on Thursday: “My family’s heart is broken.
My son was my best friend.”
Carter was allowed to remain free for opposition.
While he faces a 20-year sentence, his legal team argued that he suffered from both him and Mr. Roy’s mental illness.
Carter, wearing a red pants and a cream-colored bluse, was punished with old eyes, hands curled, and eyes looking to the ground.
The prosecutor told the court, “His actions killed Conrad Roy.”
He ended his life to heal his own.
He did not accept responsibility.”
He never showed that he regretted it.”
But Carter’s lawyer said, “It was a terrible situation that he completely regretted.”
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz said he did not see "any significant influence on the actions of his age, maturity level, or even mental illness."
A prosecutor read a statement by Mr. Roy’s mother, Lynn Roy: “There is no day that I will not mourn the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I overcame everything, and I try to be with his sisters with all the sorrow we will bear forever.”
Mr Roy’s sister, Camdyn Roy, said the reality that her brother would never attend the wedding, or that his children would never yet have it, was “unthinkable.”
“It’s a pain that the person you’ve been with every day since I was born is no longer with me for the rest of my life.”
It appears that the lawsuit will cause drunkenness because there is no Massachusetts law that considers it a crime to tell a person to commit suicide.
Mr. Roy was 17 when he was found dead from carbon monoxide poisoning in a car in 2014.
The case attracted national interest when it emerged that Carter’s short messages encouraged him to end his own life.
While on vacation with her family, the girl said in the many messages she sent two weeks before her death: “Hop yourself out of a building, jump yourself with a knife, I don’t know there are a lot of ways.”
In the moments before his suicide, he wrote, "You have to do this, Conrad" and "All you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy."
Judge Moniz ordered him not to profit from the case through the press, saying that Carter wanted to attract interest through Mr. Roy’s death.
The case divided legal views.
Amanda Knox was found guilty of killing her British roommate in Italy in 2007.
Ms. Knox, 30, published a controversial post in the Los Angeles Times saying: "Michelle Carter deserves understanding and help, not jail."
Surprising growth forecast from Mehmet Şimşek
In his statement, Shimşek pointed out that inflation in Turkey should fall to the lowest single-chart figures and stated that food inflation constitutes a "risk area".
The Deputy Prime Minister predicts that inflation will fall below 7 percent in 2018.
In his lightning speech he said:
The next 12 months are critical in the reduction of uncertainty.
The biggest incentive is the reduction of uncertainty.
We have a strong government.
There is no political uncertainty.
Hopefully the uncertainty in our neighborhood will diminish.
By increasing our resistance to shocks with some reforms, I believe that we will set Turkey on a growth trend of over 5 percent.
I said months ago.
The worst is left behind.
Slowly, our energy is no longer in those areas, but in reforms that will enable comprehensive growth and employment to increase our energy.
The next 12 months are critical.
On the one hand, reform, on the other hand, the uncertainty has decreased, there is no political uncertainty.
Hopefully our luck will be reduced and the difficulties in our neighborhood will be reduced.
Whether we want it or not, many of our classic markets have collapsed.
Like Libya and Iraq.
Not only are we losing Sunday, we are facing a wave of more than 3.5 million migrants.
When we look at the last 15 years, Turkey has grown by 5.7 percent despite all these shocks.
Turkey, that is, our foundations have solid problems.
Now, by increasing our resistance to shocks with some reforms, we will take Turkey back to a growth policy of more than 5 percent by removing some of the question marks in the minds of investors.
To be honest, we have such a generous pension system.
I think it would be reasonable to say that our retirement companies have not made enough effort.
The performance will be strong once you participate.
Why ?
Because we are cautious.
Companies do not have to go and spend effort and spend money.
With these concerns in mind, we have made a row over how we will allocate global assets to which areas of investment, considering weak performance.
You know they are high.
Once clearly, there will be a performance in addition to the 25 percent given by the state.
In addition, the rest is also in the treasury papers, and there is usually a reduction in risk.
When we look at the big picture, I think you will be interested in the next period.
They will see the performance.
There is no failure, but success.
We rebuilt the BEI in 2013.
There are 6.8 million participants, with an accumulation of £70 billion.
The system has succeeded.
There are also 2.6 million participants in the automatic participation, with an accumulation of £775 million.
We need more efforts from companies.
Let them make some advertising, let them tell the system.
We work during the Cayma period.
Maybe if we put it a little...
We will see, we will work.
Maybe the citizens see the return and see the accumulation and stay in the system.
38 percent out of the system.
Nearly half of the retirees are voluntary individuals.
You don’t want to have two individual pension accounts.
What are you doing?
You are out of participation.
We were expecting about 10 percent.
We are also very optimistic there.
The system works once.
We brought a prime ceiling.
Insurance companies sometimes explain one-sided.
They increased their prizes very quickly.
When asked what was happening, they said the court rulings did not take into account the existing regulations.
We have a new net arrangement.
We told you to do what you need.
They said we should wait for judgment.
We said it would not be so.
We have a divide of ideas here.
Of course, when this ceiling came into the application of primary, some firms attempted.
We made a new arrangement.
Risk insurers set up a pool.
I tell you, I will repeat.
I prefer this system to work through competition.
So I don’t find the roof prices right, they forced us.
I would like to look at this in three dimensions.
Consider the system we have.
Two, let the system work normally, that is a package price.
Additional charges are heavy, almost 30-31 liras of every 100 liras premium paid goes to tax cuts SGK.
I’m also working now, we’re going to talk to our finance minister.
Third, the technology is developing rapidly.
Traffic accidents will also decrease significantly over time.
This is compulsory traffic insurance.
He saved his foot in the morning.
Buerger’s disease, which appeared in adolescence, was once a discomfort in men, but nowadays it has become common in women as well.
One of them is a 36-year-old woman.
The pain that began two years ago became chronic in the foot.
When a young woman faced the risk of losing her leg, she had to walk around the hospital.
A friend recommended Prof. Dr. Yusuf Kalko.
In the morning, the mancheet showed the news of the "Azerbaijan Extraordinary Minister of the Haller saved the life".
Then it turned out that Dursun who went to Kalko struggled with Buerger's disease.
Prof. Dr. Kalko took the young woman to an emergency surgery.
Sturgeon, who soon got rid of his pain, is now undergoing oxygen therapy.
Automotive manufacturers face reverse response while Audi will modify 850,000 diesel vehicles
A day before Audi’s announcement, BMW said it would offer software upgrades on more than 350,000 vehicles.
The chairman of BMW’s board of directors said the company believes that there are “more smart options” than driving restrictions, referring to European cities, including BMW’s headquarters in Munich (where it is thought to ban or restrict diesel vehicles).
Daimler said on Tuesday that three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe would be modified to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies described these moves as a recall.
European car manufacturers have intensely encouraged the use of diesel vehicles to help meet carbon dioxide emissions in Europe and the United States.
But the nitrogen oxides released by diesel engines are adding carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The cost of the equipment that automakers need to put on to neutralize the dirty smoke emitted by diesel vehicles is also increasing, making it difficult for the price of cars to remain competitive.
As German automakers face scrutiny, Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government was accused of bullying powerful automakers and ignoring the order of the issue.
Companies are trying to avoid repeating Volkswagen’s mistakes, hiding that it uses the device known as a misleading device and adjusting emissions to comply with regulations while a car is being tested in normal driving conditions.
Many Volkswagen executives have been charged in the U.S. and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, in the engine development department of Audi, the former chairman of thermodynamics was arrested in Germany.
Former director Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, an Italian and therefore a criminal, is not protected against his extradition and can be tried in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was driven into a German criminal investigation involving Volkswagen, which expanded its U.S.-based investigation after authorities accused Audi of introducing a system to get rid of emission rules in Europe.
Audi’s involvement in the investigation could be heavy for Volkswagen: the luxury car maker has an excessive share of Volkswagen’s profits.
Don’t jump fishing when you see it.
President of the Turkish Neurosurgery Association, Prof. Dr. Yusuf Şükrü Çağlar, warned not to jump to fishing at a depth of more than 2 meters.
Every year thousands of people face the risk of stroke due to crumbling into shallow waters and spinal damage.
The neck fractures most often develop in the 5th or 6th spine.
The characteristic of the fractures is that at this level they affect the muscles of the arms and legs as well as the nerves that feed the respiratory muscles.
Prof. Dr. Çağlar, "In these types of accidents, the cervical spinal area, our most valuable organ, is cut off or compressed by the spine that is broken due to a fracture."
“The wrong first aid in injury injury can not only increase the damage in accidents, but also lead to death.”
Diving in water fishing ranks fourth in the number of spinal injuries.
The average age of the injured is 20-29 and most of them are men.
Prof. Dr. Çağlar: “Fishing should not be jumped into invisible water.”
“The better you get, the worse you get, the worse you get.”
Prof. Dr. Eggers also recalled:
Depending on the level of the spine in the place where the injury caused during fishing diving can cause different degrees of stroke in the arms and legs.
You may know how to swim, but water can be deceptive.
The place that seems to you to be deep may be shallow.
U.S. and Australian seaside warning panels have reduced fishing jumping to shallow waters by 70 percent.
Prof. Dr. Çağlar, "Despite the fact that Turkey has 28 seaside shores, unfortunately there is not even a single warning sign in places outside of Istanbul."
"In connection with this type of life-threatening accidents, information lights or information panels on beaches and pools should be placed in a noticeable manner before every summer under the health department, schools and social awareness projects of each country," he said.
The President of the Spinal and Peripheric Neural Surgery Group of the Turkish Neurosurgery Association, Prof. Dr. Kadir Kotil, suggested the following in case of injury:
In the first instance, call 112.
The neck should be kept as steady as possible, not moved, detected by a hard hit.
The airway should be provided and the patient should be placed on the reverse side for the drainage of water leaking to the lungs.
It should be kept from the legs and not clogged to empty the water.
The pattern of the patient's neck should not be tried to correct.
The spine may be broken.
But if the spine has not yet been injured, the inappropriate position to be given first aid and the patient during transportation can cause the broken pieces of bone to put pressure on the spine and cut injury.
Provence Lavender Threatened by Climate Change
It has become a symbol of Provence in southern France, but it has a warning that it is under threat of climate change.
Lavender is falling due to drought-like conditions and disease-carrying insects, causing a huge headache for scientists and farmers trying to find a solution.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the Provence-based agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM, said: “The lavender in Provence is effectively at risk because in recent years the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change, which brings much less rain in the spring and mostly in the fall.
This affects the life of the laundry.
There is also a small Augustus insect, which is a leaf-transmitting micro-bacterial pest, and many of them are found in very dry air."
Many things are in danger.
As much as the perfume and cosmetics, lavender oil is sought after by the holidaymakers.
Eric Chaisse said: “While we have to have very long plant heads with a few large flowers, we have smaller, less developed, or none, or weak heads.
That means we have fewer essential fat pieces.”
The revised solutions include improving water distribution and slowing the evaporation from the soil, but also spraying a protective barley and water mixture on plants and developing species that are more resistant to dry conditions.
Journalist murder draws gold on rising threat in Mexico
The staff of the weekly newspaper Riodoce often meet on Wednesdays to review the latest mess drawn up by organized crime in Sinaloa state, corrupt officials and plans for the endless drug warfare to take place in the newspaper.
But on this day, they gathered together to talk about their safety in the shadow of their own tragedies.
They were told that it was important to change their routines.
Two senior journalists are considering what makes them feel safer: bringing their children with them to an office targeted by a hand bomb in 2009 or leaving them at home.
Security experts wrote three words on the black board in front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.
They ask journalists to suggest names for each column; no evidence is needed, perceptions and inner voices are enough.
Drugs smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists suspected of being tied to wages by the government or cartels are the bad guys who have made their job of writing Mexico’s chaos in the newspaper dangerous.
There are no violent paydos, as the number of bodies across the country increases, more of them become journalists: according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, at least 25 people since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012; after attacks and threats, 589 are under federal protection, and so far this year at least seven have been killed in seven states.
Among the last dead are the writers and inspiration sources of Riodoce co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
Valdez writes, “The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist,” in one of his many books on drug violence.
His absence is deeply felt but his presence is everywhere, hanging on the front of the Riodoce building with a large photo showing Valdez’s mid-finger with the word “Justice”; two journalists in their 30s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear shirts showing his smile, his face with glasses, and his Panama hat, a glossy.
The workshop takes place two months before his death; journalists talk about his common traumas, nightmares, insomnia, and paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor’s office was established in 2010 to deal with journalists’ cases, the Committee for the Protection of Journalists only prosecuted two of them.
As with many thousands of murders associated with drug trafficking and organized crime every year, journalists’ killers are rarely brought to justice.
In Riodoce, although their hearts are broken, they insist on resorting to violence in Sinaloa, although the ground is now more deceptive.
Talking about security without knowledge about the killers, without justice, works very little, Ibarra says.
“It’s stupid to waste my time in this workplace.”
“Until we know why, you don’t trust anyone.”
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the Riodoce office in the provincial capital of Culiacan.
The red Toyota Corolla was able to run just a few blocks before it was stopped by two men; it was forcibly pulled out of the car and hit 12 times, estimated for the newspaper’s name, translated as The Eleventh River.
The gunman stepped away from his car and struck the car nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left his wife and two adult children.
Rumors in Culiacan tend to move freely.
But there is almost nothing but silence about Valdez.
After Guzman’s arrest last year and his return to the U.S. in January, rival groups have been fighting to fill the gap, while Sinaloa has become one of the country’s bloodiest battlefields.
In Sinaloa, let go of one or more people being shot and killed on the streets every day, or the cemetery being filled with decorated, double-edged, tumbles larger than many houses to live in.
For a minute, forget about the “silence” of just one cartel controlling valuable ports and drug trade routes to the U.S.
Despite this and despite Valdez’s profound awareness of the dangers of his business, Riodoce’s co-founder and CEO, Ismail Bojorquez (60), was crushed by guilt for failing to protect his friend.
He believes that two mistakes contributed to the murder.
First, in a publication in February, there was an interview with Damaso Lopez, the leader of one of the rival cartel groups that were at war with Guzman's sons.
This article may have angered the sons; the prospective gang members bought every piece of the print and distributed it undistributed to the newspaper dealers.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety, after being handed over to another newspaper with the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his assassination was seen as a turning point in Mexican-born violence against journalists.
He survived for a very long time, and his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there.
He was an experienced reporter in Noroeste in 2013 when he joined the Riodoce discovery by selling $50 shares to five of his colleagues.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to do journalism without referring to the drug topic," Bojorquez said.
Over time, the newspaper gained fame for its courageous and honest news, and with sales, advertisements increased.
Journalists loved publishing life-threatening research without fear of censorship, and readers captured themselves in a publication they could read stories that no one dared to report.
Eight years after its founding, Riodoce won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Prize for its journalism in Latin America.
That same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Prize from the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for showing the courage to stop pursuing the end of Mexico’s drug history.
He clearly admitted he was afraid.
During the CPJ awards, he said, “I want to continue to live.”
In an interview with TV, Rompeviento said drug trafficking in Sinaloa is "a way of life."
“You have to accept your job as a journalist, either you’re playing that or you’re a fool.
I don’t want to be asked, “What were you doing in the face of so many deaths... Why didn’t you tell me what happened?”
The Riodoce staff misses Valdez; his unbelieving joke like hamal, his friends who are generous in his embrace and advice, his teachers who know how to survive.
They trust their routine.
He always wore his hat.
He went to the bar called El Guayabo in front of the office and was always sitting at the same table.
Now they ask: Has his love for his routines collapsed?
His death forced them to question their own assumptions about how to do their job best and survive.
“If you’re dealing with their wives, their children, their clean jobs, their secret airplane tracks they use to transport drugs, they don’t like it.”
Bojorquez said, “These things were beyond the boundary.”
The result was a high degree of autosansure and self-protection, even at its best.
Trusting your own instincts.
If there is a bad smell, stay away.
Andres Villarreal, Riodoce’s director of writing, said, “The smell is a deceitful sense... and what happened to Javier happened.”
He and others say that the old rules do not apply in Sinaloa; the same in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states that host weak institutions and corrupt government officials that do not apply to profitable smuggling routes, which are a toxic mix.
The ground is constantly changing.
No mobile phones are allowed in the room where Riodoce staff gathered for security training; days ago, it turned out that spyware sold only to governments was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Two police officers outside wanted to escape from a temperature of 104 degrees (40 degrees Celsius) in the shade of a tree.
They were assigned by the state government to protect Riodoce’s office in a four-story building in a middle-class district of Culiacan.
Half-joke-half-serious, some of the journalists wondered if these officers were the police in the 50 percent that the governor himself said was not trustworthy.
Reporters have been traveling for months to the mountainous countryside that was actually controlled by drug gangs.
In this week’s issue, Riodoce has three main stories.
Former great boxer Julio Cesar Chavez's brother was murdered in Sinaloa.
In addition, there was a disclosure of government spending concentrated on the governor’s homeland.
A block from the prosecutor’s office there was a group kidnapping at Culiacan’s most expensive restaurant.
There was no official explanation of who was abducted or how it was, so when it came time to write what everyone in the city knew, caution prevailed: the restaurant was in the midst of both drug smugglers and authorities.
A reporter learned from official records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician, a member of the Corporate Revolutionary Party (PRI) in government, which dominated almost every stage of politics in the last century.
Recently, many PRI governors have been accused of corruption in sensational incidents.
Villareal asked the reporter to write about previous events at the scene, including one of the sons of "El Chapo" Guzman's escape from a soldier's oppression.
Just months ago, readers were looking at the corner of Valdez for information from the best source about the abduction.
Villareal (46), dubbed "El Flaco" because of its thin structure, said, "We already knew what happened first."
"All our channels of communication with our sources are now cut off."
While staff turn into something they never expected, activists on behalf of the press, Valdez’s office is reused as a warehouse for banners and drawings protesting the murders of journalists.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed several banners and went out to the show for another journalist the next morning at the local prosecutor’s office.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was murdered in Michoacan.
A burnt body was found, and according to DNA tests, officials say it was he.
Journalists across the country have expressed their thoughts more loudly by writing "Help the building" on elevators and buildings during organized protests.
Today, director Bojorquez is trying to provide international support for justice in the Valdez case, far away in Washington.
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on the day after Valdez was murdered, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and killing them for saying the truth.
From that day on, he wanted to be appointed to a task other than reporting to the government, thinking that his anger undermined his neutrality.
Valdez has repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are “enveloped” by organized crime, criminal associates officials, and a careless society.
In his latest book, called “Drug Journalism,” he wrote that journalists are being killed not only by drug gangs, but by politicians and security forces that cooperate with organized crime.
Media observer group Articulo 19 linked most of last year’s attacks on journalists to police and officials.
Ramirez said, “You’re dying in Mexico because they want to silence you.”
The murders obviously had the effect of a cold shower.
No one remembers the death of blog writer Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
His body was found with a note said to have been signed by the Zetas cartel: "I'm here for my news."
A computer keyboard and headphone set next to his crushed head.
In the northern border state of Chihuahua, after the murder of journalist Miroslava Breach in March, some broadcasts like El Norte preferred to shut down.
After their executives were killed in 2004, others from Nuevo Laredo, like El Manana, continue to do.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez appealed to the drug cartels with the following headline on the front page: "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled their own states, even the country.
This is a burka decision.
They find it difficult to find work in exile and are still scouring the streets waiting for danger.
Sometimes, three months after escaping from Veracruz, they are captured, apparently, by photographer Ruben Espinoza, who was murdered in an apartment in Mexico City in 2015 with four women.
A day-to-day dance with these high-risk decisions for those who stay behind and continue to work.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, says he was scared to report on drug trafficking.
“Mexico is going to hell and that’s why I became a reporter.”
A recent Saturday at midnight, while preparations were being made to finish the last issue, Riodoce’s writing managers were sitting on the floor outside the office and drinking beer, and at the same time the phones were ringing.
A series of armed clashes involving rival gangs and security forces near Mazatlan, a beach resort, have caused 19 confirmed deaths.
The war continued to rage, as promised in a series of cartel messages located around it.
They posted the news on the Riodoce website via mobile phones.
The front page should be changed the next day.
Sirens began to sink nearby, there is a clash with another weapon around.
Bojorquez quickly looked at the guarding police officers to see if they were scared.
Even if they were afraid, they would not show.
Under the gigantic portrait of the pioneering founders of his newspapers, his middle finger was displayed to see all of Sinaloa, and the staff of Riodoce was following his footprints.
“How can you think of shutting down,” said Bojorquez, “when the day Javier was killed, the trainee asked me to send him out to tell me the news on the street?”
The dinosaurs used camouflage to avoid their enemies.
At first glance it looks like a statue, but it’s a terrible one.
Researchers have now revealed that the first finds of an incredible creature of the size of a dwarf found by a Canadian miner are very well preserved, and experts have described it as “the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs.”
It was so well preserved that they could understand that the skin of the pulp was red-brown and could say it had a “problematic history.”
A report in the journal Current Biology described it as “one of the best preserved armored dinosaurs found and one of the best dinosaur species in the world.”
The fossil was a newly discovered nodosor species that lived from the middle of the Cretaceous Period 110 million to 112 million years ago.
Its exceptional well-preserved condition surprised researchers who described it as “truly wonderful.”
The plant-eating armor is the best preserved fossil found in its kind, according to National Geographic reports.
It was found by Shawn Funk on March 21, 2011 while excavating the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in North Alberta, Canada.
He hit something that seemed strange in the surrounding rock and decided to look closer.
The found fossils were sent to the Royal Tyrrell Paleontological Museum.
They spent the next six years discovering the wild animal from within a 2,500 pound (1100 kg) cluster of land.
After such hard work, the results are now ready to be revealed.
Lead author Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is exhibited, said, “If you shorten your eyes a little, you can almost believe he’s asleep.”
As one of the most beautiful dinosaurs in the history of science and the best preserved species, it will pass as the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs.
By examining its skin, the researchers found that even though it was covered in armor and resembled a walking tank, eating this plant was likely facing a serious threat from meat-eating dinosaurs.
The dinosaur used its red and white camouflage to hide from the heavily armored predators, and used a protective technique known as counter-shadowing, which is also used by many modern animals.
Experts argue that it was hunted by larger dinosaurs, allowing it to better interfere with its surroundings and overcome its enemies.
The creature, from the 110 million-year-old family of nodosor, first appeared on manches in May and is currently on display at the Royal Tyrrell Paleontology Museum.
The researchers have now completed their work and named the wild animal Borealopelta markmitchelli to museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of the more than 7,000 hours of hard-working time spent discovering it.
The extraordinary preservation of the species made it possible for Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the shape, pattern, and armor on the body.
Animals discovered counter-shading, which is a common defense method in the realm and means that the top of the creature is darker by the bottom.
While counter-shadowing is common, the findings are surprising because the size of Borealopelta far outweighs the counter-shadowed animals that are alive today.
This means that the dinosaur was sufficingly oppressed and hunted by the meat-eating dinosaurs, and that evolution preferred to face hiding as a way of survival.
But the most modern animals that use counter-shadowing (e.g. goats, zebras or armadillons) are much smaller and much more likely to be a hunt; meaning that this nodosor has encountered serious difficulties in surviving.
Brown said, “The army showed how dangerous dinosaur predators in Crete could be in a powerful hunt for a heavily armored animal.”
Chemical analysis of the organic compounds found that the dinosaur’s skin was red-brown.
Scientists continue to examine the animal for hints about life, including preserved intestinal content, to find out what it ate at its last meal.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, he fell into a river and was dragged into the sea, where he sank on the surface of the ocean.
At that time, Alberta, South Florida, was as hot as it is today, and probably rivers and oceans had spread into far more interiors than they are now.
Brown said, “The nodozor is completely covered and preserved with pulp skin, while the original shape of the animal is also preserved in a three-dimensional way.”
The result is that what the animal looked like in the early Cretaceous era is almost the same today.
You don’t need much imagination to rebuild it; if you shorten your eyes a little, you can almost believe it’s asleep.”
Cretacea was the time when giant teropods, the flesh-bearing dinosaurs who stood on two feet, travelled the Earth.
Though the king of all of them, the Tyrannosaurus rex lived millions of years after the armored dinosaur Borealopelta, who could have been hunted by a bunch of heinous ancestors.
Among them is Acrocanthosaurus, a 38-foot-long monster weighing 6 tons.
Scientists, who have published their latest findings in the journal Current Biology, believe that after Borealopelta died, it was dragged into the sea and mummified in clay.
The creature was discovered by Shawn Funk on March 21, 2011 while excavating the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in North Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, this is the best preserved armored dinosaur, including leather and armor, and is complete from nose to hip.
The creature averages about 18 ft. (five meters) and weighs up to 3,000 pounds (1300 kg).
There are two 20 inches of neck out of their shoulders.
The researchers believe that the hantal hantal is now travelling in the West of Canada until it is dragged into the open sea by a river carrying this armored grassland.
But the dinosaur’s grave under the sea preserved its armor in perfect detail.
The fossilized remains of this particular species are so well preserved that pieces of skin still cover the entire armor layers along the dinosaur’s skull.
As Michael Greshko writes for National Geographic, it’s rarely enough to win a conservative piano at this level.
The more I look at it, the more incredible it is.
The fossilized pieces of leather still cover the whole layers of armor that are located on the dinosaur’s skull.
His right forehead leg is lying next to him, with five fingers mounted upwards.
I can count on my feet.”
Do not whiten your teeth.
White teeth and an aesthetic smile is the dream of every person.
While people resort to various ways to whiten their teeth, Nükhet Berk, president of the Association of Oral Laser Applications, warns that products sold in markets or online should be avoided.
Nükhet Berk, who points out that these types of substances sold draw the surface of the mine and color the teeth so that they are no longer recycled, says that "whitening of the teeth can be provided with chemicals applied by dentists or thin porcelain surfaces that stick to the surface of the teeth, such as nails."
Berk noted that preserving dental health prevents the development of many diseases, and that aesthetic practices are important in terms of mental health by providing both tooth and tooth health and a beautiful smile, sharing the following information:
Unless there is a disorder in the dental structure or genetic factors, the teeth of adolescents are usually white.
Due to aging, the drawing of teeth and the frequent consumption of smoking, alcoholic or dark-colored beverages, teeth become darker over the years.
Whitening of teeth can be achieved with chemicals applied by dentists or thin, adhesive porcelain surfaces applied to the surface of the teeth without minimal or no rubbing.
Teeth should never be whitened with products sold in the marketplace or online.
Because, these substances draw the surface of the mine, the teeth are colored so that I will never return.
Keçiören Municipality, from 2011" provides "Dental and Mouth Health Services at Home" to the elderly, disabled and sleeping citizens.
The 65-year-old Köksal Güngör, who has lived a life imprisoned in bed for 24 years in Keçiören's Wake Up District, "has been aware of this service of the Keçiören Municipality of my wife."
We called the town and they arrived.
"I have already a stroke below my neck, thanks to this service, I do not neglect my dental care at all."
Kezban Gökçe, the 72-year-old daughter of Gülizar Taşçıoğlu, who lives in Pınarbaşı neighborhood, said: "My mother has been dependent on bed for 7.5 years because of her old age."
When I came to the town, I saw the poster of this service and immediately called.
We have been using this service regularly for 4 years.
I also have problems with my teeth, and doctors look at me when they come.
He used his “very pleased” words.
There is no mandatory health insurance for the service that is completely free of charge.
The Turkish Army’s “Trials”
Dear readers, very interesting decisions were made at the High Military Sura (YAS) meeting that took place the previous day, especially with regard to the Navy.
This force was brought to command not an admiral, but a coronel.
This is an unprecedented practice in our army.
How did this happen?
The commander of the army, Admiral Bülent Bostanoğlu, had completed his term and was already retired.
And it happened.
Now the order of command came to Veysel Kösele, the only admiral.
Veysel Paşa, who had been a victim of a cowboy in the past and who had been imprisoned for a while, had to be the commander in the normal rank of senior officers.
But the government did not want it.
I try to summarize very briefly, starting from the top in the Navy, the 1, 3, 4 and 5 commanders were not promoted.
There was only one admiral in the Navy.
The empty post had to be brought to him: Commander of the Navy at number two, Admiral Veysel Kösele.
What happened afterwards?
Admiral Adnan Özbal, who was ranked sixth, was appointed by the government.
Now look at that picture!
Admiral Veysel Kösele stands there, but a lower rank commander is appointed in his place!
He is in charge of an unconditional order.
What will happen from now on?
An admiral who is superior to the rank cannot serve under the orders of a general who is infinitely superior to him.
He does not receive orders, he does not.
In this case, the Veysel Kösele will not bear this incentive, if the retirement is not sent today or tomorrow, he will resign.
This is also the insulting message given to him by the government: “Goodbye Veysel Paşa!”
The news of his resignation was spread in the afternoon when I wrote this yesterday, but the situation had not yet been officially explained.
Let’s look at these things again!
The government opposed Veysel Kösele for this or that reason, did not want to, forced him to resign, and brought a 6th-ranked coramiri to the command in his place, thwarting our army's traditional "Kadem" concept.
There is politics behind the curtain, but we don’t know what is behind it.
Maybe soon someone will tell you, we’ll all find out!
Dear readers, I have tried to explain very briefly above, especially the senior incident in the Turkish army is very important.
Not just as a rank.
For example, an officer who finishes Harp School in 10th place is higher than the officer who finishes in 11th place.
The one who is promoted to generality first is superior to the one who is promoted to generality second.
We have lived in the examples of this high-profile event.
Commander of the Garp Front.
There are two armies.
Army and 2nd Army.
In 1922, our armies will carry out a great revolt and expel the Greek army.
There are valuable names expected to be assigned to the army command at this stage.
One of them is Paşa.
He is offered to be the commander of the army, but he says, "The command is endless from me, I cannot enter into his command."
Another name is Jacob Shevki (Subais).
Professor at Ataturk’s Harp Academy
He was a valuable and highly respected commander who took part in various battles, called "Master".
In 1919, he was captured with Turkish soldiers and civilians and deported to Malta by the British.
When he returns home, he is reluctant about the command of the army and says the same thing: "The commander of the Western Front is out of hand from me, I can't take orders from him."
But Ataturk persuades him to be grateful and Jacob Shevki Pasha accepts the command of one of our two armies.
It is a very colorful name.
by Ali Ibn Abi Waqqas.
A man who is constantly criticizing.
A commander who fought on Iraq, the Caucasus, Iran and various fronts.
He is also expelled by the British to Malta, where he escapes and comes to Ankara via Kuşada.
When he was offered the command of the army, Ali Ihsan Pasha said the same thing: "I cannot fight under the command of Ismet, who is unqualified from me".
He is persuaded...
But see, after the mission began, the commander of the Garp Front, who came to his command, is constantly arguing with the commander of the Garp Front, Ismet Pasha, and is bringing about incidents and disturbing the army...
And shortly before the big taarruz he is removed from office and sent to retirement, instead of the bearded Nurettin Paşa is brought.
After that, Ali Ihsan Paşa’s relationship with Ataturk never improved.
The problem of the Turkish army is not only in war, but also in peace.
Of course he has to go out.
The shell is the last example of this.
How did an activist have to learn the answer to the question "Who's in the streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken.
One day after coming to New York City to go for a trip, St. Louis’ native sat down on the Airbnb bed he rented and started surfing Facebook on his phone.
It was shared by someone from high school.
“The police just killed an 18-year-old boy and he’s still lying on the street,” he said.
He was surprised when he realized that no one else in the content stream shared this information, shut down Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user named @TheePharoah was constantly re-tweeted in his content stream.
A rapper from the St. Louis district was tweeting live about Michael Brown’s death, when he was murdered at the age of 18, by an unarmed black, white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He shared a picture of Brown’s dead body on the street for four hours.
Ferrell thought to himself, “This is brutal.”
But death was nothing new for him or his family.
He then left his phone to return to tweets about people gathering at Canfield Drive that same evening.
Police bands, whispering people, and pictures of a man holding a banner on which he claimed to be Brown’s father, wrote, “Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!”
A police officer watched a live broadcast where he stood in front of a group of protesters with a dog crawling.
In another video, another police officer, he said, set up his rifle and shouted, “I’ll kill you all... animals.”
Ferrell remembered saying, “This is not usual.”
“This is not the type of murder we are accustomed to.”
I felt frightened at that moment.
I was angry and I was crying.”
He booked a return ticket and went home the next day.
After landing at 11 a.m., the six-year-old took her from her father's house and decided to go to Ferguson with her the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in the three years after him is coming to theaters on August 11, the subject of a new documentary entitled "Who's the Streets?"
This is a story from the perspective of survival and protest, love and loss, power and resistance, people living in that society and filling the streets with the answers they are looking for.
As Ferrell drove his car to Ferguson with her daughter in a floral dress and a crown suitable for her, they returned to the talk they had repeatedly done that morning about "the experiences of the blacks and the situation of the blacks."
“Do you remember I taught you black people to fight because they believed?” he said.
“We’re going to Ferguson right now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that wasn’t true.
I couldn’t help,” Ferrell said later.
What is happening here today is a result of what happened in the past.
You have to know it, see it and grow in it.
We must not only advance well in the field of activism and organizing, but also know the layers of black experience and the black state and liberation, and what we must do to liberate ourselves.
Even if I were lucky enough to give her an experience she would not personally experience brutal racism, it would be no different from any black woman-child.
I feel like I will protect him from doing evil.”
When they arrived in Ferguson, their first stops were on South Florissant Road, which was facing the police headquarters and they were waiting for a conversation on the subject that resulted in official Darren Wilson not being prosecuted for the crime.
There, Ferrell and her daughter established connections with local employers who prepared packed food.
They prepared bags and helped deliver them to the protesters.
A new kind of activism was slowly forming for Ferrell.
While a student at Missouri State University, he was the president of the Association of Minority Student Nurses and noted that he was focused on food justice and health injustice in the black society, saying, “My activism has completely transformed after August 9.”
“I didn’t have any experience organizing.
It came by itself.”
Several weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-directors of the film, at a evening show.
Folayan said he and his own image director, Lucas Alvarado-Farrar, "want to document" what happened.
A question came to Ferrell’s mind: “Do you want to document or are you trying to find a story you can use?”
This suspicion was often by innumerable individuals, including whites, to come to a society and gain from its pain and resistance.
As Folayan explained in an interview nearby: “We heard that the voices of people born and growing up in Ferguson could not concentrate, and we decided to do it differently.”
Folayan had already made contact with co-director Damon Davis, a regional artist known for his activism about death sentences.
His involvement warmed Ferrell into the project, followed in the following years by the shooting of Brown’s “Who’s the Streets?” team along with the other six district locals.
David said, “This documentary is not about someone speaking for us or speaking to us; we are the speakers.”
"This was the main thing for me, how these people would be represented because that's how I would be represented."
Folayan said, “While the effort didn’t focus on Ferrell’s experiences, the movement proved to be the most open-minded of the film participants, in the form of showing that it’s not about a Christian leader, it’s about society coming together.
As a result, "Who's in the Streets?" surprisingly documents personal aspects of Ferrell's life, such as being in love and marrying his wife.
Ferrell, laughing at the first sight of the finished product, said, “I felt like I was naked.”
“But when I did this work and humanized black people, I understood that there could be some sensitivity.”
Furthermore, Ferrell’s story reinforces and re-centeres the role of black gay women in the Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement, who derived the #BlackLivesMatter slogan on social media after the murder of the young black Trayvon Martin in 2012, have identified themselves as gay.
“The black gay women in the leadership generally held the movement,” Ferrell said, “and that’s because we’re constantly fighting on many fronts.
Black gay women have to bear all the weight of it.”
Folayan added: “The movement is really supported by black women and many gay black women.”
Nevertheless, Ferrell insists “that’s when there’s nothing in the kind of positive action” and when he’s not selected because of his identity.
He says, “He was the one who triggered this energy.”
“But it’s not a coincidence that she’s in the front lines, because as a black gay woman, there’s a lot to be lost by living a life in these clashes.
You can feel his energy on the screen.
Meanwhile, news cameras in Ferguson have already gone, but there are disturbing racial connections between society and the police.
Ferrell was under surveillance for another 2.5 years due to the closure of the highway during a show.
My home describes the socio-political atmosphere in the region as "conflict" in one word.
Still, Ferguson keeps the song he carved into his memory exactly three years ago when he went out on the streets.
It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
Winning is our job.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose except our chains.”
Kyrie Irving: The world is round, not flat!
Speaking to NBC Sports, Irving said, “The world is not round.”
The world is straight.
They get used to such things by frightening people.
My friend, don’t ask too much.
Because the more information you disclose, the more information comes out.
This is madness.
Is the world straight?
Or is it rotating around itself?
I think you should research this.
I tell you, they are lying to us.
They lied to us, they used their words.
Irving, “I believed that I wanted to believe for years.”
I thought the world was round.
Do you really think we are back in the solar system?
Nothing they sent is returned.
It does not return!
The information they give us is very confusing.
The truth is here.
You just have to look for this truth.
“Do you understand what I’m saying?” he said.
Kyrie Irving, who claims the world is flat, struggles with the Cleveland Cavaliers this season with 24.4 points and 5.9 assists averages.
An Artistic Similarity: Artist Uses Chelsea Manning’s DNA to Create Portraits
In the middle of the room at the Fridman Gallery in New York, white, black, and brown, curved over the roof cables, have many faces, each showing almost certain vague similarities.
These 30 portraits were created by the portrait artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg, from earrings and cut hair sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning, a former intelligence analyst who was sentenced to 35 years in prison after leaking secret diplomatic messages to the WikiLeaks site, has sentenced his haircut from Fort Leavenworth prison.
The new exhibition opened on August 2 is a similar name.
This is the product of a two-year correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, who combines his discipline with expertise in technology, computer science and art, and a transwoman who has been forgiven a three-day sentence from office by Barack Obama, and Manning, a leading opponent.
Creating 30 portraits by algorithmically analyzing DNA extracted from Manning and using what a person with this gene data might look like, Dewey-Hagborg revealed not only the processability of DNA data (there are many ways to guess and the determinism that comes from the essence of the comments), but also its identity with a narrow, somewhat mindful interpretation.
Born as Bradley Edward but more clearly describing herself as a woman in her adolescence, Manning was convicted in 2013 of 20 crimes, including six in the Spy Act, computer fraud and theft.
He was pressured by the prison so that he had only one photograph: a sandy, black-and-white selfishness of Manning, apparently annoyed, sitting in the driver’s seat, wearing a platinum-yellow wig with him.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg was achieving success with his 2012 project The Stranger Principles.
In it, the artist produced portraits by scratching DNA from the rashes of criminal pieces such as cigarette stitches and strawberries to draw a picture of what these people might look like.
I just got an email from Paper Magazine.
“They were interviewing Chelsea Manning while in prison and asked for a sort of portrait that could accompany this writing,” Dewey-Hagborg said in a press release.
At this point, the visit could not be made, the photo could not be taken, so they reached Chelsea and asked if they were interested in making a DNA portrait.
The artist and his imprisoned inspiration became unexpected letters friends by exchanging many letters over the course of two years.
They even uncovered Bastrified Subjects, a cartoon book illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, where the president forgave Chelsea’s punishment and dreamed of a future in which he could see the exhibition personally.
The fact that Obama really asked for Manning’s eviction a few days after the book market came out was a happy coincidence after seven cruel years in a military prison in Kansas.
While Donald Trump finds new, tweetable ways to wage war on government-related information leaks and transgender soldiers and further blur the sharp divisions he’s asked to fix, there’s something deep and powerful about this exhibition that’s now open.
When asked about the strange timing of all this, Dewey-Hagborg said, “Events happen for a reason.”
An artist's statement written on the wall of the gallery, under which Manning's large-scale signature appears (the point of the letter "i" on the plot is inserted with the heart), "called for an end to the "automatic discrimination" based on gender, race, sexuality and culture.
In front of the wall there is its mitochondrial DNA sequence: many Cs, Gs, and As written with bullet pencil...
By adding 200 letters (or the nucleotides according to the artist’s sophisticated knowledge dictionary), Dewey Hagborg wanted to explain how astonishingly similar we all are, at least as a biological creation.
“What I hope people will get out of this is that our genomes don’t care who we are, and how open and subjective the genetic data is to interpret,” said Dewey-Hagborg, who was exhibiting his 2007 video work Imitation Memories.
“DNA data can tell many different stories, and that’s 30 of those stories.”
The last piece of the exhibition held in a single room is a page from a short line novel that was previously mentioned.
Here Manning is shown out in King Kong style with a speaker obtained from the United States Discipline Halls.
“They’ve won your talk,” he wrote.
“So never stop.”
The artist from Philadelphia said, “This came directly from a letter he wrote to me.”
“When I talk about it, my hair is still shrinking.”
Manning hasn’t seen the exhibition personally yet (as he predictively dreamed from the cartoon book), but when he sees it, he’ll be greeted by masks with his own genetic imitations gathered in the middle of the room like a group of protesters.
Like everything in the exhibition, the genetic haplogroups were written with bullet pencil up to Manning’s height (5”2, Manning’s length), which was especially done.
Dewey-Hagborg said about the portraits, “I’d put them on the wall in the past, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd.”
“I wanted it to be perceived as a mass movement shaped with Chelsea, as well as the movement behind his liberation.”
Northwestern educator and Oxford University employee are looking for murder
Police say a nationwide human hunt has been launched for the suspect-seeked Northwestern University educator and Oxford University employee after a man was found dead by a knife on the ground floor of a luxurious apartment in Chicago.
Cook’s administrative district records show that on Monday, arrests for first-degree murder were issued without penalty for Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) for alleged involvement in the murder of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau.
Documents say that Cornell-Duranleau (26) died after being beaten with a knife many times.
A warning issued by the Chicago Police Department said a body was found on July 27.
Officers took a phone call, reached the Grand Plaza Apartments and found many deep cuts on the victim’s body.
Official sources said Cornell-Duranleau was to have died on the scene, and police were actively searching for the two suspects while detectives were investigating the knife-bite as a murder.
Lathem has been an associate professor in microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, vice president of university relations, said in an email statement that Lathem was in administrative custody and banned from entering Northwestern University campuses.
Cubbage said: “This is a criminal case under investigation by the necessary authorities and Northwestern University is cooperating in this investigation.”
Warren is a senior financial assistant at Oxford University.
A spokesman for the university and the University of Somerville said in an email: "We are in contact with the UK police and are ready to help U.S. investigative authorities in any way they need."
The statement also said Warren’s colleagues were shocked and wanted him to surrender.
Anthony Guglielmi, Chief Communications Officer at the Chicago Police Department, said he strongly encouraged suspects to surrender to authorities.
Guglielmi said, “The police have an idea of where they are, but our efforts to identify them are concentrating.”
Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities were helping to find the suspects.
Guglielmi said the police had received a call from the Grand Plaza building manager, who had just received a mysterious hint that something had happened in apartment 1008.
Police described the scene as terrible.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident occurred on July 27.
Lathem and Warren were confirmed in the building by security cameras.
Guglielmi said, “We believe there is a relationship between the victim and teacher Latham.”
The board of directors at Grand Plaza issued a statement addressing residents, saying: "The police are still working on the victim's timeline and history, and investigating a range of aspects, including a possible domestic event."
Italy attacked a German vessel
Italian police said they had handed down a ship called Iuventa on the island of Lampedusa, which is seeking and rescuing migrants in the Mediterranean.
The police, which also shared recordings of telephone conversations with journalists, claimed to belong to two members of the organization, announced that the operation was carried out as part of an investigation initiated by the Trapani Prosecutor’s Office in October 2016.
Members of the Jugend Rettet, who are accused of "actively advocating illegal migration on the Libya-Italy line," are alleged to have brought refugees to Italy at least three times directly from ships taken by Libyan human traffickers.
Jugend Rettet members, who are questioned by the prosecutor, are among the allegations that they have committed this crime together with some people from the Libyan Coast Guard.
In the statement, the organization stated that their priorities would continue to be to save human lives, and that they were assessing the accusations that were addressed to them.
In addition to the ships covered by the Italian Coast Guard and the European Union (EU) mission, about 9 international civil society organizations are also involved in the search and rescue of refugees in the Mediterranean.
The Italian government had drafted a 13 article code of conduct for these organizations to comply with and required that it be signed.
Last minute: Five buffets of the Banli who attacked the Grand Crossing were sealed
Eskişehir Metropolitan Mayor Yılmaz Büyükerşen was arrested by police after the attack incident, was sealed by the five buffets that retired police Mahfuz Banlı hired from TCDD, who were arrested by the court they were removed.
According to the news, a large number of police and Çevik Force crews were accompanied by the municipal team.
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko: "We will complete the WADA roadmap in the short term"
Russian Assistant Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it would not take long for the rest of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) criteria to be implemented in order for the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) to re-operate.
"A certain stage in the fulfillment of roadmap criteria has been completed, RUSADA has obtained the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (United Kingdom Anti-Doping).
The WADA roadmap has been updated in this context," Mutko said on Thursday.
The Prime Minister was evaluating the second part of the WADA Regulatory Compliance Roadmap, which recently was published on the agency’s website, describing the criteria governing the re-operation of RUSADA.
According to Mutko, this does not contain anything to worry Russia.
“Everything has been announced, everything will be implemented.
The results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future.”
However, one of the criteria mentioned on the list is that Russia’s anti-doping authorities must publicly acknowledge the results of a state-sponsored doping investigation in Russian sport conducted by Canadian attorney Richard McLaren, approved by WADA.
Mutko said: “While our anti-doping system acknowledges a failure, we are conducting an investigation.
All precautions were taken.
But there is no government program, and we will not accept something that didn’t exist.”
Vitaly Smirnov, chairman of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
Speaking to the Russian broadcaster RSport in the early hours of the day, Smirnov acknowledged the past problems in the anti-doping bodies of Russia but added: "We have said on many occasions that the report contains contradictory positions and regulations.
No one is considering accepting the report unconditionally,” Smirnov added.
RUSADA was suspended from doping controls in Russia in November 2005 following the doping scandal.
However, under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping (UKAD) it was allowed to plan and coordinate this June test.
In July, following a visit to the agency’s headquarters in Moscow, WADA Director Olivier Niggli stated that RUSADA was “going in the right direction” to get things done again.
100 million people watched it.
The "Come to Beşiktaş" video, which announced the Negredo transfer of Beşiktaş, soon reached 100 million people from 18 countries.
The video, decorated with the dialogues of Quaresma, Pepe and Negredo, was also shared on the websites of major newspapers such as Marca, L'Equipe, La Gazzetta dello Sport.
The President of Galatasaray does not return empty hand.
Former president of Galatasaray, Faruk Süren, severely criticized President Dursun Uzbek, who went to Bucharest and Ankara for the transfer of Ndiaye to persuade Mircea Lucescu.
Here are the special statements the legendary president made for the Morning readers:
Lucescu-Uzbek meeting: “We were finishing when we went.”
The president of Galatasaray does not go in vain, nor does he return empty-handed.
The president of Galatasaray does not go to football.
At the foot of the President.
Of course, they know whether they kiss their hands or embrace them.
But no matter who the actor is, the president doesn’t go to his feet.
You give 9 million euros to the player who got 300 thousand euros from the Ottoman sport.
It will be $7.5 million, not $9 million.
You’ve already made a huge investment, of course you’ll play and 7.5 will be 9...
Uzbekistan’s officials: I don’t want to think.
But the desire is.
G.Saray values are eroding.
It’s not just football, it’s all wrong.
This will be changed by the Board of Directors and the Board of Directors.
As far as I know, the members are pleased.
Start-ups that will help your company not be the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure her employee’s happiness at an e-commerce start-up but the surveys didn’t work.
The answers were usually vague, unhelpful, or worse, deceptive.
Even if anonymity was promised, some employees did not trust it.
Errett, who manages Madison Reed, a 75-person e-commerce company on hair care in San Francisco, says “There’s never been consistency or objectivity.”
He also called someone out for help.
A new type of human resource start-up is emerging to help companies understand how their employees feel.
They produce and license a software that measures employee engagement for a specific purpose, enabling firms to conduct speculative surveys, target specific teams and demographic groups, provide employees with anonymity and complaint support lines, and in some cases allow employees to report a misconduct by dismissing senior executives and going directly to the management board.
Jim Barnett, co-founder and chairman of Redwood City start-up Glint, which measures employee engagement by software analytics tools companies, said, “There are now tools like Strava and Fitbit that monitor your health, but where is your company’s Fitbit?”
Errett says that using Glint, employees better understand what they think and feel three years later.
In addition to providing speculative surveys and optional surveys to specific teams, it offers a heat map with a look at which segments of the company get the most complaints and which managers have low likes scores, so that the reasons for these can be identified.
To not be the next Uber, companies are beginning to understand that they need to be aware of the culture of their workplaces; Uber has been in a scandal since describing a harassment environment in which those who clearly say what they think in a blog post posted by a former employee are punished.
For start-ups like Glint, this requests for supervision means a very profitable business opportunity.
According to the Financial Technology Insights website Let’s Talk Payments, the global governance, regulation and compliance industry could be worth $118.7 billion by 2020.
Interest and activity in Denver Colorado-based start-up Convercent, which helped companies detect and prevent bad behavior, grew among the discussions about Uber’s disproportion earlier this year.
Convercent has 600 customers including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber has recently registered as a customer.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to make personalized “push-ups”, collect real-time hidden responses, and extract heat maps of problematic areas.
It also offers an anonymous messaging help line where employees can report bad behavior.
If the president is charged, the complaints go directly to the board of directors.
Covercent founder and chairman Patrick Quinlan said, “The Kamoyu court has seized regulators.”
Quinlan said: “If a company treats its employees badly or unethically, consumer boycotts, employee incitement, or lawsuits can have costly consequences even if regulators don’t take action.
With more than 25,000 employees at 500 locations, Ruby Tuesday has been using Convercent for more than a year to keep its employees aware of the principles and procedures and provide an easy way to reach the company’s headquarters.
When a previous employee wanted to report a problem, he had to find a telephone number or email address at the company headquarters, had an official complaint and hoped it would be taken seriously.
James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesday’s chief legal adviser, said that these are mostly eye-threatening and annoying experiences, and that it’s not a good way to follow employee complaints.
But now, with the company’s use of Convercent, problems (such as separation, harassment, or unfair wage enforcement) hidden from executives who previously lived away from offices, cities or states can be detected and resolved faster.
Vitrano, who heads Ruby Tuesday’s risk management group, said: “I can approach this employment experience even more with a holistic, 360-degree perspective.”
“We also protect our shareholders from business lawsuits.”
After accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed in 2002 due to the violation of ethical values caused by the Enron scandal, companies took issues of ethics, values, and employee relationships more seriously in 2002, Quinlan said.
But after “social media came to its own,” companies realized they couldn’t prevent their dirty laundry from becoming viral.
“Before technology was used to control ethics, people used hope as a strategy.”
Both Glint and Convercent offer software as a service and charge repeated fees for using their products.
This is a business model and opportunity with the approval of venture capital investors that support both start-ups.
Convercent received $10 million in funding from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital in February, raising its total capital to $47 million.
Glint raised $10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners in November, raising its total funding to $60 million.
Given the nature, cultures and venture capital of companies that are interconnected, these investments are not surprising.
Increasing research shows that today’s employees expect more from their jobs than they did before.
High wages and interesting projects in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley are just minimum requirements.
Employees want to feel accepted, valued and giving their time to a company with a positive mission.
Nina McQueen, LinkedIn’s global benefits and employee experience vice president, who uses both Convercent and Glint, said: “When people are happy to be in a company, when they feel their voices heard, and if the job they’re doing is satisfying, they’re more genuine to make that company succeed.”
Investors make a profit when their portfolio companies do a good job; companies do a good job if their employees are sincere and feel belonging to the company.
If third-party analytics tools promise to increase employees’ sense of integrity and belonging, it’s not surprising that they find support.
Having data about employee loyalty is important according to workplace culture experts.
But the data is useless if the company’s managers do not take action.
In fact, if a company wants feedback from its employees, it can create an expectation that the change is coming.
And if the expectation doesn’t come fast enough or doesn’t come at all, it can generate disappointment and make employees feel like they’re broken.
Russell Raath, chairman of the consultancy at Kotter International, said: “If you’re going to ask for 4,000 suggestions, you need to be prepared for 4,000 conversations.”
“For if you do not follow, the workers will say, ‘Have you really heard me?
Do you care?
And why should I care if you don’t care?”
According to Errett, Madison Reed, who conducted monthly employee surveys, was able to act the same day when a problem was at Glint.
And after collecting feedback from employees who were tired of the decision-making mechanism and the speed of communication quality, they were able to reorganize various teams within the company and added communication training to solve problems.
At Ruby Tuesday, the company gets new insights about its employees and hopes that in the long run this will turn into keeping more workers in such an industry known to be a high number of employees entering out.
Vitrona said, “If you’re not committed to building a culture of transparency, you’re losing people.”
And if you lose people, you will lose customers.
And when you lose customers, you lose companies.”
NCAA’s removal of two workouts every day means a long day for Bruins.
The clock arrives at 11 p.m. and a gang of UCLA football players sit down to chat on the edge of a new training area inside the campus.
Some reveal their swollen back from the trouble of the first day in the training camp.
For a significant part of the team, these free minutes make up the middle of the day.
After 3 hours of training, players enrolled in summer classes will return home and work on their final exams before returning to Wasserman Football Center for meetings at 6.30 a.m. the next morning.
Bruins coach Jim Mora just before returning on Tuesday said: “The next three days are a torture for these guys.”
The NCAA’s lifting of two workouts a day, held to lift the burden on players, actually extended their days, at least until the finals ended on Friday.
That’s why UCLA’s first three training sessions were scheduled to start at 7.15 p.m. so that they fit into the players’ already tight schedule.
More than one workout a day for no two workouts a day; Bruins takes the camp start close to a week ahead of last season, and during the summer school, Mora is training at the summer school for the first time in his six seasons at Westwood.
They plan to do 18 training sessions until August 20 before the official preparations for their opening against Texas A&M in September.
Mora said the NCAA supported the rule change, although it added new pens to the player’s intensive working schedule.
Mora said, “We’re putting a huge burden on them for three or four days and that’s very challenging.”
“And they’ve been through this recently; they’re working, great kids.
I think we’ll have more time on Saturday when we get there, it’ll be really great.”
UCLA will stop its training when the camp is over; it’s not an easy task when the luxury hotel Luskin Center, which has a parking lot on the side and a football ball in the vicinity, is held in the rain and closed behind the castle with a protective net, considering it’s on the view line of its fields.
The Bruins players are scheduled to settle at the hotel earlier this week, but Mora admits there may be a problem with emptying the rooms during the season.
He said, “We will be safe.
“It’s a real concern, and it’s not too blatant to think that someone will rent a room and sit there and take a video of a workout.
If there is a video recording of a workout, this is a pretty good thing.
But there will be our security and there will be our security in the upper parking lot at 8.
We will do our best with what we have.
I will not worry too much about this.
We have a plan.”
Facebook Increases Story Verification Power to Fight Fake News
Facebook will send more potential fake articles to third-party story verificators and show their findings under the original share, telling the world’s largest online social network that it’s trying to fight names as fake news on Thursday.
In a statement on the company’s website, it said it would use updated machine learning to detect potential fraud and send them to story verificators, and this would potentially show the story verification results below the original article.
Facebook has been criticized for being one of the main distribution points of news known as fake news that many think has affected the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
The issue has also become a big political headline in Europe, with French voters supporting a penalty cuts plan if fake news floods before the May presidential election and Germany fails to quickly remove hateful posts on social media networks there before the September elections.
In a separate statement on Thursday, Facebook said a test of the new story verification feature was being launched in the U.S., France, the Netherlands and Germany.
Facebook news stream product manager Sara Su said in a blog: “In addition to seeing which stories are being discussed by third-party story verificators, people want more resources about what they read and share to make informed decisions.”
He added that Facebook will continue to test the “affected article” feature and will work on other changes in the news stream to reduce fake news.
Creating a comic book: the story of a castle in England
In its recent history, the small Scotney Castle played in a Squeeze music club and was a haven for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But now, inspired by a comic novel written by a dusty, historical documentary enthusiast from Yorkshire, Jamie Rhodes, Scotney has witnessed 700 years of turbulent history from his comfortable seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent.
“I find it great to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years,” he said.
“It’s a personal bond to hold this letter in my hand.”
A Castle in England, ranging from the Edward period to the Middle Ages, each story documents the families who lived in Scotney to be painted by a different artist named after the United Kingdom (Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg).
This is not Rhodes’s first book based on an archive: he also wrote Dents of Dead Men and Other Stories in 2014, a project he unexpectedly found emotional, inspired by stories in the British Library.
“My eyes were filled with fingerprints on the edge of a letter written in the 1700s by a dual agent working for King James’ supporters.”
This was his fingerprint.
Letters also always smell like it, because you then lit a fire for light.
For someone in the future for 300 years, this smell feels like he is there too.
I love the archives!”
As a lover of old papers, getting support from the National Trust and the British Art Council and staying in a castle for almost four months (“I’ve been a little overwhelmed by staying too much to be warmly welcomed, to be honest.”) seems too good.
Rhodes spent his days exploring the "new" castle of the Victorian era, scanning the archives, and working on many treasures and antiques, such as backbones mounted on the walls of the mansion and centuries-old bottles in the cave.
Talking to the guardians, gardeners, and sometimes to the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book, he walked through the land and the remains of the old castle.
Then, at night, he was “drinking whiskey and being put to write.”
The detailed date of Scotney is relatively unknown, since the National Trust was fully accessible but could be reached when her last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, died in 2006.
When Rhodes arrived ten years later, the staff had only started dealing with the archive, and he described it as follows: "For centuries the aristocrats said, 'Oh, throw it in the ceiling.'"
Diaries, letters from the days of the British Empire, maps that set the boundaries of who has what to do: “You think land disputes will be boring,” says Rhodes, “but there was a hush tree over which two families fought.
Let go guys!”
Some stories in the collection, including The Labourer, who left the newly built castle to join the Peasant Uprising in 1381, use the castle as a leappoint to make a wider entry into British history.
"In this book, Knights of the City and Sussex, there is a record of the 1380 uprising in the castle," Rhodes says.
“The peasant uprising started around here and I thought a uprising could be a good starting point.
Per the two are connected?”
Other stories are closely linked to the history of the castle, such as The Priest, which tells the story of the Darrell family hiding a Jewish priest for 7 years during the British Invasions.
Or The Smuggler, where the 18th-century smuggler Arthut Darrell, who is thought to have filled a coffin with stones and planned his own funeral, is located (a revelation made when the coffin was removed from the ground years later).
The Darrell's were Rhodes' favourite Scotney family: "These gentlemen seemed quite rude, always borrowing and spending money on things they couldn't meet.
During different generations, the Darrell men solved their debt crises by marrying wealthy old women; I imagine them as a group of handsome men who are inclined to make women heirs.”
Rhodes ends his mission at the castle, looking for other unique writing experiences.
In the wild of Finland, he completed a two-week work on a comic book about Elämänmäki, a sanatorium site in the early 20th century, which has since been re-occupied by nature.
But Scotney holds a separate place in his heart.
“I’m sad that I’m separated.”
“It’s like, ‘Ah, I have to go now and face your damn possible real life.’”
Meral Night’s ‘Maho’ reaction
Nationalist Movement Party General Secretary İsmet Bökkataman has made a written statement about the resignation claims in social media and the press related to MHP recently.
Using the expression that "some old rifles flow" from social media and "from the corners of some old Marxists" to MHP, he argued that "games and tables were resorted to preventing the revolutionary movement from continuing to exist under the MHP roof after September 12".
The grandfather said:
“Those who do not value the historical existence of the Turkish nation, who do not attract the homeland of the Turkish nation, if their records are corrupt, if their criminal files are blurred, if their ideas are blurred, if their minds are confused, their hands are shaken.”
“MHP Kocaeli Gölcük Primary Organization management and its members 410 people and MHP Bursa’s Yenişehir district 215 people resigned.”
250 resignations, 300 resignations are misleading the public with unfounded news.
In the columns of the newspapers, the lies spread, the deceit deepened.
The number of refugees in the places mentioned, as a number of resignations reached by us, does not cross the fingers of one hand.
Bokataman, who has been described as "in the words" concerning the allegations, said that with the surveys he has been described as "in the words" the public is attempted to be misdirected and the perception management is carried out.
The Ambassador said: “They will reverse propaganda and campaigns aimed at creating perceptions against MHP.”
MHP Secretary-General Büyükataman, who stated that MHP is an important and indispensable actor in Turkish politics, said about the resignations:
The forces of the former Marxists with the sword are not enough to destroy the place MHP has taken in the conscience of the Turkish nation.
There is a dirty account behind all the comments made, the practiced methods of perception management.
Because politics and media have turned their eyes on the MHP foundation.
Those who do not work in favour of our party and do not strive for good work between us do not make sense to resign now.
What about those who are not able to give up on their own?
In their lives, MHP has not benefited, has not shared our memories, has not understood our countries, has not participated in our struggle, even if he has always stood on the sidelines, his mind has been carbonized, his heart-burned gang has to find another occupation for them.
The attempts to disrupt the unity and integrity of the Nationalist Movement Party, the attempts to discourage and disperse them, are an attempt in Benghazi.
And he will turn back and strike his master.
The Nationalist Movement is the last fortress of the Turkish nation that has survived despite severe destruction.
In his explanation, the Ambassador, who calls MHP “political murderers” for those he claims is targeting, “the nationalist movement is not without.”
“The roots that feed beyond the ocean will not reach their ends at any cost.”
The MHP’s Büyükataman, who uses the phrase “the treacherous traitors will turn crazy and be ashes in the fire,” in his statement, ranked the opposition parties and terrorist organizations together, claiming: “from the CHP to the HDP; from there to the Perinçekgill, from the PKK to the FETÖ, whoever does anything, they will not be able to operate the right of the Turkish nation to own its own destiny.”
We resisted the new tactics and games of those who planned Turkey without MHP, without MHP; we fought to the end with the dishonest who wanted a government without MHP, a parliament without MHP.
We’re going to break the games, we’re going to break the players.
Büyükataman, who said "the patent of landscape is in MHP", used the following statements imitating Meral Akşener: "As in the film Banker Bilo, an ancient Greenshake, I will take the Maho peasants to Germany, saying that after traveling in the truck box for days, if they left Istanbul in a mountain pitch, the rapists of the land they follow, I say, will take you to power and leave you to the edge of the abyss."
This is their matter, but the only thing we want from these refugees is that they are the new ones where they go.
Kjaer signed for Sevilla
Kjaer signed an official contract for 12.5 million euros from the yellow-laciverted team to Sevilla, which became the most expensive defensive transfer of the Spanish team in history.
The Danish star will be wearing the No. 4 uniform in Sevilla.
It is easy for babies.
According to a statement from THY Press Release, the national airline, which keeps its passengers’ flight comfort and satisfaction at the forefront and works to make them feel more comfortable during the flight, continues to develop new ideas for a perfect travel experience.
In this direction, the "baby travel kit", prepared by studying the needs of babies and their families aged 0-2 years old, began to be available to babies travelling on intercontinental flights from August.
Within the kit prepared with a specially designed bag; a replacement cover, a single-use breast cover, piss cream, baby lotion and shampoo, newborn wet cotton diaper and breast pad is included.
Products that do not contain parabens, alcohol, paints and harmful chemicals were produced taking into account the sensitivity of the baby’s skin.
Washington Changes Green Card Rules
According to the media, President Donald Trump has said there will be a new U.S. immigration plan that changes the Green Card rules.
It envisages reducing legal immigrants by 50,000 a year, stricter rules for temporary work permits and restrictions on family visas.
The new rules were proposed by the Republicans and also supported by the president.
The draft law will be debated in both sides of Congress.
“This law will reduce poverty, raise wages, and save billions of dollars for taxpayers, and it will do so by changing the way the U.S. gives green cards to citizens of other countries.
The law will reduce the chain of migration and replace the current regime.
This new application process will benefit English-speaking candidates, those with self-sufficient financial resources and the skills that will benefit our economy,” Trump said.
The Fenerbahçe-Sturm Graz match
I have found the excitement and glory that I did not see for two seasons, and the glory that I did not see again was found by the woman.
A "mangal-hearted" team brought out by Aykut Kocaman in absences was on the pitch to make a deal with his supporters "stay behind us".
We can criticize the game, positions, or performances, but I haven’t seen a game that has worked and sought so much for a long time.
He determined in the first match, but yesterday his apolletics were on his own shoulder; Fenerbahce’s commander on the pitch is now Valbuena.
When transferred, it was an age problem, but Bigaman’s words contained the phrase “untouchable character.”
Thirty years ago, we gave the name of the atomic ants to Rıza Chalimbay.
If he does, it will be the most suitable comment for the French player.
He was everywhere on the pitch, participated in all the pas organizations, always took responsibility and scored a huge short show.
Alper's lead-play, staying in the second forvet position, left Sturm Graz's team "limited" on the pitch for a long time.
Fenerbahçe continuously sought a formula to overcome such a tough wall while winning the circuit without throwing a corner.
They dominate the ball but do not produce an effective pass in the competing penalty field.
This image can bring an explanation of "santrfor need", but we face a game that hesitates to throw a blow to Ahmethan, which is not able to put the sole center of his hands in position.
Either the team didn’t trust the young player or his performance needed to improve a bit.
After 1-1 they didn’t take advantage of the two net chances.
It was important for them to pass the round, but lifting up this side that applauded the struggle of the players to stand up as a "gol" would make the night even more beautiful.
There will probably be another 1-2 transfers by Monday.
But the truth is that Fenerbahçe’s biggest need is number 12.
We are on the verge of a very bright and enjoyable season with this style of play that carries the hearts of those who are trying to play in the front.
Aykut’s machine grows big, it needs a little more time.
They are in good physical condition.
The quality of the game will also improve.
You can see that the self-confidence of all the players on the pitch has increased.
They need a lot of applause last night for a new page.
The rise of sex robots is real and we should be worried
Just as you think 2017 is not even more strange, a new report on technological developments in the sex robot industry is coming out.
and yes.
Sex robots are a big thing right now.
Recently, the Responsible Robot Science Agency (FRR) released a report looking at the development of sex robots over the next five to 10 years.
According to Noel Sharkey, a retired professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and one of the founders of FRR, we should take their rise seriously.
Customers can choose the robot's eye color, breast tip shape and nail type.
Mr. Sharkey said about the release of the new report: “People are laughing at them, but companies are actually sending a lot and we’ll see more of them.”
Modern sex babies have evolved into robots, with silicone skin that is hot to touch from swollen like, with specifically human-like reactions carried out by artificial intelligence.
Users can also customize their robots to suit their own needs by choosing everything from the robot’s eye color, breast tip shape and nail type or color.
But with too many robots having “personalities” to innovate a Stepford Woman, this gets even more annoying.
Modern sex babies have evolved into silicone leather robots.
For example, the RealBotix robot allows users to personalize their own robots according to the character features they find attractive (e.g. fearfulness).
Then there are Roxxxy Gold sex robots, which come with pre-programmed personalities, developed by True Companion, giving the impression of cowardice"Frijit Farrah" and "Wild Wendy" with the personality of the "commercial".
True Companion’s website says: “Roxxxy Gold has a personality that fits your personality as much as possible.”
So what you love, you love it, and what you don’t like, you don’t like it.
They also have mood during the day like the same real people.
He may be sleepy, willing to talk, or “in full mode.”
There are many annoying aspects of the rise of sex robots: not only are the real human relationships replaced, but the overly obedient female personality traits, the violent calls as they approach Frijit Farah are the most thought-provoking.
On its website, True Companion resembles Roxxxy as a vibrator but the one for men.
“If a woman can have a vibrator, why not a Roxxxy for men?”
However, these sex robots are not just fetish or sex toys.
Their emergence and increasing complexity point to something darker and deeper within our culture, a retreat toward sex desire by subjugating it from the ideal of gender equality, an optional add-on.
Many men will not naturally own sex robots, and while FRRs are paying attention to their growing popularity, they are now part of the outer circles of consumer culture.
But those who are drawn from the ends can be highly instructive about the course of the time we are living in.
Many people are not strange or aggressive until the free market gives them the right to be.
It’s no coincidence that these sophisticated sex robots, with a president in the White House who boasts of sexually assaulting women, appear at a time when women’s rights are threatened worldwide.
The most frightening part of The Handmaid's Tale TV series is the depictions that show all the details, not the scientist bodies or the carved eyes, but how realistic the image feels.
The Gilead Republic is a sudden change, but it doesn’t feel like it has changed so much at the moment.
The goal behind these sex robots is to create as much physical resemblance as possible to real women (in proportions of porn movie stars, of course).
Their creators want them to feel human when they are touched and to mimic the movements of a real body.
But when it comes to their “personalities,” robots can’t clearly represent real women.
They cannot leave their husbands or leave them.
They have no activities or past stories, nothing that will reveal their independence or disrupt the total fantasy of slavery.
In other words, they are slaves who enjoy.
Or with the character of the year 2017: Carriers.
Attack on U.S. military convoy: dead and wounded
The suicide attack in Kabul’s capital Karabakh district targeted foreign military forces operating in the country.
One NATO soldier and three civilians were killed in the explosion, five were American soldiers in the convoy and one was an interpreter working with NATO forces.
In an official statement issued by NATO's Resolute Support in Afghanistan, NATO forces said the suicide bomber had infiltrated a home-made explosive during a joint operation with the Afghan National Army.
The wounded personnel were treated at the U.S. Military Hospital at Bagram Airport.
The injured are not in danger.
Local media that the suicide bomber was a Taliban member.
The great Trump?
Mitt Romney is a common sense man.
The micro-scale division of families by the political division that polarized U.S. voters became the reality of the Trump era.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, newspapers in the U.S. were full of how to deal with the nightmare of relatives who voted for Trump.
We all struggle to blow up our own filter bubbles.
Less discussed is Trump’s power to bring families together.
I am referring to this because my cousin, a leftist poet who lives in Chicago and is inter-republican in our family, is visiting us in New York this week.
He reminded me that uniting against a common enemy could have a powerful effect.
Everyone he knows, including his Republican brother, whom Trump has been fighting about politics for decades at the White House, is suddenly and strangely on the same side.
This is, of course, a good thing at the dinner table; but it seems to me that in a broad context it carries significant risks.
The left was embodied by Trump, but the twisting effect of his presidency created a push to the right for me all.
When we talk about “normalization” and Trump, we are talking about the terrible possibility that one day his strange behavior may no longer be shocking.
There’s even a more terrifying long-term scenario in which Trump “normalizes” right-wing Republicans against his own standards, which suddenly appear to be a symbol of logic.
I find myself feeling nostalgic about the strange version of Mitt Romney’s madness these days: the dog on the roof of the car, the 14 percent income tax (but at least we knew what his tax refund looked like), both of which are really very mild crimes according to Trump.
When Trump leaves, he just needs to be wise to assess whether the next Republican candidate has achieved immeasurable progress.
While my cousin was in town, we took our kids to the equestrian in Central Park, the largest of the equestrian houses operated by the New York parks department, and the best three papers you could spend in the city if you don’t need caffeine.
The horses are enormously large, the fiberglass designs in the center cylinder (the clowns and animals all turning around to look fearfully behind their shoulders with strange faces) and the swirling music are strangely thrilling.
In other words, many clichés of a city can be disappointing: the scenery of the high buildings starts to get boring, the horizontal line begins to become familiar enough that it can’t create too much excitement, and the reality of the city doesn’t fall.
It’s been thirty-five years, and I still can’t fully overcome the day when I discovered that the Swiss Cottage was actually a large rotating crossroads in north London, not a Swiss countryside (the private bar Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is not counted).
However, horsebacking in Central Park is still a strangely magical experience, so two people at age two, one at age 11 and two women at age 40 can go here and all have a great time.
If I could write a note to the horse, I would give it a full note, but thankfully nobody asked.
On the other hand, I was asked to rate my transaction “experiment” between 1 and 5 stars before passing my credit card on a bounce this week.
The same goes for the coffee shop at the corner of my street, and the option of matching the rating with a 15% donation; for what is purchased from the counter...
This has the effect not only of slowing down what should be a neutral shopping, but also of putting pressure on the server to personalize an unnecessary event.
As the poor woman in Bonmarche stood up and cried as if she were apologizing, I, in the boredom, gave five stars to my experience of giving her a credit card.
When the temperature reached 41 degrees, they wore clothes.
In Tunceli, one of the hottest days of the season, people flowed to Munzur beaches.
From the afternoon, young people, children, old people, women and men who entered the beaches on the side of Munzur Tea, along with the careful suppression of the heat, tried to protect themselves from the heat by cooling up in ice-like waters.
Especially in countries such as Germany, the Netherlands, France and the UK, Tunisian citizens spent their holidays in their homelands instead of the Aegean or Mediterranean, the beaches on the edge of Munzur Tea were filled.
Suna Tosun, who is among the coolers on Munzur Beach, stated that he used his preference to Tunceli instead of western hills for the holiday, "I didn't want to spend my holiday in the west to cool down in family Munzur, it was better to stay in our own land."
"Munzur's water is not like ice anywhere in the world, at these temperatures Munzur keeps us cool."
Hasan Ulu, who came from Germany, said that they preferred the Munzur Tea Coast in Tunceli rather than the Chesme or Bodrum beaches and therefore did not regret it.
Oscar Pistorius taken from prison to hospital with chest pain
This is the second time that Pistorius leaves prison for a hospital visit.
Last year, she was taken to the hospital for treatment of cuts on her wrists, which she said had occurred after she fell into the prison cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after prosecutors appealed to the previous accidental killing decision.
Early on Valentine’s Day in 2013, Steenkamp was killed by shooting several times at the door of a toilet cabin in his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed he had confused his girlfriend with someone who went into the cabin at night.
Prosecutors have said they intend to challenge Pistorius’s six-year sentence once again, which they thought was too light this time.
The National Prosecution Mercii said it would appeal to the South African Supreme Court and the appeal could be reviewed this year.
If the prosecutors succeed, Pistorius will face a 15-year sentence.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
The First Hockey Chapel
Hoss candidates to go to Saudi Arabia with the organization of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs were greeted with prayers and tears at the Atatürk Airport External Lines Terminal.
The ceremony, held at the External Lines Terminal before the movement of the first hacker, was attended by citizens and relatives, as well as about 200 hacker candidates.
On the other hand, Turkish Airlines (THY) has distributed roses in the shadows to the candidates who travel to holy land on a tariff plane.
The Hague in Ankara was welcomed from Esanboğa.
In Kafile, the towns and neighbors of Gaza also took part, for the first time this year, in the use of the "unfortunate hacks for the gazis and the city neighbors" practice.
Two Bulgarians arrested in Greece for illegal camping
According to the statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and cited by bTV, two Bulgarians were arrested in Greece on the grounds of illegal camping.
A group of illegal campers, including two Bulgarians, were arrested by police in Sithonia on the morning of August 1.
They were released the same day as the investigation was still ongoing.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs told bTV that the Bulgarians were later left.
The Greek authorities have tightened their controls on free camps and are still reducing severe penalties for those who are arrested while resting in places not set for that purpose.
It will be checked throughout the season.
The minister said the court could cut the penalty.
We will not go back to the Netherlands until we find him.
Joe Hoffman, 22, traveled to Turkey with his two friends in early July.
Joey Hoffman, who travelled to Adana and Mersin with his rental car, disappeared in Silifke on July 8.
When his friends came with him, despite all the calls, could not reach Hoffman, he informed his family in the Netherlands of the situation.
While police are also taking action to find the missing tourist, his brother Robin Hoffman and his friends Angelo Durei went to Jaimy Gewald Adana.
The Iranians drove
Robin Hoffman, who appealed to the police here, spread in Adana and Mersin, pressing missing announcements to find his brother.
Robin Hoffman said he had received the latest news from his brother on July 8, saying, "We first called the police in the Netherlands."
Then we went to Turkey with two friends and called the police.
So far we have not received any news, nor have we found any clue.
“We will stay in Turkey until we find my brother.”
Congratulations on the Second World to Ceren
At the 2017 Youth World Championship in Palette Swimming held in Russia, national athlete Ayşe Ceren Yeşilbaş became the world second in 400 meters above water.
Minister of Youth and Sports Osman Aşkın Bak congratulated Ayşe Ceren Greenbas, who won the silver medal with a message he published.
On the first day of the 2017 Youth World Championship in Palette Swimming held in Russia, Ceren Yeşilbaş became the world second on 400 meters above water.
While Ceren took his place in the second place with the stunning performance he showed on the track he competed with 8 finalists, he lost the gold medal with only 27 scores.
The gold medal in 400 meters was won by Elena Lopatina from Russia in 03.18.73 minutes, while Ceren won the silver medal in 03.19.00 minutes.
Turkey is represented by eight men and eight women athletes.
His last words were, “I think I’m dying, goodbye mom.”
Among those killed in the Grenfell Tower fire in London, which has so far been to be 30, she called her mother at the moment of the fire, saying, "I don't want to die mom, it's not fair at all."
“Thank you for everything you’ve done for me, goodbye,” said Gloria Trevisan.
Among the dozens of people who were not after the fire were Gloria Trevisan, 26, who was sitting on the 23" floor of the 24-storey building, and her Italian boyfriend Marco Gottardi.
Maria Cristina Sandri, a lawyer for the Trevisan family living in northern Italy, said in a statement that according to information obtained from British authorities, the two young people had gained certainty that they also lost their lives.
The lawyer, who said the young people's families were suffering greatly, also asked journalists not to insist on explaining the matter.
I think I'm dying, goodbye mom
Lawyer Sandri said Gloria was calling her mother Emanuela Trevisan on her mobile phone shortly after the fire broke out, and she was crying when she listened to the latest conversations recorded by her mother.
Gloria Trevisan spoke to her mother several times during the two hours following the fire that started around 1 p.m. local time.
In his first talk, Trevisan said, “Mom, there’s bad things going on here, there’s a fire.”
We are stuck and cannot get out.
There’s some smoke, but don’t worry, we’re waiting to be rescued.
"We tried to get out by opening the door, but there was a lot of smoke and the elevator wasn't working," he said.
The last words of Gloria Trevisan, who was increasingly concerned about the rise of the fire, were as follows:
My whole life passes in front of my eyes.
I think I am dying.
I had a life ahead of me; it was not fair.
I don’t want to die and I want to help you financially.
I’m sorry I can’t embrace you again.
Thank you for everything you have done for me, goodbye mom.
I am going to heaven and I will help you from there.
This is the fault of the Italian government.
Both Gloria Trevisan and her boyfriend, Marco Gottardi, had moved to London in March from the northern Veneto district after having struggled to find work after graduating last year.
Gloria Trevisan, who was only able to find a job with a salary of 300 euros in her country, soon started working in London for a job with a monthly salary of £1,800 (approximately €2060).
Lawyer Sandri said Gloria Trevisan's family had financially difficult days, saying "Gloria had gone to London to help her family."
Unfortunately, our young people have to leave the country to save their future and find work.
“The government needs to find an immediate solution to this problem.”
Italy’s unemployed youth
Gloria’s father, Loris Trevisan, also expressed his anger, “This is the fault of our government forcing our young people to flee abroad to find work.”
The unemployment rate in Italy has reached 12 percent, while the rate among young people has exceeded 40 percent.
On the rise of this problem, in the last few years many young Italians have begun to emigrate to many European countries, including Britain first.
Last year alone, the number of young people forced to leave Italy due to unemployment exceeded 110 thousand.
Commentaries in the Italian press on the confirmation of the deaths of Gloria Trevisan and Marco Gottardi also stated that this was the drama of a country that was unable to provide jobs for their youth.
Red Meat, Milk Products, and Chocolate Can Ease BMI
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.
But a new study claims the opposite: A diet rich in meat-based protein and dairy products can help relieve the symptoms of those suffering from inflammatory bowel disease.
Affecting 1.3 million people in the U.S. and 300,000 in the UK, this incurable health condition causes stomach cramps and swelling, recurring or bloody snoring, weight loss and excessive fatigue.
While patients are often advised to skip meat and dairy products to ease their symptoms, researchers at the University of Washington found that the protein’s primary amino acid, tryptophan, helps develop immune cells that develop a resilient gut.
The lead researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, stated that the immune cells operate in the intestines so that the microbes stored in food do not secretly enter the body.
Cells capable of triggering inflammation are balanced with cells that promote resistance by protecting sensitive tissues without harming them.
If the balance slides too much towards inflammation, inflammatory bowel disease can result.
Experiments have found that a type of immune cell has emerged that promotes resistance in mice carrying a specific bacterium in their intestines.
And bacteria need tryptophan, one of the building blocks of the protein, to trigger the appearance of cells.
Professor Colonna said: “We’ve found a link between the development of a cell population that promotes resistance with the bacterial species Lactobacillus reuteri, which is part of the microbiome of the belly.”
Mice with more tryptophan in their diet had more of these immune cells.”
If the same thing happens in humans, he argued that a diet rich in L. reuteri and tryptophan could develop a more durable, less inflammatory gut environment.
Postdoctoral researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas, who worked on a type of immune cell that improved resistance, discovered that one group of experimental mice had such cells but that another group, which were of the same type and held in a different place, did not have them.
The difference was suspected to be related to the intestinal microbiomes of mice, in other words, to the bacterial, viral and fungal communities that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The DNA sequencing of the intestines of the mice was done, and it was found that mice with immune cells had six types of bacteria but did not have them.
Mice who lacked an intestinal microbiome because they were treated in a sterile environment and did not develop this type of immune cell were given L. reuteri and immune cells appeared.
To understand how the bacterium affects the immune system, the researchers grown L. reuteri in the fluid and then transferred it to immature immune cells taken from mice in small amounts of this non-bacterial fluid.
Immunity cells turned into cells that promote resistance.
The active ingredient turned out to be a by-product of the metabolism of tryptophan, known as indol-3-lactic acid when treated from the liquid.
The researchers found that when mice doubled the amount of tryptophan in their food, the number of cells increased by about 50 percent, but when tryptophan levels were halved, the number of cells was halved.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan stated that humans have cells that promote the same endurance as mice, and that most of us host L. reuteri in the gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether the by-products of tryptophan from L. reuteri develop as well in humans as in mice, but disturbances in the genes associated with tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
He said: “The development of these cells is something we probably want to encourage because these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestines.
“High levels of tryptophan potentially cause the spread of this population where L. reuteri is present.”
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United is signing a 'affiliation' with Nemanja Matic
After the midfielder came out on his first match against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening, Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United is signing a "deal" with Nemanja Matic.
The £40 million transfer from Chelsea started with a 2-1 win in Dublin ahead of the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid in the United’s last pre-season match on Tuesday, with Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira holding the position as they pleased to attack.
However, Matic, who was left out of Maviler’s pre-season Asia round, had a severe shortage of match condition and was able to pull out only for 45 minutes; Mourinho admitted that this needs to be improved before the Premier League season starts.
Mourinho said: “He needs time, but his experience, his intelligence, his way of thinking... he thinks about football.”
“We’ll help him get ready sooner.”
While Mourinho started shaping the top 11 for the start of the season, like Matic, his new transfermates Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku came out to play at the Aviva Stadium.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho still wanted three more transfers, but the club has already insisted that he has done "an extraordinary job" by making three of his four priority transfers.
“Thank you to the club for getting the four.”
“If they get four out of four, I’ll be happier, but they’ve done a lot for me.”
Last year, 197 people were hospitalized.
According to data from the Swedish Social Welfare Agency, in 2005, the diagnosis of gender dissatisfaction of 1 in 100,000 people increased to 8 in 100,000 in 2015.
Most of the 197 children and adolescents who were dissatisfied with the gender they were born in the past year were transferred to Astrid Lindgren Children's Hospital.
Children’s psychiatrist Lousise Frisen, who works at the same hospital, said the increase could be attributed to becoming a more open society, saying, “Openness in the psycho-sexual field, including questions about sexual identity, can be perceived as a general development in society.”
Sexual dissatisfaction disorder is not known to have any connection with sexual orientation.
Narcotic Drugs in Iceland
Teams of the Office for Combating Trafficking and Organized Crime of the paid Primary Security Department operated the 36-year-old F.T.’s home on 3 September at the Town Hall Ülker Street.
During the home search, a delicate container with 33 extacy pills was seized.
F.T. who jumped from the balcony and failed to escape was arrested.
F.T. was to be brought to court after security operations.
Transfer to New Malatyaspor
Evkur New Malatyaspor, the new team of the Super League, linked the wing player Turgut Doğan Shahin, who wore the Novemberpaşa shape last season, to his colors.
According to a statement from the yellow-black club, a two-year contract was signed with the 29-year-old wing player as part of transfer work.
In the statement, "A two-year contract has been provided with Turgut Doğan Şahin, a wing player wearing shape in November.
Good luck to our new Malatyaspor.”
British inventor puts a microchip on himself to enter his home and car with a hand-motion
A British inventor was the first person in the country to have a microchip attached to him so that he could open his front door, access his office, and even drive his car with just one hand.
Steven Northam (33) transplanted the tiny chip between the thumb and the finger, and the service is now being offered by his company through BioTeq to workplaces and individuals who want to make their lives easier with technology.
To ensure that the implant procedure could be performed at medical standards, Winchester partnered with Dr. Geoff Watson, a consultant anesthetist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Hants.
The technology is similar to microchips transplanted to cats and dogs and lasts only 30 seconds.
Mr. Northam’s company will also change locks in homes and vehicles, including £300 per lock, to be compatible with the chip.
The man, who is married and a father of children, has both his home and his BMW Z4 with this technology, and his hands are running the car while he is on the wheel.
White House Demonstration Costs Tax Offenders Thousands
According to military records revealed to TIME, the decision to blow down a marine infantry helicopter on the grasses in the south for an organization that highlighted White House’s American production last month cost taxpayers up to a figure of $24,000.
When he was in office, the green and white Sikorsky VH-3D, also known as Marine One, was the focus of interest in the organization, which presented U.S. construction programs on July 17 at the White House.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, and senior White House officials visited all 50 states of the country.
A Connecticut-made helicopter was displayed side by side with a yacht from Main, a fire truck from Wisconsin, and a forklift from Mississippi.
According to the records of the responsible unit operating the helicopter Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the White House Harp Office demanded the presence of the helicopter with a münferit order (also called FRAGO) just 36 hours before the helicopter drove to the southern grassland for the "unusual" organization.
The commander of the HMX-1 sent an e-mail to the upper Naval Aviation Commander's Deputy one day before the organization, saying, "I just wanted to make sure you are aware because this is an unusual high-visibility organization."
The message indicated that the helicopter would come to the southern lawn around 7 a.m. on July 17 for the organization at 3 p.m. and would stay there until the lawn was cleaned from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m.
The note added that if the departure from the White House was delayed, a second flight crew would be needed for the return flight due to time limitations.
While the unit’s security personnel were standing in the aircraft while the original flight crew was in the helicopter during the organization.
It is not clear from the records provided to TIME whether a second flight crew is ultimately needed.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using government funds for political purposes.
Records show that HMX-1 is investigating whether the organization violates this requirement.
The commander wrote, "One question we asked was whether it violated the Hatch Law and was to us that it did not."
“It looks like you’re mashed,” the deputy commander replied.
The “Made in America” organization is designated by the White House as an official organization and is not covered by the Hatch Act.
But even official organizations have political imams.
In the organization, the president referred to the ongoing efforts to reform health services in the Senate at the time and praised efforts to curtail government regulations.
The use of aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically advantageous purposes is not a very new event.
They need to be used to travel.
But it is unusual that these are officially requested to be used only for the opportunity to take a photo.
Trump drew attention when the presidential plane advanced behind the scenes of the first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, in February, and considering that the Twitter account was filled with messages about the use of the presidential plane.
White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said: “The White House is excited about the ‘Made in America’ exhibition, with products made from American materials by American workers from all 50 states.”
The HMX-1 crew frequently makes training flights in the Washington area and exercises on the southern grass to let the U.S. president go to the White House with a point shot.
Trump was in Germany for the G20 summit in early July, while HMX-1 conducted 58 exercises at the White House.
One official said the flight for the Made in America organization was counted as training for the air crew during that month.
The unit helicopters flew an additional 11 hours that day for "support tasks not related to the president."
The White House said taxpayers were not charged for any other numbers included in the organization.
A spokesman from Sikorksky said that their companies did not participate in the arrangement of the helicopter's exhibition on the southern grasslands.
HMX-1 does not keep budget records for presidential flights, and it is difficult to identify the exact cost incurred by the organization.
But according to the Defense Ministry’s hourly rates for the 2017 fiscal year, the Defense Ministry’s rate of meeting the VH-3D is $24,340 per flight hour.
Unit records record the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes in both directions from the Marine Corps Air Facility Quantico headquarters in Virginia.
The White House claims that the actual operating cost of the helicopter is far below that.
Walters said, “It’s very misleading for taxpayers to draw a fee based on estimates of the cost coverage ratio.”
“This ratio estimates include downward costs included in staff, maintenance and annual expenses.”
According to a 2015 RAND survey, the Defense Ministry’s reimbursement rates do not include personnel expenses but include fuel, maintenance and contract expenses.
At the time, former White House spokesman Sean Spicer advocated the use of the helicopter for the organization.
Spicer said, “We’re here to showcase what’s done in America this week.”
“And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of their contribution to our national security, and I think that the work of hundreds of people, even if not thousands, depends on it.
And I think we are all proud of the helicopters and other military equipment that many Americans, like most Americans, have worked tirelessly to do.
That is why it is good to make it clear.”
It’s unclear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter while walking the southern grasslands for the organization, but he stepped into the driver’s seat of a fire truck.
Within the White House, Trump appealed to Sikorsky’s representatives, joking about the products of the company’s fleet with the media.
“I know Sikorsky very well,” he said, “I have three of them.”

According to B.M., Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women
The head of B.M.’s mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday that elections could be representative if all segments of society, including women, play a role.
Nicholas Haysom, deputy chairman of the B.M. Aid Mission, says hundreds of women compete in provincial council elections, three women compete for vice-president positions, and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
He said in a statement on Wednesday that “the role of women cannot be exaggerated.”
Elections can be truly representative and reliable if only women participate fully and are involved in all aspects of the election process.
Afghan council and presidential elections will be held on April 5.
The Taliban threatened the election process when it became an advisory role for international military operations.
This year’s election marks the peaceful turn of power from one democratically elected government to another for the first time.
Haysom said the strong role of women would contribute to the democratic success of Afghanistan.
The Afghan Independent Election Commission says 1.2 million women registered among 3.6 million registered voters.

GMB worries about McVitie's investment in Glasgow factory
A trade union is asking the executives of biscuit maker McVitie's to guarantee a long-term commitment to production at its factory in Glasgow.
GMB Scotland said the company remained silent about the future of its investment in the Tollcross region.
More than 500 people work in the factory where Hobnobs and Rich Tea biscuits are also produced.
McVitie’s owner Pladis said they have invested more than £5 million in the region over the past few years.
He added that if there is a change in their operations, employees and trade union representatives will be "first informed".
In a letter to the company’s factory manager, GMB Scotland called on McVitie’s “to address their concerns that there is no funding available for the modernization of its production bands.”
GMB senior organizer Drew Duffy said: “It’s deeply worrying for our members to see no clarity about business needs and the investment plan for Tollcross’s future from the general manager of the thesis.
Families across generations work here and workforce is concentrated in Glasgow and its suburbs, a critical base of adequate employment in a local community with a high unemployment and social poverty.
From the perspective of jobs, wages and well-being, Brexit conditions, rising transit costs and chronic production decline urgently require a four-person production presence at Glasgow’s east end, McVitie’s.”
A spokeswoman for Pladis said: “Tollcross plant manager GMB received a letter from Scotland yesterday and the company will respond directly because we value our commitment to workers and trade union representatives.
Two months ago at Tollcross, we held a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives where several issues were clearly discussed.
We then told our employees, like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic environment, that in order to remain competitive, we constantly review our operations, which applies to all our and facilities.
He added: “In recent years, we have invested more than £5 million in the Tollcross plant, especially in production bands and operational improvements.
We fully recognize Tollcross’s legacy as a manufacturing plant, and if there are any changes to our operations at the plant, employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to know.”
Fighting and fighting for four more years
The club extended the contract of Necip Uysal and Utku Yuvakuran to four years.
In the section on the website of the Turkish Football Federation (TFF), where the data concerning the players are included, it was seen that Beşiktaş has extended the contract with the two players until 31 May 2021.
Growing up in the black-and-white team and having his first professional contract on 19 June 2008, Necip began to wear the form in the A team in the 2009-2010 season.
The player, born in 1991, who rose to the captain of the team, played a total of 254 official matches with the Beşiktaş form.
The TFF website also included information that Beşiktaş had signed a contract with him until 31 May 2021, taking the reservation of Utku Yuvakuran, whom he included in the staff as a rental last season.
The information that Utku was removed from temporary transfer status as of 1 August 2017 and his license was renewed on 2 August can be seen on the website.
Utku Yuvakuran served in more than 21 years old league matches in Beşiktaş, which he rented last season.
The young goalkeeper served in only 2 Turkish Cup matches with the black-and-white form.
Did PSG warn Barcelona 3 years ago about Neymar's departure?
The La Liga side may have regretted their interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not give up Neymar’s follow-up after offering a £189 million release item, but have they warned Barcelona about breaking the three-year-old world record?
With the Ligue 1 team ready to break the world transfer record more than twice as much as the previous amount Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United last season for £89 million, the sensational offer kicked off the summer transfer period.
With PSG’s offer of a weekly salary of £500,000 after taxes, it shows that when the transfer is completed, Neymar will be the world’s most expensive player and also the most earning professional athlete.
Although a source close to the Catalan administration has insisted that the club has always done its best to listen to him since the arrival of Santos in 2013, Barcelona is known to be angry at the style of the offer and Neymar’s attempt to leave.
So, was the football world warned by the PSG president about this scenario three years ago?
When Manchester City Blaise expressed interest in signing Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi issued a tough warning to all clubs who wanted to sign one of PSG’s top players.
Al-Khelaifi said, “I’m not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, we’ll be against them, we’ll be in contact with their players.”
“We respect all the clubs.
But if they get to sign one of our players, they’ll bear the results.”
The Spanish club Barcelona appears to have crossed this line earlier this summer by expressing interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti.
PSG has stated that it will not allow the Italian team to leave under any circumstances, and Barcelona also feels deeply about losing Neymar of his greatest values.
The penalty for blocking the reading of the room was broken
The accused, who are alleged to have tried to walk and hinder Ezan and Sela reading the Küçükçekmece Gültepe Camisi Imam Mustafa Baki, Kenan Gülşen and Nait Yılmaz "do not help the organization knowingly and willingly while not being a member", "do not resist to do the job" and "harassment" crimes in Istanbul 22.
He was convicted by a severe criminal court.
The court ruled that the defendants should give up the victim’s complaint for the crime of “insulting the public officer due to his duty” and take into account the manner in which the crime was committed, the court order that it should be fined with a fine of 7 thousand liras, and the accused Yılmaz was sentenced to one year in prison for the crime of “resistance to not commit the crime”, taking into account the importance of the crime in terms of the public and the future of Turkey in terms of the date and time of the crime.
The court decided to convert the prison sentence given to Yılmaz to a fine of £6,000.
Following the sentencing of two defendants, the lawyers of the defendants filed an appeal.
Court of Appeal of the District of Istanbul to examine the file.
He came to the prison.
The court, which completed its examinations, decided on the substantial rejection of the appeal application on the grounds that the punishment given for the crime of "harassment" against the accused Kenan Gülsen was applied in the legal context, the act was correctly qualified and conformed to the type of crime provided for in the law, and found the punishment given to the accused appropriate.
By the Heavy Criminal Court, when the accused Nait Yılmaz read and met the imam Mustafa Baki who came out of the mosque, "You are throwing the people on the streets, neither the people, nor the people."
The President is taken.
He stated that his act in the form of attempting to walk and strike on it, saying "this work has ended," caused the victim imam to read in certain intervals, and that the "resistance to not perform the task" was committed by accepting that he could not read the scripture.
Despite the indication of the reasons by the local court, the court stated that the act occurred at the time when the victim ended his duty of reading and informing the people in front of the mosque, noted that in the concrete incident, the victim did not have a duty that the victim began or continued to perform, that the crime of attempting to injure the victim due to the public duty performed by the victim was created or not, and that the accused was justified with insufficient reasons, without being explained and demonstrated in such a way as to enable the supervision of how the accused man achieved the acceptance that the victim attempted to prevent the tasks that the victim would subsequently perform.
It was not disputed that the accused was unconscious, that there was no tangible financial damage to the victim due to the crimes imposed on the accused, that the spiritual damage did not constitute an obstacle to the application of the explanation of the verdict and that it would not be applied against the victim's abandonment of the complaint.
The court, which saw the objection claims of the lawyer of the accused Nait Yılmaz with these reasons in place, decided definitively to corrupt the judgment given on the accused, to return the file to the court of first instance.
Six Americans on Interpol's Live Bomb List
The German newspaper Die Welt that Interpol (International Police Organization) in May sent a list of 173 people with the potential to commit suicide attacks on behalf of the terrorist organization ISIS to security agencies in European countries.
The list includes 132 people from Iraq, North Africa, the Gulf countries, Tajikistan and Bangladesh.
Six of the people on the list are European citizens.
These people are said to come from Germany, Belgium, France, the Netherlands and Bosnia.
The suspect is a 27-year-old German citizen from Solingen, North Rhine-Westphalia.
It was that the man first went to Egypt in the autumn of 2012, then to Turkey, and finally to Syria.
In a statement from ISIS’ social media accounts in mid-July, it was recorded that the man was to have died in Rakka.
The German security agency did not respond to the newspaper's questions on the matter.
The names on Interpol's list have been claimed to have been seized during operations against ISIL in Mosul.
According to Die Welt, the U.S. intelligence services sent the list to Interpol to examine it.
Interpol also that the list was transmitted to police offices in Europe in May.
Die Welt said in a report based on German security circles that ISIS may be trying to send some of the names on this list to Europe to organize suicide attacks.
Soldier's farewell to pumped rifle horror: 5-year-old Starsu may lose his eye
There was bloodshed in the youths of the soldiers.
A crowd of people gathered in the park in the Karadolap neighborhood to say goodbye to their friends who went to the military the previous night.
According to allegations, M.K. and O.A. in the group occasionally opened fire on the air with pumped rifles.
After the attack, the group began to disperse.
M.K. shot a hand to the ground with a pumped rifle as he passed by the side of a playground full of children.
Five children were injured in the shooting at the park.
This was reflected in the park’s security cameras.
The injured were transported to the surrounding hospitals with Ferhat Turan, Ercan Turan, Kader Balkır, Yıldızsu Unus, Pearl Stone ambulances.
Five-year-old Star Su Unus, one of the wounded in hospital, faced the risk of losing his left eye.
The star’s grandmother, Mary Stone, told DHA about those moments.
Stone, who said the incident occurred while his grandson was in his arms, said: “The soldier’s celebration began at 8 p.m.”
It took two hours.
The fun of the soldiers is over.
The young people began to disperse.
We would have gotten up when it was over.
The gun exploded right in front of me.
My grandson is not well.
You have an 80-90% chance of losing your eyes.
I talked to the doctor, he said.
He pulled one out of the assholes and the other in his eyes.
“He said he’s undergone one surgery, maybe he’ll have 10 surgeries.”
The suspect M.K. and O.A. were arrested by the officers of the Assembly Office of the EIUB First Security Directorate.
Two people were arrested after police interrogation.
