Not only does it confirm that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, but a theory has gained traction, but it is not possible to give details from the fossils, such as color and three-dimensional patterns.
Scientists said the animal's upper feathers were brown and the inside pale or carotenoid.
The discovery also sheds light on the evolution of bird feathers.
Because dinosaurs did not have well-structured feathers called rachis, but had another feature of feathers - spines and fine spines - researchers suggest that rachis is most likely one of the features that evolved later.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight but rather for temperature control or display. The researchers suggested that, although this was the tail of a younger dinosaur, the specimen showed the adult feather and not the lower part of the younger one.

In partnership with NPWS and Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) INC, qualified volunteers were recruited to the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting programme.
According to NPWS's park conservation director and veteran Mick O'Flynn, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received much more security and training.
Martelli was sworn in yesterday as a new member of the nine-member Temporary Electoral Council (CEP).
This is Martli's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the former CEP as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission is Martelli's response to mass protests against the authorities that began in October.
The occasional violent protests were exacerbated by the failure to hold elections that have been stalled since 2011.
There have been about 60 reported cases of faulty iPods overheating, resulting in a total of six fires and four minor burns.

Out of 1,400 people who voted before the 2010 federal election, the number who opposed Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8 per cent since 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed that she believed that Australia would become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of those polled agreed that they wanted Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
At the end of the poll, 29 percent of those polled believed Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believed Australia could never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was due to compete in the 100m and 200m freestyle and triple relay at the Commonwealth Games but has expressed doubts about her fitness and ability as she has been citing her physical problems.
He was unable to take the medication needed to relieve his pain due to his suspension from the sport.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number ever discovered on January 25.
In early February, a large number of people tested the invention using various hardware and software, and it was announced on Tuesday.
The comet is likely to be a source of water supply on Earth as well as a source of organic matter that could help build proteins and sustain life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets formed, especially how the Earth formed, since comets collided with the Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor earlier this year and signed a proposed bill to legalize same-sex marriage last month.
He called the rumors "political nonsense and nonsense".
He is expected to run for the 2016 presidential election.
The FAA claims that NextGen is a medium that helps aircraft fly on shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel and carbon emissions each year.
It uses satellite-based technology instead of the older ground-based radar technology to help air traffic controllers more accurately locate the aircraft and send more accurate information to pilots.
There is no extra transport running in Wembley and overground trains will not stop, and there are no facilities for parking and driving on the street.
Fears of lack of transportation have created the possibility that the game will be forced to be played behind closed doors without the team's supporters.
A paper published Thursday in the journal Science Reports on the formation of a new species of bird in the Ecuadorian Galopego Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in only two generations, although the process is thought to have taken longer due to breeding between the Darwin finch, Jesopizza fortress, and the finch of the migratory cactus, Geopizza conyrostris.
And thou shalt make of gold all manner of work, and shalt make of it small engravings, and shalt make of it small engravings.
It can be drawn on thin wire, which can be twisted and braided. It can be beaten or rolled into sheets.
It was so thin that it could be glued to another metal. It was so flexible that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on whether it is acidic or alkaline (alkaline) chemical.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen (H in pH) ions present in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are a type of proton that has had its electrons removed from it (hydrogen atoms have a proton and an electron).
Twist two dry powders together and then, with clean wet hands, press into a ball.
Your hand moisture will react with the outer layer, which will feel strange and it will cause a kind of peeling.
Almost every house in the towns of Harappa and Mahengo-Daro had a flush toilet connected to a state-of-the-art sewage system.
Ruins of sewage systems have been found in homes in the Minoan towns of Crete and Santorini, Greece.
Toilets were also found in places such as ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes located in a part of a human bathroom where men and women used to share.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
The satellite received the call in space and then returned it.
The satellite was launched by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere changes some of our light and view.
It takes a giant rocket 100 feet high to put a satellite or telescope in space.
The wheel has changed the world in an unprecedented way, and the most important thing it has done for us is to make it easier and faster to transport.
It has brought us trains, cars and many other modes of transportation.
Under them are more medium-sized cats that prey on medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to blackbirds and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (lost pet cats) that prey on many small prey such as insects, rats, ticks and birds.
The secret to their success is a sense of place, a special function that keeps each cat from competing with the others.
The lion is the most social of cats, living in large groups called pride.
Prides consist of one to three adult males plus thirty females and young.
As a large family of sisters and daughters, women are usually closely related to each other.
The prideful behavior of lions is very much like that of a pack of wolves or dogs, animals that behave in a surprisingly similar way to lions (but not other big cats), and are extremely lethal to their prey.
A perfect athlete can climb a tiger (though not well), swim, jump far and pull five times faster than a strong man.
The tiger is a panther, as are the lion, leopard, and jaguar.
The tiger's roar is not like a full-throated lion's roar, but rather a phrase made of roaring and screaming sounds.
Ocelots prefer small animals, and they will catch monkeys, snakes, rats, and birds, almost all of which are smaller than the ones they prey on.
Scientists believe that oselots follow and feed by smell, where they find animals by scent as they walk on the ground.
With their keen night vision and stealthy movements, the ocelots blend into their environment and jump on prey.
When a small organism (a small population) becomes separated from its main population (as when it moves over a mountain range or river, or it moves to a new island from which it can not easily return) it often finds itself in a different environment than before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so they need different characteristics or adaptations than before to be more powerful competitors.
The actual population has not changed at all, they still need the same adaptation as before.
Over time, as new populations begin to adapt to their new environment, they begin to lose their affinity for other populations.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they can no longer be considered the same species.
We call this process speciation, which usually refers to the formation of new species.
Plants produce oxygen that humans take in with their breathing and they take in carbon dioxide that humans expel with their breathing (which they expel).
Plants make their food by photosynthesizing sunlight, and they also provide shade.
We make our homes and our clothes from trees. Most of our food is plant. Without plants, animals could not live.
Mosasaurus was the top hunter of his time, he feared nothing but other Mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were distinguished by sharp teeth of over seventy, with an extra set at the top of the mouthpiece, meaning that it was no match for anything that fell in its path.
We don't know for sure, but it may have been from its conical tongue. Its diet included turtles, giant fish, other mosasaurs and it may even have been an anthrax.
It would attack anything that entered the water; even a monstrous dinosaur like the T-Rex had no resemblance to it.
Although most of their food is familiar to us, the Romans also ate strange or unusual foods, including wild boar, moose, snails, and a type of rat called dermos, as part of their diet.
Another difference was that while the poor people and women sat in chairs and ate their meals, the rich people preferred to sit together and eat loudly.
The next century, the ancient Roman diet could not contain any food that came to Europe from the Americas or Asia.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes or cocoa fruit, and no ancient Roman ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a temple for each of their gods, which they considered to be the home of their respective gods.
People brought sacrifices to the gods and priests tried to pay attention to the needs of the gods through rituals and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and a sanctuary inside that only the priests could enter.
Sometimes, special pyramid-shaped pillars were built as part of the temple, called jigurats.
The pillar was the seat of the gods.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not particularly important.
The Hebrew family spent most of their lives outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyards; stores looked like street-facing counters.
There were no large forests in Canaan, so timber was very expensive.
Greenland was settled by chance. According to Norse mythology, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and as he moved further west, he discovered Greenland and named the land Greenland.
But even before his discovery, Eskimos were already living there.
Although each country was 'Scandinavian', there were many differences between Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland in terms of people, kings, customs and history.
If you've seen the National Treasure movie, you might think that the treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Even though, this is not true. Even though there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
""The original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776"" whose words were written on the back of the Declaration of Independence. The text is displayed below the reverse of the document.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that the large leather paper document (measuring 29 by four inches by 24 and a half inches) was folded to the side of the horse to preserve it.
So, the mark was probably added as a label.
The D-Day landings and the ensuing war led to the liberation of northern France, but the southern France was not yet independent.
"It was ruled by the Vichy French, the French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting".
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France in what became known as Operation Dragon.
American and Free French forces were liberating southern France and advancing on Germany in just two weeks.
A civilization is a single culture that consists of a significantly large population, who live in a society of mutual cooperation and action.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, related to Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and it also describes the shape of society in some way.
A civilized culture is something that carries knowledge through many generations, a lasting cultural imprint and fair distribution.
It is often seen that the culture of small tribes or peoples loses its relevance in history due to lack of proper documentation and thus is not recognized as a so-called civilization.
During the Revolutionary War, under the Articles of Confederation, the Thirteen States initially formed a weak central government - with Congress as its sole component.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, as there was no national executive or judicial committee at the time. Congress relied on the state governments to impose and enforce taxes.
The states have no authority to impose taxes and duties.
The consent of all states was required before amendment of the articles and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italy national football team is the second most successful team in the world, jointly with the German national football team, and it became FIFA World Cup champion in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the Nordic countries due to the participation of Italians in the Olympics and various international competitions.
Japan consists of about 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu) making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
"Due to the Japanese archipelago, Japan is often referred to as an "island" in geographical terms".
The island was first discovered in the 15th century by European sailors who named it Ilha Formosa, or the Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in the southwest area of Taiwan to transform an indigenous way of producing goods and to employ Chinese workers in their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) army captured the western and northern coastal regions of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, thereby ceding Taiwan's sovereignty to Japan, who ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures called Intihuana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Three Window House.
Most of the buildings on the edge of the complex have been renovated to give tourists a better idea of what it was like.
By 1976 about thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and restoration work is still ongoing.
For example, the standard size of most still-image photography in the world is 35 mm, which was the most dominant size of film in the late analog film era.
It is still being made, but even more important is its proportions which have inherited digital camera image sensor formats.
The 35mm format is actually a bit confusing, 24mm being 36mm.
Therefore, the approximate ratio of this format (divided by 12 to give the mathematical ratio of simple integers) is assumed to be 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g., APS family formats) are equal to or close to aspect ratio.
The highly offensive and almost ridiculous Rule of Thirds is a simple guideline that controls the order of motion in a picture.
It states that the most effective location for the main subject is the division of lines that divide the image into three sections along the vertical and horizontal (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Churches that became rich and powerful came under investigation.
For thousands of years, Christianity held European nations together despite differences in language and customs.
Its all-pervasive power influenced everyone from kings to commoners.
One of the main Christian doctrines is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and the church's financial funds are for that purpose.
The central authority of the Church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and many questions were raised as to whether it was being trusted for this abundance of power and money.
Soon after the outbreak of war, Britain imposed a naval blockade on Germany.
The strategy of separating important military and civilian assets has been successful, although the blockade violates generally accepted international norms imposed by various international treaties over the past two centuries.
Britain has dug up international reservoirs to prevent any vessel from entering the entire sea, which also poses a danger to neutral vessels.
As the tactic had a limited response, Germany expected a similar response to its unmanned submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the population of most countries was mainly pacifist and separatist.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, all nations wanted to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to work for the Edison Company in New York City.
He came to Thomas Edison in America with only 4 cents, a book of poetry and a recommendation letter from Charles Bacheller (his previous job manager).
Ancient China had a unique way of showing different periods; each stage of China or ruling family was a separate dynasty.
There was also a period of unrest in the provinces divided between each dynasty. The best known of this period was the three-phase reign between the Han and Jin dynasties, which lasted for 60 years.
During this period, there were fierce battles between many nobles in the struggle for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China. Thousands of people died fighting to occupy the highest seats in the palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political influences such as the use of the metric system, the transition from authoritarianism to republicanism, nationalism and the fact that the republic is not the sole ruler of the country.
At the same time, post-revolution career opportunities were opened up to all male applicants, so that the most ambitious and successful could succeed.
The same is applicable for the army as the army rankings are now based on caliber instead of class.
The French Revolution inspired many oppressed working people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
"Muhammad was deeply interested in matters outside this mundane life. For meditation he sometimes used a cave known as the "diamond" of the "Noor" (Light) mountain".
He himself built the cave, which survived for many years, providing a vivid reflection of Muhammad's spiritual tendencies.
Resting on a hilltop north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, even if it exists, it's not easy to find.
Nothing is seen except the clear, beautiful sky above and the many surrounding mountains.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is one of the only seven wonders of the world still standing today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramid structures built in honor of the Pharaoh.
"The Giza Valley, or ""Giza Necropolis"" in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, contains several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), several smaller tombs, several temples, and a huge sphinx".
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu. Many smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The "up" is like a V and the "down" is like a staple or square without the bottom.
Up means you should start at the edge and push the bow, and down means you should start at the frog (where you hold the bow in your hand) and pull the bow.
A bow usually produces a softer sound, while a down-bow is stronger and more emphatic.
Feel free to use pencils on your own markings, but remember that Boeing's printed markings are for musical instruments, so they should generally be respected.
The future King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette and their two young children (Marie-Th√©r√®se, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged 4) and the King's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles on 6 October 1789 by a group of vending ladies.
They were driving back to Paris in a car amidst an excited crowd shouting threats against the king and queen.
The enthusiastic crowd forced the King and Queen to leave their car windows open.
One of the once excited crowd shook the head of the bodyguard killed in Versailles in front of the panicked queen.
The war costs of US imperialism as a victory for the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the US colonial government to create confusion about a large portion of the spending and bond interest on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the extra profits from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people will form the basis of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must first understand the context in which they were formed.
The period in which the events occurred is generally referred to as the High Middle Ages in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (AD 10001300) of European history.
The Early Middle Ages preceded and followed the High Middle Ages, which ended with the Convention around 1500 AD.
Technological determinism is a term that can mean a broad, technological push or a rigid notion that holds that human destiny is governed by an inherent scientific law and its technological application.
"Most technological determinants have two general explanations: that technological development itself follows a path beyond primarily cultural or political influences, and that technology results in ""influences"" on underlying societies rather than social conditions".
For example, one might say that motor cars are necessarily driven to develop roads.
At least, a nationwide road network is not economically feasible for a handful of cars, so new production methods have been developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The increasing number of people owning cars increases the likelihood of road accidents, which has led to new innovations in the medical system to treat injured people.
A major factor in determining the direction of culture was the romanticism of writers like Schlegel, Goethe, Fishtad.
In the context of romance, the geographic environment of a person creates customs and cultures associated with that area over time, to match that place in society, rather than arbitrarily imposing laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a center of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until around 1100 AD.
Its position declined during the 12th century, largely when crusaders brought with them gift items such as silk and spices that were more valuable than the Byzantine market value.
From this time on, the title of fashion capital was moved from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style peaked between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
Early clothing was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
However, due to the slowdown of communication channels, customs in the West may be 25 to 30 years behind.
In the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop their own identity. One of the biggest developments of the time was the use of buttons to strengthen clothing by the people as a result of the Crusades.
Subsistence agriculture is a form of agriculture that produces only enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Farming that meets the needs of the farmers themselves is simple and often organic. For maximum yields, people in areas with uniform heat, humidity and solar radiation and uniform geographical features replace the crops with surviving seeds or cultivate in another common method.
In the past, most farmers were involved in agriculture for a living and this trend continues in many developing countries.
The subculture brings together like-minded individuals who feel neglected by the standards of social justice and helps them to develop their identity.
Subcultures may be distinct because of the age, race, class, location and/or gender of members.
The qualities that define a subculture as distinct and distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of different factors.
Members of subcultures often signal their membership through distinctive and symbolic use of styles, including fashion, genre, and dialect.
Some common ways of portraying the importance of socialization are to create unfortunate situations for children as they grow up, such as neglect, unwanted behavior and deliberate abuse, which prevent them from mingling with adults.
Some "feral" children are usually held captive (by their own parents); in some cases these children are abandoned due to parental rejection of the child's severe intellectual or physical disabilities.
Inexperienced children may have endured a lot of abuse or trauma before they fled or were abandoned.
Others are allegedly raised by animals; some are known to live in the wild by their own will.
When raised by animals that are not fully human, the feral child often exhibits fully cared for animal-like behaviors (within physical limits) such as its fear or dislike of humans.
Project-based learning approaches make learning easier and more interesting, going one step further than scaffolding.
Scaffolding is not an educational method but rather a help that provides support to individuals who are gaining new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The scaffold can be raw or real, in other words, the teacher is a form of scaffold but a small paper clip man in Microsoft Office.
The virtual scaffolding is embedded in the software, which helps answer questions that are difficult for a single student to answer quickly and quickly.
From neglect, abuse to bribery, children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons.
No child should grow up in an environment that is not nurtured, cared for and cared for, but they do.
We realized that the foster care system is a safe area for children.
Our foster care system allows for safe homes, loving providers, stable education and reliable health care.
From the place where parenting used to be, it was to provide all the essentials that were lacking.
The Internet is a medium that combines elements of both mass and interpersonal knowledge.
The unique features of the Internet add an extra dimension in terms of usability and convenience.
"For example, ""education"" and ""socialization"" are suggested as one of the motivations for using the Internet (James et al., 1995). "
"When examining audience responses to websites, Imey and McCord (1998) also identified ""personal involvement"" and ""continuous relationships"" as new motivational directions".
The use of video recording has led to important innovations in the interpretation of facial expressions, which last for milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that to understand whether a person is lying, it accurately detects the subtle facial expressions.
Oliver Sachs, in his letter to the President, points out that having a brain defect can make it difficult to understand speech but also to assess sincerity correctly.
He even suggests that pets like dogs have this kind of ability to analyze human behavior.
Research in the 20th century showed that there are two aspects to genetic variation: hidden and revealed.
Mutations add new genetic variants and selection removes them from the released variants.
Separation and reconnection help bring diversity between the two pools of each generation.
In the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like humans to meet its amino acid requirements from readily available plant resources.
On top of that, failure to do so leads to a rise in serious problems like depression, malnutrition and premature death.
The most readily accessible plant resources are proteins that are accessible in leaves and bark, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest without cooking.
By comparison, animal foods (ants, ants, eggs) are not only easily digested, but also provide high amounts of protein in which all essential amino acids are found.
"All things considered, we should not be surprised if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in the same way that chimpanzees do in the savannah today".
Sleep disruption is the process of intentionally staying awake during normal sleep and falling asleep after a short time (10-60 minutes).
Using a relatively quiet alarm clock can easily wake you up without completely waking you up.
If you reset your watch in your sleep, you might be able to put it on the other side of the room, which will force you to get out of bed when you turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before bed, which forces one to get up and urinate.
A person's peace of mind is directly related to the anxiety of his body and soul.
The less worry, the more positive the presence of life force, the more the capacity to find ultimate peace and contentment is within each person.
The only thing that stands in the way of achieving enlightenment is our own anxiety and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has been expanded by the MahƒÅyƒÅna path of love and the techniques of Indian yoga.
The principles of Tibetan Buddhism are very simple. Kundalini consists of yoga, meditation and the expression of universal love.
Kundalini Shakti (consciousness energy) is awakened through yoga practice, breathing practice, chanting and vision.
The focus of Tibetan meditation is on the Divine Jayaga. Through the perception of Divine energy, the means of energy release are purified, the cycles are activated and consciousness is created.
Germany, the main enemy of World War II, played a key role in the cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. As the war ended, disagreements over systems, processes, and culture led to a dispute between the countries.
Within two years of the war's end, the old allies had become adversaries and the Cold War had begun.
It subsequently lasted for 40 years and then with mercenary armies the real fighting began in Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many more.
On September 17, 1939 the Polish defences were already broken and the only hope was to retreat and rebuild over the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were cancelled overnight when the Soviet Union's 800,000 Red Army violated the Riga Peace Treaty, invaded the eastern Polish areas and entered Belarus and Ukraine to play the war front. The Riga Treaty was the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact.
Ships are the easiest way to transport large numbers of people and goods by sea.
Traditionally, the Navy's job has been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move your people and goods while at the same time your enemy faces interference with its ability to move people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of WWII. The Americans were trying to move manpower and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy, using mainly U-boats, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies failed, Germany would probably have conquered Britain as well as the rest of Europe.
Goats are believed to have been first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes started to keep them for easy access to milk, hair, meat and skin.
Goats were usually kept in the mountains or other pastures and roamed within certain herds. Their care was usually entrusted to children or adolescents, who we know as shepherds.
In the 16th century, wagonways were invented in England.
Although the carriageways are merely a series of parallel wooden planks, they allow the horses to pull faster and to pull more weight than the more uneven roads of the day.
Crosses were introduced fairly early to hold the tracks in place. However, it was gradually realized that the tracks would be more effective if they had an iron strip on top.
It became common practice, but the iron was ground on the wooden wheels of the freight car.
The first fully iron railway was introduced in 1767.
The first means of transport was walking, and humans began walking 20 million years ago, when Homo erectus was able to stand on two legs.
Their ancestors, the Australopithecus, were not naturally upright.
The bipedal animals were characterized in the Astralopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although it is estimated that Sahelanthropus began walking on two legs seven million years ago.
We can be more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, we can even work as environmental activists to reduce future suffering to some degree.
This is a symptom-based therapy, but if we don't want a temporary solution, we need to find the root of the problem and we need to neutralize it.
It is quite clear that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological progress of mankind, and the problems have been exacerbated by overpopulation and the unpredictable lifestyle of mankind.
After it was passed by the legislature on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Speaker of the Legislature John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to the John Dunlop Press a few blocks away.
"Between 150 and 200 copies were made that night of what are now known as the "Dunlap Bradsides".
On July 8, John Nixon gave the first public reading of the document in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides are the oldest known copies of the document. The original handwritten copy is no longer extant.
Many fossilists still believe that a group of dinosaurs lived and still live today.
A lot of people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have wings and they can fly.
But there are still many things in birds that look like dinosaurs.
They have spines and claws, lay eggs, and walk on their hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus.
In fact, all computers used today rely on the manipulation of information in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have either 0 or 1 and to use computer language these numbers are referred to as binary digits or bits.
Internal toxicity may not be immediately apparent, but symptoms of vomiting are very common and cannot be immediately diagnosed.
The best indicator of internal toxicity may be the presence of an open base of medication or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label according to the specific first aid instructions for the specific poison.
The term bug is used by entomologists to identify this group of insects.
The term is derived from the ancient familiar word for bed bugs, which are insects highly adapted to being pollinated by human host germs.
Both the killer insect and the worm are observed, adapted to live in their host's home or dwelling.
There are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) across the United States, which is seen as the number one neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, including the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Studies show that women are twice as likely as men to have MS.
A couple may decide that the idea of raising a child by adoption is not their or anyone else's responsibility.
The couple can make adoption plans for their child.
When adopting, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can become the child's parents.
The main goal of science is to determine the way the world works in a scientific way. This is what guides the direction of scientific research.
Not only that, but experimentation is a method used to rule out one or more possible hypotheses, to ask questions and to observe, as well as to guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on the classical texts and especially on the Latin Bible.
Aristotle was accepted in all sciences, including psychology.
The West began to disconnect itself from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots as it rejected knowledge of Greece.
Many rhythms in physiology and behavior are present in the endogenous cycle and often depend on the biological clock to produce them.
Periodic rhythms, which are not just a response to external periodic signals, have been documented for most organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks have self-sustaining oscillators that will last for as long as free cycling without external force.
One of the first pieces of evidence that DNA is a genetic component was the Hershey and Chase experiment.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to place their own DNA into a bacterium.
They did two studies identifying the DNA of the stage with a radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the stage with a radioactive sulfur.
A gene mutation can have a variety of effects, but these effects depend on the type of gene mutation, the severity of the damage to the genetic material and the cells affected, which are germ-line cells.
Only mutations that occur in germ-line cells can be administered in the baby, elsewhere mutations can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in nature areas for enjoying the natural scenery including flora, fauna and wildlife.
Examples of local activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and walking in parks and learning about ecosystems.
In Borneo, for example, there are opportunities to visit, photograph and learn about the Orangatuang.
Every morning, workers leave small towns to drive to work and pass people who live in other people's workplaces.
In this dynamic shuttle transportation system, everyone is connected and supports a transportation system based on private cars in some way.
Science now indicates that this massive carbon-based economy has shaken the biosphere out of its stable state that was conducive to human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone lives in a society and relies on the transportation system.
In developed countries, you rarely hear such complaints about water quality or broken bridges.
Why do transportation systems raise such complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transportation engineers just incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?
The movement and interaction between two drivers and their vehicles between two points is called traffic flow.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to predict the movement of vehicles because the deceleration of drivers is never 100% known.
Fortunately, drivers tend to move within certain continuous ranges and thus transport systems can also be represented mathematically within a fairly reasonable range.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships are established between three key characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) momentum.
These links help in planning, designing and managing the road infrastructure.
Insects were the first creatures to fly through the air. Their ability to fly helps them avoid enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most moths have the advantage of folding the back of their body with their wings.
It gives them a wide range in small spaces to hide from predators.
Currently, the only insects that can't fold their wings back are the ferns and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
While some people favored his view, most people disagreed that the solar system, including the sun (and even other stars), revolved around the earth.
It seems smart, because you don't understand that the earth rotates, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river in the world. It carries 8 times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is the widest river on earth, at around six miles wide.
20 percent of the water that falls into the oceans of the rivers on the planet comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, no one could surpass the size of the Giza pyramids and their construction technological excellence.
New generations were amazed by the ancient Egyptian monuments, which were more than a thousand years old.
Vatican City has a population of about 800. It is the world's smallest independent country and the least populous.
The Vatican City uses Italian in its legal affairs and official communications.
For those who work in the state, Italian is the everyday practical language and Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
The Vatican City is Roman Catholic for all citizens.
People have been familiar with various basic chemical elements like gold, silver, copper since ancient times, as they are found in nature in their mineral form and are the main ingredient of ancient tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, proposed that everything was made up of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
It's like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, atmospheric, and plasma, although according to his theory they change into new matter to form what we see.
Synthetic metals are basically alloys of two or more metals.
Materials such as calcium and potassium are considered metals, but there are also metals such as silver and gold.
You can also have a compound metal with a small amount of non-metallic elements like carbon.
Everything in this world is made of matter, all matter is made of tiny particles called molecules.
Atoms are so incredibly small that billions of them could fit in the last period of this sentence.
That's how the pen became a close friend of man.
Sadly, as new writing methods have emerged, the pencil has fallen into disrepute and disuse.
Now people type messages on the computer screen, never needing a sharpener.
One can only wonder what the keyboard will look like when something new comes along.
Fusion bombs work on the principle that energy is needed to bind a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like pushing a heavy freight car up a mountain, and the nuclei are splitting and then releasing some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they can break apart with little or no damage.
The lunar surface is made of dust and rock. The outer surface of the moon is called the crust.
This shell is 70 km thick at the front and 100 km thick at the rear.
It is thin in Maria and thick in the highlands.
The surface is thin, so there may be more maria near the surface.
Content theories aim to find out what topics people check or what topics are appealing to them.
These theories suggest that people have specific needs and/or desires that are built into them as they age.
These theories focus on what motivates certain people to do the things they do and what things in their environment will motivate them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's demand theory of classification and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
"Generally speaking, two behaviors may emerge as managers begin to lead their former colleagues. Part of the behaviors is trying to be "one of the boys" (or girls)".
Such managers face obstacles in making unpopular decisions, disciplining measures, evaluating performance, assigning responsibilities, and ensuring people's accountability.
At the other end of the spectrum, incredibly, one becomes a person who feels that he must change everything that is being done in the team and make it his own.
After all, the team leader is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This use often leads to a rift between the leader and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams managed to maintain their quality compared to traditional teams, but there were also subtle differences.
Virtual team members often serve as the point of contact in their immediate physical branch.
They often have more individual freedom than traditional team members because their teams may meet in different time zones that may not be understood by their local management.
"The presence of a true ""invisible group"" (Larson and LaFastow, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of the unorganized group".
"The "invisible team" is the management team where each member reports. The "invisible team" sets the standards for each member. "
Why would an organization want to go through a time-consuming process to create a learning substitute? One goal for implementing organizational learning concepts is innovation.
When all functional available logistics are used across different departments of an organization, creativity and agility can flow.
As a result, when all employees of an organization work together to overcome barriers, new innovative processes are created that will meet the needs of customers.
Before an organisation can be innovative, the people in charge of the organisation must create an innovative culture and share knowledge and institutional learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuous approach as being used as a method to help organizations reach higher levels of performance.
Neurological data provides practical evidence for the theoretical approach to knowledge search. It therefore narrows the field of study and makes it more precise.
The relationship between brain structure and behavior supports scientists' research.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, trauma, injury, and tumors affect behavior and alter certain mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and explore the unseen structures and processes of our brains.
It provides us with a wealth of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes of the mind.
Although AI has a strong focus on science fiction, AI forms a very important branch of computer science that deals with the adaptation of a machine's behavior, learning and intelligence.
Research into AI includes building machines that can automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer needs and questions, as well as handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
These kinds of things have become separate disciplines that focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
Currently, the AI system is often used in economics, medicine, engineering and the military, and is also built into most home computer and video game software applications.
Often a teacher would prefer to take students to places where there is no bus travel.
Technology has a solution for every difficult area, so students can sit in their classrooms and see museum exhibits, visit aquariums or admire fine art.
Sharing details of virtually any trip is a great way to share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students at the North Carolina Barnett School design a website about their trip to the state capitol, and every year the website is redesigned, but the old version is left in the scrapbook.
Blogs can also improve students' writing. Although students often make grammar and spelling mistakes at the beginning of their blog, the presence of readers usually corrects them.
Since students are the most critical audience, the blog writer focused on improving his writing to avoid criticism.
"Blogging ""makes students more aware of the world around them. "" It influences students to be more intelligent and curious to meet the audience's interest (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a great way to learn and inspire collaborative work outside of traditional school.
Proper use of blogs can 'make learners more analytical and critical; students can explain their positions through active response to the Internet's materials in the context of others' writing, while also outlining their own perspectives on specific problems (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital city that showcases Canada's past and present through a variety of art exhibitions and museums.
Further south, Niagara Falls and farther north beyond Muscocca are the focal points of unspoiled natural beauty.
These and other things make Ontario look like pure Canadian to outsiders.
The more northerly expanses are sparsely populated and the nearby is somewhat nearly desert.
A demographic comparison that will surprise many: There are more African Americans living in the United States than there are Canadians.

Woman: Any female traveler, regardless of actual marital status, should say they are married.
It is also useful to wear the ring (not just to make it look expensive).
Women should realize that what they consider harassment can be due to cultural differences and hand-holding, etc. is not uncommon.
Be firm in rejecting men, and don't be afraid to stand up for yourself (cultural differences or not, it doesn't get justified!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was strategically used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Marinids as a port called Anfa.
It was destroyed by the Portuguese in 1755 to be abandoned after an earthquake and rebuilt as Casa Branca.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Dar El Badia, and the Spanish traders who built trading posts there named it Casablanca.
Casablanca is the least attractive place in all of Morocco to shop.
Traditional Moroccan products such as tannins, pottery, leather goods, hookahs and more are easily available around Old Medina, but they are all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist-heavy city located just east of Rwanda in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano which destroyed most of the city's roads, especially the city center.
While Goma is reasonably safe, any movement outside Goma should be investigated to understand the state of the war in North Kivu province.
The town was a base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano as well as tracking Africa's cheapest mountain gorilla.
To reach Gouma, you can use the Boda-Boda (motorcycle taxi). The average (local) price for a short tour is ~500 Congolese francs.
"Timbuktu" has been used as a jewelry in outlying, remote areas, combined with its relative remoteness.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor country, although due to its popularity it is an attractive tourist destination and also has an airport.
It was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger in 1990 due to the risks associated with desert sands.
This was one of the main obstacles when Henry Louis Gates' PBS African World Special Wonders became available.
This city is in stark contrast to other cities in the country, as the environment is more Arab than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and is bordered by Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers 19,500 square kilometers and is divided into 14 different ecosystems, each of which is home to a variety of wildlife.

Like every national park in South Africa, the park has daily reservations and an entrance fee.
One can also buy a wild card, which gives access to certain parks or any national park in South Africa.
The area of Hong Kong is named after Hong Kong Island and is considered a major tourist destination.
Buildings that touch the skyline of Hong Kong reflect the shimmering waters of Victoria Harbour like a bar chart.
For the highest view of Hong Kong, exit the peninsula and head towards the Kowloon waterfront opposite.
Much of the urban development on Hong Kong Island is concentrated on reclaimed land along the northern shore.
The place was taken over by the colonists and is a good place to start if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of the region.
Sundarbans is the world's largest coastal mangrove bracket, with a backdrop extending 80 km (50 mi) along the coast of Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
Forests are not just mangrove wetlands - they include the last remnants of the nearly extinct forest that once covered the Gangetic Plain.
The area of Sundarbans is 3,850 sq km. One third of the area is wetland.
Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966, and the area now has an estimated 400 Royal Bengal tigers and around 30,000 Chitra deer.

The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017 when Brazil's customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guaran√≠ were the most prominent indigenous group now living in eastern Paraguay as semi-nomadic hunters, who also worked agriculture for a living.
The Choco region was home to other indigenous tribal groups such as the Guaycur√∫ and Payagu√°, who made a living by hunting, gathering and fishing.
"Paraguay, born of the encounters with the Spanish conquistadors with the local indigenous groups in the 16th century, was known as the "Giant Province of the Indies".
The Spanish began a colonial period that lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunci√≥n in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain many of its indigenous features and uniqueness.
Argentina is well known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.

The official currency of the Falklands is the Falklands pound (FKP) which is equal to 1 British pound (GBP).
The only bank in the island, located across from the FIC West store, is Stanley, where money can be exchanged.
Credit cards in British Pounds and Stanleys are generally accepted anywhere on the islands, and US dollars are also fairly common.
Credit cards are probably not accepted in remote islands, although British and US currency is accepted; contact the owners in advance to find out about the correct payment method.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so change the currency before leaving the island.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa when it is cold.
Montevideo is in the tropics; during the summer months, temperatures usually exceed +30¬∞C.
Winter can be strangely cold: temperatures rarely go below freezing, but air and humidity combined feel colder than a thermometer.
There are no special rainy or dry seasons: the rainfall is about the same throughout the year.
Although all the animals in the park are used to being seen by humans, wild animals are wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park authorities, stay at least 100 yards/meter away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meter away from all other wildlife!
No matter how calm they may seem, bison, elk, moose, bears and almost any other large animal can attack.
Dozens of visitors are harmed each year by not maintaining proper distance. These animals are usually large, wild and potentially dangerous, so let them stay in their own space.
Also, be aware that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying smelly or cooked food and keep the camp clean.

If you are driving on high ground or on a dirt road, you should consider the possibility of snow, ice or cold temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, there is less friction and you cannot drive as if you were on an open pitch.
During a blizzard, you can get enough snow to get stuck in a very short time.
Visibility may also be limited by snowfall or avalanche or frozen ice on the car's windshield.
Meanwhile, in many countries, snow and ice conditions are normal, and traffic is uninterrupted all year round.
Safari is probably the biggest tourist destination in Africa and a major attraction for many visitors.
The term safari is widely used to refer to a land trip to see the fascinating African wildlife, especially the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, have a tendency to approach cars and have specific tools to help them see better.
Lions, leopards and leopards are sometimes shy and you can see them better with a telescope.

Insects spoil food, cause allergies, poison and spread infections.
Infectious diseases, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill humans by applying force, are not usually considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to buy goods in certain places without taxes and excise duties.
Travel to countries with higher taxes can sometimes save travelers a lot of money, especially on alcoholic beverages and tobacco products.
The area between Point Marion and Fairmont creates the most challenging driving conditions for frequent travel through isolated woodland on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, use discretion: steep slopes, narrow streets, and sharp curves are the norm.
The posted speed limits are significantly lower than the previous and subsequent parts - usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and strict adherence to these speed limits is crucial.
Oddly, though, mobile phone service is much stronger here than in various other parts of the route, for example: Pennsylvania Wild.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria, like their southern neighbour Austria, most are rich and varied.
Fruit pastries are common, apples are cooked in pastries all year round and cherries and plums make their appearance in the summer.
Many German baked goods contain nuts, hazelnuts and other nutty ingredients. The preferred cakes often go well with a full cup of coffee.
If you want some small but good quality pastries, try something called berliner, faffnkuchen or krapfne, depending on the region.
Curry is meat or vegetables with herbs and spices.
"Depending on the amount of liquid, a curry can be either "dry" or "juicy".
In northern India and Pakistan, yeast is commonly used in curries; whereas in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
The extensive list of Indonesian dishes across the country's 17,000 islands includes various local terms.
However, if used without extra selection, the term mainly refers to the cuisine of the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
The island is now home to the Sulve Javanese cuisine, a collection of seasonal dishes, which is a combination of peanuts, cucumber, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various spices.
The rider's legs are for his foot support which exists on both sides of the rider's gene.
They provide more balance to the climber but there is a safety concern that the climber's feet may get stuck in them.
If a horse drops its rider, while one of its legs is caught in the strap, the horse will pull them away even if they escape.
First, most riders wear riding boots that have a heel and a smooth, almost narrow, tread.
Next, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow a strap to fall from a leather jean when pulled back by a falling rider.
Cocamo Valley - Chile's main climbing site, including the Great Wall of Granite known as Yosemite in South America and the Duraro Hills.

Popular skiing in mountainous areas is to slide on snow with a ski or snowboard attached to the foot, which includes skiing and snowboarding.
"Skiing is a major travel activity for many enthusiasts, who plan to spend an entire holiday surrounded by skiing in a specific location known as "ski bumpers".
The concept of skiing is very old - cave paintings of skiing date back to about 5000 BC!
Downhill skiing as a sport has been around since at least the 17th century, and in Australia the Norwegians opened the first recreational ski club in 1861.
Backpacking by ski: This is also known as backcountry skiing, ski touring or ski hiking.
Although the methods of alpine ski touring and mountaineering are similar, they are not related to each other, the latter being done on steep terrain and requiring much harder skis and boots.
Think of a ski trail as a hiking trail.
Under the right conditions you can cover a little more distance than walking - but you won't get the speed of cross country skiing without a heavy backpack on groomed tracks.
Despite being a relatively isolated continent, Europe is home to several independent countries. Under normal circumstances, travel to different countries often requires a lot of visa applications and passport control.
The Schengen area, however, acts somewhat like a country in this respect.
As long as you are in the region, you can usually cross the country's border without going through these passport control checkpoints.
Similarly, you do not need to apply for a separate visa for each Schengen member country to have a Schengen visa, thus saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of antiquity, and some tax agencies classify items over 100 years old as antiquities.
The definition varies by geographic location, with age limits being lower in North America than in Europe.
Craft products can be called ancient, although they are younger than similar mass produced products.
Deer herding is an important livelihood among the Sami and the practices associated with this business are important for many associated with other professions.
Even traditionally, although primarily bullfighters as beasts of burden, not all Sami were involved in large-scale bullfighting, but instead made a living by fishing, hunting and similar work.
Today, many Sami people work in modern businesses. Tourism is an important source of income in the Sami region.
"Although it is widely used, especially among non-Romani, the term ""gypsy"" is often considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and misconceptions about Romani people".
If the country you are going to falls under a travel warning, your travel health insurance or your travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
You can ask the government of any other country, but their arguments are made for their citizens.
For example, Middle Eastern Americans may face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
The advisors are simply a summary of the political situation in a country.
The opinions presented are often faster, more general and more simplified than detailed information easily available elsewhere.
Extreme weather is a general term for any dangerous weather event such as damage, severe social disaster or loss of human life.
Bad weather can occur anywhere in the world and of any kind and can be geographically, topographically and atmospherically dependent.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and wildfires are forms and effects of extreme weather, such as lightning, tornadoes, tornadoes, and hurricanes.
Regional and seasonal extreme weather events include heavy snowstorms, blizzards, hailstorms and dust storms.
Travellers are strongly advised to be aware of the risk of adverse weather affecting their area as it may affect any travel plans.
Professional training should be taken before planning to travel to a country that is considered a war zone.
An internet search for 'adverse environmental courses' will probably give the address of a local organization.
A course will naturally cover all the subjects discussed here in quite a detail, usually with practical skills.
A course is usually 2-5 days and includes characterisation, plenty of first aid and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines on survival in remote areas are equally effective, but there are few publications related to war zones.
Seafarers who are planning to undergo gender reassignment surgery abroad should bring the necessary documents for their return journey.
The government's willingness to issue passports varies in cases where gender is not specified (X) or where documents are updated to match a preferred name and gender.
The willingness of foreign governments to accept these documents is actually highly variable.
In the post-September 11, 2001 era, searches at security checkpoints have become more intrusive.
Transgender people should not be expected to go through the scanners before surgery, while maintaining privacy and dignity.
A rip current is a flow returning from the beach, often a reef or similar.
Due to the underground topology, the reversible current concentrates at some depths and can form a fast current near the deep water.
