This confirms that some dinosaurs had feathers, which is a popular theory, but it also provides details like color and three-dimensional layout that you can't get from fossils.
According to scientists, the animal's fur was chestnut-colored on the top and light or carotenoid on the underside.
This discovery also sheds light on the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed trunk, called the stalk, but have other features of feathers - rays and prominences - scientists have concluded that the stalk was probably a later evolutionary stage than these other features.
The feather structure indicates that they were not used for flying but for temperature control or display, and scientists believe that this is the plumage of an adult rather than a chick, even though the tail was that of a juvenile dinosaur.
Researchers suggest that although it is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the persistence of the specimen indicates an adult rather than a chick.

The work was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations of a galaxy in the constellation Sagittarius.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the Moon affects the Earth and causes tides, the Milky Way exerts its power on the Sagittarius.
And scientists have been able to conclude that dark matter is affecting other dark matter in the same way that standard matter does.
This theory says that most of the dark matter surrounds the galaxy like a kind of halo, made up of many small particles.

She's in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but eyewitness testimony may be unreliable because her image has been widely publicized.
This is common practice in other parts of the UK, but the Scottish justice system works differently, as the courts believe that the publication of the photographs can be harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that journalists are entering dangerous territory by publishing photos of suspects, etc.
The Crown Prosecution Service, which is generally responsible for the investigation, has told reporters that any further comment is withheld at least until the indictment is filed.
According to the leak, the document will deal with the disputed borders that Palestine wants to restore to the state before the Six-Day War in 1967.
Other topics reportedly discussed include the future status of Jerusalem, a holy city for both nations, and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel has demanded a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years after the signing of the agreement, and the PA has agreed to such a presence for only five years.
The shooters participating in the additional pest control test were to be closely supervised by the foresters, as the test was monitored and subject to an evaluation of effectiveness.
The NPWS and the Australian Sport Shooting Association (NSW) have partnered to recruit qualified volunteers from the Sport Shooting Association's hunting program.
Mick O'Flynn, conservation and heritage director of NPSW Park, believes that the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received comprehensive safety and training.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday as a member of the new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission requested the dissolution of the previous Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) as part of a package of measures to speed up the country's new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
The sometimes violent protests were the result of no elections, which have been blocked in some cases since 2011.
There have been over 60 reported cases of iPods malfunctioning due to overheating, which has caused six fires and four people to suffer minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents involving the devices.
Last week, Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry said Apple had reported 34 additional heating incidents, describing them as "non-hazardous".
When Apple postponed the report, the department called the decision "very unfortunate".
The earthquake struck the Marianas at 7:19 a.m. local time (Friday at 9:19 p.m.
The Northern Mariana Islands Office of Emergency Management said the country was not affected.
In addition, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center reported that there are no tsunami warning signs.
A bus carrying tourists from Hong Kong was hijacked in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, by a former Filipino police officer who took the passengers hostage.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
So far, several hostages have been rescued and at least six are presumed dead.
The Filipino photographers and six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early.
Then the photographers took the place of an old woman who needed a toilet.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and started a career in medicine.
He trained as a midwife and in 1959 began work at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland.
While working at the hospital, Liggins used his time off to start researching premature birth.
His study showed that the introduction of the hormone would accelerate the development of the fetal lungs.
The Xinhua News Agency reported that government investigators had recovered the black boxes on Wednesday.
The wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was Extreme's first queen, and she died on a night of two moons, which was as special as she was, a strong woman".
Dustin Goldust Runnels said that Luna was as crazy as I was... or maybe even crazier... I love her and I'm gonna miss her... and I just hope she's better now.
A survey of 1,400 people was conducted before the 2010 federal election, and the percentage of people opposed to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8% compared to 2008.
Supervising Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic with the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of respondents agree with this and want Queen Elizabeth to be the last monarch of Australia.
At the extreme points of the poll, 29 percent of respondents believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and 31 percent think it should never become one.
The Olympic gold medalist was set to compete in the 100m and 200m freestyle and the triple jump at the Commonwealth Games, but because he complained about his form, doubts were raised about his expected results.
The drugs necessary to relieve the pain were prohibited by the rules of the games, so he couldn't take them.
On January 25th, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number.
By early February, several people had confirmed the discovery using different hardware and software, and it was announced on Tuesday.
It is suggested that comets may have brought water to Earth along with organic matter capable of forming proteins and sustaining life.
Scientists hope to learn about the process of planet formation, especially how it happened on Earth, where comets collided with it long ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office earlier this year and signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage last month.
He called the rumors "political babble and nonsense".
There's been speculation that he's running for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says would allow airplanes to fly shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel and reduce carbon emissions.
Using satellite technology instead of older radar technology allows air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater precision and provide more detailed information to pilots.
There will be no additional transport options, no overground trains will stop at Wembley, and furthermore car parks and park-and-ride facilities will be inaccessible in the overground area.
The potential lack of transportation made it possible for the match to take place behind closed doors without the participation of the team's fans.
Published Thursday in the journal Science, the study reports the emergence of a new species of bird on Ecuador's Galapagos Islands.
Scientists at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden announced that a new species had formed in just two generations, although it was thought that the process took much longer based on the reproduction of Darwin's finch, black darwin, cactus darwin, and grasshopper darwin.
Gold can be worked into many shapes, even the tiniest.
They can be stretched into thin threads that can be twisted and braided, and they can be spread out or rolled up into sheets.
It can be thinly ground and glued to another metal, and it can be so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted illustrations in books called illuminated manuscripts.
We call this the pH of a chemical, and the juice of the red cabbage has the ability to detect pH.
The juice of the cabbage changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical is.
The pH level is indicated by the number of hydrogen ions (letter H, abbreviated pH) present in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have no electrons (hydrogen atom is made up of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and then, with clean, wet hands, squeeze them into a ball.
The mucus on your palms will react with the outer layers, causing a strange sensation and forming a kind of shell.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, almost every home had a flush toilet connected to a modern sewer system.
In homes in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece, remains of a sewerage system have been discovered.
Toilets were also known in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, and in Roman civilization, toilets sometimes belonged to public baths, where men and women shared.
When you call someone who's thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
The call is transmitted to a satellite in space, and then it's bounced back almost immediately.
Scientists use space-based telescopes because the earth's atmosphere distorts the light and thus the image seen from the earth.
To launch a satellite or a telescope into space requires the use of a huge rocket over 100 feet high.
The wheel has changed the world in many amazing ways, but most importantly, it has made transportation much easier and faster.
Without it, there would be no railways, no automobiles, and no other means of transportation.
Below that are medium-sized cats, feeding on medium-sized prey: rabbits, antelopes, all the way down to deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including domestic cats) that eat much more of their small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success lies in the niche, the special task that each cat performs, which makes it impossible for them to compete with others.
Lions are among the most sociable of cats and live in large herds.
A pride of lions consists of one, two, or three related adult males and as many as thirty females and young.
The females are usually closely related to each other, forming one big family of sisters and daughters.
Groups of lions behave like a pack of wolves or a pack of dogs, which are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in their behavior and the deadly threat they pose to their prey.
A well-built athlete, the tiger can climb (though not very well), swim, jump for great distances, and pull five times as fast as a strong man.
The tiger, along with the lion, the leopard, and the jaguar, is a member of the genus Panthera, the only four species of mammals that can roar.
The tiger's roar is not as loud as that of a lion, but it is more like words that are tangled up and shouted.
The ocelot prefers small animals, hunting monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds whenever possible, and most of its prey is much smaller than it is.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find prey by scent.
They have excellent night vision and are stealthy, hunting their prey by blending in with their surroundings and then pouncing on their prey.
When a small group of living creatures (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it comes (e.g. when moving over a mountain range or river, or when moving to a new island without easy retreat), they are often in a different environment than before.
In this new environment, there are different resources and different competitors, so the new population will have to develop new traits or adapt in a way that it can compete effectively in its new environment.
The original population hasn't changed a bit and it's still adapting.
Over time, as a new population adapts to a new environment, they become less and less like other populations.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, these two populations will be so different from each other that it's hard to call them one species.
This process is called speciation, which simply means the creation of new species, and speciation is an inevitable result of evolution and a very important part of it.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Photosynthesis is the process by which plants use sunlight to produce nutrients, and plants provide shade.
We make our homes from plants, we make our clothes from plants, we make most of our food from plants, and without plants, animals could not survive.
The Mozazaur was the biggest predator at the time, so he was only afraid of other Mozazaurs.
With over 70 sharp teeth in its elongated jaws, and an extra jaw protruding from the mandible, the victim had little chance of being touched.
We're not entirely sure, but he may have had a forked tongue, fed on turtles, large fish, other mozzarella, may have even been a cannibal.
It didn't shy away from attacking its prey in the water, and even a dinosaur as big as a T. rex must have had a certain respect for it.
While we are familiar with most of the foods that the Romans ate, their feasts also included some exotic dishes, such as wild boar, peacocks, snails, and sushel.
Another difference was that the poor and women ate their meals sitting on stools, while the rich met at banquets, where they ate in a semi-reclining position.
Ancient Roman dishes could not have contained the ingredients that would have made their way to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they did not know about corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
In Babylon, each of the gods had a main temple dedicated to him, which was considered his home.
The sacrifices to the gods were made by humans, and the priests were to provide for the divine needs through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard behind which was an inner sanctuary, accessible only to the priests.
Sometimes, special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built and became part of temples.
A special sanctuary dedicated to the god was located on top of the tower.
The house was not particularly important in the warm climate of the Middle East.
Most of the Hebrew family's life was spent outdoors.
Women prepared food in the backyards, shops were just bricks going out into the street, and stones were used to build houses.
Since there were no large forests in Canaan, the price of timber was very high.
According to Norse sagas, Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and on his journey west, he discovered Greenland and called it Greenland.
However, without minimizing his role as an explorer, it should be noted that the Eskimo tribes were already inhabiting the area at that time.
Although each country could be described as "Scandinavian", Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland differ from one another in people, rulers, customs, and history.
If you've seen the movie "Treasure of Nations", you might think that the Declaration of Independence was a map drawn on the back of the document, with a road to the treasure.
There are some entries on the back of the document, but it's not a map to the treasure.
The words on the back of the Declaration of Independence read: "The original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776". The text is written at the bottom of the document, written upside down.
No one knows for sure who wrote it, but it is known that this large parchment document (measuring 29.75 by 24.5 inches) was originally injected for storage.
Therefore, it can be assumed that the endorsement was added as a descriptive label.
The landings in Normandy and further fighting led to the liberation of northern France, but the south remained under occupation.
The French Vichy, the people from France, who made peace with Germany in 1940, and collaborated with the aggressors instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies launched an invasion of southern France, known as Operation Dragoon.
It took only two weeks for the US and Free French forces to liberate the south of France and move towards Germany.
A civilization is one culture shared by a fairly large group of people who live and work together as a society.
The word civilization is derived from the Latin civilis, which is cognate with civitas, or city or city-state, and thus indicates the size of a community.
The city-states were the prototypes of nations, and the culture of civilization involved the transmission of knowledge across many generations, the preservation of a lasting cultural footprint, and the equitable distribution of knowledge.
The larger cultures often disappear without leaving any substantial historical evidence, so they cannot be considered true civilizations.
During the American Revolutionary War, thirteen states first established a weak central government, whose only element was Congress, based on the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, and since it had no national executive or judicial authority, it relied on state governments, which often were unwilling to cooperate in enforcing all their laws.
Furthermore, he had no authority to override the laws and rates of taxation between states.
The articles required unanimous approval by all the states before any changes could be made, and the states treated the central government with such disdain that their representatives often did not attend.
Along with Germany, Italy's national football team is ranked second in the world and won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula One.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, and Italian athletes compete in international tournaments and the Olympic Games.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making it the seventh largest island in the world.
Because of the cluster of islands it has, Japan is often called an archipelago in the geographical sense.
Taiwan's origins date back to the 15th century, when European sailors recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, meaning beautiful island.
When the Dutch East India Company established a factory in southwestern Taiwan in 1624, it began to change native grain production practices and employed Chinese to work on rice and sugar cane plantations.
In 1683, Qing dynasty (1644-1912) troops took over the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, and in 1885 they declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after losing the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, giving Taiwan to Japan, which would rule the island until 1945.
Within Machu Picchu, three main sites stand out: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
To better reflect the original appearance of the site to tourists, most of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex have been rebuilt.
By 1976, one third of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the process is still ongoing.
For example, the most commonly used format in photography is 35 mm, the most common film size in the late analog era.
It's still being made today, but more importantly, this image format has been transferred to the matrix formats in digital cameras.
The 35mm format is actually 36mm wide and 24mm high, which is quite confusing.
So the ratio of this format (we divide by twelve to get the simplest total ratio) is 3:2
Many common formats (e.g. the APS group of formats) are identical or very similar to this ratio.
The rule of thirds is often misused or ridiculed, but it's a simple guideline to help achieve the dynamic effect without disturbing the order.
He says that the ideal location for the main subject is the intersection of the lines dividing the photograph into three equal parts vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become powerful and prosperous, came under close scrutiny.
For more than a millennium, the Christian religion has provided a vital bond between European countries that differ in language and customs.
His power was so overwhelming that it affected everyone from the king to the peasant.
One of the main tenets of Christendom is that wealth should be used to help the suffering and poor and that church funds should be used for that purpose.
The central church authority has been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money raises the question of whether this doctrine is being observed.
Soon after the outbreak of hostilities Great Britain imposed a naval blockade on Germany.
This strategy effectively cut off key military and civilian supplies, even though the blockade violated generally accepted international law as enshrined in several international agreements concluded over the previous two centuries.
Britain had mined areas of international waters to block ships from entering vast swaths of the ocean, putting even neutral vessels at risk.
This tactic met with limited response, so the Germans expected a similar situation for their unforgiving underwater warfare operations.
The 1920s were characterized by pacifism and isolation of most nations and citizens.
After the terrible and cruel experiences of World War I, the nations wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to work for the Edison Company in New York.
He set foot on American soil with a nickel in his pocket, a book of poetry and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager from his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, the different periods were uniquely represented; each stage in China or each ruling family constituted a separate dynasty.
In the transitional periods of no kingship between successive dynasties, the provinces were plunged into confusion and division, the Three Kingdoms period of 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties being the most famous such period.
Many notables who claimed the throne were in fierce competition with each other during these periods.
The Three Kingdoms era was a period of great bloodshed in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying in the battle for the supreme throne in the great palace of Xi'an.
There are a lot of social and political effects, like the introduction of the metric system, the change from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the state belongs to the people, not just to a single ruler.
After the Revolution, all male candidates were given free access to the professions, allowing those who showed the greatest ambition and skill to succeed.
The same is true of the military, because the ranks of the military, which used to be based on class, are now based on the sword.
The French Revolution also inspired many oppressed working-class people in other countries to start revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond his ordinary life, and he often went to contemplate in a cave known as Hira on Mount Noor (Mountain of Light).
The cave itself, preserved, gives a very colorful insight into Muhammad's spiritual predilections.
The cave, located on a mountain top north of Mecca, is completely cut off from the rest of the world.
It is not easy to find, even if one knows of its existence, for inside the cave, the visitor is in total isolation.
You can't see anything but the clear, beautiful sky and the surrounding mountains, and from inside the cave, you can't see or hear much of the outside world.
The only one of the Seven Wonders of the World still standing today is the Great Pyramid of Giza.
The Great Pyramid, built in the third century B.C.E., is one of many large pyramids built to honor the dead pharaoh.
On the Giza Plateau (also known as the Giza Necropolis) in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, there are several pyramids (the largest of which is the pyramid of Cheops), several smaller tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Cheops, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Cheops' wives and relatives.
The symbol  uplink looks like the letter V, and the symbol  downlink looks like a spinner or a square without a bottom.
Up means you start at the tip and push the string, and down means you start at the frog (that's where your hand holds the string) and pull the string.
A downward stroke produces a softer sound, while a downward stroke produces a stronger, more definite sound.
Don't worry about drawing your own characters, but remember that the printed characters on the string are there for musical reasons, so you should generally stick to them.
The mob of angry looters forced the frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two children (Mary Theresa, 11, and Louis Charles, 4), and the king's sister, Elizabeth, to return to Paris from Versailles.
As the king and queen rode back to Paris in their carriage, they were joined by a raging mob threatening to attack.
The enraged mob forced the king and queen to open the windows of the coach.
At one point, a member of the crowd waved the head of the guard who had been killed at Versailles right in front of the terrified queen.
The war expenses of the imperialist United States for the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover most of the expenses and interest on the bonds floated on behalf of the Philippine government by Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the great profits from the continued exploitation of the Filipinos would be the primary profits of US imperialism.
The context in which the Order of the Templars was formed is essential to understanding its specificity.
These events belong to the era commonly called the Late Middle Ages, which covered the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries in European history (1000-1300 C.E.).
The Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a broad term that encompasses a wide range of ideas used in practice, including the technological impulse or technological imperative, and the strict definition of human destiny guided by the hidden logic of scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general principles: first, the process of technology development itself is not influenced by cultural or political factors, and second, technology generates effects in societies that are immanent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, we can say that the motor vehicle necessarily leads to the development of the road network.
As the national road network is not economically viable when the number of vehicles is small, new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of vehicle operation.
The mass ownership of cars also leads to an increase in road accidents and, consequently, to the invention of new ways of repairing damaged bodies in medicine.
Romanticism contained an important element of cultural determinism, which can be found in the writings of such authors as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the Romantic context, individuals were shaped by geography, and over time, geography shaped customs and culture that were so much more in keeping with the place of society that they were superior to arbitrary laws.
Just as Paris is now known as the modern fashion capital, Constantinople was once considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as a place of luxury began about 400 C.E. and lasted until about 1000 C.E.
Its status declined in the 12th century, primarily because the returning crusaders brought back such commodities as silk and spices, which were valued more highly than those offered at Byzantine fairs.
It was then that the title of the fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its zenith in the 11th and 14th centuries.
Initially, the dress was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
However, because the exchange of information was slow, Western styles may have developed with a delay of 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style, and one of the great achievements of the time, as a consequence of the Crusades, was the use of buttons to fasten clothing.
Self-sufficient farming is the practice of a farmer producing enough food to satisfy his needs and those of his family.
Self-sufficient agriculture is a simple, often organic system using self-sufficiency of seeds from the ecoregion in combination with crop rotation or other relatively easy methods of maximising yield.
In the past, most farmers were self-sufficient, and this is still the case in many developing lands.
Subcultures attract people with similar attitudes to the world, people who feel that social norms do not meet their needs, people who find a sense of identity within the subculture.
Subcultures are distinct by age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of members.
The characteristics that distinguish a subculture in its distinctiveness may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
If you're a member of a subculture, you show it through your expressive and symbolic style, which includes fashion, mannerisms and slang.
One of the most popular ways of portraying the importance of socialization is to rely on the few unfortunate cases of children who were not socialized by adults during their adolescence, whether due to neglect, misfortune or intentional exploitation.
Such children are referred to as "wild" or "disabled".Some of them were imprisoned (usually by their parents), and some were abandoned because their parents were unable to accept their child's severe mental or physical disability.
Before abandonment or escape, the feral children may have suffered from trauma or abuse.
Others are thought to have been raised by animals, and some are said to be living in the wild on their own.
If a feral child is cared for by animals only, he behaves almost exactly like them (with physical limitations), showing fear or indifference toward humans.
The project method should make learning easier and more attractive, but the scaffolding method takes it a step further.
The scaffolding method is not a learning method but rather a support provided to people who are participating in new learning experiences, e.g. using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The scaffolding can be virtual and real, meaning the teacher is a kind of scaffolding, just like Mr. Spinach in MS Office.
Virtual scaffolds are internalized in software and are designed to challenge, prompt and explain procedures that may be challenging for the student to understand on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, including neglect, abuse, and even coercion.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that does not provide them with nurturing, care and education, but unfortunately this is what happens.
We believe that the foster care system is a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system is supposed to guarantee a safe home, loving caregivers, a stable education, and good medical care.
The purpose of a foster family is to provide for any needs that were not met in the home from which they were taken.
The Internet can be used for both mass and interpersonal communication.
The specific characteristics of the Internet open up new dimensions in terms of usage and rewarding approaches.
For example, 'learning' and 'contacting with others' are proposed as valid reasons for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
The 'personal engagement' and 'lasting relationships' were also identified by Eighemeya and McCorda (1998) as new aspects of motivation when they examined the responses of recipients to websites.
Video recording has made important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial muscle movements lasting just a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it's said that you can tell if someone is lying by reading their microexpressions correctly.
In an article entitled "The President's Speech", Oliver Sacks argues that people who cannot understand speech because of brain damage are still able to correctly assess the sincerity of the speaker.
He even suggests that animals, such as domestic dogs, may have the same ability to interpret human behavior.
Scientific research during the 20th century has shown that there are two pools of genetic variation - one hidden and the other expressed.
Mutation adds a new genetic variation, while selection removes the variation from the pool of expressed genes.
With each generation, there is a mutual exchange of variability between the two pools through segregation and recombination.
Plants growing on the savannah barely allow primates with human-like digestive systems to meet their body's demand for amino acids.
Moreover, failure to do so can have serious consequences: stunting, malnutrition, and eventual death.
The most readily available plant resources would be the proteins in leaves and stalks, but for primates like us, they're hard to digest without cooking first.
Animal foods (antelopes, termites, eggs) are not, since they are easily digestible and provide high amounts of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, it should come as no surprise that our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in a similar way to how chimpanzees do it on the savanna today.
Sleep disruption is the deliberate awakening during normal sleep and re-falling asleep after 10 minutes 60 seconds.
It's not difficult if you use a relatively quiet alarm that restores consciousness, but doesn't wake you up completely.
If you happen to be moving your watch while you sleep, you can put it across the room, which will force you to get up to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based methods recommend drinking plenty of fluids before bedtime (especially water or tea, which is diuretic) so that you have to get up to urinate.
The level of inner calm is inversely proportional to the inner and physical tension of the person.
The less stress, the more positive life force, and each person has the potential to find total peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment, and the only thing that stops us is our own tension and negative attitude.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it also includes the Mahayana path of love and numerous Indian yoga techniques.
The basic idea of Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, and it's a combination of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of all-embracing love.
Kundalini yoga is the practice of awakening the kundalini energy (or enlightenment energy) through the practice of asanas, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The central theme of Tibetan meditation is the yoga of the deity, and through the visualization of the various deities, the energy channels are purified, the chakras are activated, and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
During World War II, the United States and the Soviet Union were allied against a common enemy, Germany, but after the war ended, a radical clash of systems, processes and cultures divided the two countries.
Two years had passed since the end of the war, when former allies became enemies, and the Cold War began.
It was to last for the next 40 years and encompass the real battles fought by the surrogate armies on the battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defense had been broken, the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian coast.
However, these plans quickly became obsolete when over 800,000 Soviet Red Army troops formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading eastern Poland, breaking the terms of the Russo-Russian Peace, the Polish-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Shipping is by far the most efficient way of transporting large quantities of goods and people across oceans.
The Navy's mission has always been to keep the country safe from the movement of its people and goods, while preventing the enemy from moving its people and goods.
The North Atlantic campaign of World War II was one of the most famous examples in recent history, and to help the British, the Americans attempted to hurl men and equipment across the Atlantic.
At the same time, the German navy, using submarines primarily, tried to block these passages.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would have probably succeeded in conquering Britain, as it had the rest of Europe.
The domestication of goats probably occurred in the Iranian Zagros Mountains about 10,000 years ago.
People of ancient cultures and tribes began to raise them for their milk, hair, meat, and skin.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that roamed the hills or other pastures, often guarded by shepherd-like goat herders, usually children or teenagers.
Railways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the tracks were built on parallel wooden boards, the horses could move faster and carry heavier loads than on the well-worn roads of the day.
Railroad-mounted rails appeared relatively early, but gradually it was realized that iron rails would be needed to make the tracks more efficient.
This became a common practice, but iron contributed to the increased wear of wooden wagon wheels.
The wooden ends of the wheels were replaced with iron ones, and in 1767 all-iron rails were introduced.
The first known form of human movement was walking. Man began to walk upright about two million years ago, hence the name Homo erectus.
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, were not in the habit of walking upright.
Forms of bipedalism can be found in the fossil record of Australopithecines dating back to 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although it is possible that Sahelanthropus walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living in a more environmentally friendly way, we can join the green movement, and we can even take on the role of activists to help to some extent reduce the scale of suffering in the future.
This is often a symptomatic treatment, but rather than being a temporary solution, the source of the problem must be identified and eliminated.
Clearly, the world has changed greatly because of scientific and technological advances, and overpopulation and extravagant living have added to the problems.
When the Fourth of July Declaration of Independence was adopted by Congress, its handwritten version signed by John Hancock, the President of Congress, and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to John Dunlap's printing plant a few blocks away.
Between 150 and 200 copies were printed overnight, now known as the "Dunlap broadsides".
The document was first read publicly by John Nixon in the courtyard of the Independence Hall building on July 8.
One of these was sent to George Washington on July 6th, who instructed his troops to read it on July 9th in New York, and a copy arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 Dunlap stamps that still exist are the oldest copies of the document that have survived.
Many paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived to the present day, and we call them birds.
A lot of people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
But there are still many things about birds that resemble dinosaurs.
They have scaled feet and claws, they lay eggs and they walk on two hind legs, just like the T-Rex.
In fact, almost all computers in use today rely on manipulating information encoded as a binary system.
A binary number can have a value of 0 or 1, and these kinds of numbers are referred to as binary digits or bits in computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent, but symptoms such as vomiting are so general that they are not immediately diagnosable.
The best indication of poisoning is the presence of an open package of medicines or toxic household chemicals.
Refer to the instructions on the label for first aid in this particular poisoning.
The name worm is the formal name used by entomologists for this group of insects.
The term comes from ancient times, when bedbugs were a familiar insect highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Both the larva and the house-bug are nest-builders, adapted to life in the nest or in the home of their host.
In the United States, there are about 400,000 reported cases of multiple sclerosis, making it the most common neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Studies have shown that women are twice as likely to develop multiple sclerosis as men.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interests or in the child's.
These couples can decide to prepare an adoption plan for their child.
Adoption is when the birth parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can be the parents of the child.
The ultimate goal of science is to discover the workings of the world by using the scientific method, which is the basis of most scientific research.
But it's not the only way to do it; an experiment is a test that allows you to reject one or more possible hypotheses.
The classical texts, especially the Bible in Latin, were the basis of the studies of naturalists and philosophers.
Aristotle's views have been adopted in all scientific fields, including psychology.
As knowledge of the Greek language declined, the West was cut off from its philosophical and scientific Greek roots.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend essentially on the existence of endogenous cycles and their creation by biological clocks.
Cyclic rhythms that are not just responses to external periodic stimuli have been documented for most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that last for entire cycles, even in the absence of external stimuli.
Hershey and Chase's experiment was one of the leading suggestions that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used the same bacteriophages or viruses to implant bacteria with their own DNA.
Two experiments were carried out, one involving the labelling of DNA in a flask with radioactive phosphorus, and the other the labelling of a flask protein with radioactive sulphur.
Mutations can have different effects, depending on their type, the importance of the genetic material element affected, and whether the cells affected are germ line chambers.
Only mutations in the germ line cells can be passed on to children; mutations elsewhere can lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people interested in exploring natural areas, admiring landscapes, including flora and wildlife.
Examples of activities on site include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visits to parks and ecosystems.
For example, you can go to Borneo and take pictures and gather information about orangutans.
Every morning, people leave their small towns to go to work in their cars, passing by others who are going to places they just left.
In this dynamic shuttle transport, everyone is somehow participating in and supporting the private vehicle-based transport system.
Now science shows that the vast coal economy has caused the biosphere to be displaced from its stable state, which has supported human evolution for two million years.
Everyone is a participant in the social life and uses transportation, and almost everyone complains about transportation.
In developed countries, similar complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges are rare.
Why are there so many complaints about transport systems, why are there daily malfunctions in their operation, are the engineers responsible for them, or is the problem much deeper?
Traffic fluidity is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that occur between them.
There's no way to predict the behavior of drivers with 100% certainty, so unfortunately, traffic flow testing is a challenge.
Fortunately, the behaviour of the drivers is essentially consistent; therefore, the traffic flows also show some consistency and can be approximated by mathematical calculations.
The relationships between the three key properties, namely (1) flow rate, (2) density and (3) speed, allow better visualization of traffic.
The planning, design and operation of road facilities use this type of relationship.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air, and their ability to fly allowed them to evade enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have a useful ability to fold their wings along their bodies.
This gives them a greater choice of small hiding places from predators.
Today, the only insects that do not have the ability to fold their wings are the weasels and the jellyfish.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some thought he was right, while others held the opposite view, namely, that the solar system, including the sun and other stars, revolved around the earth.
It makes sense, because the Earth doesn't seem to be moving, does it?
The Amazon is the second-longest river in the world, and it's the largest river in the world, carrying eight times as much water as the second-largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, and in some places, it's almost 6 miles wide.
The Amazon is responsible for 20% of the water from rivers that feed the world's oceans.
The Amazon is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long in its main stream and is fed by thousands of small tributaries.
Although stone pyramid construction continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, it never succeeded in surpassing the size and technical perfection of the pyramids at Giza.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom looked with wonder at the structures of their ancestors, which were then over a thousand years old.
With a population of about 800, Vatican City is the world's smallest independent state and the least populated country.
In its legislation and official communications, the Vatican uses Italian.
Most of the people working in Italy use Italian in their daily life, and Latin is often heard in religious ceremonies.
All the inhabitants of the Vatican are Roman Catholics.
The basic chemical elements, such as gold, silver and copper, have been known to man since ancient times because they are naturally occurring and can be extracted relatively easily with simple tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything was a combination of at least one of the four elements, which were earth, water, air, and fire.
It was more like the four states of matter, solid, liquid, gas and plasma, in that order, but he also theorized how they could be converted into new substances that would shape what we see.
Alloy can be defined as a mixture of two or more metals, and it's important to remember that the periodic table contains many elements.
Calcium and potassium are considered to be metals, and of course, silver and gold are also considered to be metals.
The term "alloy" is defined as any alloy containing more than 50% by weight of nickel.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly microscopic that the dot at the end of this task would contain trillions of them.
So when the pencil came out, it became a good friend of many people.
Unfortunately, with the advent of newer ways of writing, the pencil lost its status and its use.
People are writing messages now using computer screens and they don't need any templates at all.
One can only wonder what will happen to the keyboard when something new comes along.
The atomic bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to combine a nucleus with many protons and neurons.
It's like a heavy cart being pushed upwards, and the fission of the nucleus releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei that break apart with little or no friction.
The surface of the moon is covered with rock and dust, and the outer layer of the planet is called the crust.
The cover is about 70 kilometers thick on the near side and 100 kilometers on the far side.
It's thinner under the lunar seas and thicker under the highlands.
There may be more areas of maria on the visible side, because the shell is less thick here and the lava was easier to penetrate to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what people respond to and what appeals to them.
Theories assume that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been acquired in the process of coming of age.
These theories are about what makes some people want to do what they do and what in their environment makes them do certain things and not do others.
Two popular theories of content are Maslov's pyramid of needs and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, when managers start to lead their former colleagues, there are two types of behaviour that can occur.
This type of manager is reluctant to make unpopular decisions, avoids disciplinary action, and avoids evaluating performance, assigning tasks, and billing people for work done.
The other extreme is that you're transformed beyond recognition into someone who feels that you have to change everything that the team has done, subordinate it to your own vision.
After all, it's the leader who is ultimately responsible for the successes and failures of the team.
This often results in friction between the leaders and the rest of the team.
In the case of virtual teams, the same standards of excellence apply, but there are some minor differences.
Virtual team members often act as a point of contact for a physical group directly related to them.
They often have more freedom than regular team members, because their teams can arrange meetings according to different time zones, which local management may not understand.
The presence of a real 'invisible team' (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p.109) is a unique element of a virtual team.
The invisible group is the governing body to which all members are subject, and the invisible group sets the standards for each member.
Why would a company want to go through the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organisation?
Creativity and inventiveness flourish when all available resources are used efficiently in the functional departments of the organization.
As a result, collaboration within the organisation to overcome the barrier can lead to the creation of an innovative process that meets the needs of customers.
To become an innovative organisation, its management must create a culture of innovation, knowledge sharing and learning.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuum approach as a method that helps organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
The neurobiological data is the physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition, and it narrows the field of study and makes it more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports the scientific research that's being done.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, injuries, and tumors affect behavior and lead to altered mental function.
With new technology, we can observe and study previously unknown brain structures and processes.
We're going to be able to use a lot of information and a lot of material to build simulation models that allow us to better understand what's going on in the human mind.
Although AI is strongly associated with science fiction, it is a very important branch of computer science that deals with machine behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation.
Research on artificial intelligence is about building machines to automate intelligence-related tasks.
Examples include control and planning, the ability to respond to customer statements and questions, and the ability to recognize handwriting, voice and faces.
These things have become separate fields, focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
Artificial intelligence systems are now widely used in fields such as economics, medicine, engineering and military technology, and are also embedded in several applications used in personal computers and video games.
Field trips are an essential part of any class, and it is not uncommon for a teacher to be eager to take her students to places where buses cannot reach.
Technology allows students to take virtual field trips, visiting museum collections, visiting an aquarium, or seeing artwork from their classroom.
By sharing a virtual field trip, you can stimulate reflection on the field trip and share experiences with subsequent classes.
For example, every year, students at North Carolina's Bennet School design a website about their trip to the state capital; every year the website is changed, but the old versions remain online as an album.
Blogs can help students make progress in writing. Often when they start blogging, grammar and spelling are not at their peak, but the presence of readers usually changes that.
The blogger is beginning to make efforts to improve the quality of his writing and avoid criticism, as students often miss the most rigorous grades.
In addition, blogging helps students to become more aware of the world around them. e need to respond to the interests of their audience inspires students to offer intelligent and interesting content (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool to inspire collaboration and encourage students to extend their learning beyond the traditional school day.
Through the proper use of blogs, students can become more analytical and critical; through active responses to online posts, they can define their own position on the work of others and draw their own perspective on specific issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital, with many art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
To the south are Niagara Falls, and to the north is the pristine beauty of the Muskoka district and surrounding regions.
All of these things, and more, clearly indicate that Ontario is considered by outsiders to be the quintessence of Canada.
The vast areas further north are sparsely populated, some of them practically uninhabited wilderness.
This population comparison comes as a surprise to many: the number of African Americans living in the United States exceeds the number of Canadians.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean, east of the African coast.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and it is a continent of its own in terms of its natural environment.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or allies of France and are famous as luxury seaside resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to these lands, which was firmly established in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European outward movement and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the sea route from Europe to India.
The region is bordered by the Sahel to the north and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: It is recommended that any woman travelling should present herself as married, regardless of her actual marital status.
It also helps to wear a ring (as long as it doesn't look too expensive.
Women should know that cultural differences can cause behaviours that they consider to be harassing, often being followed, grabbed for their hands, etc.
Be firm in your rejection of men, and do not be afraid to stand up for yourself (cultural differences do not mean that this is the case!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded in the 10th century B.C.E. by Berber fishermen and served the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, but abandoned it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru-I-Badya, and the Spanish merchants who had trading bases there called it Casablanca.
When it comes to shopping, Casablanca is the last place in all of Morocco.
Traditional Moroccan goods such as Taji, ceramics, leather goods, water pipes and a whole host of different jewelry can be easily bought in the old Medina, but this is a typically tourist-oriented offer.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located in the eastern end of the country near the border with Rwanda.
In 2002, the city of Goma was devastated when the Nyiragongo volcano erupted, leaving most of the city's streets, and especially its downtown, covered in lava.
While Goma is fairly safe, all visits outside of Goma should be checked for the state of the fighting in North Kivu province.
From the city, you can go hiking on the Nyiragongo volcano and also go mountain gorilla-hunting, one of the cheapest things to do in Africa.
The standard (local) price for a short course is about 500 CFA (Congolese francs).
In the context of its relatively difficult accessibility, "Timbuktu" has become a metaphor for exotic and distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, yet its reputation attracts tourists, and it has an airport.
In 1990 the city was inscribed on the List of World Heritage Sites in Danger because of the destruction caused by the desert sands.
It was one of the main stops on Henry Louis Gates' PBS special "The End of the African World".
This city is definitely different from the rest of the country, because it has an Arab climate rather than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa, bordered by Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers an area of 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecoregions, each with its own flora and fauna.
It is one of the biggest attractions in South Africa and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
There are daily guard fees and park admission fees, as in all other South African national parks.
Buying a wild card can be beneficial, as it gives you access to selected parks in South Africa or to all of South Africa's national parks.
The territory of Hong Kong takes its name from the island of Hong Kong, which is the most important attraction for many tourists.
The rows of buildings that make up the skyline of Hong Kong have been compared to the brilliant column pattern highlighted by the Victoria Bay skyline.
The best views of Hong Kong are from Kowloon's waterfront, across from the city.
The vast majority of Hong Kong's urban area is concentrated in reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is a place occupied by British colonizers, so it's worth starting to look for traces of the territory's colonial past here.
The Sundarbans are the world's largest belt of mangrove forests, stretching 80 km (50 mi) from the coast to the interior of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and part of the forest in India is called the Sundarbans National Park.
But forests are not just the cradles of the earthquake, they are also the last remnants of the vast jungles that once covered the Indus Plain.
The Sundarbans have an area of 3,850 km2, of which about one-third is covered by water and marshes.
Since 1966, Sundarban has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now 400 royal Bengal tigers and some 30,000 reed tigers living there.
Buses leave from the Inter-Regional Bus Station (across the river) throughout the day, although most leave between 6:30 and 7:30, especially those heading east and to Jakaru/Bumthang.
It is best to buy your ticket a few days in advance, since the buses that run between the districts are often crowded.
Most districts are served by small Japanese buses that are fast, comfortable, and durable.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient means of transportation to nearby places, e.g. Paro (Number 150) and Punakha (Number 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a suspension bridge that connects the city of Oiapoque, Brazil, to Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 meters high, its length is 378 meters and it has two traffic lanes of 3.5 meters wide.
The bridge has a vertical clearance of 15 metres, and was completed in August 2011, but not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be open for use in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs offices are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group in the region of present-day eastern Paraguay, leading a semi-nomadic hunter-gatherer life and working hard to provide for their own needs.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly known as the "Great Province of India", was founded in the 16th century by Spanish conquistadors who clashed with indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is well known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
In December, the polo grounds at Las Cañitas host the biggest tournament of the year.
In other months, you can also find smaller tournaments and tournaments.
The Asociación Argentina de Polo offers more information about the games and tickets for the polo matches.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland pound (FKP), which is equal in value to the British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank in the islands, located in Stanley across from the FIC West store.
British pounds are generally accepted throughout the islands, credit cards are accepted in Stanley, and American dollars are often accepted.
Payment by card is not to be expected when on the most remote islands, although British and American currency may be accepted; it is best to ask the owners in advance for the form of payment.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falklands currency outside the islands, so you should exchange your money before leaving the islands.
Because Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer in the northern hemisphere and winter in the southern hemisphere.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical zone, which means that temperatures often exceed +30°C in the summer months.
Winter may be colder than it seems: the temperature rarely drops below zero, but when combined with wind and moisture, the feeling of coldness is greater than the thermometer indicates.
There are no "dry" and "rainy" seasons, and the amount of rainfall is essentially the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park have become accustomed to human contact, they are wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
The park authorities recommend keeping a distance of at least 100 yards from bears and wolves and 25 yards from all other wildlife!
Although they may appear to be gentle, zebras, moose, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don't keep their distance, and these are large, wild, potentially dangerous animals that need space.
In addition, be aware that the smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking smelly foods and keep your campsite clean.
Apia, the capital of Samoa, is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of less than 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and became the capital of Samoa in 1959.
It was here that the infamous maritime stalemate of 1889 occurred, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave port.
All ships were sunk except for one British cruiser, with the loss of nearly 200 American and German lives.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful assembly in the city ended with the assassination of the chief Tupua leader Tamasese Lealofi III.
Auckland is between two bays, so there are many beaches, and the most popular ones are in three areas.
The North Harbour beaches (in the North Harbour district) are on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all beaches are sandy, with safe bathing areas, and most of the shade is provided by metrosideros trees.
Tamaki Drive Beaches are located in Waitemata Bay, in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
They are often crowded family beaches with a wide variety of shops lining the waterfront.
The main local beer is the Number One, which is not a complicated beer, but a pleasant and refreshing one.
It's worth stocking up on some French wine, but New Zealand and Australian wines might make the trip a little easier.
You can drink tap water here without any worries, but if you're in doubt, you can easily find bottled water.
For Australians, the concept of "flat white" coffee is unfamiliar. Small black is "espresso", cappuccino is filled to the brim with cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards, and the fruit juices are expensive, but they're delicious.
Many reef expeditions are year-round, and reef injuries from any of these causes are rare.
However, take the advice of the authorities, follow all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
The perch is found near the beaches and mouths of rivers from October to April, north of 1770, and occasionally outside this period.
No one denies the existence of sharks, but the rarity of their attacks on humans is one reason most of these creatures are afraid of human contact and will run away.
Pink crocodiles are not active in the oceans, their primary habitat is the estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance means that the traveler does not have to worry about finding a place to sleep when he reaches his destination.
Travel agencies usually work with specific hotels, although it is possible to book other forms of accommodation, such as camping, from a travel agent.
Travel agencies offer packages that include breakfast, airport transport, and combined air and hotel packages.
The reservation may be extended for you if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain other documents needed at the destination (e.g. visas).
Any corrections or requests should go to the travel office first, not directly to the hotel.
In the case of music festivals, the vast majority of participants choose to stay on site, and most of them consider it an integral part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you have to get there early to find a campground near the music.
Please note that even after the music is over on the main stages, some festival sectors will still be playing music late into the night.
Some festivals offer camping sites for families with young children.
When crossing the northern Baltic in winter, check the cabin's position, as traveling through the ice generates a terrible noise for those most affected.
The cruises to St. Petersburg include time in the city.
Casinos are usually very careful to keep their patrons as long as possible and to leave as much money as possible, so there are no windows or clocks, and it's hard to find your way out.
They usually have special offers of food, drinks and entertainment to keep their guests happy and entertained.
Some establishments offer drinks on the house, but intoxication distorts judgment, and all seasoned gamblers know the value of a sober mind.
When driving at high latitudes or over mountain passes, conditions such as snow, ice and sub-zero temperatures should be taken into account.
The roads are covered with ice and snow, and there is little friction, so you cannot drive as smoothly as on a clear asphalt.
When a blizzard hits, it can quickly become so heavy that the road becomes impassable.
Other factors that can reduce visibility are snow, sleet, or dripping snow or ice on car windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow are common in many countries, where traffic is free year round.
The safari is probably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the most important event for many visitors.
The popular use of the term safari refers to a land journey undertaken to admire the beautiful African nature, especially the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, often come close to cars, and standard equipment will allow appropriate viewing.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are all shy, so it's best to observe them through binoculars.
A walking safari can last from a few hours to several days.
The Paralympic Games will begin on August 24 and will run until September 5, 2012, with some events hosted in other locations in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host the Summer Olympics twice (the first time was in 1964).
If you booked your flight and accommodation for 2020 before the change was announced, you may be in a difficult situation.
The rules for cancellations vary, but at the end of March, most coronavirus-related cancellations do not include July 2020, when the Olympic Games were scheduled to take place.
The price of most tickets to events is expected to range from 2,500 yen to 130,000 yen, with a typical ticket price of around 7,000 yen.
Ironing can speed up the drying of wet clothes, and many hotels rent irons and ironing boards if they are not available in the room.
If you don't have an iron or don't want to wear socks that have been combed, you can try using a hair dryer if one is available.
The fabric must not be subjected to excessive heating, as it may shrink or burn in extreme cases.
There are many ways to purify water, some of which are more effective at addressing specific threats.
Depending on the area, the water may be boiled for a minute or it may take several minutes.
Filters vary in effectiveness, so if you are concerned, consider buying bottled water from a reputable company.
The varieties may encounter pests that are not native to their home areas.
They damage food, cause irritation or, worse, allergic reactions, secrete venom, and carry infections.
In general, the category of pests does not include infectious diseases as such or dangerous animals that may injure or kill humans.
Free-trade shopping gives you the opportunity to buy goods exempted from taxes and excise duties in certain places.
Travelers to countries with particularly high taxes can sometimes save a lot of money, especially on such goods as alcohol and tobacco.
On the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, the most challenging stretch for drivers is between Point Marion and Fairmont, often crossing remote wooded areas.
If you are not in the habit of driving on country roads, keep your eyes open, for you will often encounter steep climbs, narrow sections and sharp turns.
The speed limits are much lower than those for the preceding and following sections (usually 3540 mph, or 5664 km/h), and it is of the utmost importance that they are strictly observed.
But the interesting thing is that the cell phone network here is much stronger than on many other sections of the trail, like the Pennsylvania Wilds region.
German pastries are quite tasty, and Bavarian pastries are as nutritious and varied as those in Austria, which borders Bavaria to the south.
Fruit cakes are very popular: with boiled apples available all year round, and with cherries and plums in the summer.
Almonds, walnuts, and other nuts are a staple of many German pastries, and the popular biscuit often goes particularly well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want a small but nutritious dish, try what is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices served with meat or vegetables.
The curry can be either "high curry" or "wet curry" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is a common addition to curries, while in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is used.
With 17,000 islands, Indonesian cuisine encompasses a wide variety of regional cuisines from across the country.
The term without further specifying terms usually refers to the cuisine typical of central and eastern Java, which is the most important island of the region.
Javanese cuisine, now readily available throughout the archipelago, includes simple spices, and Javanese favorites include peanuts, chili peppers, and various spices.
The saddle is the rider's footstool, which hangs on either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider, but may cause safety concerns because of the possibility of the rider's foot getting stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse and his foot gets caught in the bridle, the escaping horse may pull him back.
First of all, most jockeys wear riding shoes with high heels and a smooth, rather narrow sole.
Then, some saddles, particularly the English saddles, have a safety feature that causes the saddle to fall off the saddle when pulled by a rear-facing rider.
Cochamo is the most important climbing location in Chile, referred to as the Yosemite of South America, and offering a variety of large granite walls and turns.
The peaks provide spectacular views, and climbers from around the globe continue to chart new routes through the walls of endless possibilities.
Winter sports such as downhill skiing and snowboarding are popular sports involving skating or snowboarding on snow-covered terrain.
Skiing is the main outdoor activity for many enthusiasts, sometimes called 'ski nuts', who plan their entire skiing holiday in a given location.
Skiing has a very long history, as far back as 5,000 years B.C. Skiers' figures were painted on cave walls!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the Norwegians opened the first recreational ski resort in Australia.
Skiing: This activity is also called skiing, ski touring or skiing.
There are some similarities to alpine skiing and climbing, but unlike them, the route does not run through steep terrain and requires no more robust skis or boots.
Think of a ski trail as a similar hiking trail.
