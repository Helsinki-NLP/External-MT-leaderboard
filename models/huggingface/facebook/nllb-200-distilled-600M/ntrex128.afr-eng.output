Members of the Welsh Assembly Worried They're Going to 'Look Silly'
There is consternation among some Assembly members over the proposal to change their title from AMe to MWPe (for Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This was caused by plans to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members across the political spectrum fear that this could spark a spotlight.
One Labour Party member says his group is concerned because "it rhymes with Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means stupid and pwp means stool.
A Plaid Cymru party MP says the group as a whole is "unlucky" and has proposed alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party says his group is "initially" excited about the name change, but has noted that it is a short speech jump from MWP to Muppet, the British equivalent of fool or fool.
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced like the Yorkshire English pronunciation of the letter u.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the name changes, said: "The final decision on any descriptions of what are called Assembly members will of course be a matter for the members themselves.
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June the Commission published the results of public consultations on the proposals which received broad support for the call of the meeting to be the Welsh Parliament.
As for the AMe title, the Commission elected Welsh Parliament Members or WMPs, but the MWP option received the most approval in a public consultation.
AMe is apparently proposing alternatives, but the struggle to get consensus could be a headache for the chairman, Elin Jones, who must submit a bill on the changes within weeks.
The reform legislation will also include other changes to the working of the meeting, including rules on disqualification of AMe and the drafting of the committee system.
AMe will have the final say in the question of what they should be called when debating legislation.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on changing the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday whether to change the name of their country to the "Republic of North Macedonia".
The referendum was held in an attempt to resolve a decades - long dispute with neighboring Greece, which itself has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour represents a claim to its territory and has repeatedly backtracked against its applications for EU and NATO membership.
The president of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the referendum on the name change, said he would ignore the vote.
Supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, however, argue that the name change is simply the price to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's are ringing because churches in Harlem are struggling.
"Historically, the old people I spoke to say, there was a bar and a church on every corner", says Mr. Adams.
"None of the two are there today".
He says that the disappearance of barren trees is understandable.
"People are socializing these days in other ways", he says.
"Bars are no longer neighborhood family rooms where people go regularly".
As for churches, he worries that the money from asset sales will not last as long as leaders expect, "and sooner or later they are back exactly where they started".
Churches, he adds, can be replaced by apartment buildings filled with condominiums filled with the kind of people who will not help the neighborhood's remaining shelters.
"The vast majority of people who buy units in these buildings will be white", he says, "and therefore will bring the day when these churches close even closer, because most of the people who move into these condominiums will likely not become members of these churches".
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis - Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved away in the 1930s.
A black congregation worshiping nearby took over the building's title.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation led by the Hon. John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, a major shopping street in Harlem, who did not want to hire or promote black people.
A fire in 1939 badly damaged the building, but while Father Johnson's members were making plans to rebuild it, they ordered the carillon.
The Rev. David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the carillon "the bells of the poor".
The expert who played the carillon in July called it something else: "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the world's first carillon played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger carillon at the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather says that St. Martin's did not replace him.
What has been playing out at St. Martin's over the past few months is a complex story of architects and contractors, some introduced by the lay leaders of the church, others by the Episcopal diocese.
The church council, the governing body of the congregation, made up of lay leaders - wrote to the diocese in July concerned that the diocese was trying to pass the costs on to the church council, even though the church council was not involved in appointing the architects and contractors that sent the diocese.
Some parishioners complain of a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark Wounded 13-Year-Old on Crab Diving in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while diving for crab on the first day of California's crab season, officials say.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was diving with friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy crying for help and then called a group to help him get out of the water.
Hammel says he first thought it was just the thrill of a first shrimp catch, but then he realized "that he was shouting, 'I was bitten!
I was bitten!'
His whole clavicle was torn open", Hammel saw as he approached the boy.
"I called out to everyone to come out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" adds Hammel.
The boy was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where his condition is described as critical.
It is not known which shark species is responsible for the attack.
Life-saving Captain Larry Giles told a news conference that a shark was spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper part of his elbow.
Officials closed beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swamis in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigative and security reasons.
Giles notes that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to expand into the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's says Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams are battling department store-type beauty trails manned by specialist assistants.
As part of a major expansion into the UK's £2.8 billion beauty market, which continues to grow as sales of fashion and home goods fall, the larger beauty trends will be tested in 11 stores across the country and, if successful, taken to more stores next year.
The investment in beauty is taking place as supermarkets look for ways to fill shelves once used for TVs, microwaves, and household goods.
Sainsbury's says it will double the size of its available beauty products to 3,000, which will include brand names such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman, and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Existing L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees series will also gain more space with brand-specific areas similar to those seen in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket is also launching its Boutique makeup line again so that the majority of products are sweetened-friendly - something that more and more younger buyers are insisting on.
In addition, the fragrance retailer, The Fragrance Shop, will test concessions at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened last week in Croydon, South London, and the second, which will open later this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Internet shopping and the shift to smaller quantities of food purchased daily at local convenience stores mean that supermarkets need to do more to persuade people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, Sainsbury's chief executive, said that the stores will look more like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to fight back against discount stores Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and also launched a number of Habitat outlets since buying both of these chains two years ago, which they say has boosted grocery sales and made purchases more profitable.
The supermarket's previous effort to revamp its beauty and pharmacy departments has failed.
Sainsbury's tried a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the relationship ended after an argument over how to divide the profits from the pharmacies within its stores.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281-store pharmacy business three years ago for £125m to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain.
It says Lloyds will play a role in the plan by offering an extensive range of luxury skincare products, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's's director of marketing, said: "We have transformed the look and feel of our beauty products to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be on hand to provide advice.
Our range of brand names is designed to meet every need, and the attractive setting and convenient locations mean that we are now a breathtaking beauty destination that challenges the old way of shopping".
Peter Jones 'angry' after Holly Willoughby withdrew from an £11m deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones ran away "angry" after TV presenter Holly Willoughby pulled her out of an £11 million deal with his lifestyle brand business to focus on her contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby didn't have time for their home-clothing and accessories brand, Truly.
The couple's business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand name.
The 37-year-old This Morning host announced on Instagram that she was withdrawing.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons Den star Peter Jones furious by withdrawing from their lucrative lifestyle brand business at the last minute - to focus on her own giant contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "angry" when TV's golden girl announced Tuesday at a tense meeting at the headquarters of her business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new opportunities - worth up to £1.5 million - meant she could no longer spend enough time on their homewear and accessories brand, Truly.
The business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and would have doubled Willoughby's estimated £11 million fortune, according to dedicators.
While Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones boarded a jet and traded Britain for one of his vacation homes.
"Truly, Holly's highest priority was by far", says one source.
It would be her long - term future that would carry her through the next few decades.
Her decision to withdraw her completely stunned all involved.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, it was so close to launch.
There is a warehouse full of goods at Marlow headquarters that is ready to be sold.
Experts believe that the withdrawal of Britain's biggest money-shaker, This Morning, could drive the firm out of its pocket by the huge investment in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and homewares, and the possibility that its launch could face even more delays.
And it can mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby co-founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
The couple are vacationing together, and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will become a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm a Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We will not comment on his business affairs".
Harsh Words "and Then We Fall in Love"
He mocked criticism from the news media for making a comment that some would consider "unpresidential" and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in his kamma "news-reader voice".
"I did not give up anything".
He mentioned that Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump described their first meeting in June in Singapore as a major step toward North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
But nuclear disarmament negotiations were on fire.
North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday, more than three months after the June leaders' summit in Singapore, that the North does not see a "corresponding response" from the US to North Korea's early disarmament activities.
Instead, he noted, the United States is continuing to impose sanctions aimed at keeping the pressure going.
Trump took a much more optimistic stance in his convention address.
"We are making excellent progress with North Korea", he said".
"We were on our way to start a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have this wonderful relationship".
He says that his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results - ending rocket tests, helping to free hostages, and prompting the return of the remaining American soldiers home.
And he defended his unusual approach to descriptions of relationships with Kim.
"It's so easy to be president, but instead of 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded arena, we would have had almost 200 people standing there", Trump said, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
Waves and earthquake in Indonesia devastated island, killing hundreds
In the wake of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population has been displaced, no national disaster has been declared, a prerequisite for catalyzing international aid.
In many cases, unfortunately, they were very clear that they were not asking for international help, which makes it a little difficult", said Ms. Sumbung.
Although Save the Children is working on a team to travel to Palu, it is not certain whether foreign personnel can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the relief effort.
Given the earthquake that Indonesia is continually enduring, the country sadly remains ill-prepared for the wrath of nature.
While tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not a common sight on other coastlines.
The apparent lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu likely contributed to the loss of life, although a warning was in effect.
Traveling between Indonesia's many islands is at its best challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is en route to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has made improving Indonesia's crippled infrastructure a focal point of his election campaign and has spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
But Mr. Joko's administration is hampered by funding shortages as he faces re-election next year.
Mr. Joko is also facing pressure from declining sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands displaced as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets with knives, arrows and bows, and other primitive weapons.
Watch: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge kicks good equals against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss to Chelsea on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London with a goal in the 89th minute.
Xherdan Shaqiri came on as Sturridge were about 30 years out of the Chelsea goal and his side 1-0 behind.
He pulled the ball to the left before kicking far into the goal.
The effort sailed high over the frame as it drifted to the upper right-hand corner of the net.
Eventually, the ball over a jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga swung and fell into the net.
"It was just trying to get in that position, to get on the ball, and players like Shaq always play as far forward as possible, so I just tried to create as much time for myself as possible", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante come and type once and not think too much about it and just kick".
Chelsea were 1-0 ahead at halftime after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a goal in the 25th minute.
The Blues' goalkeeper returned to the play area with a back-up to Mateo Kovacic before coming close to the midfield and scoring in the Liverpool half.
Kovacic quickly received and confessed in the middle.
With a beautiful forward shot, he then introduced Hazard into the frame.
Hazard overtook the defense and finished with a left foot pass to Liverpool's Alisson Becker in the farthest goal.
Liverpool will play Napoli at the Champions League group stage at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy, on Wednesday at 3pm.
Chelsea will be in front of Videoton on Thursday at 3pm in London for the UEFA Europa League.
Death toll rises to 832 after the Indonesian tsunami
The death toll in Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, the country's disaster agency said early Sunday.
Numerous people were reportedly trapped under the rubble of buildings that collapsed from the earthquake, which struck Friday at a magnitude of 7.5, and caused fires up to 20 feet [20 ft], agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
The city of Palu, with its more than 380,000 inhabitants, was filled with the rubble of collapsed buildings.
Police arrest man, 32, on suspicion of murder after woman was hidden dead
A murder investigation has been launched after a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old was found stabbed at 7:55 a.m. in Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police urged people in the area who had heard or seen anything to come forward.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in its early stages but I urge anyone who has been in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead who has seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I also urge anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have caught anything on dashcam film footage to contact us as they may have information that may be essential to our investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead and that she was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who believe they know the woman showed up at the scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
Investigations continue as police said they were in the process of informing the victim's immediate family.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews had just tried to return to his apartment but was informed by police that no one was allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he discovered what had happened.
Residents are now told it will take hours before they are readmitted.
A police officer is reported to have told one man that the entire area is now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared on the scene in tears.
She said repeatedly, "It's so awful".
At 2pm, there were two police cars inside the cordon with another just outside.
A number of officers were left inside the cordon to monitor the block of flats.
Anyone with information is asked to call @MerPolCC, 101 or call Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 using log 247 dated 30 September as a reference.
Parliament's Statute of Cromwell is the latest commemoration with a rewrite of history.
His exile would be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of so much of England's cultural and religious artwork carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as "a foolishness" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate over the abolition of statutes that the figure of Oliver Cromwell would be targeted outside the Palace of Westminster.
The image distortion of the English Civil Wars was carried out by Cromwell's command.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the last century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent depiction of Cromwell is evidence of 19th-century opinion and part of the historical record of a figure many believe still to be memorable.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as the defender of parliament from external pressure, in his case of course the monarchy.
Whether this is a completely accurate depiction is the subject of ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid-17th century shaped the later development of our nation, and that Cromwell is an individually recognizable figure who represents one side of that division.
His success as Protector is also worthy of celebration and commemoration.
Murder Pig Scratched Chinese Farmer
According to local media reports, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig at a market in southwestern China.
The man, identified only by his last name, Yuan, was found dead with a blood-stained battered bat near a cage at the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer prepares to inject vaccinated pigs at a pig farm in Xining, Qinghai province, China.
He reportedly traveled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead and found the door open to a neighboring pigsty.
He said there was a large male pig in the cage with blood on its mouth.
A forensic investigation confirmed that the 550-pound pig bit the farmer to death, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were bleeding and torn", said the cousin, who was named after his last name, Wu, quoted the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market Thursday at 4:40 p.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man does not belong to Yuan or his nephew.
A market manager told the Evening New that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking anyone else while the police were gathering evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and the market authorities are allegedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although strange, cases of pigs attacking humans have been reported before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man with serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a Welsh farmer held a 650-pound pig to his tractor until his wife scared the animal off.
After a farmer from Oregon was bitten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBS News that pigs are not normally aggressive but that the taste of blood can act as a "speed catcher".
They're just playful.
They're dicks, very curious... they're not trying to hurt you.
You just have to show them the right amount of respect, he said.
The rest of Hurricane Rosa will bring widespread heavy rain to the southwestern United States.
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa weakened as it moved over the cooler waters of Mexico's northern coast.
However, Rosa will bring floodwaters across northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the coming days.
Rosa had winds of 85 mph [85 m/ h] as of 5 a.m. eastern time on Sunday, a Category 1 hurricane, and was placed 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a tidal wave across the Pacific Ocean is beginning to take shape and move eastward toward the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula as a tropical storm on Monday, heavy tropical moisture will begin to drive northward into the southwestern United States.
Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain on Monday in parts of Mexico.
Then, in response to the approaching droughts over the coming days, tropical moisture will bring widespread heavy rainfall to the southwest.
Local 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous flash floods, waste streams, and possibly landslides in the desert.
Heavy tropical humidity will cause place-to-place rainfall rates of up to 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
As much as 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in parts of the southwest, especially over much of Arizona.
Flooding is possible with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the widespread nature of tropical rainfall.
It would be extremely unwise to risk the desert on foot with the danger of tropical rainfall.
Heavy rainfall can cause deep-swept desert rivers to run into the ground, and thunderstorms will bring strong local winds and dust clouds.
The approaching snowfall will bring some local heavy rain to parts of the coastline of Southern California.
Total rainfall rates of over half an inch are possible, which can cause small waste streams and smooth rivers.
This will be the region's first rainfall of the wet season.
Some scattered tropical rainbows will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday before the rainfall spreads more widely late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the Four Corners on Tuesday and last until Wednesday.
October may see intense temperature fluctuations across the United States as the Arctic gets colder, but the tropics remain very warm.
This sometimes results in dramatic temperature changes over short distances.
A good example of dramatic temperature differences across the central United States is on Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of nearly 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the sweltering summer heat will try to rise and expand again.
Large parts of the central and eastern U.S. are expected to start warming in October, with widespread 80s from the Southern Plains to parts of the Northeast.
New York City could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a higher chance of above-average temperatures for the eastern U.S. for the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched the Brett Kavanaugh trial
More than 20 million people on six television networks on Thursday watched the eye-catching testimony of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christian Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual assault allegedly in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political deadlock has continued, with broadcasters interrupting regular programming for Friday's on-the-spot spin: a deal brokered by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 percent sure Kavanaugh beat her into drunkenness and tried to undress her at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in a heartwarming testimony, said he was 100 percent sure that it did not happen.
It's likely that more than 20.4 million people watched it Friday after, Nielsen reported.
The company counted average viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC.
Figures were not immediately available for other networks that showed it, including PBS, C-SPAN, and the Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen sometimes finds it difficult to measure people who look in offices.
To put it in perspective, it's an audience as big as one for a decisive football game or the Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose hosts strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, was all the networks ahead with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the daylong hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Interest was still high after the trial.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that he would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, he was caught on CNN and CBS Friday morning where opponents shouted at him as he tried to take a lift to the Judiciary Committee.
He stood for a few minutes with his eyes down while CNN was alive picturing him being vilified.
"I'm standing right here in front of you", said one woman.
Do you think he's telling the country the truth?
He was told, "You have power, while so many women are powerless".
Flake said his office issued a statement and went forward before the elevator door, saying he would have more to say at the committee hearing.
The cable and broadcasting networks all later covered live hours when the Judiciary Committee voted to promote Kavanaugh's appointment to the full Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he would only do so with the understanding that the FBI would look into the charges against the candidate for next week, as requested by the Democratic minority.
Flake was partially convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators thereafter, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice was powerful because it was obvious that Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the inquiry.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British MEP May accuses critics of political play on Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of playing politics with Britain's future and undermining national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May is due to attend the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview with her on the front page of the newspaper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson continued his attack on her so-called Chequers Brexit plan, saying that a proposal that Britain and the EU should levy tariffs on each other was utterly ridiculous.
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest suspected Dyteon Simpson in LSU player's death
Police have arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and charged with second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials released a video of the Sims-Simpson confrontation, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the storm.
Police recovered the glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, CBS-affiliated WAFB reports.
After questioning Simpson, police said he admitted to shooting Wayde to death.
His bail was set at $350,000, the lawyer reported.
The East Baton Rouge Parish coroner's office on Friday issued an interim report stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The department commends the Louisiana State Police's fugitive task force, the state police's crime lab, Southern University police and local citizens for their assistance with the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked local law enforcement for its zeal and pursuit of justice.
Sims was 20 years old.
The six-foot-six forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
His average last season was 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was shocked and shocked by Wayde's death.
"That's what you worry about all the time", said Wayde.
Volcano spitting as on Mexico City
As splashes from the Popocatepeti volcano reached the southern neighborhoods of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity in the crater picked up and 183 gas releases and as recorded in 24 hours.
The center monitored multiple thunders and tremors.
Images on social media showed thin gas layers covering car windshields in neighborhoods like Xochimilco in Mexico City.
Geophysicists have noted an increase in activity at the volcano, which is 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital, since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists before the anniversary vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police, and thousands joined protests to commemorate the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarizing vote for abolition.
A group of masked pro-separatists held back by riot police laid eggs and sprayed powdered paint that caused dark dust clouds on streets usually crowded with tourists.
A riot also broke out later that day, and the police had to use their buttons to keep the fighting under control.
For several hours pro-independence groups sang on one note, "No Forget, No Forgiveness", in confrontation with the unionists' cry of "Long live Spain".
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries sustained in the marches, the local press reported.
Tensions continue to rise in the independence-minded region, a year after the referendum on October 1 was declared illegal by Madrid but celebrated by Catalan separatists.
Voters overwhelmingly voted to become independent but turnout was low, with those against backlash largely boycotting the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried in violent clashes to prevent the vote at polling stations across the region.
Pro-independence groups camped overnight on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration continued but was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist demonstration with his wife, said he was no longer optimistic about the prospect of Catalonia gaining independence.
Last year we had one of the best moments.
I saw my parents cry out of joy because they could vote but now we're stuck", he said.
Despite a crucial yet resounding victory in regional elections last December, pro-independence Catalan parties have struggled to maintain momentum this year, with many of their best-known leaders either in self-imposed exile or in custody for their role in organising the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42 - year - old mechanic who recorded the protest in support of the police on his phone, says the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting more and more tense", he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial detention since late last year, announced that he would stand in next year's European Parliament elections.
"To stand as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to endorse the decline in democratic values and repression we have seen from the Spanish government", he said.
London: Men arrested after driving home
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car repeatedly hit a house in London.
The incident occurred at about 7:30 p.m. local time on Thursday in Ballynagardsingel.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said damage was done to the gates and the building itself.
A crossbow may have also been fired at the car at some point.
Menga goal gives Livingston a 1-0 win over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston ensured victory
Promoted Livigston surprised Rangers by putting Steven Gerrard on the sidelines until only his second 18-game defeat as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's goal proved the difference when Gary Holt's team moved up to second with Hibernian.
Gerrard's side remained unbeaten in the Premier League that season and will face the hosts Heart next week, who are eight points ahead.
Rangers will not host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League until Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston is extending their unbeaten run in the division to six games, with head coach Holt still undefeated since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston plays chances against bot visitors
Holt's team had to have advanced long before they scored a goal, with their round-robin success putting Rangers through all sorts of trouble.
SR broke through but drilled in front of the goalkeeper, then AL could only play wide after he came closer and met CH's head across the goalkeeper.
The hosts were happy to have Rangers play before them, knowing that they could get the visitors to play with deadly moments.
And so the decisive goal came.
Rangers released a free kick and Livingston created an opportunity, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson joining Menga to kick and score from the middle of the frame.
By that point, Rangers ownership had prevailed but could not penetrate home defence and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was largely unconcerned.
That pattern continued in the second half, though Alfredo Morelos forced a turn from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was dismissed by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow scored extensively to avoid an open game from Livingston.
Overcruises repeatedly reached Livingston's frame and repeatedly reversed, while two penalties were dropped after Halkett's challenge of replacement Glenn Middleton and one for handball.
Fenomena  by Livingston  analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at the Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal play and results for Livingston.
Until the last man was excellent; they still exceeded expectations on this upward course.
Their playing style and manpower have remained virtually unchanged since their return to the starting lineup, but much credit goes to Holt for the way he has strengthened the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Hackett was enormous with his formidable defensive line, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their toes throughout.
However, the Rangers lacked inspiration.
As well as they did in times under Gerrard, they could not maintain those standards.
Their final ball was missing and only once they were able to pass through the home team, which is somewhat of a wake-up call for Rangers, who find themselves in the middle division.
Erdogan receives mixed reception in Cologne
There was a smile and blue sky on Saturday (September 29) when leaders from Turkey and Germany met in Berlin for breakfast.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which was to restore relations between NATO allies.
They had a stance on issues including human rights, press freedom and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police cited security reasons to prevent the 25,000-strong crowd from gathering outside the mosque but many supporters later showed up to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters  many of them Kurds  also cast their voices and condemned both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
The fighting demonstrations reflect the divisiveness of a visitor who is hailed as a hero by some German Turks and an autocrat by others.
Deptford road accident: Cyclist killed in car crash
A cyclist died in a collision involving a car in London.
The collision occurred at about 10:15 a.m. local time near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, southeast of the city.
The driver of the car stopped and paramedics were present but the man died at the scene.
The collision comes months after another cyclist died in a hit-and-run on Childers Street, about a mile from where Saturday's crash took place.
Metropolitan Police said officers were working to identify the man and notify his immediate family.
Roadblocks and bus routes are in place, and drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Guards Injured in Riot
Six guards were injured in a riot at a high-security men's prison, the prison office said.
The riot broke out around 9:30am BST on Sunday and is still ongoing at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire.
Specialist Tornado Watchers were called in to deal with the riot, which included eight prisoners and was limited to one wing.
The guards were treated at the scene for minor facial injuries.
A prison service spokesman said: "Specialised prison staff have been deployed to address an ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and make it clear that those responsible will be referred to the police and can stay behind bars longer.
HMP Long Martin houses more than 500 inmates, including some of the country's most dangerous offenders.
In June, it was reported that the prison's chief warden was hospitalized after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, riot officials were called in to address serious disorder during which personnel were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa Threats Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City With Flooding
It's unusual for a tropical low pressure to hit Arizona, but that's exactly what could happen early next week if the remaining energy from Hurricane Rosa moves across the southwestern desert, bringing immediate flood risks.
The National Weather Service has already issued emergency flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a direct route over Phoenix on Tuesday, and will approach late Monday with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or depressive status within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the AZ border".
The National Hurricane Center's models predict 2 to 4 inches of rainfall, with isolated amounts of up to 6 inches in the Mogollon edge of Arizona.
Other parts of the American Southwest, including the central Rockies and the Great Basin, will likely get 1 to 2 inches, with isolated totals possibly as high as 4 inches.
For those who are not at immediate flood risk, Rosa's rain will likely be a blessing as the region is plagued by droughts.
Although flooding is a very serious issue, this rainfall is likely to be beneficial as the Southwest is currently experiencing a drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, only about 40 percent of Arizona experiences at least extreme drought, the second highest category", reported weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa's path leads to approaching land across the Baja California Peninsula of Mexico.
Still stormy on Sunday morning, with maximum sustained winds of 85 miles per hour, Rosa is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm is coming into contact with cooler waters in the Pacific Ocean and is therefore losing its strength.
So it is expected to reach the country on Monday afternoon or evening at the height of a tropical storm in Mexico.
Rainfall over parts of Mexico can be heavy and pose a significant flood risk.
"Total rainfall of 3 to 6 inches is expected from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, with up to 10 inches possible", weather.com reported.
Rosa will then move northward over Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border as a tropical depression early Tuesday morning and then moving through Arizona and into southern Utah late Tuesday night.
"The biggest danger Rosa is expected to face is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and the U.S. Southwest", said the National Hurricane Center.
This rain is expected to cause life - threatening flash floods and debris flows in deserts and landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsummer Norton attack: Four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenage boys a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found stabbed in Somerset.
The injured teenage boy was found at about 4:00 a.m. local time on Saturday in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton.
He was taken to a hospital where he remains in a "stable" condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset Police said.
Officials appealed to anyone who may have any cell phone footage of what happened to come forward.
Trump says Kavanaugh has "suffered under the common cold, the rage" of the Democratic Party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthless and shocking tactics of the Democratic Party", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "suffered under the common, the rage" of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress Thursday, vigorously and emotionally denying an allegation by Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the trial about her claim.
The President said on Saturday that Americans saw "the brilliance and quality and courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most competent legal minds of our time, a jurist with a pure record of public service", he told the West Virginia supporters.
The president referred indirectly to Kavanaugh's nomination while discussing the importance of Republican surge in the midterm elections.
"Five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lifetime.
I am not standing, but actually I am", he said.
That is why I fight for these candidates everywhere".
Trump argued that the Democrats are on a mission to "resist and hinder".
The first major procedural vote on the Senate floor on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior GOP leadership aide told CNN.
Hundreds killed by the Indonesian earthquake, tsunami, with numbers still rising
At least 384 people were killed and many washed away when huge waves broke on beaches when a major earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday for a beach party when fireworks up to six metres (18 feet) high broke through the beach at sunset, washing away many after death and destroying everything in the way.
The tsunami followed a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat came yesterday, people were still busy on the beach and did not immediately run and became victims", said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's disaster relief agency BNPB, during an information session in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come on its own, it dragged cars, coal mines, houses, it hit everything on the ground", Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami moved over the open sea at speeds of 800 km/ h (497 m/ h) before hitting the coast.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
Some 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the disaster agency show numerous buildings and shops destroyed, bridges distorted and collapsed, and a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal city was still shaking by landslides.
A series of earthquakes were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's agency for evaluation and application of technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's giant blast was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geography of the city, which sits on the edge of a long, narrow bay, could have worsened the size of the tsunami, they said.
Nugroho described the damage as "significant", saying thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls, and hotels collapsed.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the injuries and damage could be greater along the coastline 300 km (190 mi) north of Palu, an area called Donggala that is closer to the quake's epicenter.
Communication "is completely disrupted by no information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there, the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
"It's already a disaster, but it could get much worse", they said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for not reporting a tsunami hit Palu, although officials said the waves had come at the time the warning was issued.
Amateur footage shared on social media can be heard shouting desperate warnings about the impending tsunami to people on the street below on the top floor of a building.
Within minutes, a wall of water hits the beach and sweeps buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately declare the footage authentic.
The quake and tsunami caused major power outages that cut off communication around Palu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military began sending cargo planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but evacuees still desperately needed food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport has only reopened for relief efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
Indonesia tsunami death rates are rising above 800.
It's very bad.
Although World Vision's staff from Donggala arrived safely in Palu City, where workers were hiding in covering shelters set up in their office yard, they passed scenes of devastation on the way, Mr. Doseba said.
They told me that they had seen many houses destroyed", he said.
It's very bad.
Even as relief groups begin the awful task of launching the disaster relief effort, some people have complained that foreign relief workers with a lot of experience are being prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian guidelines, funds, supplies, and overseas personnel can only be turned on after the disaster area is declared a national disaster area.
It has not yet happened.
"It is still a disaster at the provincial level", said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"Once the government says, 'Well, this is a national disaster,' we can open it up to international assistance, but it doesn't have a status yet".
With the dawn of the second night on Palu after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of those still missing are hoping that their loved ones will be the miracles that will bring relief to the sad story of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled from a sewer pipe.
On Sunday, rescue workers rescued a woman who had been trapped under rubble for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, has trained two of the missing paragliding weavers for the Asian Games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Another of those trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"As a senior in the field of screen weaving, I had my own emotional burden", he said.
Mr. Gendon relates how, in the hours after the news of the Roa Roa Hotel collapse circulated on social media among the screen-weaving community, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the Palu participants who took part in the beach festival.
However, his messages were only answered with one gray bar, instead of two blue bars.
"I think it means the messages were not delivered", he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 while refilling ATMs at Newport on the Levee
Thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's worker who refilled an ATM at Newport on the Levee on Friday morning, according to a news release from the Newport Police Station.
The driver of the car was clearing an ATM in an entertainment complex and preparing to deliver more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press release.
While he was busy, another man "came running from behind the Brink's employee" and stole the bag of money to be delivered.
According to the release, witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but police did not specify the number involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identities should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West is going to change his name to Ye
Announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The entity formerly known as Kanye West".
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for some time and used the nickname as the title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live where he is expected to introduce his new all-new Yandhi.
He replaces Ariana Grande on the show that was canceled for "emotional reasons", said the show's producer.
Besides being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has said in the past that the word has religious meaning to him.
"I believe 'ye' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you,'" West said earlier this year when discussing his album title with radio host Big Boy.
"So I am you, I am us, that is us.
It went from Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye  just reflecting our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are".
He is one of a number of well-known rappers who changed their names.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, or Diddy, among others, but this year announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
A former West associate, JAY-Z, also has already finished with or without a coupon and capital letters.
Mexico's AMLO pledges not to use military force against civilians
In the run-up to the country's 50th anniversary of bloody retaliation against students, Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised never to use military force against civilians.
Lopez Obrador promised at Tlatelolco Plaza on Saturday that he would "never use the military to hold back the Mexican people".
On October 2, 1968, soldiers opened fire on a peaceful demonstration in the plaza where up to 300 people were killed at a time when left-wing student movements were sweeping Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by giving monthly grants to those who graduate and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and a lack of training opportunities attract youths to gangs.
The U.S. needs to double AI funding
With China becoming more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. must double the amount it spends on research in that field, said investor and AI practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who worked at Google, Microsoft, and Apple.
The comments come after several parts of the US government made AI announcements, even though the US has briefly adopted an overall formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China announced their plan last year: they aim to be No. 1 in AI innovation by 2030.
"Doubling the AI research budget would be a good start, given that all the other countries are so far behind the US and we are looking for the next breakthrough in AI", Lee said.
Doubling funding could double the chances of the next big AI achievement being achieved in the U.S., Lee said this week in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the HUB of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's most prominent AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that beat the highest rated American Othello player, and later served as a managing officer at Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee acknowledged past U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's robotics challenge, and asked when the next one would be, to help identify the next visionary.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to win government grants, Lee said.
"It's not China that takes away the academic leaders; it's the corporate ones", Lee said.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have hired influential people from other universities to work on AI in recent years.
Lee says immigration policy changes could also help to help U.S. AI efforts.
"I think green maps should be automatically presented to PhDs in AI", he said.
In July 2017, China's State Council released its Next Generation Development Plan for Artificial Intelligence.
China's National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people at academic institutions similar to the way the National Science Foundation and other government organizations allocate money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a joint AI center that aims to engage partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the formation of a committee to review AI.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it currently invests over $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation aimed at creating a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has come under fire months ago.
Macedonians vote in elections or the country's name must change
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday to change their name to "Republic of North Macedonia", an act that would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that blocked its membership boats for the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, insists that their northern neighbor's name represents a claim to the territory and has denied them admission to NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argued that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has cast doubt on whether the rise will meet the minimum 50 percent required for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum ballot read: "Are you in favor of NATO and EU membership with acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, have argued that it is a price to pay for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia, to pursue admission to bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because it means safer lives for all of us", said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, enough MPs have said they will accept the outcome of the vote to decide it.
The name change will require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state Election Commission said there were no reports of disturbances at 1 a.m.
But the increase was then only 16 percent, compared with 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 percent of registered voters voted.
"I came to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe", said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital city of Skopje.
Macedonia's EM, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko cast their votes for the referendum in Macedonia on changing the country's name that will pave the way for the country to join NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small crowd and pulled chairs in front of tents set up by those who boycotted the referendum.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads up, not through the back door", Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they do not want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia to become part of Euro-Asia integration".
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring much needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe the vast majority will be in favour of it, because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO", Zaev said after casting his vote.
He said a "yes" result would be "confirmation of our future".
A survey published last Monday by Macedonia's Institute for Policy Research said that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum  less than the required amount.
Another survey, conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV, found that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of them, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
For the referendum to be successful, the turnout must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A referendum setback would be the first serious setback for the policies of a pro-Western government since it took office in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero navigating through all of Brighton's defense for goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling cleared the Brighton defence in Manchester City's 2-0 win on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it seem ridiculously easy during his goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine goalkeeper received a nod in the middle of the field at the start of the series.
He chased through three Brighton defenders before hitting the open field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green shirts.
He passed one defender before passing several others on the edge of the Brighton goalkeeper.
He then pushed a forearm to the left, where he found Sterling.
The English forward used his first touch in the cage to send the ball back to Aguero, who used his right foot to hit Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a kick into the right side of the net.
"Aguero is struggling with foot problems", City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
This is what happened.
We are happy that he scored a goal at that moment".
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial lead in Premier League wrestling.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball deep in the Brighton area on that play.
He sent a beautiful ball along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane had a few touches before leading Sterling to the farthest goal.
The Sky Blues' forward kicked the ball into the net just before he was over the back line.
City will take on Hoffenheim in the Champions League on Tuesday at 12:55pm at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play worse against the Rockies
With the Nationals out of the playoffs, there's not much reason to force another start.
But the always-competitive Scherzer wants to take over the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if there are still pitching complications for the Rockies, who have a one-game lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies have at least earned a spot as the promotional team with a 5-2 win over the Nationals Friday night, but still want to secure their first division title.
"Although we're not playing for nothing, we can at least play the game knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team will probably play at the highest level from any point I'll face this year.
Why would I want nothing to do with it?"
The Nationals have yet to announce their starter for Sunday, but are reportedly favorably putting Scherzer in such a situation.
Scherzer, who will have his 34th start, had a throwing practice Thursday and will play on his normal rest Sunday.
The Washington right-hander is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump holds conventions in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation surrounding his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh while speaking about the importance of Republican surge in the midterm elections.
"Everything we did was at stake in November.
Five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
It's one of the big, big  I don't stand, but I actually stand and that's why I fight for these candidates everywhere", he said.
Trump went on, "You see this horrible, horrible radical group of Democrats, you see it happening now.
And they are now determined to take back the power by any means possible, one sees the ugliness, the ingenuity.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to run to get power and control, that's what they want, power and power, we're not going to give it to them".
Democrats, he said, are on a mission to "resist and hinder".
"And one sees it over the past four days", he said, calling the Democrats "evil and mean and cunning and false".
He referred by name to the Senate Judiciary Committee's high-ranking Dianne Feinstein, who received heavy praise from the audience.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh no, I'm waiting for one. It was really weak body language. The weakest body language I've ever seen".
The Labour Party is no longer a broad church.
It is intolerant of those who say what they think
When Momentum's activists in my local party voted to put me under censorship, it was not exactly a surprise.
After all, I am the last person in a string of Labour MPs who were told we were not welcome  all because we said what we thought.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received similar treatment for standing up boldly against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censorship criticized me because I differed from Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironically enough, are similar issues that Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders on.
The notice for the Nottingham East Labour Party meeting on Friday said that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
For most of my eight years as the local Labour Party MP, this was exactly what Friday's AR meetings were.
Unfortunately, this is not the tone of many meetings today, and the promise of "friendlier, more benevolent" politics has long been forgotten, if ever it has begun.
It became increasingly clear that differences of opinion were not tolerated within the Labour Party and that each opinion was judged on the basis of whether it was acceptable to the party leadership.
It started shortly after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues I thought I had previously shared similar political views with began to expect me to make a U-turn and take positions I would never have otherwise agreed with  whether it was on national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I speak publicly  and it doesn't really matter what I say  there is a barrage of social media ranting that asks me not to be re-elected, rejection of politics from the core and telling me not to be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
I am actually happier than my colleagues because the comments directed at me tend to be political.
I have great respect for the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a flood of sexist or racist insults every day, but never shrug off.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how the levels of insult have normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn last week claimed that the Labour Party should cultivate a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that broad church, and with each "motion of distrust" or change of selection rules the party becomes frightened.
I have had many counsel over the past two years that encourage me to stay under the radar, not to be so outspoken, and then to be "okay".
But I did not enter politics to do so.
Since joining the Labour Party as a scholar 32 years ago, motivated by the Thatcher government's neglect that literally left my state high school crumbling, I have tried to fight for better public services for those who need them most  either as a local councillor or government minister.
I never hid my politics, including at the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been at all confused about my policy positions and areas where I differed from the current leadership.
To those who voted for the motion on Friday, I can only say that with the country pushing for a Brexit that will hurt all households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But the one message I actually have is not to Nottingham Momentum, it's to my constituents, whether or not they're now members of the Labour Party: I'm proud to serve you and I promise that no amount of threats of not being re-elected or political advantage will keep me from doing what I believe is in your best interests.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unconquered Ayr above
Two late thirds may have slightly skewed the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win in this wonderfully entertaining Tennent's Premier League match of the day.
They are now at the top of the points table, the only undefeated team out of the ten.
In the end, it was their excellent defense, as well as their better odds, that carried the home team and coach Peter Murchie had every right to be content.
"We have been tested in our matches so far and we are still undefeated, so I must be happy", he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "To Ayr, they took their chances better than we did".
Grant Anderson's three in the 14th minute, which was scored by Frazier Climo, made Ayr the lead, but a yellow card for Scottish player Rory Hughes, made available for the game by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to have the numbers counted and Jason Baggot scored an unanswered three.
Climo extended Ayr's lead with a penalty kick just before he, just before break, scored a solo triple to make it 17-5 for Ayr.
But Melrose got off to a good start in the second half and Patrick Anderson's three, stunned by Baggot, cut the deficit to five points.
There was a long delay to a serious injury at Ruaridh Knott being carried on a portable, and from the start Ayr increased the lead with a Stafford McDowall three, stunted by Climo.
Ayr's acting captain Blair Macpherson was then given a yellow card and again Melrose took advantage of the extra player with an unassailable three by Bruce Colvine, at the end of a very tight game.
The home team made a comeback and when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card for killing Climo without the ball, and from the penalty box MacPherson hit the ball dead behind the incoming Ayr loose end.
Climo scored, as he did almost from the start, after Kyle Rowe took David Armstrong's goal and sent out flanker Gregor Henry for the home team's fifth third.
Still Game star looks set to take on a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star appears to be moving into the hospitality industry after it was discovered that he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old stars Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, which he writes and stars in alongside longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the upcoming ninth season would be the show's last, and Kiernan appears to be preparing for life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment, although a source at the Scottish Sun suggested Kiernan wanted to be involved in Glasgow's "flourishing restaurant business".
'The sea is ours': landlocked Bolivia hopes court will reopen away to the Pacific
Sailors patrol a masonry-covered naval barracks in La Paz.
Public buildings fly a sea blue flag.
Fleet bases from Titicaca Lake to the Amazon are lined with placards that read: "The sea is ours in our own right.
It is a duty to get it back".
Throughout the landlocked Bolivia, the memory of the coastline they lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century is still fresh as the need to sail the Pacific again.
That hope is likely the highest it has been in decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling by the international court of justice on October 1, after 5 years of negotiations.
"Bolivia has the momentum, the spirit of unity and peace, and of course, it expects the outcome with a positive attitude", said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the IGH ruling on large screens across the country, hoping that the tribunal in The Hague will find in favor of Bolivia's claim that after decades of sporadic negotiations Chile is obliged to negotiate to give Bolivia a sovereign passage to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president who faces a controversial re-election battle next year, also has much to rely on Monday's ruling.
"We are close to returning to the Pacific", he promised in late August.
But some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will decide in Bolivia's favor and that little will change if it does.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no power to assign Chilean territory, and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of any possible negotiations.
The fact that the IRH's ruling comes just six months after the last appeal shows that the case was "not complicated", says Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And rather than helping Bolivia's cause, the past four years may have slowed it down.
"The issue of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration", said Zárate.
Morales' aggressive rhetoric has tainted any remaining Chilean goodwill, she noted.
Bolivia and Chile will resume talks at some point, but close talks will be extremely difficult.
The two countries last exchanged ambassadors in 1962.
Former president Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making was exceptionally fast.
Monday will bring Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to begin a new era of relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "end 139 years of differences with mutual benefits", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales  remains one of Latin America's most popular presidents  uses the maritime issue as a political bait.
Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific", he added.
"The ruling is an opportunity to see what we need to overcome the past".
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't come unless they can trust the US
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his country would never first disarm its nuclear weapons if it could not trust Washington.
Ri was speaking at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to fulfill the promises made at a summit in Singapore between the leaders of the competing countries.
His remarks follow U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo apparently on the verge of resuming nuclear diplomacy, which has reached a dead end, more than three months after Singapore with North Korean Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it is a "dream image" that continued sanctions and US cover-up to a declaration ending the Korean War will also bring the North to its knees.
Washington is careful to agree to the statement without Pyongyang first taking meaningful steps toward disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism about whether Pyongyang is serious about renouncing an arsenal that the country sees as the only way to guarantee their security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest range of major head covers on the way to the shops near you
If you want to increase your hat collection or completely avoid the sun, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne introduced a series of wavy oversized head covers to their SS19 collection on the runway that enchanted the style at Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats have been on Instagram this summer, and these designers have paraded their amazing creations on the runway.
The highlight by Valentino was a supersized beige hat with a feathery wide edge that swallowed the models' heads.
Other oversized accessories included jewelled walnuts, a witch hat, and even an pineapple but they were not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also introduced a series of bizarre masks just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had elaborate lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creature looked like scuba gear, with a snorkel and scuba goggles included, while another looked like a melted ice cream cone.
And if you continue the great fashion design, it's your lucky day.
Fashion critics predict that the huge hats may be on their way to the shops near you.
The oversized hats follow briefly the heels of 'La Bomba,' the two-foot-wide, fringe-shaped hat seen on everyone's heads, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult tag behind the highly impractical hat that spread across social media sent another great creation across the aisle  a straw-sandbag that was almost as big as the swimsuit model that wore it.
The burnt orange raffin bag, finished with raffia frying and finished with a white leather handle on top, stood out at Jacquemus' La Riviera's SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: 'I expect to see big hats and beach bags appear in stores for next summer  as the designer has made such a big impact that it will be difficult to ignore the demand for oversized accessories.'
John Edward: Language skills essential to world citizens
Scotland's independent schools have a craze of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with another set of excellent exam results, which were only reinforced by individual and collective successes in sports, art, music and other community enterprises.
With over 30,000 scholars throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best level of service to their scholars and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen careers, and their position as world citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a custom school curriculum, we see world languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "When you talk to someone in a language they understand, it goes to their head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it goes to his heart".
It is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely solely on English when building relationships and trust with people from other lands.
From this year's recent test results, we can see that languages are at the top of the league tables with the highest pass rates in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of scholars who studied foreign languages had an A-grade.
Data collected from SCIS' 74 elementary schools showed that 72 percent of students received an A-grade in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 of those who studied French, and 63 of those who studied Spanish also received an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and young adults will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages now have, as subjects of choice, the same prestige as STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) subjects in independent school curricula and elsewhere.
A survey by the UK Commission for Vocational and Skills in 2014 found that 17 percent of the reasons employees give why they struggle to fill jobs are attributed to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly important in preparing young people for their future careers.
With more likely jobs requiring languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career a person chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real benefit in the future with such a lifelong skill.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically put a multilingual person ahead of the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of over 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage of 15 percent.
That is why it is so important to invest in language education for children today.
Knowing several languages, especially those of developing economies, will equip children with a better chance of getting meaningful work.
In Scotland, each school will differ in the languages they teach.
A number of schools will focus on the more classical modern languages, while other languages will teach what are considered essential for the UK in the run-up to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests, there will always be a number of languages to choose from in independent schools, with teaching staff who are experts in this field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare and equip children with the skills needed to succeed, whatever the future holds.
It cannot be denied that languages are still extremely important for the future of the country at this stage, in a global business environment, and that this must therefore be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should truly be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to Scotland's young people.
It must be well done.

LeBron is making his debut for the San Diego Lakers on Sunday.
The wait is almost over for fans to see LeBron James make his first start for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in Sunday's preseason opening game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But exactly how many minutes he will play is yet to be determined.
"It will be more than one and less than 48", Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James will likely play a limited amount of time.
After a practice session earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six preseason games.
"I don't need pre-season games at this point in my career to get ready", he said.
Trump's West Virginia meeting time, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is launching a sweeping election campaign tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's Trump's first of five rallies scheduled for next week, including stops in friendly locations including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote currently held for his choice to fill the vacancies on the Supreme Court, Trump intends to build support for the upcoming midterm election as Republicans risk losing control of Congress when it is voted on in November.
What time is Trump's gathering in West Virginia tonight, and how do you watch it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7pm ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia live below.
Trump will likely be paying attention to this week's hearings for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who became nervous about allegations of sexual misconduct with an expected confirmation vote that was held back for up to a week as the FBI investigates.
But the main focus of these over-crowding is to help the Republicans facing tough elections in November.
President Trump's campaign thus said that these five rallies next week are aimed at "visiting volunteers and supporters as Republicans seek to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and House", according to Reuters.
"Control of Congress is so critical to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible when we reach the busy campaign season", a Trump campaign spokesman, who declined to be named, told Reuters.
This evening's rally, scheduled for the Westbanco arena in Wheeling, could draw fans from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and be covered by the media in Pittsburgh", according to the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the past month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state he won by more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is behind by the ballot box.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come and give him a boost at the polls", said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA show their courage for the fight to keep hope alive as they enter Sunday's singles
After three one-sided sessions, the Saturday afternoon four-game teams may have been just what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging swing of momentum is a totally faded sporting concept but one that players believe in wholeheartedly, and certainly in competitions like this one.
Where would they say the momentum is now?
"They've gone six points ahead and now it's four, so we're carrying it as a little momentum, I guess", Jordan Spieth said as he walked away at the end of the day.
Europe, of course, has the advantage, four points ahead and 12 to play.
The Americans, however, feel, as Spieth says, that they have such a little wind in their sails and that there is much to encourage them, not the least of which is the class of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day, scoring three points out of four.
Spieth was lethal from the cradle to the field and led by his example.
That score-climbing became harder as his round progressed and he sank a critical stance to win Game 4 completely evenly while he and Thomas were two laps behind.
His bet that won the game for them on 15 was greeted with a similar scream, the kind that tells one that he believes the American team has a chance.
"You really just have to get everything out and worry about your own game", Spieth said.
That's all those players have left.
18 wells to stamp their mark.
The only players to score more points than Spieth and Thomas over the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed story of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's unmarried but charming couple got four out of four and can do nothing wrong.
"Moliwood" were the only couple who did not record a single hit on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided a single hit on Saturday morning as well as during the late nine of Friday morning.
That race, and the way their energy seems to flow to and from these exuberant crowds, confirm that they are the players to be beaten on Sunday, and there will be no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari who can sound a potential European victory when the sun sets over Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time or at different wells.
However, it is too early to talk about European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made brief appearances with Sergio Garcia, the morning four-ball hero, when he played with Alex Noren.
One hold over the lead and two doubles on the front nine left the Spaniards and Swedes in a hole they could hardly get out of.
On Sunday, however, there is no one to help you out of your hole.
The four-ball and four-player teams are so exciting to watch closely because of the interaction between the pairs, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and the way a strategy can change in the blink of an eye.
Europe has always played better as a team so far, taking a significant lead on the final day, but this four-game session also showed that the U.S. team has the courage to fight a battle that some, especially at home, have questioned.
Europe leads 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will have a healthy advantage on the final day of the Ryder Cup after coming off Saturday's four-ball and four-ball games with a 10-6 lead.
The inspired duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the offense with two victories over struggling Tiger Woods to take their score so far to four points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, trying to retain the trophy they lost two years ago at Hazeltine, dominated an uneven American team in the morning fours, winning the series 3-1.
The U.S. struggled more in the quarterfinals, winning two games, but they did not shrink the lead.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points from Sunday's 12 singles matches to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four points in a row, while he and Molinari, who after a sensational weekend are dubbed "Moliwood", are only the second pair in Ryder Cup history to score four points after their first four games.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in the four-ball, they played well together to beat a dad Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambreau with an even more convincing 5&4.
Woods, who pulled himself through two games on Saturday, sometimes showed flashes of brilliance but has now lost 19 of his 29 games in four-ball and four-ball and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who was comfortable during the morning fours, returned to play Henrik Stenson in the quarterfinals to a 2-1 loss to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - who are first and third in the world rankings.
Europe, however, did not always get its sense on a pleasant day with a slight southwest wind from Paris.
Jordan Spieth, who won the Big Ten three times and Justin Thomas, set the American record by two points on Saturday.
They scored a difficult 2-1 win over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fours and later returned to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 3&4 in the fours after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup have a team recovered from a four-point deficit when entering the singles, although Furyk's team only has to play a tiebreaker to retain the trophy because they already hold it.
After two days as the second best, however, they do not seem to be able to make a counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea says it will "certainly not" unilaterally disarm without confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions exacerbate their distrust of the United States and that the country would certainly not unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons without such qualities.
Ri Yong Ho told the world body's annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "significant benevolent measures" in the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, demolishing the nuclear test site, and pledging not to proliferate nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see any corresponding response from the US", he said.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances we will certainly not unilaterally disarm first".
While Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phased" approach to nuclear disarmament whereby North Korea would be rewarded if it took gradual steps, his words seemed meaningful in that it did not unconditionally reject unilateral nuclear disarmament as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the very first summit between a US president and a North Korean leader on June 12 in Singapore when Kim committed to working for "the destruction of nuclear weapons on the Korean Peninsula" while Trump promised assurances for North Korea's security.
North Korea wants a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to ease stringent international sanctions against North Korea.
"The US insists on 'destruction of nuclear weapons first' and is putting more pressure on the US by tightening the level of sanctions to achieve their goal in a compelling way, and even objecting to 'declaring the end of the war,'" Ri said.
"The perception that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a dream of people who are ignorant of us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions are exacerbating our distrust".
Ri did not say anything about plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump that the US leader drew attention to at the United Nations earlier this week.
Rather, the minister drew attention to three meetings over the past five months between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in, adding: "If the party on this issue of nuclear weapons destruction were South Korea and not the United States, the destruction of nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula would not have reached such a dead end".
Ri's tone of speech was dramatically different from last year's, however, when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable that North Korean rockets would be targeted at the US landmass after "Mr. Bad President" Trump called Kim a "fireman" on a suicide broadcast.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking steps to disarm, but said that much work still needs to be done and that sanctions should remain in place until North Korea destroys nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn't have a timeline for this, saying, "It doesn't matter if it takes two years, three years, or five months".
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps they have taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: "The implementation of sanctions by the Security Council must continue diligently and without ceasing until we realize the complete, final, confirmed destruction of nuclear weapons".
The Security Council has unanimously tightened sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an effort to cut funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri on the outskirts of the UN General Assembly and said in retrospect that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip there has not gone well.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying that progress had been made, but North Korea accused him only hours later of "misleading demands".
North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile site and also a nuclear complex if the United States "takes appropriate measures" at a meeting with Moon.
He said Kim told him that the "corresponding measures" he wants to see are security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore as well as steps toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on rest.
A new course at Harvard University this year allows all its undergraduates to get more sleep in an effort to counter the growing macho culture of study by caffeine-driven "participation sessions".
An academic found that students at the world's top university are often ignorant of the basics of how to care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a talk about the effects of sleep deprivation on learning.
"At the end of it, one girl came up to me and said, 'Why are they telling me this now, in my senior year?'
She said that no one had ever told her how important sleep was - which surprised me,' he told The Telegraph.
The course, first offered that year, explains to students the basics of how good sleeping habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as how they improve their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said that the university decided to introduce the course after finding that students were severely sleep deprived during the week.
The hour-long course involves some interactive tasks.
In one section, there is a picture of a bedroom, where students must click on coffee cups, curtains, exercise shoes, and books to be told about the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by sleep deprivation and the importance of a sleeping diet.
In another section, participants are told how prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive icons, then encourages participants to reflect on their daily routines.
'We know this will not change students' behavior immediately.
But we believe that they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know the health effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes,' added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride in 'studying all night,' he said, adding that modern technology and ever-increasing pressure on students have meant that sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
Making sure you get enough good quality sleep should be a student's "secret weapon" to avoid stress, exhaustion, and anxiety, he said - even to avoid gaining weight, because sleep deprivation puts the brain in a starvation mode, which makes you feel hungry all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after taking one of his classes last year, during his freshman year at Harvard.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to pursue a campus-wide course.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all graduate students to complete a similar study program before joining the institution where people compete with each other.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider setting an alarm for when to go to sleep, as well as when to wake up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic displays and LED lights, which can disrupt your circadian rhythm and cause you to struggle to reach the sheep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Goal of Menga defeated Gerrard's men
Rangers suffered another heartbreak when Dolly Menga's goalkeeper gave Steven Gerrard's uncooperative team a 1-0 loss.
The Ibrox team wanted to record their first win as visitors since February's 4-1 win at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's side only gave Gerrard his second defeat in 18 games as manager so his side were eight points behind Hearts, who had run unnoticed in the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga hit seven minutes before break, and it didn't look like a Rangers team without much inspiration would play.
While Rangers now fall to sixth place, Livingston climbs to third, trailing Hibernian by goal difference.
And further trouble could arise for Rangers after Border Judge Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound after an object was apparently thrown from the side.
Gerrand made eight changes to the team that stormed past Ayr after the final of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, used the same Livi-11 that took a point from Hearts last week and he would have been in his lap with the way his well-trained team beat their opponents at every turn.
Rangers may have dominated ball ownership, but Livingston did more when they had the ball.
They were actually supposed to score after just two minutes when Menga's first delivery passed Scott Pittman on Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder opened his big shot.
A deep free kick by Keaghan Jacobs was later found by captain Craig Halkett but his defensive teammate Alan Lithgow could only miss a kick from the back of the goal.
Rangers took control, but it seemed there was more hope than conviction about their game in the final third.
Alfredo Morelos felt that he should have been hit at the quarter point when he and Steven Lawless clashed, but referee Steven Thomson rejected the Colombian's requests.
Rangers managed to get just two shots to the target during the first half but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was adversely affected by Lassana Coulibaly's head shot and a light goal from Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi's opener in the 34th minute may have been against the game, no one can deny that they deserved it, even if it was just for their hard work.
Once again, Rangers failed to handle a deep set of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained calm and sent it to Menga for a simple round.
Gerrard took the break when he traded Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and the trade had an almost immediate impact when the wing sent to Morelos but the impressive Kelly drove from his line to the block.
But Livingston continued to force the visitors to play the exact kind of game they enjoyed, with Lithgow and Halkett packing long balls after long balls.
Holt's team could have increased their lead in the final stages, but McGregor rose well to turn Jacobs before Lithgow could enter from a wide angle.
Rangers replacement Glenn Middleton had a late criminal appeal when he got into trouble with Jacobs, but Thomson turned his back on him.
Almanac: The Inventor of the Geiger Teller
And now a page from our Sunday Morning Almanac: September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, and our TEL VERDER... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device called the Geiger Teller.
Since then, the Geiger Teller has been a mainstay of science, and it has also become a mainstay in pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", which starred those two unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What on earth is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger meter used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can even hear the effect of the atoms emitted by the radioactivity in the minerals.
Evans: "Good, it's cracking up about now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention bearing his name lives on.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" predatory cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" and kill predatory cells
Vaccines teach the immune system to identify predatory cells as part of treatment
Method involves removing immune cells from a patient, transforming them into a laboratory
They can then "see" a protein that is common to many cancers and then inject it again.
A test substance shows promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
One woman who was given the vaccine, who is teaching her immune system to identify predatory cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves removing immune cells from a patient, modifying them in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein found in many cancers, called HER2, and then inject the cells again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine".
HER2 "drives the growth of several cancers", including breast, ovarian, lung, and colorectal cancer, explained Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar approach to removing immune cells from patients and "teaching" them how to attack cancer cells has worked to beat a type of leukemia.
Kanye West began his performance on SNL with a pro-Trump mockery speech while wearing a MAGA hat.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was featured in the studio during Saturday Night Live after a lengthy performance in which he credited US President Donald Trump with announcing his candidacy in 2020.
After singing his third song of the night, called Ghost Town, during which he wore a Make America Great cap, he went out against the Democrats and repeated his support for Trump.
"I talk to white people so often and they say, 'How can you like Trump, he's a racist?'
Well, if I was concerned about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago", he said.
SNL began the show with a sketch featuring Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on sexual assault charges made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not broadcast, West's footage was criticized by comedian Chris Rock on social media.
It is unclear whether Rock tried to mock West by posting it.
West also complained to the audience that behind the stage, what he was wearing on his head made it difficult for him.
"They bullied me behind the stage.
They said, 'don't go out with that hat on.'
They bullied me!
And then they say I'm in a low place", he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West went on to say, "Do you want to see the bottom?" and said he would put on his "superman coat, because that means you can't tell me what to do.
Try love".
His comments drew the audience's attention at least twice, and members of the SNL cast seemed embarrassed, Variety reported, with one person there saying to the publication: "The whole studio has gone silent".
West was introduced as a late replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rhythm guitarist Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West was surprised by a performance of the song I Love it, dressed like a Perrier bottle.
West was supported by the head of conservation group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest spirits: THANK YOU for standing up to the crowds".
But chat host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was simply "who he was and that's absolutely wonderful".
"But I have chosen NOT to reward anyone (by buying their music or clothes or supporting their 'art') who I believe accepts and preaches an ideology that endangers my community.
He's free.
We too", she added.
Before the show, the rhyme singer announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he is now "the creature that used to be known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Co-rhythm guitarist Snoop Dogg was named Snoop Lion and of course the late music legend Prince changed his name to n symbol and then to the artist formerly known as Prince.
Accused of attempted murder for stabbing at a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed at a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Landgericht on Monday.
The indictment will be reviewed by the public prosecutor's office.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington criticizes toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for his sword-swinging role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, criticized the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that such screen roles often mean that young boys feel that they must be tough to be respected.
Kit spoke to The Sunday Times Culture, saying he believes "something went wrong" and asked how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he feels "reasonably strong" about working on this issue.
'I personally feel pretty strongly about it right now - where have we gone wrong with masculinity?' he said.
'What have our men learned as they grow up about the problem we see now?'
Kit believes that television may well be responsible for the growth of toxic masculinity because of its highly masculine characters.
He continued: "What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on TV and in the streets that makes young boys feel that they must have this certain aspect of being a man?
I think that this is really one of the big questions of our time - how do we change it?
Because something obviously went wrong with our young men.'
In the interview, he also admitted that he will not be participating in any of the Game of Thrones pre- and sequel episodes when the series ends next summer, saying he is "ready with battlefields and horses".
Starting November, Kit will star in a new version of Sam Shephard's True West, which tells the story of a filmmaker and his brother, a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he thinks the best thing that came out of Game of Thrones was meeting his wife Rose.
'I met my wife on this program, so that way it gave me my future family, and my life from here on out,' he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love interest of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married on the site of Leslie's family estate in Scotland in June 2018.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14 percent increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people in the country are affected, health officials say.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases have been sexually transmitted, representing a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spreads rapidly through some parts of China due to infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
Year after year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a critical issue in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still very common.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the diseases transmitted come from insufficient sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicine as part of an effort to address the issue.
Maxine Waters denies that a staff member leaked GOP senators' data, condemns "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. Republican Maxine Waters on Saturday contested allegations that a member of her staff posted the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on the legislators' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the allegations were driven by "ultra-right" experts and websites.
"Lies, lies and more hateful lies", Waters said in a Twitter statement.
The leaked information allegedly included the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online Thursday, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during the Senate panel's hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak happened some time after the three senators interviewed Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts is linked to Waters' office and has released the information of a member of Waters' staff, the Hill reported.
"This unfounded claim is completely false and a total lie", Waters continued.
"The member of my staff - whose identity, personal information, and security were compromised as a result of this deceptive and false claim - was by no means responsible for the leak of this information.
This unfounded claim is completely false and a total lie".
Waters' statement soon drew online criticism, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial testifies to anger", wrote Fleischer.
"It suggests that she does not have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something he did not do, he should not be angry.
He should not be challenging.
He should not question the motives of the prosecutor.
He needs to be calm and calm".
Fleischer apparently compared Waters' response to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of being apparently overly angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is trying to get Waters out of the middle seat in the midterm elections, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Great if it's true", he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said her office "informed the appropriate authorities and law enforcement agencies of these fraudulent claims.
"We will make sure that the nurses are exposed", she continued, "and that they will be held legally accountable for anything they do that is destructive and dangerous to every member of my staff".
Johnny English Strikes Again review - shy Rowan Atkinson spy pottery
It is now traditional to look for Brexit meaning in any new British-influenced film and this seems to apply to this revival of the Johnny English action comedy satire franchise - which started back in 2003 with Johnny English and struggled further in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will tongue-in-cheek self-satire on the subject of how obviously powerful we are be the nation's new export opportunity?
In any case, the rude Johnny English with his splinters and rubber face has renewed his license to spoil everything for the second time - and his name is a clearer indication than anything else that he is a great comic creation for non-English-speaking film audiences.
He is, of course, the derided secret agent who, despite his bizarre pretence of sophisticated elegance, had a little bit of Clouseau, a piece of Mr Bean and a good crush on that guy who contributed a single note to the Chariots of Fire theme at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
He is also originally based on the traveler and international man of mysteries, leaving chaos behind, who Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten Barclaycard commercials.
There are one or two lovely moments in this latest version of YOU.
I liked Johnny English, who walked to a helicopter dressed in medieval armor and briefly cut the screws against his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is highlighted but the humor feels rather shallow and oddly superfluous, especially when the "serious" film brands like 007 and Mission Impossible now use self-confident comedy as an ingredient.
The humor feels like it's aimed at children rather than adults, and for me Johnny English's misery is not as original and focused as Atkinson's silent comedy in the persona of Bean.
The eternal thematic assumption is now that Great Britain is in serious trouble.
A cybercriminal infiltrated Britain's top secret spy network and revealed the identities of all Britain's agents in the field, much to the chagrin of the agent on duty - a deplorable little role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last straw for a bloated and besieged prime minister who is already experiencing a general collapse in political unpopularity: Emma Thomspson is doing her best with this quasi-Teresa May character but there is little in the text to work with.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that since every active spy is at risk, she must call someone out of retirement.
And that means the struggling Johnny English himself, now employed as a teacher at some fine institution, but who gives record-breaking lessons on how to be a secret agent, there are some cute jokes here when English offers a School of Rock-type espionage school.
English is recalled to Whitehall for an emergency assignment and reunited with his long-suffering former companion Bough, again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, married to a submarine commander, an all-star character who is too little expected of Vicki Pepperdine.
So the Batman and Robin of completely wasting everything in Her Majesty's secret service completely return to service and come to Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister finds himself under the dangerous spell of the charismatic tech billionaire who claims to solve Britain's computer problems: the enigmatic Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their journey of ridiculous escapades: disguised as waiters setting fire to a French restaurant, causing chaos when they smuggle themselves aboard Volta's luxury yacht; and English breaks free of pure anarchy when he tries to use a virtual reality headset to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's house.
Nothing is spared for that last scene, but as cute and exuberant as it may be, the whole affair is quite a bit like children's TV.
Pretty mediocre.
And like the other Johnny English films, I couldn't help but wonder, can the British not give Rowan Atkinson a role that really brings his talent to life?
Labour denies it's devising a plan for Britons to work four days a week but get paid for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party must consider a drastic plan that would force Britons to work four days a week - but pay for five days.
The party claims that corporate-based savings caused by the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution should be transferred to workers by giving them extra day off.
This will allow workers to enjoy a third week - but they will still take home the same pay.
Sources say that this will "fit" with the party's economic agenda and plans to turn the country in the workers' favor.
Changing to a four-day week was endorsed by the Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour party source told The Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
"It will not happen overnight, but a four-day workweek is an ambition that fits with the party's approach to rebalancing the economy in favour of the worker as well as the party's overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party will not be the first to endorse such an idea, with the Green Party promising a four-day work week during its 2017 general election campaign.
However, the ambition is not currently endorsed by the whole Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "A Thursday workweek is not party policy and is not considered by the party".
Shadow Secretary John McDonnell used last week's Labour Conference to outline his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take power back from "faceless directors" and "profits" at service firms.
The shadow minister's plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not get their full investment back as a Labour government can make "withdrawals" based on alleged violations.
He also confirmed plans to put workers on corporate boards and create inclusive ownership funds to give employees 10 percent of equity in private sector businesses, which can receive annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy tells "60 Minutes" whether the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh can change their minds
The FBI's investigation into charges against Justice Brett Kavanaugh delayed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week, raising the question of whether the bureau's findings could persuade any Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview broadcast Sunday, "60 Minutes" Republican intelligence correspondent Scott Pelley asked John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could dig up anything that might change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more receptive than his South Carolina counterpart.
"I mean, of course", said Kennedy.
"I said at the beginning of the hearing, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, that accusation came out, and I said, 'Did you do this?
He was determined, certainly, unambiguous".
Graham's voice, however, seems to be unchanging.
"I've formed my opinion on Brett Kavanaugh and it will require a charge of dynamite", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know it: Brett has eagerly denied it", Graham continued, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone she mentioned could not confirm it.
It's 36 years old.
I see nothing new changing".
What is the World Citizens' Day, and has it done anything to alleviate poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the World Citizens' Day, an annual music event that features a particularly impressive group of performing stars and an equally impressive goal; ending poverty in the world.
The World Citizens' Festival is now in its seventh year and during the festival, tens of thousands of people will flock to Central Park's Great Lawn to not only enjoy performances by Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event's true purpose of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Citizens Day, which began in 2012, is an extension of the World Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you are willing to pay for a GDP ticket), concertgoers had to perform a series of tasks, or "actions", such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, making a phone call, or any other meaningful way to raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But just how successful was World Citizen with 12 years left to accomplish his goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a good way to convince people to call for action, or is it just another case of so-called clicktivisme - people who feel they are making a real difference by signing an online petition or tweeting?
Since 2011, World Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" by its supporters, supporting a multitude of different goals.
It says that these actions have helped to encourage world leaders to announce commitments and policies that amount to more than $37 billion that will potentially affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group reported 390 commitments and announcements resulting from its actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid or raised.
The group estimates that the confirmed money has so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the most important commitments include the Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and implementers committed to "helping children reach their full potential", pledging $35 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from World citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and World Citizens just like you, we can make the social injustice of undernourishment a footnote in history", Power of Nutrition ambassador Tracey Ullman told the crowd at a London concert in April 2018.
The group also said that, after more than 5,000 actions to get closer to the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government has announced funding for a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the common questions on his website that asks "what makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
World Citizen replied: "It will be a long and difficult road - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed because together we have more power.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the artists performing at this year's New York event, which will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US could use navy for "blockade" to reverse Russian energy exports - Interior Minister
"If necessary", Washington can leave him on his fleet to prevent Russian energy from entering the market, including in the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke revealed, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke has claimed that Russia's involvement in Syria - especially where it works at the invitation of the legitimate government - is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
"I believe the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to act as energy brokers just like in Eastern Europe, southern Europe", he allegedly said.
And, according to one officer, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States has the ability, with our Navy, to ensure that the sea lanes are open, and if necessary, to block, to make sure their energy does not end up on the market", he said.
Zinke addressed the attendees of an event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that considers itself the "voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He went on to compare Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran and noted that they are practically the same.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is, more or less, to finance and replace fuel", he said, referring to Russia as a "simple talent" with an economy that relies on fossil fuels.
The statements come as the Trump administration was on a mission to boost its liquefied natural gas exports to Europe to replace Russia, by far the cheapest option for European consumers.
For that reason, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, have tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump says makes Berlin Moscow's "prisoner".
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a means to pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers", Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US view provoked a backlash from Germany, which reaffirmed their commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), called on the US to stay away from EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply", said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), after a recent meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "seriously consider" running for president in 2020, the Massachusetts senator said
Massachusetts' Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would "seriously consider" running for president after the midterm elections.
At a town meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider standing.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our fractured government, and that includes a woman in the highest sport", she said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6, I will seriously consider running for president".
Warren publicly expressed her opinion on President Donald Trump during the town meeting, saying he was "taking the country in the wrong direction.
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", she said.
Warren was very vocal in her criticism of Trump and his nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
In a tweet Friday, Warren said "of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote".
A poll released Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own constituents do not think she should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of "probable" Massachusetts voters said the senator should not stand, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe survey.
Thirty-two percent supported the idea of her standing.
The poll showed more support for the idea of former Governor Deval Patrick standing, with 38 percent supporting the idea of potentially standing and 48 against it.
Other high-profile Democratic names discussed as likely to stand in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont's Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin named Track Palin's PTSV at the Donald Trump event
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after joining in September.
He was arrested on Monday night and charged with domestic violence.
"What my own son is going through, what he has been going through since he came back, I have sympathy for other families who feel the effects of PTSD and the injury that our soldiers are coming back from", she told an audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called her arrest "the elephant in the room", and of her son and other war veterans, "they come back a little different, they come back hard, they come back and wonder if there is respect for what they and their fellow soldiers and airmen and every other member of the military have given to the country".
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence, assaulting a woman, interfering with a domestic violence complaint, and possession of a firearm while under the influence, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Station.
18 states, D.C. supporting challenge of new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the district filed a friend-of-the-court lawsuit Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker and challenge the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions case, which the American Civil Liberties Union filed against federal policy in August, was not disclosed.
She says her partner "and his violent gangster sons", abused her, but U.S. officials denied her asylum request on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
The state attorneys who support Grace describe El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, which produce a large number of U.S. asylum seekers, as nations facing profound problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District of Columbia attorney general Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal, and international law".
"Federal laws require that all asylum applications be decided on the specific facts and circumstances of the claim, and such advocacy violates that policy", said the friend-of-the-court legal order.
Lawyers further argued in the order that policies that deny immigrants entry hurt the U.S. economy, saying they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide needed labor".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges in June to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic and gang violence.
"Asylum is available to those who leave their homelands because of persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality, or membership in a particular social group or political opinion", Sessions said in his June 11 policy announcement.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all the problems  not even all the serious problems  that people around the world face every day.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as death toll doubles in the race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation is increasingly grim.
"It feels very tense", said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma as she comforted her cowardly baby son at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute an ambulance brings bodies.
Clean water is scarce".
Residents were seen returning to their devastated homes, searching for contaminated property, trying to save anything they could find.
Hundreds were injured and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5-magnitude quake, were overwhelmed.
Of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a broken back and shoulder, rest outside Palu's military hospital where patients are being treated outside for continuous strong rear-shocks.
Tears filled his eyes as he told of the violent earthquake that shook the fifth-floor hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was crushed in the rubble of the walls, I think", Haris told the Associated Press, adding that he and his family were in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife cry for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they are safe".
US ambassador accuses China of "bullying" with "propaganda advertising"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in an American daily newspaper that praised the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to China Daily's paid entry in the Des Moines Register  Iowa's state paper with the most sales  after accusing China of interfering in the US congressional elections on November 6, a claim China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the US election marked what US officials told Reuters was a new phase in Washington's growing campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently caught up in an escalating trade war that has led to their equalizing tariff rates on each other's imports.
China's retaliatory tariffs early in the trade war were aimed at hitting exporters in states like Iowa who supported Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing has hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in an op-ed in Sunday's Des Moines Register, "is now exacerbating the bullying by publishing propaganda ads in our own free press".
"By spreading their propaganda, the Chinese government is seizing America's cherished tradition of free speech and a free press by placing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register", Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, one will find very limited deviant voices at the newspaper kiosk on the street here in Beijing and will see no real reflection of the varied opinions held by the Chinese people about China's worrying economic trajectory, given that the media is under the firm thumb of the Chinese Communist Party", he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers has scratched the offer to publish his article", though he did not say which.
Republicans alienate female voters before midterm elections with Kavanaugh debacle, analysts warn
While many top Republicans stand before Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and defend him in the face of multiple allegations of sexual assault, analysts have warned that they will see a backlash during the upcoming midterm elections, especially from women.
The emotions about this are going up tremendously, and most Republicans are on record already indicating that they want to continue with the vote.
Those things cannot be reversed", Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted Senator Jeff Flake's (R-Arizona) urging for an FBI investigation would be enough to appease angry voters.
"Women will not forget yesterday  they will not forget tomorrow and not in November", said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn Friday, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is Coming!" as they protested in the Senate lobby as the Republicans who controlled the Judiciary Committee chose to continue Kavanaugh's appointment despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be very high", Stu Rothenberg, a neutral political analyst, told the news site.
"People say it was already high; it's true.
But it can be higher, especially among swing female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18 to 29 years old, who don't often vote because they don't like the president".
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing the details of her allegation of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts said a backlash could follow if Republicans continue to affirm.
"It's become a mess for the GOP", said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, early last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not about the committee vote or the final vote and whether Kavanaugh is on the bench, it's about the way the Republicans have handled it and how they have treated her", Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, told the news channel.
But Americans seem somewhat divided over who to believe after Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony, with a little more choosing the latter's side.
A new YouGov survey shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or likely believe Ford's testimony, while 35 percent say they definitely or likely believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they think Kavanaugh likely or definitely joked during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
At Flake's urging, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford, as well as at least one other complainant, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh assaulted her at the age of 17 while drunk.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee exposed her genitals to her while attending a party during their student years at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to fight Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is starting a startup that wants to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The tech legend's latest project, Inrupt, is a company that builds on Berners-Lee's open source platform, Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people are allowed access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the idea with Inrupt is "world domination".
"We must do it now", he said of the project.
"This is a historic moment".
The application uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data storage" or a POD.
It may include contact lists, to-do lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are all available at the same time and on one browser.
What is unique about personal online data storage is that it is entirely up to the user who can access that type of information.
The company calls it "personal data empowerment".
The idea for Inrupt, according to the company's HUB John Bruce, is for the company to bring resources, processes, and relevant skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, staff developers contracted to work on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers from around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee says he and his team don't talk to "Facebook and Google about launching a global change or not, where all their business models are completely reversed overnight.
"We do not ask their permission".
In a post on Medium published Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to provide commercial energy as well as an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Even as he launches Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about this next era of the web", Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: WW1 Victorian Cross-Spiritual Celebration
The only clergyman of the Church of England to win the Victoria Cross as a fighter during World War I was honored 100 years later in his hometown.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann was awarded the medal on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But four days later he was killed by a sniper and never knew he had earned Britain's highest military honor.
A memorial stone was unveiled by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "brilliantly symbolic" that the stone was revealed exactly 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning achievement.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through very dense fog and under heavy fire from field and machine guns".
He later rushed to the line of fire and, with "great courage", led the line forward before storming a field gun and striking three of the division.
Lieutenant Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918 just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something I know I can never confess, but something that is humiliating".
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid a wreath at the parade, conducted by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Orchestra.
Michael Vann said he "felt honored to be able to play a part in the parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero is demonstrated by the support that a crowd will give".
MMA fans stay up all night watching Bellator 206, but get Peppa Pig
Imagine, you stay up all night watching the full-scale Bellator 206, only to miss the main event.
The San Jose program featured 13 fights, including six on the main program that would be broadcast live throughout the night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6am, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were on their way to tell each other the battle, viewers in the UK were stunned when the cover changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were unimpressed after remaining awake until the early hours, especially for the battle.
One fan described the switch to the children's cartoon on Twitter as "some sick joke".
"It is government regulation that content at 6 nm. was not appropriate and therefore they had to switch to children's programs", said Dave Schwartz, Bellator senior vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the broadcast.
""Peppa the pig, yes".
Bellator company president Scott Coker said they would work on their schedule to include UK viewers in the future.
"I think when I think about the rebroadcast, I think we can probably work something out", Coker said.
"But it's a Sunday morning there and we won't be able to sort it out until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when it switched, there were a lot of text messages sent back and forth and not all of them were friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical error.
But it wasn't, it was a government issue.
I can promise you that this won't happen next time.
We'll limit it to five fights instead of six as we normally do and we tried to offer more to our fans and just wasted our time.
This is an unfortunate situation".
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt " inferior " about sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up with a sense of inferiority about his sexuality but that gave him the motivation to be a success.
The 24-year-old said that he did not realize before he went to high school that "not everyone is like me".
Speaking on the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said he was leaking his feelings about gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said that growing up made him less concerned about winning the Olympics.
The regular host of the long - running program, Kirsty Young, has been inactive for a few months because of illness.
When he appeared as a rejectionist on Laverne's first program, Daley said that growing up he felt "less" than anyone else because "it was socially unacceptable to like boys and girls".
He said: "To this day, those feelings of inferiority are, and feel different, the real things that have given me the strength and energy to succeed".
He wanted to prove that he was "something", he said, so that he would not disappoint anyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The double Olympic bronze medalist became a high-profile LGBT activist and used her appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He says that he has been happy because he is so happy to be able to live openly without consequences and wants to give others "hope".
The three-time world champion said falling in love with US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, "catched him off the hook".
Daley married the Oscar winner last year, who is 20 years older than him, but says the age difference has never been an issue.
"When you go through so much at such a young age"  he went to his first Olympic Games at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later  he said it was hard to find someone of his age who had similar ups and downs.
The couple became parents of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley in June, and Daley says his "whole perspective" has changed.
"If you asked me last year, it was all about 'I need to win a gold medal,'" he said.
"But you know, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie".
His son shares the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at age 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley says his father didn't accept that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked was if they already had tickets to London 2012 because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him 'you're not going to be here to be in the front row, Dad,'" he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and it was only after he stopped breathing and was dead that I finally admitted that he was not invincible", he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics, winning bronze.
"I just knew that this is what I've dreamed of all my life - to dive in front of my home crowd at the Olympics, there was no better feeling", he said.
It also inspired his first song collection  Proud by Heather Small  who also resonated with him in the build-up to the Olympics and still gives him chicken.

Mickelson is not on track and withdraws from Saturday's Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup, but he will have to get his form right to stop it from being an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, playing for a record 12th time in the biennial event, was pulled out of the game by captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's four-ball and four-ball games.
Rather than being the center of the action, as he has often been for the United States, the five-time Major winner will split his day between being race leader and working on the practice bench to his game in the hope of fixing that squeeze.
Even at the height of his career, he was never the most straightforward driver, and therefore the 48-year-old is not the ideal person for the narrow Le Golf National course where the long courtyard always punishes the wandering rods.
And as if the track itself wasn't challenging enough, Mickelson comes up against the accurate British Open champion Francesco Molinari on Sunday in his ninth match, who teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their matches this week.
If the Americans, who are four points behind, start the 12 singles games well, Mickelson's game could be absolutely crucial.
Furious expressed confidence in her husband, not that he could say much else.
"He fully understood his role today, gave me a slap on the back, put his arm around me, and said he would be right tomorrow", Furyk said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He's in the Hall of Fame and he's contributed so much to these teams in the past and this week.
I probably hadn't thought he would play two games.
I was looking forward to more, but that's how things worked out and that's what we thought we should do.
He wants to be there on the track, just like anyone else".
Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup games on Sunday.
This may mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that never really matched the highlights of his individual achievements.
Mickelson had 18 wins, 20 losses and seven half-centuries, although Furyk said his presence contributed intangible aspects to the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's taken, he likes to shave like crazy, and he's a wonderful guy to have in the gang room", he explained.
"I think the younger players also enjoyed shaving with him, which was fun to watch.
He offers so much more than just play".
Europe captain thomas bjorn knows great lead may soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant lead before the final day of singles in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable experience.
The Dane made his debut in the 1997 game at Valderrama, where the team, led by Seve Ballesteros, held a five-point lead but won only a nail scratch by 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"One keeps reminding oneself that we had a big lead at Valderrama; we had a big lead at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won the nail scratch", Bjorn said, pictured, after watching the Class of 2018 win 5-3 on Friday and 10-6 yesterday at Le Golf National.
So, history will show me and everyone on the team that it's not over.
You're going full speed tomorrow.
Go out and do all the right things.
It's not over until you have the dots on the board.
We have a goal, and that is to try to win the trophy, and that's where the focus remains.
I keep saying, I'm focusing on the 12 players on our team, but we also know who's on the other side  the best players in the world".
Delighted with the way his players have played on the difficult golf course, Bjorn adds: "I will never get ahead with this.
Tomorrow is a horse of a different color.
Tomorrow it's the individual participation that comes in turn, and it's a horse of a different color.
It's great to be out there with a partner when things are going well, but when you're there individually, you're tested to your full capacity as a golfer.
That's the message you have to convey to players, get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind and he must also make the best of himself".
Unlike Bjorn, his peer Jim Furyk would want his players to perform better individually than they did as playmates, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Fury himself was already on both sides of that great last-day, where he was part of the wish team at Brookline before ending up a loser when Europe achieved the "miracle of Medinah".
"I remember every concealed word of it", he said in response to being asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, encouraged his players on the way to that final day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you want to get off to a good start, as seen at Brookline, as seen at Medinah.
When that momentum starts to move in one direction, it puts a lot of tension on those middle games.
We put our team together accordingly and ranked the men we felt, you know, would bring us something magical tomorrow".
Thomas was tasked with trying to lead the counterattack and came into the main draw against Rory McIlroy, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter being the other Europeans in the top half of the standings.
"I chose this group of guys in this order because I think it covers it all the way to the end", Bjorn said of his singles choices.
Germany's new warship again postponed
The German army's latest frigate would have been commissioned in 2014 to replace the old Cold War-era warships, but it won't be there until at least next year, due to faulty systems and growing costs, local media report.
The commissioning of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the lead ship of the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to The Zeit newspaper, quoting a military spokesman.
This vessel was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but the troubling post-delivery issues plagued the fate of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
They are understood to have a powerful cannon, a battle-range air-to-air and anti-ship missiles, as well as several secret technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods  it should be possible to deploy the latest frigates for up to two years away from home.
But continuing delays mean that the advanced warships that will apparently enable Germany to project power overseas will already be obsolete by the time they enter service, The Zeit reports.
The disastrous F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to commission the vessel and sent it back to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but German media have mentioned that a number of essential "software and hardware defects" render the ship useless if deployed in a campaign.
Software defects are particularly important as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships will be handled by a crew of about 120 sailors, only half the manpower on older Bremen-class frigates.
It also revealed that the ship was drastically overweight, reducing performance and reducing the Fleet's ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000 - tonne "Rheinland - Pfalz" is believed to be twice the weight of similar class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the price tag for the entire project, including the training of the crew, also became an issue.
It apparently reached an incredible €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) - up from the initial €2.2 billion.
Problems that the new frigates have been facing are becoming especially important in light of recent warnings that the strength of Germany's fleet is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, admitted that the Fleet's "deployable ships are becoming obsolete".
The official spokesman said the matter had worsened over time, as old ships were taken out of service but no replacement ships were provided.
He lamented that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could join the Navy.
National Trust listens to the secret life of bats
New research is being conducted on a Scottish Highlands estate that aims to reveal how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behavior of the unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow the common and supra-negative butterfly as well as the brown langour and Daubenton butterfly at Invereve Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at key locations on the property to track bat activity throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using hand-pointers.
Expert sound analysis of all the recordings will check the frequency of the bats' calls and determine which species do.
A habitat map and report will then be compiled to create a detailed landscape scale picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a conservation advisor for NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important to the bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work such as grazing and how to best manage forest lands for bats and other associated species.
Bird populations in Scotland and across the UK have declined significantly over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects habitat and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lightning can also pose a risk, as can flypaper and some chemical treatment of building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
Vultures are not really blind.
But their nocturnal hunting activities make their ears more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echo-oriented approach technique to point out obstacles and obstacles on their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens, and 76,000 acres of land across the country, is very serious about bats.
It has ten trained experts who regularly perform surveys and bed inspections and sometimes rescue operations.
The organisation even set up Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve at Threave Estate in Dumfries and Galloway which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
Property manager David Thompson says the estate is the ideal site for them.
"Here at Threave we have a wonderful area for bats", he said.
"We have the old buildings, many veterans trees, and all the good habitat.
But there is so much about bats that remains unknown, so the work we do here and on other properties helps us to better understand what they need to thrive".
He emphasizes the need to search for bats before maintaining properties because it is possible that unknowingly destroying a single nest could result in the death of up to 400 females and young and exterminate an entire local population.
Birds are protected, and it is illegal to kill, disturb, or prevent them or destroy their nesting sites.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to jump in to help.
She said: "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we don't know how their populations are doing.
Ronaldo is dropping rape charges while lawyers prepare to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has dismissed rape allegations against him as "fake news", saying that people "want to promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers are ready to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the claims.
The Portugal and Juventus forward has been accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
He allegedly paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported Friday.
In an Instagram Live video in which he addresses his 142 million followers, hours after the allegations were published, Ronaldo, 33, described the posts as "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no, no. I was just going to say,
What they said today, fake news", the five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the camera.
"They want to promote themselves by using my name.
This is normal.
They want to be famous for saying my name, but that's part of the whole thing.
I am a happy man and everything is fine", the player added with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyer is preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegation, which they called, according to Reuters, "unacceptable reporting of suspicion in the area of privacy".
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for "moral damages for any amount consistent with the severity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years".
The alleged incident allegedly occurred in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anal, according to documents filed in Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident, saying he was "99 percent" a "good guy" who was abandoned by the "one percent".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had her injuries photographed at the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was "scared of retaliation" and worried about being "publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old says she now wants to reverse the settlement because she is still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack and moved to Italian giants Juve this summer in a €100 million deal.
Brexit: UK will 'repent forever' if its carmakers lose
The UK will "repent forever" if it loses its status as a world leader in automotive manufacturing after Brexit, said Secretary of State for Industry Greg Clark.
He added that it was "competitive" that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would have to temporarily stop production at the Burnaston factory near Derby.
"We need a deal", said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of border delays in the case of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which produces Toyota's Auris and Avensis, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see production stopped at our factory", said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director at Burnaston.
Other UK automakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have raised fears about leaving the EU without a deal and how cross-border trade will work.
BMW, for example, said it would close its Mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns relate to what automakers say are supply chain risks in the case of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line runs on a "just in time" basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and EU for custom-made cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there could be disruption at the border that the industry says could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to hold more than one day's supply at the Derbyshire plant, the company said, and therefore production would be halted.
Mr. Clark says Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is "precisely calibrated to avoid those border checks".
"We need a deal. We want the best deal that, as I say, will allow us to not only enjoy the current success but to seize this opportunity", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"The indications not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers are that we absolutely need to continue with what has been a highly successful supply chain.
Toyota could not say how long production would be halted, but warned that added costs could reduce the plant's competitiveness in the long run and ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been at Burnaston for 24 years and is Unite's summoner to the plant, says that his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, when these jobs disappear, they never come back.
A government spokesman said: "We have proposed a precise and acceptable plan for our future relationship with the EU.
Trump meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, White House says
Donald Trump's high-stakes meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "postponed by another week" as the battle over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian election interference, links between Trump aides and Russia, and possible presidential interference with the law.
Whether or not Trump fires the deputy attorney general, threatening Mueller's independence, has fueled Washington's gossip for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of wearing a tape recorder to record conversations with Trump, as well as the possibility of removing the president via the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday, he went to the White House, amid reports that he was on his way to give thanks.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would "preferably not" to take Rosenstein down, but the meeting was then postponed to avoid a clash with the Senate Judiciary hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump conducted a one-week FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh and postponed the full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said: "A date has not yet been set, it may be this week, I can see that it is postponed by another week with all the other things going on with the high court.
But we'll see, and I always like keeping the press informed".
Some journalists will disagree with that statement: Sanders has not held a White House press briefing since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the scarcity of news sessions is not due to a paradox for TV journalists who are "efficient", although she said: "I will not argue with the fact that they are effective".
She hinted that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
"The president holds more Q&A sessions than any president before him", she said, adding, without citing evidence, "We looked at the numbers".
Intelligence sessions will continue, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the president of the United States, then it is infinitely better than talking to me.
We try a lot and you've seen a lot of it in the last few weeks and it's going to take the place of a press conference when you can talk to the president of the United States".
Trump frequently answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open sessions or press releases with visiting dignitaries.
Solo press releases are rare.
In New York this week, the president may have demonstrated why, by making an unofficial and timely, bizarre appearance in front of the press gathered there.
Secretary of Health writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland about Brexit fears
The Secretary of Health wrote to EU staff working in Scotland's NHS to express the country's gratitude and wish to remain after Brexit.
Jeanne Freeman MSP sent a letter with less than six months left before the UK's withdrawal from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to covering the costs of completed status applications for EU citizens working in the delegated public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on withdrawal continued, heading for expected decisions this fall.
But the UK government has also stepped up its preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this is a very troubling time for all of you.
That is why I would like to repeat how much I value each staff member's contribution, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of healthcare, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we would very much like you to stay here.
Christion Abercrombie undergoing emergency surgery after a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie had emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in Saturday's 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessee team's Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State's head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred just before break time.
"He came to the sideline and kind of just sank in there", Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen along the sideline before he was placed on a portable and taken back for further evaluation.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was out of the theater at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are no details yet about the type/ extent of the injury" and Tennessee is still trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a sophomore in college, is in his first season at Tennessee State after moving out of Illinois.
He struck out five times on Saturday before leaving the game, putting him at 18 strikeouts for the season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp duty when they buy a property in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp duty when they buy a property in the UK and the extra cash will be used to help the homeless, according to the new Tory plans
That move will neutralize the success of Corbyn's attempt to attract young voters.
The stamp duty will be levied on those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp duty when they buy a property in the UK with the extra cash to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
The move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's attempt to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing and target high earners.
The stamp duty increase will be charged to individuals and firms that do not pay taxes in the UK, with the additional money to support government plans to tackle homelessness.
The additional tax  that is outside the current stamp duty, including the higher levels introduced two years ago on second homes and homes purchased for rent  can be as much as three percent.
The Treasury expects this move to bring in up to £120 million a year.
An estimated 13 percent of newly built London properties are bought by non-UK nationals, which push up prices and make it harder for first time buyers to get a foot in the door.
Many affluent areas of the country  especially in the capital  have become "ghost towns" because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a stamp tax cut to help more young people own their first home.
He accused large construction firms of keeping property prices high by raising land but not using it, and encouraged Mrs. May to waive quotas on affordable homes to repair Britain's "housing disaster".
Mr Corbyn announced a string of planned housing improvements, including rental control and an end to "no-fault rental".
He also wants to give councils greater powers to build new homes.
Ms May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my prime ministership to restoring the British dream  that life should be better for every new generation.
And that means rebuilding our broken home market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
But it cannot be right that it is as easy for individuals outside the UK as well as foreign-based companies to buy homes as it is for hardworking British residents.
For too many people, the dream of homeownership has become a distant dream, and the humiliation of homelessness a reality.
Jack Ross: 'My greatest ambition is to run Scotland'
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "greatest ambition" is to become Scotland's manager at some point.
The Scot, 42, is enjoying the challenge of breathing new life into the North-East team, which is currently in third place in League One, three points below the bounties.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after guiding St Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got the second team, but that was it", Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
"But as a child I often watched with my father Scotland at Hampden, and that is something that draws me back.
However, the opportunity can only come if I succeed in club management".
Ross's predecessors as manager of Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin ONeill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic boss said he was not afraid to emulate such established names at such a big club, having previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"At the moment, success for me will be measured by 'Can I get this club back to the Premier League?'
Due to the structure and facilities at this club, it undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League", he said.
"It's not an easy task to get there, but I'll probably consider myself successful only if I can get the club back out there".
Ross's managerial career was only three years, following a stint as assistant manager at Dumbarton and a 15-month stint on Hearts' coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa return from relegation to the third league and converted St Mirren from on the verge of relegation to championship title winners the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever felt during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a real crossroads", he says, recalling how he took over Alloa's locks.
"I really believed the management was the right place for me, even more than to play.
It sounds weird, because I did well enough, made a reasonable living out of it, and lived through reasonable highlights.
But the game can be difficult.
There are many things that one must go through weekly.
I still go through it in terms of the stress and pressure of work, but management just feels right.
I always wanted to drive and now I do, it feels the most comfortable I've ever been in my own skin in my entire adult life".

The perfect time for a pint is 5:30pm on a Saturday, survey found.
The summer heat wave improved Britain's struggling bars' income but put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Drinking places and bar groups saw sales rise 2.7 percent in July  but restaurant revenue fell 4.8 percent, figures showed.
Peter Martin, of business consultancy firm CGA, who compiled the figures, says: "Continued sunshine and England's longer-than-expected participation in the World Cup meant that July followed a similar pattern as the previous month, June, when drinking places were up 2.8 percent, besides the fact that restaurants were hit even harder.
The 1.8 percent drop in restaurant sales in June only worsened in July.
Drinks and bars led by drunkards fared better and rose more than restaurants did.
Food-guided drinking places also suffered from the sun, but not as badly as restaurant operators
It seems that people just wanted to go out for a drink.
Over managed bars and drinking venues, sales rose 6.6 percent for the month, with food washing down three percent.
Paul Newman, of leisure and hospitality analyst RSM, said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
Weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the major factors when it comes to sales in the out-of-home-out-market.
It comes as no surprise that restaurant groups continue to struggle, although a 4.8 percent year-on-year drop in sales will be especially difficult beyond continuing cost pressure.
The long hot summer could not have come at a worse time for food-driven operators and only time will tell if the more moderate temperatures we have experienced since August will bring the necessary relief.
Total sales growth across beverage and restaurant locations, including new locations opening, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in trademark announcements.
The Coffer Peach Tracker industry sales monitor for the UK's drinking, bar and restaurant sector collects and analyses performance data from 47 industry groups, with a combined turnover of over £9 billion and is the established benchmark in the industry.
One in five children has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents
One in five children, some as young as 11, have secret social media accounts they hide from their parents and teachers, a survey revealed.
Survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in fake Insta pages
The news has raised fears of sexual content being posted
Twenty percent of students say they have a household account to show parents
One in five children, some as young as 11, create social media accounts that they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid growth in fake Insta accounts, referring to the photo sharing site Instagram.
The news has raised fears that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty percent of students said they had a clean main account to show parents, but also had private accounts.
One mother who came to her 13-year-old daughter's secret site found a teenager who was inciting others to rape her.
The research, at Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of 11- to 18-year-olds have two profiles, with half of them admitting to having private accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: "It is disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers cannot track them.
Eilidh Doyle will be voting for athletes at the Scottish Athletic Council.
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Board of Scottish Athletics as a non-executive director at the governing body's annual general meeting.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated track and field athlete and chairman Ian Beattie described the move as a wonderful opportunity for those who lead the sport to benefit from her extensive experience at international level over the past decade.
"Eilidh is highly respected throughout Scotland, the UK and the world athletics community and we are sure that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly from what she brings to the board", Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I am eager to act as a voice for athletes and I hope I can really contribute and help to the sport in Scotland.
The American, who won the 200-meter and 400-meter dashes at the 1996 Atlanta Games among his four Olympic gold medals, is now a regular BBC expert, unable to walk after suffering a brief ischemic attack.
He tweeted: "Today, a month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors said that time would tell whether or not I would recover and to what extent.
It was exhausting work, but fully recovered, learned to walk again, and is doing agility exercises today!
Thank you for the messages of encouragement!
Breast pump advertising that compares mothers to cows dividing opinions online
A breastfeeding company shared opinions online with an ad that compared breastfeeding mothers to cows being milked.
To celebrate the launch of what has been called "the world's first silent portable breast pump", consumer technology company Elvie  has released a tongue-in-cheek music video-inspired ad to showcase the freedom the pump gives lactating mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of straw and cows to the tune of a song that includes lyrics like, "Yes, I milk myself, but you can't see a tail" and "You didn't see it, it's not onions, it's my breasts".
The cooking part says, "Pump it out, pump it out, I feed the babies, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my ladies".
But the ad posted on the firm's Facebook page caused controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received a mixed response from viewers, with many saying it undermines the "horrors" of the dairy industry.
"Very poor decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they must become pregnant and give birth in order to produce milk, but their babies are often stolen from them within days of giving birth", wrote one.

Another observed: "Extremely traumatic for mother and baby.
But yes, why not use it to advertise a breast pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Another added: "The ad is so sentimental".
Others defended the ad, with one woman admitting that the song was "crazy" to her.
"I think that's a brilliant idea.
I would have had one if I had continued to breastfeed.
Milking out made me feel like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but I took it for what it is.
It's a brilliant product", one wrote.
Another commented: "It's a fun ad aimed at mothers who are milking (often in their workplaces or toilets) and feel like "cows".
This is not an advertisement that praises or judges the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, the women show that they were all dancing with the discreet pump in their bra.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women who are lactating say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is still, has no wires or tubes, and discreetly fits into a nutritional bra that allows women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even go out while they are breastfeeding.
Ana Balarin, partner and UKD at Mother, noted: "The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it has earned a huge and provocative introduction.
Drawing a parallel between women milking and dairy cows, we wanted to highlight the milking process and all its challenges, while demonstrating the wonderful sense of freedom that the new pump will bring in a fun way that people can connect to.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the set for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of migrant children detained has risen sharply although monthly border controls have remained relatively unchanged, in part due to harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration that make it harder to place children under guardianship.
Traditionally, most sponsors were also undocumented immigrants and feared that their own ability to remain in the country would be jeopardized by moving forward to demand a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that prospective sponsors and other adult members of their households would have to file their fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs enforcement official before Congress, testified that the agency had arrested thousands of people who applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal records.
"Nearly 80 percent of individuals who are either sponsors or members of sponsors' households are illegal here in the country and a large number of them are criminal aliens.
That is why we continue to persecute those individuals", said Mr. Albence.
In an effort to process the children more quickly, officials have introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within a month of their arrest, rather than after 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to shelter workers.
Many will appear by videoconference call, rather than in person, to plead their case for legal status before an immigration judge.
Those deemed unfit for relief will be deported quickly.
The longer the children stay in detention, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts, according to shelter workers and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months.
Advocates say that concern is heightened at a larger facility like Tornillo, where signs of a struggling child are more easily overlooked because of their size.
They added that moving the children to the tent town without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally to say goodbye to friends can worsen the trauma that many already struggle with.
Syria tells the US, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the country itself is in its eighth year of war.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were illegal on Syrian soil, under the pretext of fighting terrorism and would be handled accordingly.
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions", he told the meeting.
Moualem insisted that the war on terror in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, with millions more displaced, was almost over.
He said that Damascus will continue to wage this holy battle until we have cleared all Syrian territories of both terrorist groups and any illegal foreign presence.
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mostly training and advising Kurdish forces as well as Syrian Arabs against President Bashar al-Assad.
France with over 1,000 troops on the ground in the war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said that conditions were in order for them to return, and he blamed some Western countries for spreading irrational fears that encourage refugees to stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate these backfires", he said.
They politicize something that should simply be a humanitarian issue.
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats said a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major rebel siege of Idlib created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement thwarted a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, home to three million people.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action would target jihadists, including fighters from the Al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front who would be "destroyed".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee of government and opposition members soon to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem prescribed conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the panel's work should be limited to "checking the articles of the current constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Term
According to that logic, Mr. Trump will win re-election in 2020 unless, as many liberals are likely to hope, a state of accusations and scandals ends his presidency early.
In what will undoubtedly be the most dramatic finale of a presidency ever!
To date, there are no signs of viewer fatigue.
Since 2014, peak-time viewership has more than doubled to 1.05 million at CCN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million at MSNCBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million prime time viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's Rachel Maddow Show is above cable viewing figures with as many as 3.5 million viewers on major news nights.
"It's a fire that people are attracted to because it's not something we understand", says Neal Baer, program manager of the ABC drama "Designated Survivor", about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroyed the Congress building.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club, has a different theory.
She remembers a taxi driver in Boston before the 2016 election.
The manager told her that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? she asked.
He said, 'Because he makes me laugh,' Scovell told me.
There is entertainment value in the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the storylines coming out of Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, or immigrant families could reunite and the health of the global economy.
To eliminate is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it goes beyond just being an informed citizen when you're in the sixth hour of watching a panel of experts debate Bob Woodward's use of deep background from his book Fear, Paul Manafort's $15,000 full-leather flying jacket, and the implications of Stormy Daniels' shocking descriptions of Mr. Trump's, um, anatomy.
For example, I will never watch Super Mario the same way again.
"Part of what he does that makes it feel like a reality show is that he feeds you something every night", says Brent Montgomery, chief operating officer of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", about Trump's changing casting and daily twists in the plot (such as seeking a rift with N.F.L., praising Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss one episode, or you're left behind.
When I reached for Mr. Fleiss this week, it was 80 degrees outside his home on the northern coast of Kauai, but he was inside watching MSNBC while he was recording CNN.
He couldn't get away with it, not with Brett Kavanaugh on his way to appear before the Senate Judiciary and the future of the Supreme Court hanging in the balance.
I remember when we were doing all those crazy programs back then and people were saying, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization", Mr. Fleiss told me.
I thought it was kind of a joke, but it turns out they were right.

Extracurricular flows to the most exciting midterm elections in the House
Not surprisingly, Pennsylvania's 17th sees an influx of money, thanks to a shift in congressional districts that has now put two officials in a race for the same seat.
The recently renamed suburban Pittsburg district is allowing Democratic Rep. Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring, to measure forces.
Lamb is up against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old Pennsylvania 12th district, which is heavily overlapping with the new 17th.
The maps were withdrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally delineated in favor of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th started with a campaign finance competition between the major parties' financial bones, the Democratic Campaign's Congress Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after winning a landslide special election in March for Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
The seat was held for more than a decade by a Republican, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts gave the Democrats a slight advantage.
The US considered penalizing El Salvador rather than supporting China, but then backed down.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until partners expelled the Trump Organization's management team.
State department officials have decided to recall U.S. heads of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan, Heather Nauert, a department spokeswoman, said in a statement earlier this month.
But fines were only considered against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including drug control, development, and economic assistance.
The proposed penalties, which include reductions in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would be difficult for the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, only North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level congress and focused on security and economic progress to follow up on a similar meeting last year that was seen as a step forward in an effort to prevent migrants from entering the United States.
But by mid-September, top administrative officials made it clear that they wanted the congress to continue effectively ending any consideration of fines for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now scheduled to address the convention, now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the seriousness of the meeting for the administration, the diplomats said.
And the three American ambassadors returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic with no new angry messages or punishments from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal deliberations on condition of anonymity.
Their statements were confirmed by an outside analyst who was close to the administration and also spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Studying the History
The next thing that could happen could be the special consultation on Robert Mueller's report on Mr. Trump's possible courtroom bombing, of which there is now much significant evidence in the public record.
Mr. Mueller is also likely to focus his investigation on whether Mr. Trump's campaign collaborated with Russia in the country's attack on our election.
If Congress were to pass into other hands, Mr. Trump would have to face accountability in that body just as he prepares to go back before the voters, and perhaps eventually before a jury of his peer group.
It's a bunch of asses, and I don't mean to imply that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable, and neither is that of his European counterparts.
Decisions are to be made on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect how much of the battle can be fought.
In 1938, German officials were ready to stage a coup against Hitler, if the West only opposed him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points and the relentless course of democracy is being hasty or delayed.
Americans now face several such turning points.
What would we do if Mr. Trump fired Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in hot water since this paper reported that he proposed covertly taking the president last year and speculated about his eligibility for office.
Mr. Rosenstein says The Times' report is inaccurate.
"How will we respond if the newly requested FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair  or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible sexual assault charges and dishonest testimony?
And most importantly, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we look at those tests, there is a long winter ahead for democracy.
But I believe we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once lived in my embassy home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and, 60 years later, sent me to light Sabbath candles on that table that wears the swastika.
With this in my background, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Rangers' Graham Dorrans optimistic about the Battle of Rapid Vienna
Rangers are playing hosts for Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a victory over the Austrians, following the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will place them in a strong position to qualify for Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season until the 2-2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes Rangers can use this result as a springboard for bigger things.
"It was a good point for us, because Villarreal is a good team", said the 31-year-old.
"We entered the game convinced that we could get something and walked away with a point.
Maybe we could have won it in the end, but an even number is probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we came out in the second half and were the better team.
Thursday is another big European night.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it's going to be a tough game because they had a good result in their last game, but with the crowd on our side, I'm sure we can push through and get a positive result.
Last year was certainly difficult, with everything that happened with my injuries and the changes at the club, but there is now a well-being factor in place.
The group is good and the men really enjoy it; the training is good.
Hopefully we can push through now, put last season behind us and be successful".
Women lose sleep over this fear of leaving
Despite the fact that survey participants have a clear idea of how they want to be cared for, few talk about it with their relatives.
About half of the individuals in the Nationwide study said they talk to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they had discussed it with their children.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't take the steps to have the conversation", says Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide's life insurance business.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and the children: You cannot prepare your family for caring if you do not express your wishes well in advance.
Work with your counselor and your family to preach where and how to receive care, as those choices can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Bring in your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you to come up with a way to pay for those expenses.
Your long-term care funding decisions may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid cash value life insurance policy to help cover these expenses, or self-insurance at your own expense, as long as you have the money.
Work out your legal documents: Cut off legal disputes at the pass.
Get a health care attorney in place so that you can appoint a trusted individual to oversee your medical care and ensure that experts will fulfill your wishes if you cannot communicate.
Also consider authorizing your finances.
You must choose someone you trust to make financial decisions for you and to ensure that your bills are paid if you are unfit.
Remember the little details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer questions about medication and allergies?
Write down those details in a written plan so that you are ready.
"It's not just the financial issues that are at stake, but who are the doctors?" asks Martin.
What is the medicine?
Who will take care of the dog?
Make sure that plan is in place".
Man shot several times in Ilfracombe with windshields
A man was shot several times with a windshield as he walked home after a night out.
The victim, in his 40's, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
Officials described the shooting, which occurred at about 2:30 P.M. BST, as an "unusual act".
The victim did not see his attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening and the police have called for witnesses.
Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and the death toll is expected to rise.
With communications out of action, emergency responders could not get any information from Donggala Regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the center of the 7.5 magnitude quake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were brought to safety after the disaster struck.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, located at the tip of a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a regency that stretches along more than 300 km (180 mi) of coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The regency, an administrative region under the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the mainstays of the economy of Central Sulawesi province, especially the coastal area of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times over the past 100 years, according to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck western Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia sits on the seismic Pacific Ring of Fire and is frequently struck by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A major earthquake along the western coast of Indonesian Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26 that led to a tsunami that struck 14 countries, resulted in 226,000 deaths along the Indian Ocean coast, with more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 hit southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, leading to a tsunami that hit the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near the city of Padang, capital of Western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands, near Sumatra, leading to a 10-meter-high tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A massive earthquake struck the Pidie Jaya regime in Aceh, leading to destruction and panic when people were reminded of the destruction of the deadly earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
This time, it didn't lead to a tsunami, but more than 100 died from buildings collapsing.
2018: Large earthquakes hit Indonesia's tourist island of Lombok, with more than 500 deaths, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily stranded thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on domestic violence charges.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interference with a domestic violence report, and resisting arrest, according to a report released Saturday by Alaska State Police.
According to the police report, he took a woman's phone when she called the police to report the alleged crimes.
Palin is being held at Mat-Su Pre-Trial Facility and is being held on $500 unsecured bail, KTUU reports.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared "not guilty, absolutely" when asked what he was pleading, the network reported.
Palin faces three class A misdemeanors, which means he could face up to a year in jail and a $250,000 fine.
He is also charged with a class B misdemeanor, punishable by up to a day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that a criminal complaint has been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported the alleged attack.
The case is currently before Alaska's Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interfering with the reporting of a crime of domestic violence, and possession of a firearm while intoxicated in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claimed that he had punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after she linked her son's behavior to PTSD following his military service in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake and tsunami: hundreds dead
At least 384 people died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake led to a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been shut down with mortality rates expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck just outside central Sulawesi, which is northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos circulate on social media showing the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach party in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the beach.
Federal prosecutors seek a rare death sentence for suspects in the NYC terrorist attack
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terrorist attack that killed eight people, a rare sentence not yet carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out an attack on a cycleway along the West Side Freeway in Lower Manhattan to kill pedestrians and a cyclist who was in his way in October.
To justify a death sentence, prosecutors would have to prove that Saipov "deliberately" killed the eight victims and "deliberately" inflicted serious bodily harm, according to the notice of intent to seek the death penalty filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both of those charges carry a possible death sentence, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury convicted Saipov on 22 counts, including eight counts of murder for extortion, typically used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and one count of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "deep planning and foresight", prosecutors said, describing Saipov's conduct as "depraved, cruel, and perverse".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injury, injury and loss to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", the intention notice stated.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
A decade has passed since the Southern District of New York brought a death penalty case to trial.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but was finally sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who had been executed after being convicted of conspiring to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenberges were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months following the attack, court documents show.
He told investigators that he felt good about what he had done, police said.
Saipov told authorities he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the charges.
He also requested to display the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to the 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal pro- Deo lawyers representing Saipov, said they were "naturally disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We think that the decision to seek the death penalty rather than accept a guilty plea to life in prison without the possibility of parole will only prolong the trauma of these events for all those involved", Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to crave the death penalty.
Tory MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be put in charge of Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage pledged to mobilize "the people's army" today during a protest at the Tory conference.
The former Ukip leader said politicians had to feel the "heat" of Eurosceptics as one of Theresa May's own MPs proposed that he should be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told the Birmingham march that by then the UK would be "out" if Mr Farage was Brexit secretary.
But the challenge Mrs May faces to unite her deeply divided officers was by swearing pro-Roman Tories by joining a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister struggles to keep her Chequers compromise plan on track amid attacks by Brexiters, Remainers and the EU.
Allies insisted she would push through in her attempt to reach a deal with Brussels despite the deadlock and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and "chaos".
Mr. Bone told the Loop Means Loop convention in Solihull that he "wanted to screw up Chequers".
He proposed that Mr. Farage be made a nobleman and given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
If he was in charge, we would have been out by then,' he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: 'I will stand for Brexit, but we must defeat Chequers.'
He expressed his opposition to the EU, saying: "We have not fought world wars to be submissive.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
Mr Bone has rejected suggestions that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay is completely untrue.
Tory Brexit leader Andrea Jenkyns was also at the march and told reporters: "I simply say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chequers are unpopular with the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for them, they are unpopular with our party and our activists who actually bomb the streets and make sure we get elected in the first place.
Please let Chequers go and start listening.
In a direct message to Mrs May, she added: Prime Ministers should keep their jobs when they keep their promises.
Mr Farge said the assembly politicians had to feel the "heat" when they were on the threshold to violate the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"It is now a matter of trust between us - the people - and our political class", he said.
They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them we won't let you get away with it
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to make our political class, who are about to betray Brexit, feel the heat.
We are mobilizing the people's army of this country that gave us victory in Brexit and will not rest until we are an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.
During the rush, Remainers marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour convention in downtown.
Some activists have been calling on Tories to oppose Brexit banners after the group's launch this weekend.
Labour MP Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives for the security issues they endured with a party application as the conference opened.
It is the people who tell us that they can have the IT systems and all the technology for Canada plus plus in place, for the seamless border, for borderless free trade in Ireland", he added.
This is a general wisdom.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit, he added.
Warren plans to look hard to run for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will "look forward to running for president" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at a town hall meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican State Rep. Geoff Diehl, who co-chaired Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She's already in the midst of speculation that she might challenge Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with constituents using the city hall format since Trump came to power.
A public speaker asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren responded that it was time "for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that includes a woman at the top".
Arrested made in shooting of LSU's Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, LA., announced Saturday that a suspect in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wayne Sims was arrested Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11 a.m. ET news conference.
They released a video of the shooting Friday and asked for help identifying a man seen in the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed early Friday near Southern University's campus.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and eventually died as a result", police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday via 247sports.
Wayde stepped in to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interviewed and admitted to being on the scene, possessing a weapon, and admitting to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A 6-foot-6 junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims played in 32 games with 10 starts last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is claiming the world title after team orders gave him his win over Sebastian Vettel
This became apparent the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday when Mercedes' team orders would play a big role in the races.
From pole position, Bottas got off to a good start and almost won for Hamilton as he defended his position in the first two laps and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went into the wells first, leaving Hamilton to drive in the back of the pack, which must have been decisive.
The Mercedes drove a lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton advanced to wheel-to-wheel action which left the Ferrari driver unreasonably risk-free on the inside at the risk of withdrawal after a double-movement to defend at the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the jump grid and finished seventh by the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then led for much of the race as he held on to his tires to finish fast and pass Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He eventually reached the wells on the 44th lap, but could not speed up his pass in the remaining eight laps as Raikkonen took fourth place.
It was said to have been a difficult day, because Valtteri had done fantastic work all weekend and was a real gentleman.
The team did exceptional work to have a one-two", Hamilton said.
It was a terrible bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday over her insistence that she did not leak Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a convention in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead commented that what was happening in the Senate showed that people were "common and rude and liars".
"The one thing that can happen and the nice thing that has happened in the Senate over the past few days, when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and mean and liars", he said.
"When you look at statements and leaks and then they say, 'Oh, I didn't do it.
I did not".
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak?
Remember her answer... you leaked the document-- "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no, you know.
I didn't leak it".
Well, wait a minute.
We leaked it...No, we didn't leak it", he added, in a speech from the senator.
Feinstein was sent the letter outlining the charges against Kavanaugh by Ford back in July, and it was leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein denied the leak from her office had occurred.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations. I didn't leak her story", Feinstein told the committee, The Hill reported.
"She asked me to keep it confidential, and I kept it confidential as she asked".
But the president did not take her denial to heart and commented during the Saturday night convention: "I tell you what.
Maybe not, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen".
The president continued to defend the Supreme Court nominee accused of sexual misconduct by three women, and suggested that the Democrats use the allegations for their own purposes.
"They are determined to take back power by any means necessary.
You see the meanness, the dishonesty, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to fight to get power and control", Mediaite reported the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
Dundee Stars reconciled for Friday's Elite League loss to Belfast Giants by winning the 5-3 draw at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants took an early two-goal lead with pitches from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied the home team before Dwyer restored the Giants' lead.
Francois Bouchard tied Dundee before two Lucas Lundvald Nielsen goals tied their win.
It was the third Elite League win of the season for Adam Keefe's men who first lost matches and then went on to win 2-1 at Dundee on Friday night in Belfast.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two sides, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
Dwyer's opening came in the fourth minute at 3:35 from Kendall McFaull's assist, with David Rutherford providing the help when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In what was a busy opening period, Sullivan brought home the game back to 13:10 before Matt Marquardt became the catcher for Cownie's match at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants took the lead into the first break when he kicked his second goal of the evening at the end of the first half.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard again tied them with a field goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran came together to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time in the game late in the second half and he made sure of the win with his team's fifth point halfway through the final half.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, are home to Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies to make sure hundreds on the plane can escape earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller is considered a hero after he died making sure that a plane carrying hundreds of people took off safely.
More than 800 people have been killed and more are missing after a major earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
There are still strong aftershocks in the area and many are trapped in debris in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues fleeing for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his position in the control tower that had been badly damaged at Mutiara SIS Al-Jufri airport in Palu.
He remained motionless to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, was able to take off safely.
He then jumped from the traffic control tower when he noticed that it was thundering.
He later died in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait says the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, reported Australia's ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"We are heartbroken to hear this", he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death toll could reach the thousands with the country's disaster relief agency saying access to the villages of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is restricted.
"The death toll is believed to continue to rise as many bodies are still under construction while many are still unreachable", said agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves reaching up to six metres [6.5 ft] have ripped through Palu, which will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring in aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance brings in bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
The minimum marks are looted everywhere".
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help survivors, but we don't know what they will find there.
It's already a tragedy, but it can get much worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military service: "I ask all of you to work day and night to complete every task related to evacuation.
Are you ready?  CNN reported.
Earlier this year, earthquakes in Lombok struck Indonesia, killing more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini says one man is now missing after a beach lake plane crash
The airline that handled a flight that crashed into a Pacific lake on the shores of Lake Michigan now says one man has gone missing after earlier stating that all 47 passengers and crew safely evacuated the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon they could not account for a male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals, and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people were taken to a hospital.
The airline said six passengers were hospitalized on Saturday, and all were in stable condition.
The cause of the collapse and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed near the runway in the beach lake.
Some witnesses thought the plane had overtaken the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane landed very low.
"It's a very good thing", Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that he and the others managed to walk through shallow water to the emergency exits on the sinking plane.
He said that the airmen panicked and shouted and that he had suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said creatures working near a dock improvement also helped rescue people back and forth to land before the plane sank in about 30 feet [30 m] of water.
Data from the Air Safety Network indicates that 111 people have been killed in crashes of PNG-registered airlines over the past two decades, but Air Niugini was involved in one.
Analysts set a timeline apart from the evening that woman was burned alive
The state closed its case on Saturday in a retrial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used cell phone records to put together the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said he received location data from various cell phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers on the night of her death, which contradicted his previous claims, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers during the period he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was kidding because my truck was in Nashville".
Another inconsistency is that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Cell phone records indicated that they had known each other for only a week.
Rowlett said that shortly after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He took her out of his life", said Hale.
The defense is scheduled to begin its final hearings Sunday.
The judge said that he expected the trial to go to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
A hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative outlook of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, of Bristol, claims that hip-hop has moved away from its origins of political messages and addressing social issues.
They want to go back to the basics and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have seen a recent resurgence in the UK with artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Enough of a black person?!
NY Childhood Miss sues a couple for being fired after a racist text
A New York-based midwife sued a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a misadressed message from her mother who complained that she was "too black".
The couple deny being racist and compare the case to "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, was shocked to learn that the new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived for her first day of work in 2016.
"NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, you are not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not
Instead of sending it to her husband, however, she sent it to Mrs. Maurice twice.
After finding out she was flat, a "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman fired Ms. Maurice, saying that their outgoing African-American childhood sweetheart had done a bad job and that she had expected a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Ms. Maurice was paid one day's work and then sent home by Uber.
Now Maurice is suing the couple for damages over the firing and seeking damages of up to $350 a day for the six months, residential employment for which she was initially hired, although without a contract.
"I want to show them, look, you don't do such good", she told the Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination".
The couple replied to claims of being racist, saying that it was the reasonable thing to terminate Maurice's employment, fearing that they would not be able to trust her after insulting her.
"My wife sent her something she didn't mean to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racist people", Joel Plasco told the Post.
"But would you put your children in the hands of someone with whom you were rude, even if it was by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Go now".
Plasco compared the case to extortion, saying that his wife would have a baby in two months and was in a very difficult situation".
"Are you just going after someone?
It's not a very nice thing to do", the investment banker added.
While the case was still ongoing, the court of public opinion was quick to frame the couple on social media and hack them for their behavior and logic.
A new letter reveals that Paddington publishers feared a talking bear would not connect readers
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It is difficult to put yourself in the shoes of someone who reads it for the first time before it is published.
It is very entertaining to know of Paddington's great success".
She said her father would have been furious if his work had been rejected. He had been a BBC cameraman before being inspired to write the children's book about the little toy bear. She added that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication after his death last year was "bitter sweet".
Of Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family", she added that her father was quietly proud of his ultimate success.
"He was quite a quiet man and he was not an apple-picking man", she said.
"But because Paddington was real to him, it was almost like having a child who accomplished something: you're proud of them, even if it's not your job.
I think he considered Paddington's success kind of that way.
Even if it was his creation and imagination, he always gave the honor to Paddington himself".
My daughter was dying and I had to say hello over the phone.
When she landed, her daughter was rushed to Nice's Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad often called to say that it was really bad, that they didn't expect her to do it", said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I get a call from Nad to say that she would die within the next two minutes and that I should have said hello.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, lamb of the heart.
I will be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medication the doctors gave her to keep her heart beating was slowly recovering and leaving her system.
She was dead for a while and the body was closing.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing that it was coming.
I could not whine or scream or cry, because I was in a situation surrounded by families and people.
I really had to hold it together".
Eventually, Mrs. Ednan - Laperouse, who was then grieving the loss of her daughter, joined the other passengers on board the plane - unaware of the ordeal she had gone through.
"No one knew", she said.
"I was shaking my head and the tears were falling all the time.
It's hard to explain, but I got an overwhelming sense of sympathy for Nad on the flight.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her".
Mourning Women Post Cards to Prevent Suicide on the Bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide work to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been posting maps for a while on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers for people to call for support.
Ms. Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day", she said.
Mrs Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said that her son was a promising chef with an infectious smile.
Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said that her smile illuminated any room".
However, he quit his job before he died, because he was in a very dark place.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after he took his own life.
"I'm constantly worried that there will be a domino effect", Ms. Davis said.
Ms Davis designed the maps, "to let people know that there are people out there you can go to and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Do not sit still - you must speak.
Miss Humphreys, who had been a friend of Miss Davies for years, lost Mark, her husband of 15 years, not long after the death of his mother.
"He didn't say he felt sick or depressed or anything", she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He reached the lowest point on Christmas Day - when the children opened their presents, he did not make eye contact or anything with them".
She said that her death was very traumatic for them, but that they had to work through it: "It's ripping a hole through the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we all have to go ahead and fight".

Brett Kavanaugh's future is still uncertain as the FBI investigations begin.
"I thought that if we could actually get something like what he asked for - a timeless investigation that had no scope - we might be able to bring some unity", Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was "falling apart" under entrenched partisan crowds.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their paradox is all due to timing.
The midterm elections are just weeks away, on November 6 - if, as expected, the Republicans are doing poorly, then they will be severely weakened in their efforts to get the man they want elected to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush calls senators to persuade them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House and through whom he met his wife Ashley and was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI delivers its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It's not clear yet whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes on the Senate floor that will allow Vice President Mike Pence to break a tie and take him to the Supreme Court.
North Korea's number of victorious nations declined under Kim
The number of North Korean transfers to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seek cited data from the South's unification cabinet, saying there were 1,127 overtakings last year - up from 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said stricter border controls between North Korea and China and higher tariffs demanded by human smugglers were key factors.
Pyongyang has not commented publicly.
The vast majority of survivors from the North are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flights pass through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the highly-protective demilitarized zone (DMS) between the two Koreas.
China treats the invaders as illegal immigrants rather than refugees, often repatriating them by force.
Relations between the North and the South - still technically at war with each other - have improved markedly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks centered around the strikes on nuclear disarmament.
It came after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore when they agreed to work together in the long term for the nuclear-free Korean Peninsula.
But North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho on Saturday blamed US sanctions for the lack of progress since.
"Without any confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances, there is no way that we unilaterally disarm ourselves first", Mr Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "historic", says he is ineligible to serve on the Supreme Court
House minority leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "historic", saying he was temperamentally unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman ever acted like this, they would say 'historic,'" Pelosi said of her response to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening remarks, Kavanaugh had been very emotional and at times he almost screamed and choked while discussing his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly rejected Democrats on the committee, calling the allegations against him a "ridiculous and coordinated character assassination" organized by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not serve on the Supreme Court because it showed that he was biased against Democrats.
"I think he's making himself unfit with those statements and the way he's been following the Clintons and the Democrats", she said.
Pelosi was skeptical when asked if she would try to sue Kavanaugh if he was confirmed, and if Democrats won the majority in the House.
"I'll say this -- if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's not entitled to be on the Supreme Court, but to be on the court he's on", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about potential Kavanaugh rulings against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade as he was considered a conservative right.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh skipped questions about whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
"It's not the time for a hysterical, prejudiced person to go to court and expect us to say, 'Isn't that great,'" Pelosi said.
And women have to deal with it.
It is a just diatribe, months and years of rage that boils over, and she cannot get out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry", Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
I don't think it's unusual, do you?
She went on, "I was a lot helped by a woman who was an executive somewhere, who also said that she cried when she got angry, but she developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and started crying, she would say to the person she was talking to, "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying".
I am angry".
And then she just walked in.
And I thought it was brilliant".
Tears are permissible as a partial outlet for mourning because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my sharpest memories of my early work in a male-dominated office is one where I once found myself crying in anonymous rage and being grabbed by my neck by an older woman - a cold driver I was a little afraid of - who dragged me into a stairway.
"Never let them see you cry", she told me.
They don't know you're angry.
They think you are sad and will be happy because they have had an effect on you.
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital affair on a boat called Monkey Business and had to leave the races, Mrs. Schroeder, very frustrated, realized that there was no reason why she could not investigate the idea of running for president.
"I didn't think about the decision well", she told me laughing 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was one more.
Someone called it Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
Because it was late in the campaign, she was behind in fundraising, and so she vowed not to enter the races unless she raised $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men, she would receive only $250.
"Do they think I get discounts?" she wondered.
When she gave her speech and announced that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was overwhelmed with emotions - gratitude for the people who supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and target voters rather than delegates, and anger at sexism - that she choked.
You would have thought I had a nervous breakdown, Mrs. Schroeder recalls about the press' reaction to her.
You would have thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they going to put on my tombstone?
"She was crying"?""
How the US-China Trade War May Be Good for Beijing
The opening alvos of the US-China trade war had been overwhelming, and while the battle is far from over, a disagreement between the countries may be beneficial to Beijing in the long run, experts say.
US President Donald Trump issued the first warning earlier this year by taxing key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most striking escalation has been this week, with new tariffs affecting $200 trillion in items and effectively taxing half of the goods entering the US from China.
Beijing has retaliated in goods each time, and recently imposed tariffs of five to 10 percent on $60 trillion of U.S. goods.
China has promised to match the US shot-for-shot and the world's largest economy is not going to move anytime soon.
To get Washington back means to yield to requests, but to publicly comply with US requests would be too much of a disgrace to Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Experts continue to say that if Beijing plays its cards right, pressures on the US trade war over the long term can positively support China by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
The fact that a swift political decision in either Washington or Beijing could create the conditions for an economic boom in any of the countries is actually far more dangerous than what observers have previously admitted, said Abigail Grace, a research assistant focusing on Asia at the Center for New American Security, a thinker.
Syria is ready for refugees to return, says Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is calling for help to rebuild the country devastated by more than seven years of war.
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly that conditions in the country are improving.
Today, the situation at ground level is more stable and secure thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism, he said.
The government continues to restore areas destroyed by terrorists to normal.
All conditions are now in place for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that targeted their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need philanthropic assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome help to rebuild the landslides.
But he stressed that it would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that supported the invasion.
Europe is beating Ryder's victory in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup and Team USA won by a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The US has now lost six straight times on European soil and has not won a European Ryder Cup since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team scored the 14.5 points they needed to win the United States.
US star Phil Mickelson, who struggled for most of the tournament, blew his T-shirt in the water at the par-3 16th hole and handed his game over to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has blinked in all his rounds, becoming one of the first 1-out-4 players ever to go 5-0-0 since the tournament's current format began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was blown 5&4 by the lowest ranked player on the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The world's highest-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 and 1 to land Poulter of England who may have played in his final Ryder Cup.
An eight-time Ryder Cup veteran, Spaniard Sergio Garcia became the tournament's all-time European winner with 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It has been a rough year.
So grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to get the cup back.
It's about the team and I'm glad I could help", said an emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He handed over the torch to fellow American John Ram who won US golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in a single game on Sunday.
The incredible pride I feel, overcoming Tiger Woods, I grew up looking at that guy, " said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods has lost all four of his games in France and now holds a career Ryder Cup record of 13-21-3
A strange statistic by one of the greatest players of all time and he won 14 major titles second only to Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA struggled to find the field all weekend except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau who played high-caliber golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk spoke on behalf of his team after a disappointing performance, saying, "I'm proud of these guys.
There was a time this morning when we put some heat on Europe.
We deleted it.
Keep your hats off for Thomas.
He's a wonderful captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
I'm going to work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee, and we're going forward.
I love these 12 boys and am proud to serve as their captain.
You must keep your hat upside down.
We are overcome.
