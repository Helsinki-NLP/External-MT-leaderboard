Welsh Moms are worried about 'imitating the Muppets'
Some AMs were concerned about the idea that their names should be changed to the MWPs (Members of the Welsh Parliament).
The issue arose because of a plan to change the name of the council to the Welsh Parliament.
AMS in the political world are worried that it could lead to a joke.
A Labour AM said he was concerned that his group would be "faced with TWPP and PWPP".
For readers outside Wales, TWD means foolish in Welsh, and PWD means stupid.
One Plaid AM said the group was "not happy" overall and suggested alternatives.
The Welsh activist said his group had "a clear mind" about the name change, but it was a short wordy leap from MWP to Mepet.
In this context, the Welsh spelling of W is the same as the spelling of the English spelling of U in Yorkshire.
The council's commission, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce similar changes, said: "The final decision on any clarifications as to what the council's members are called is really up to the members themselves".
The Government of Wales Act 2017 empowered the Welsh Assembly to change its name.
In June, a proposal to call the summit the Welsh Parliament published the results of a public consultation that received broad support.
On the issue of appointing MPs, the commission chose the term Members of the Welsh Parliament or WMPs, but the option of the MWP was supported by the public consultation.
The AMs are clearly proposing alternatives, but reaching an agreement could be a headache for the current chair, Ellen Jones, who is expected to table a bill of amendment in weeks.
The amendments include the rules on the expulsion of AMs and the formulation of the committee system, including other changes to the way the Assembly operates.
The AMs will have the final say on who should be named when debating the law.
Macedonians vote to change the name of their country in a referendum
On Sunday, voters will vote to change the name of their country to the Republic of North Macedonia".
The referendum was held to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece over the sovereignty of the independent state of Macedonia.
Athens has long resisted its bid to join the EU and NATO, arguing that the name of its northern neighbor implies a claim to its territory.
Macedonian President George Ivanov, who opposes the name change, says he does not care about the election.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zayev, say the name change is a price to pay for EU and NATO membership.
St. Martin's bells were rung silently as the churches in Haarlem struggled
"The old people I spoke to in history were in coffeehouses and churches on every corner", said Mr. Adam.
"None of them are alive today".
The loss of coffee houses is understandable, he said.
Today, "people are socializing in a different way", he said.
"The coffee houses are no longer the local saloons where people normally go".
As for the churches, the leaders fear that the money from the sale of property will be less than they had expected, "and they are quickly back where they started".
He added that churches could be replaced by apartment buildings filled with communal houses where people live in the same way as the rest of the local temples.
"Many of the people who buy communal housing in this area are white", he explained, "and so we are going to accelerate the closure of these churches because it is not expected that the majority of the people who come to these communal housing will be members of these churches".
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem was a black community - the town's community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The main white Methodist conference emerged in the 1930s.
The Black Council, which recently took over ownership of the building,
St. Martin was held by the Black Council, led by the Rev. John Howard Johnson, who had led a strike against merchants on 125 Main Market Street in Harlem, who were established to hire or foster blacks.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but when Fazer Johnson planned to rebuild the church, he built a musical instrument with bells.
Father David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin, proudly called the unstrung instrument "the bells of the poor".
The instrument, which was played last July, was called by experts as something else: "a cultural treasure" and an irreplaceable "historical instrument".
University of Michigan scholar Tiffany Enge, also played the world's first stringed instrument by black musician Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the large stringed instrument at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Mr. Meriwether, St. Martin did not replace him.
What has been happening in St. Martin's over the past few months is a tale of complex architects and contractors, some of them church leaders and others the diocesan bishop.
The archdiocese - the governing body of the diocese, which is comprised of church leaders - wrote in July that the archdiocese "wants to spend the expenses on the archdiocese", even though it is not involved in the process of hiring architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained that there was a lack of transparency in the diocese.
A 13-year-old boy, Asa, was seriously injured while swimming to catch lobsters in California
A 13-year-old boy was attacked by a whale while trying to catch a lobster in a pond during the lobster season in California on Saturday, officials said.
The incident occurred shortly before 7 a.m. in the town of Insinitas, near the coast of the Beken Sea.
Chad Hamel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was swimming with friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and went to the pool with the team to get him out of the water.
Hamel initially thought it was the joy of catching a lobster, but he said he "understood it was screaming 'I've been bitten!' "
'I have touched you!'
The whole door was opened, and Hamel said he noticed it as soon as he and his son arrived.
"I yelled for everyone to get out of the water: 'There is a shark in the water!'" added Hamel.
The child was airlifted from Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was on the critical list.
The species of the whale responsible for the accident is unknown.
A whale was spotted at the site a few weeks earlier, but was not considered an endangered species, said Larry Giles, a lifeguard at the site.
Gilles added that the victim suffered severe injuries on his upper body.
Authorities closed the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swamy's in Encinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security purposes.
There are more than 135 species of whales in the area, but most are not considered threatened, Gilles said.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK beauty markets
With the help of the staff at Sainsbury's, a large store organized in different sections of boots, supercars and Debenhams, with shelves of stylish beauty items.
As part of a £2.8 billion push to the UK market, which continues to grow as fashion and domestic sales decline, the largest beauty product shelves will be trialled in 11 stores across the country, and if successful, will be rolled out to more stores next year.
Supermarkets that have invested in beauty are now saving shelf space that was once reserved for TVs, heaters and home appliances.
Sensbury said it would double its beauty supply to 3,000 products, including brands like Revlon, EC, Twitzman and Dr. Dre.
From L'Oréal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees, current products will find branded preferences that are similar to those found in stores like Boots.
The supermarket will also relaunch the makeup size of the boutique to make vegetarian-only products, which are highly sought after by most young consumers.
The fragrance retailer is also trying to cut costs at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, south London, last week, and the second, which will open in Sealy Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and buying small portions of food every day where it is convenient means that supermarkets have to work harder to get people to visit them.
Sainsbury's CEO, Mike Coupe, said that the supermarket chain's sales destinations appear to be a large department store organized in a highly fragmented way, in an attempt to compete with Aldi and Lidl, which have more offerings and services and non-food related products.
Sainsbury's has placed argon outlets in hundreds of stores and has introduced several residences that have boosted grocery sales and made the holdings more profitable since buying both chains two years ago.
The supermarket's previous attempt to renovate the beauty and pharmacy stores into a large store organised in different sections failed.
Sensbury had attempted to start with Boots in the early 2000s, but the venture collapsed after a dispute over how to divide the revenue from the grocery stores in the supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury sold its 281-store pharmacy to Lloyd's pharmacy chain owner, Celesio, three years ago for £125 million.
Lloyd's said it will play a role in the plan by adding luxury leather goods brands, including products like LaRoche-Posay and Vincennes, to its extensive portfolio of four stores.
"We have changed the look and feel of our beauty stalls to enhance the environment for our customers", says Paul Mills-Hicks, Salesbury's business director.
We have also invested in specially trained staff who are ready to provide advice.
The variety of brands we have is tailored to suit every need, and its attractive environment and convenient location mean that we are now a compelling beauty destination that challenges the old fashioned fashion".
Peter Jones 'got very angry' after winning a £11 million deal from Holly Willoughby
Dragon's Den star Peter Jones leaves "very angry" after TV presenter Holly Willoughby walked out of her £11 million deal with the lifestyle brand to focus on her new contract with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Wiloogby has no time for their furniture and accessories brand Truli.
The business of the early was connected with the Gup brand of Gweeniez Paltrow.
The 37-year-old woman, who is the host of This Morning, announced on Instagram that she is dating.
Holly Willoughby left her luxury lifestyle brand at the last minute to focus on her new contract with Marks & Spencer and ITV, upsetting Dragon's Den star Peter Jones.
Sources say Jones was "very angry" at a tense meeting at the business empire's headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, when she told the Golden TV Man that her new contract would cost up to £1.5 million and that she would no longer have time to launch their furniture and accessories brand Truly.
The business was linked to the Gup brand of Gweneth Paltrow, and it was estimated that Willoughby's fortune of approximately £11 million had doubled.
When Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones took a jet from the UK to a resort.
A source said, "True Holly was her top priority.
Her longest period of activity was the next decade.
Her decision to leave has absolutely shocked everyone involved.
No one could believe it was Tuesday, it was so close to being started.
The warehouse at the headquarters in Marlow is filled with goods ready for sale.
The breakfast host is one of Britain's most prominent banking stars, and the release of this man will cost the company millions of dollars in everything from trash to underwear, and will also delay his next successful trip, experts believe.
As a result, his long-standing partnership may be over.
Wilogui, a mother of three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have a decade-long relationship with John and his wife, Tara Capp.
Wilogii further strengthened her relationship with CAP in 2016, and John, 52, became chairman in March.
The Caples Holiday Together and Jones own 40% of Baldwin TV Productions.
Willoughby is set to become a brand ambassador for MS, replacing ITV's Anne McPartlin, who was a presenter on AM Celebrity.
Sources close to Jones said that they "do not want to comment on his business" yesterday evening.
After a wonderful conversation, we both fell in love.
He mocked the media criticism of him for making comments that some people did not expect from the president and for thinking something positive about the North Korean leader.
Why does President Trump have a badge?
Trump mocked, "This is the voice of the new news reader".
why did the apostle paul write that the apostles were "the first ones"?
He said Kim was happy with the second meeting, which was the first to be held in Singapore in June and hosted by Trump, and that it was a better way to make North Korea a nuclear-free country.
But it stopped at the nuclear disarmament treaty.
North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho spoke to world leaders at the United Nations, three months after the Singapore summit in June, which the General Assembly said had ignored the North's "irreconcilable response" to the US arms reduction to North Korea.
he said that the us is continuing to impose sanctions with the intention of having an influence on us, on the contrary.
Trump said good things in his long speech.
We are getting along well with North Korea, he said.
We have been leading to war with North Korea before.
Millions could have died.
We have now established good relations.
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim had produced positive results, including the launching of rockets.
When asked about their relationship with Kim, they said they disagreed.
Trump said that it was easier to be president than to have 10,000 people in a crowded hall, and he pointed to the people in front of him, saying that there were now about 200 people in the hall.
Hundreds of people have died in the tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia.
Following the earthquake in Lompoc, it was stated that the NGOs in foreign countries do not need help.
Although 10 percent of Lom Bok's population was killed, no national emergency was declared.
Ms. Sambeng said, "Unfortunately, there are many instances where international assistance is not requested, which is very difficult".
When Save the Children was preparing a team to travel to Palu, it was not clear whether there would be a possibility for foreign experts to enter and work on the site.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, said Indonesian authorities in Palu were looking into the possibility of international agencies entering the area.
Indonesia was unfortunately helpless in the face of this earthquake, as it has been on several occasions.
Although there are a lot of tents in the wake of the tsunami in Incheon, there are not many on other beaches.
The lack of tsunami warning bells in Palau, though not having much effect, was a major factor in the deaths.
In Indonesia, getting from one island to another was not easy, even in the middle of the day.
Natural disasters complicate the logistics.
The ship from the Lom Bok hospital was on its way to help the injured in Palu, but it would take at least 3 days to reach Palu.
President Joko Widodo promised during his election campaign to work on improving Indonesia's infrastructure, and he spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
But the lack of funded individuals is not expected to be a barrier to the Jacoan administration's election next year.
Mr. Joko is under increasing pressure, and a large number of Muslims are becoming conservative.
More than 1,000 people were killed and 10,000 were displaced in the street fighting between Christian and Muslim mafias, who used clubs, bows and other weapons to fight.

Cromwell's Parliament Monument is a good reminder of the history of the building.
What is being done is a kind of justice that is not appropriate and is a kind of justice for the many cultural and religious gifts of England that the Taliban destroyed and gave to the Persians.
The Croomwell community describes Mr. Crick's idea as a hoax and an attempt to rewrite history.
John Goldsmith, a collector for the community of Cromwell, said the current dispute was aimed at removing the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster.
What many do not accept is that the English Civil War was neither ordered nor orchestrated by Cromwell.
Cromwell's weakness can be seen as his disdain for the works of Thomas before him.
Sir William Hamm's description of Cromwell is a testament to 19th century thought and history, and is still held in high regard by many.
Mr. Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was much respected, and in the 19th century in particular, he was much more respected than he is now, for standing up to the pressures from outside Parliament, especially from the Royal Family.
The historical argument that the whole matter is correct will continue to be the case.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid-17th century shaped the fate of our country's further development, and Cromwell is a prominent figure in that division.
His achievements are honored and remembered like a king on his throne.
The killer donkey injured a Chinese farmer to death.
A farmer at a market in southwestern China was attacked by a pig and died, local media reported.
The Morning Post in southern China reported on Sunday that a man named Yuan was found dead in a market in the province of Guizhou, Liu Panshui, after he was found covered in blood.
On May 30, 2005, the owner of a pig farm in the Chinese province of Zhongqing was preparing to inject his pig with a vaccine.
He had gone to market with his cousin last Friday to sell 15 pigs from the province of Yuan.
The next morning, his cousin was found dead in the door of the pig farm next door.
He said that the big pig's mouth was covered in blood.
The forensic investigation confirmed that the pig weighing 550 pounds was the cause of the farmer's death, according to the report.
My cousin's son, Agru, was injured and bloodied. According to the Guliang Evening News, the victim was called 'Wu'.
Security cameras showed Yuan entering the market to feed the pigs at 4.40 am on Thursday.
The body was found an hour later.
It was not Yuen's or his cousin's animal that killed the man.
A police official told the Evening News that the pig was locked in order to prevent harm to other people, adding that police were gathering information.
Yuan's family and market officials are discussing the amount of compensation to be paid to the deceased.
Although there have been occasional cases of pigs attacking humans in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and a man on their farm in Massachusetts, causing the man significant damage.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig was tied to a Welsh farmer's tractor until his wife threatened to drive the animal away.
Pigs are not normally aggressive, but blood can be "triggered", a Manitoba farmer told CBC News, until a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012.
"It's their game.
They are like babies, they ask a lot...they don't hurt you.
You just have to give it the right respect, he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa are expected to bring heavy rain to the southwestern United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the cold coastal waters of northern Mexico.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will bring rainfall that will cause flooding in northern Mexico and the southwestern US.
Rosa had winds of 85 mph, a Category 1 hurricane, as of 5 a.m. eastern time Sunday, and was 385 miles southwest of Punta Yuga, Mexico.
On Sunday, Rosa is expected to head north.
Meanwhile, a storm is forming over the Pacific Ocean and is moving eastward along the U.S. West Coast. Rosa will become a tropical storm on Monday, as it approaches Baja California, and a deep tropical depression will begin to push northward across the southwestern U.S.
Rosa will bring 10 inches of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the tropical moisture combined with an upcoming downpour will cause widespread heavy rainfall in the southwest over the next few days.
1 to 4 inches of rainfall in the area can cause dangerous flash floods, mudslides and landslides in desert areas.
Deep tropical moisture causes rainfall of about 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in southern Nevada and parts of Arizona.
Rainfall is expected to be 2 to 4 inches, especially in most parts of Arizona.
With the nature of tropical rainfall dispersed, there is a possibility of flash flooding with rapidly decreasing conditions.
It is not very wise to go out on foot into the desert when there is a threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rains turn valleys into powerful rivers, and storms bring strong winds and dust storms to the area.
The approaching storm will bring some localized rainfall to portions of the southern California coast.
Over half an inch of rainfall overall can cause moderate flooding and slippery roads.
This could be the first rain of the wet season in the area.
Some scattered tropical showers will begin to approach Arizona on Sunday evening and Monday morning, before the showers begin to spread into Monday night and Tuesday.
Heavy rain in all four corners will continue from Tuesday and till Wednesday.
As the Arctic cools, there may be some strong temperature fluctuations across the US in October, but the tropics remain warm.
Sometimes this causes unexpected changes in temperature over short distances.
A great example of unexpected temperature variations is in the central US on Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of about 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
The summer heat will last for the next few days, and it will try to spread again.
Most of the central and eastern U.S. is expected to have a warm start to October, with about 80 percent of the southern plains to the northeast.
New York City could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, about 10 degrees higher than the average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates that there is a possibility of warmer than average temperatures in the first half of October for the eastern US.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanagh's trial.
More than 20 million people watched the extraordinary testimony of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual assault in the 1980s, on the Six Television Networks on Thursday.
Meanwhile, political protests continue as broadcasters suspend their regular program for a last-minute change Wednesday, a deal brokered by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake to have the FBI conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100% sure that they had drunk caviar at a party at a high school and tried to strip her naked.
Kavanagh said that he was 100% sure that his emotional testimony did not occur.
It is estimated that more than 20.4 million people watched it on Friday, Nielsen reported.
The company was measuring the average viewership of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and Fox Business Network and MSNBC.
The number of other networks that showed it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, was not immediately available.
And Nielsen often has trouble measuring people who see the office.
To put that in perspective, the amount of nominations is the same as a football game or an Academy Award.
Fox News, which had strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, led all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers for the day's hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million viewers.
After the trial, the demand continued at its highest level.
Flake was a central figure in Saturday's drama.
The Republican office of the senator made a statement in support of Kavanaugh, and was filmed on CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning as they tried to arrest Asser to go to the Justice Committee hearing.
They stood for several minutes with their heads bowed to the ground during the protest, as reported live on CNN.
One woman said, "I'm standing right in front of you".
Do they think they are telling the truth to the country?
"Many women have no power, but you have power", she said.
The office issued a statement, Fleck said, and they will be able to say more during the committee hearing before the elevator closes.
Cable and broadcast networks were all providing live coverage as the Judiciary Committee voted to confirm Kavanaugh's nomination for the full Senate.
But Flake said he could do so only if he understood that the FBI would look at the allegations against the candidate next week, as it did when a few Democrats were pushing him.
Flake admitted part of the allegations after speaking with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After consulting with the Counsel and several senators, Flake passed his decision.
The election is a power play, because Republicans are not likely to get the votes they need to approve Cavanagh out of the polls.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into Kavanaugh's allegations.
British Prime Minister May accuses Haydn of "playing politics" over Brexit.
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused the Conservatives of "playing politics" as if her plan to leave the European Union undermines Britain's interests and national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives in Birmingham, UK, for the Conservative Party Conference to be held on September 29, 2018.
In another interview, following the front page of the newspaper, former foreign minister Boris Johnson attacked the Chequers plan, a proposed Brexit deal that would have Britain and the EU collecting their own tariffs, as "totally absurd".
Wade Sims was shot and killed, and police arrested Dayton Simpson, a suspect in the LSU player's disappearance.
Police arrested a suspect in the shooting death of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old former LSU basketball player.
The Baton Rouge Police Department said that Dayton Simpson, 20, was arrested and charged with second-degree manslaughter.
Authorities released a video of the fight between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the beating.
Police recovered the glasses from the scene of the fight and said they found Simpson's remains on them, CBS partner WWAFB reported.
After questioning Simpson, police said they believed Wade was shot to death.
The bond is $350,000, according to The Advocate.
The East Bethlehem Parish Coroner's Office released an initial report on Friday that the cause of death was a bullet wound to the neck from the head.
The department said that the Luzan State Police's Special Force on the Fugitive, the State Police Criminal Laboratory, the Southern University Police and local citizens contributed to the arrest of the suspect.
"LCU athletic director Joe Aleva thanked the local law enforcement for their diligence and for their commitment to justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-6 forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 assists per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said that the team was "extremely hurt" and "in shock" by Wade's injury.
"This is what you're always worried about", Wade said.
Volcanic ash in Mexico City
Ash from the Popocatépetl volcano has reached the southern neighborhoods of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to avoid the area after the volcano erupted in the crater, reporting 183 gas emissions in 24 hours.
The center was monitoring several severe thunder and tremors.
Images from social media showed ash flows covering car roofs in Mexico City's neighborhoods such as Zochimil.
Geophysicists have detected activity on a volcano 45 miles (72 kilometers) from the capital after a 7.1-magnitude earthquake rocked central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, called "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan protesters ahead of the independence vote anniversary.
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with police, and thousands joined them in protesting against the anniversary of Catalonia's independence vote.
During the strike, which was covered in eggs and paint powder, masked pro-separatist groups, led by the police, created a cloud of dust on the streets, which is often flooded by visitors.
Later in the day, a fight broke out and the police used sticks to stop the fight.
For hours, pro-secession groups chanted "no forgetting, no forgiving", while pro-unity chanted "Long live Spain".
According to local newspaper, fourteen people were treated for minor injuries.
After the referendum of October 1st was declared illegal in Madrid and was respected by the rebels, tensions in the region of the independence movement continued to escalate.
The number of people who voted against the coup was low compared to the number of people who voted against the coup, but the voters chose to be free.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in violent clashes across the region last year as police tried to stop the voting at polling stations.
Pro-independence groups spent the night on Friday preventing a planned demonstration in support of the National Police.
The protest was held but in a different way.
Narcissus Termes, 68, an electrician who marched with his wife in the protest, said there was no hope for Catalonia's independence.
"Last year was one of the best years of our lives.
I saw my parents happy to vote, but now we have stopped", he said.
Despite a useful but narrow victory in the local elections last December, the parties that promote Catalan separatism have struggled to maintain the momentum that most of their prominent leaders have had, either undergoing persecution themselves or in prison awaiting trial for their role in the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
The clash was sparked by politicians on both sides, said Hwan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who was recording the rally in support of the police by phone.
"It's becoming more stressful", he explained.
Oriol Juanqueveras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in pretrial detention since last year, announced Saturday that he will run in the European Parliament elections next year.
"We have seen from the Spanish government that participating in the European elections as a candidate can help to observe and understand the pressures that arise when democratic values are weakened", he said.
London: Man arrested after carjacking home
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested in Londonderry after a car repeatedly hit a house.
The incident was reported in the Ballynagard Crescent around 19:30 BST on Thursday.
According to Inspector Bob Blemings, the gate and the building were damaged.
It is believed that an arrow was fired at a part of the vehicle.
The attack from the crowd allowed Levenstein to win 1-0 against Rangers.
Dolly's first goal ensured Livingstone's victory.
He surprised the Rangers by signing the grown-up Living Stone Rangers coach, Jared, who had lost just two of his 18 games.
Dolly's attack forced Hibernian, who are backed by Gary Holtz, to finish second.
Zard faced the eight-point leader Hertz next Sunday, who had not won an away game in the Premiership.
Before that, Rangers will host Rapid Vena in the Europa League.
Levin Stone continued his progress in six games without defeat under head coach Holt, replacing his former coach Kenny Miller.
Living Stone missed his chance in the match against the visiting team, the Bullets.
Holt's team must use the Rangers' lack of goals to expand their range.
Scott Robinson was seen turning his face to the goal in a high-powered attack, while Alan Lithgow was seen only trying to catch the carriage-bound passes for the Carrig Hackets.
The concern of the Balmeade team is that the Rangers may be distracted by the visiting team playing with them.
The role of ethics is crucial to the critical goal.
The Rangers got a perfect penalty, and Living Stone was joined by Declan Gallagher and Robinson, with Menga taking the ball from them from midfield to the goal.
At that time, the Rangers were better in ball control, but they were able to defend and the stability of goalkeeper Liam Kelly was superior.
Although the situation remained the same, Alfredo Morelos used force against Kelly.
Alan McGregor and LeGeau clash with Livingston players after Scott Pittman tackles an injured Rangers goalkeeper.
Livingstone's goal line was easily overtaken and he was under pressure from Glenn Middleton's replacement, with two perfect penalty chances, one of which was in his hand.

The Livingstone Effect and Effect of Event
The precaution of humanity to leave no trace is very impressive.
Especially after coming to the leadership, his playing style and movement did not change much, but the energy he created in the team that he joined the team is much appreciated.
He has many heroes.
Amble Hulket was a giant, and especially successful in organizing the defensive section; otherwise, Manga had tried Connor Goldson and Joy Warell.
The Rangers' motivation for games was down.
While they were good under Zard, they were not as good as the standards set.
The last balls are problematic, after the pressure is not effective, which makes the team to be in the middle of the table and think.
Ordoğan was given a special welcome by Colony.
On Saturday, September 29, the leaders of Turkey and Germany had breakfast in Berlin, with clear skies and much to be cheered.
President Erdogan's controversial visit to Turkey, which was supposed to strengthen ties with NATO, came to an end today.
They also discussed human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the European Union.
Ordoğan travelled to Cologne to inaugurate a large mosque.
The city is home to many Turks living outside of Turkey.
On the contrary, a large number of the president's supporters openly went to see their leader, while the police explained why he killed 25,000 strong demonstrators who marched in front of the mosque.
Hundreds of Erdogan's opponents, many of them Kurdish, have voiced their condemnation of Erdogan's policies and Germany's decision to accept him.
The strong opposition is the difference between those who see the visitors as heroes and those who see them as dictators.
Deppford road accident: A cyclist who collided with a car dies.
A cyclist was killed after colliding with a car in London.
The accident occurred at 10:15 BST on Deptford Road, a heavily trafficked road in the southeast of the city, at the junction of Best Wood and Eblin Streets.
The driver stopped the car and tried to get the victim help, but the man died instantly.
The accident occurred on Childers Road, months after another cyclist died in a hit-and-run accident a mile from Saturday's crash.
The Metropolitan Police said that the police were working to arrest the man and would report the results.

Long Larten Prison: Six officers were injured in the riot.
According to the prison, six prison guards were injured in the disturbance that occurred in the men's section of the prison, which was not highly protected.
The disturbance was reported to have occurred at 09:30 BST on the HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire, and has not yet taken off.
The special police force "Tornado" arrived at the scene and investigated the disturbance, which was confirmed to have involved eight prisoners and a group of people.
Police officers who suffered minor facial injuries during the disturbance were provided medical treatment.
A spokesman for the prison said: "HMP Long Lartin has been told that it plans to deploy a specially trained prison task force that can prevent future similar problems.
Six correctional staff members are being treated for injuries.
"we will not tolerate the disturbance in the prison, and we will also inform the police of those who do not feel responsible and we will make them stay longer in the court".
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 members, including some of the most dangerous defendants in the country.
The prison administrator pointed out that they were hospitalized in June after being attacked by a gang member.
In October last year, police officers were brought to the prison after a violent riot broke out in the prison after the prison staff attacked the prison with a pool ball.
The storm, nicknamed Rosa, could cause flooding in Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City, but could benefit areas hit by drought.
A tropical depression is not expected to hit Arizona, but flooding similar to that of the previously-missing Rose hurricane could occur in the southwestern desert area, affecting off-grid infrastructure.
The National Weather Service forecasted flooding Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, and in Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City, including Phoenix.
Following the heavy rains that began on Monday, Rosa is expected to bring the Gsgaeson to Phoenix on Tuesday.
The National Weather Service tweeted about Phoenix, "Since 1950, ten tropical cyclones that have swept the city of Phoenix, one of a kind and 200 miles wide, have threatened residents with flooding and flooding".
The 1967 hurricane Katrina devastated the AZ region for 40 miles".
The National Hurricane Center recently released a model that predicts 2 to 4 inches of rain, with up to 6 inches of rainfall, especially on the Mogollon coast of Arizona.
Others, especially the southeastern parts of the Bahamas, as well as the central Rockies, will receive 1 to 2 inches of rain, while the Great Basin may receive up to 4 inches of rain in total.
For areas that are free of flood risk and have experienced drought for several seasons, the rains can be seen as a good opportunity.
Although the floods are strong, the rainfall is expected to be beneficial for some areas currently affected by drought, such as the southeast.
As reported by weather.com, "40 percent of Arizona is experiencing the worst drought on record, and this is the second-strongest drought on record".
The first tropical storm, Rosa, made its way to the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico, causing landslides.
Strong Rosa will begin 385 miles south of Punta Iguazú, traveling through Mexico Sunday morning with maximum sustained winds of 85 miles per hour and continue northward at 12 miles per hour.
The storm is cooling the waters of the Pacific, causing a meltdown.
The intensity of tropical flooding is expected to cause landslides in Mexico on Monday afternoon and afternoon.
Heavy rain is expected in parts of Mexico, followed by severe flooding.
"A total of 3 to 6 inches of rain is expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, and up to 10 inches when it passes through", according to weather.com.
Rosa will continue its journey north through Mexico before reaching the Arizona coast on Tuesday morning, and then arriving in Arizona and southern Utah on Tuesday evening.
"The main threat to the rose and the weather that is expected to follow it is a very strong rainfall that is expected to fall in Baja California, northwestern California and throughout the desert southwest", according to the National Hurricane Center.
This rainfall is expected to threaten lives, cause flooding, and cause landslides, especially in mountainous areas, with flooded debris accumulating in desert areas.
The Midsomer Norton attack: Four attempted assassinations have failed, including one in which a woman was killed.
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of murder following the stabbing of a 16-year-old boy in Somerset.
The young boy was found injured at the Excelsior Yard in Midsomer Norton, on Saturday at 04:00 BST.
He was taken to hospital with "non-movable injuries".
Police said the suspects, aged 17, 18 and 20, were arrested overnight in Rathrock, Avon and Somerset.
Police are appealing to anyone who has left a mobile phone to help them in their work.
Trump said that Kavanaugh was "too tired, too uncooperative and too disrespectful to the Democratic Party".
"To vote for Senator Kavanaugh is to give the Democratic Party a platform for the following cruel and dishonorable tactic", Trump said at a campaign rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh "has been a disruptor and irritant to the democratic process".
Cavanaugh, who was on Thursday before the congress, responded to a sexual assault allegedly committed by Christine Blasey Ford when she was a child, decades ago, with a strong emotional response.
Ford added evidence to the charges.
"The American people have seen the bravery, efficiency and initiative of Kavanaugh", the president said on Saturday.
"Voting for the legal expert Kavanaugh is like voting for the best legal mind of our time and giving a public service position to a lawyer", he told supporters in West Virginia.
The president has said a lot about Kavanaugh's nomination, either directly or indirectly, in order to gain support in the upcoming midterm elections.
"Five weeks have passed since the most important election of our lifetime.
"I'm not running, I'm running well", he said.
"That's why I'm ready to fight with the top candidates everywhere".
Trump opposed the Democrats' mission to "resist and destroy".
The first practical election for Kavanaugh's candidacy will be held before Friday in the Senate, the senior leadership of the Grand Old Party told CNN.
Hundreds of people have died in the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, and the death toll is expected to rise.
An official said on Sunday that at least 384 people were killed and many more were missing after the Indonesian island of Sulawesi was hit by a tsunami and waves washed ashore.
In the city of Palu, hundreds of people were stranded at a beach festival on Friday, while a wave of 6 meters or 18 feet high washed away everything it had, including those who were enjoying the sunset in the evening, causing many deaths and damage.
A 7.5 magnitude earthquake followed the tsunami that hit the area.
"When the tsunami threat was announced yesterday, many people were doing their normal activities like they were on the beach, and they didn't even try to run away, and they were killed", said Supotopo Purwo Nugroho, an official with Indonesia's disaster management agency BNPB, in a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come by itself, it was just cars, poles, houses, everything on the ground", Nogueño said, adding that the tsunami was travelling at 800 km/h (497 mph) over the entire ocean before it hit the coast.
A few people managed to survive the tsunami by climbing a tree, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 stations in Palau.
The disaster agency's aerial photographs show that several buildings and shops were destroyed, bridges were broken and a mosque was surrounded by water.
A light earthquake continues to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The quake was felt by an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology and Application Assessment said in a statement that the earthquake in Arbu was 200 times more powerful than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The city's location on a long, narrow waterway would have made the tsunami more likely, he said:[2]
The destruction was "extensive", according to N'Goo, with thousands of rented homes, hospitals and shops destroyed.
The bodies of the victims were found under the rubble of the collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 people were missing.
The death and destruction could be higher in the coastal area of Donggala, 300 km (190 miles) north of Palau, where the earthquake was felt.
No information could be exchanged from the Donggala area, according to N'goho, due to the fact that communication devices were out of order.[2]
The Red Cross said in a statement that more than 300,000 people live in the area, adding that staff and volunteers had been directed to the site.
"This is very sad", he said, "but it could be worse".
The agency was criticized for not providing information about the tsunami, even though the authorities had warned that the wave had arrived earlier.
A video posted on social media by an amateur shows a man on a building announcing the approaching tsunami with a loud and frightening voice.
Within minutes, a towering tsunami swept across the coast, sweeping away cars and buildings
Reuters was unable to immediately confirm the video.
The earthquake knocked out power lines in the Palu area, making rescue work difficult.
The military is flying relief supplies from Jakarta and other cities, officials said, but the displaced are desperate for food and other basic assistance.
the city's airport reopened for emergency use only, but will remain closed until october
The city's airport has reopened for emergency operations only, but will remain closed until October.
The Indonesian tsunami killed more than 800 people.
It is very bad.
The World Vision team in Donggala arrived safely in Palu, where the team was hiding in tents, but faced many dangers on their way, Mr. Doseba said.
"They told me that many houses were unusable", he said.
It is very bad.
It was also complained that when aid workers were preparing to begin their recovery, some highly experienced foreign nationals were denied entry to Palu.
According to Indonesian law, foreign aid can only come after the disaster area has been declared a national disaster area.
This has not yet been done.
"It is now recognized as a threat to the state", said Auliya Ariani, spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"If the government declares it a national emergency, we will open ourselves to international help, but we will not be able to do anything".
On the second day after the earthquake and tsunami on Saturday, friends and family of those lost in the dark and terrible disaster are hoping for a miracle.
A small child was found in a flooded ditch on Saturday.
On Sunday, a woman was rescued after being trapped under the rubble for two days.
Indonesia's paragliding team coach Gendon Sebandono was training two paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended this month, but both were lost in the accident.
Others arrested in Rowa Rowa and Tel were students of his, including Mr. Mandangi.
"As a paragliding expert, I am personally under a lot of stress and pressure.
Mr. Gendon sent a WhatsApp message to the Palu competitors at the Beach Festival, saying that the situation had already been circulated by the paragliding community after hearing the news of the Rowa Rowa Hotel collapse.
He was able to get only one grey check and one blue check.
" That means the messages didn't get through, " he said.
Thieves stole $26,750 from an ATM while it was refilling in Newport on the Live
Thieves stole $26,750 from an ATM of a Brink's employee in Newport on the Live, according to Newport police.
The driver of the vehicle was opening the ATM at the resort and preparing to deposit the full amount of cash, Detective Dennis McCarty said in a press release.
He said that a man, who was busy with his work, came from behind and ran with the money in his bag.

Anyone with information about the identity of the persons can report it to 859-292-3680.
[1Kanya West: The rapper changed his name to Ye:
Rapper Kanye West is changing his name to Kanye West.
He tweeted about the change on Saturday, saying, "The individual whose name is Kanye West on the record".
The 41-year-old West was briefly nicknamed Y, and the moniker was used for his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes ahead of Saturday's release of his new album, Yandhi.
The show's producer announced that Ariana Grande was scheduled to perform on the day but cancelled "due to unrest" and would perform instead.
He had previously said that the term had a religious connotation, although it was a professional acronym of the time.
"I believe the word "you" is used more than once in the Bible. It was in an interview with Big Boy radio station that he said, "You are the one who is the most important thing in the Bible".
" So here I am you, I am we, and this is us.
From the word "Kanya" or "the only one" to the word "Y" or "us", the goodness, the badness, the controversy and the reflection of our own things.
The album is mostly a reflection of who we are.
He is one of the many rappers who have changed their names.
Sean Combs has been called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, D.D. at various times, and this year he announced that he would prefer Love or Love Brothers.
Former West collaborator Jay-Z calls him JAY-Z as a catapult and Dash on the stage, or not.
Mexico's MLO has pledged not to use military force against the people
In his speech on the 50th anniversary of the brutal and vengeful attack on students by Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, he vowed that the same atrocities will not be perpetrated by the armed forces.
López Obrador, who on Saturday in the Plaza de Latelló vowed "to never use military force to oppress Mexican citizens", said:
The same square was the scene of the massacre of peaceful demonstrators on October 2, 1968, when leftist politics began to take root in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support Mexican youth by providing monthly stipends to those attending universities and opening more free public universities.
He also said that unemployment and lack of educational institutions are leading young people to organized crime.
USA must double funding for artificial intelligence
Kai-Fu Li, an investor and artificial intelligence expert from Google, Microsoft and Apple, said that as China is increasing its involvement in artificial intelligence, the United States should spend twice as much on research and development as it does now.
The comments come after various US government entities released AI announcements, and the country lacks even an artificial intelligence strategy.
However, China announced its goal last year to become No. 1 in the field of artificial intelligence by 2030.
"While doubling may be a good start, while other countries are so slow, we are working to make a positive difference", Li said.
Doubling the funding would make the next breakthrough in the United States, Li said in an interview with CNBC this week:
Li's book, Artificial Intelligence Superpower is Leaping China, Silicon Valley and New World Order, was published this month by Hoghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Sinovation Ventures, one of China's most prominent artificial intelligence companies, and Face++.
He worked on the American Otello player, the highest-ranking artificial intelligence system at Carnegie Mellon University in the 1980s, and then went on to serve as the CEO of Microsoft Research and the Google China branch.
As Lee noted earlier, the US government is using the agency's contribution to technology competitions such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge to identify the next generation of visionaries and ask when similar competitions will be held.
Researchers in the United States have to work harder to win government funding, he said.
"It's not China that is taking away corporate leaders, it's the companies", Li said.
Facebook, Google and Microsoft have recruited promising students to work on artificial intelligence.
Changes to immigration police will have a greater impact on China's artificial intelligence efforts, Li said.
"I think that a green card should be prepared for students working on artificial intelligence PhDs", Li said.
The Chinese State Council launched the Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Program in July 2017.
China's National Natural Science Foundation funds educational institutions, much like the National Science Foundation and other government foundations fund researchers in the United States, but the quality of Chinese educational work is poor, Li says.
Earlier this year, the US Defense Department established a joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which will allow industry and academia to engage, and the White House announced the creation of a separate committee on artificial intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced that it has allocated $2 billion for the Artificial Intelligence Next project.[2]
NSF will invest $100 million in research and development of artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, the US legislation to create a National Security Commission has not registered any activity this month.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on whether to change the country's name
Last Sunday, Macedonians voted in a referendum to decide whether the country should be called the Republic of North Macedonia, a move that is expected to end the country's decades-long dispute with Greece, which has kept it out of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, whose territory bears the same name as Macedonia, used its right to vote to block the country from joining NATO and the European Union.
The two countries reached an agreement on the name in June, but it has been opposed by nationalist activists who say it diminishes the identity of the majority Slavic people of Macedonia.
President georgie ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, but a similar campaign of non-voting raised concerns that the referendum would not reach the required 50 percent.
The question on the ballot paper reads: "Stop the negotiations with Greece and choose to join NATO and the European Union".
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is the price to be paid for Macedonia's advancement as a member of NATO and the European Union, which is among the Yugoslav states that rejected the referendum.
"I came here today to choose what is best for my country for tomorrow, especially the young people of Macedonia, who live in freedom under the shadow of the European Union, because it allows us all to live a comfortable life", said Olivera Geogjevaska, 79, in a speech in Skopje.
He said that even though it is not required by law, a sufficient number of members of parliament will be governed by the votes cast and will accept it as decisive.
The name change must be approved by two-thirds of the members of the parliament.
The country's Election Commission said that there were no problems related to the elections at 1 p.m.
The opposition to the parliamentary elections was 16 percent, compared to 34 percent last year, but this time 66 percent of those registered to vote did.
"I came to vote because of my children, my home is Europe", Jossi Tanscheski, 62, who voted in the capital Skopje, said.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko voted in a referendum on changing the country's name on September 30, 2018, which would help it join NATO and the European Union.
In front of the Parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov, who was seen with protesters, set up a small stage and arranged chairs in front of the tent.
"we are with NATO and the EU, but when we join, we will stand tall, not be a tool for others", said Kovadakov.
"We are a poor nation, but we have dignity"
If we are not accepted as Macedonia, we will turn our faces to China and Russia and join the Eurasian combination".
Prime Minister Zaev said that becoming a NATO member country would bring a lot of investment opportunities to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is more than 20 percent.
"I believe that more than 80 percent of our citizens will support the European Union and NATO", Zaev said after casting his vote.
He said the "yes" result is proof of the next time".
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Police Research Institute showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum, while the number of those who did not vote was lower.
Another poll by Macedonian TV, Telema TV, found that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote next Sunday.
70% of the respondents said they would vote "yes".
For the referendum to be successful, one answer must receive 50 percent plus one vote.
The referendum's failure is the first failure of a policy that has been in the interest of the Western government and has been in operation since May of last year.
Watch: Manchester City's Aguero scoring a goal as he struggles to keep Brighton's defenders on the edge
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling were the first to be sent off in a 2-0 win over Brighton at the Etihad Stadium in England on Saturday.
Aguero was happy as a fool after scoring a goal in the 61st minute.
The Argentine striker was given a good ball from the midfielders near the start of the game.
He was racing with three Brighton defenders before the raid.
Aguero then found himself among four green badges.
Brighton was hit by a defender before entering the goal zone.
He then went to the Sterling on the left.
After the English striker received the ball directly back to Aguero, who had reached the goal line, Aguero kicked the ball with his right foot and scored a goal on the right side against Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan on Wednesday.
"Aguero was playing against his injury", Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about playing 55 or 60 minutes in advance.
That's what it is.
"We are lucky to score in that situation"
Sterling was the first to make the first shot for the Blue Jays in a difficult Premier League game.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball in a difficult situation in Brighton's goal area.
He then gave a beautiful welcome to Leroy Sane on the left wing.
Sane pushed the ball forward to attack Sterling, who was a little further away.
The Blue Water Blues expressed their happiness after scoring a goal in the forward pass and slipping out of the field.
The team will play against Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage match at Rhen Neckar Stadium in Sinsch, Germany, at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday.
Scherzer wants to play with Spoiler: The Rockies
If the Nationals are out of the game, there is no reason to start again.
We predicted that the season opponent, Scherzer, would take the lead in the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but that would be the case if the Rockies, who have a one-game lead in the NL West, were out of the game.
The Rockies won the Nationals on Friday with an unprecedented 5-2 victory to retain their first place.
"Although we are playing without any budget, I have been expecting the number of mountains in Denver and the team to play at a high level this year, so I better quit playing.
Why I Didn't Want to Compete"
The Nationals are expected to hide the starter for the week, but the chances of a shorter pitch are expected to be weighed.
Scherzer, expected to start for the 34th time, is expected to pitch Thursday and prepare for the next one on Sunday.
Washington's Wright Hunters are 2/3 of the way through the season with a 2.53 ERA, 18-7 and 300 strikeouts in 200.
Trump's West Virginia rally
The president cited the Supreme Court's selection of Brett Kavanaugh and said it was important that the Republicans win by half a vote.
"Everything we did in November was done in vain.
Five weeks have passed since the most important election we have ever made in our lives.
This is one of the big ones: I am not running, I am running well, that is why I am everywhere to be the best candidate.
Trump continued, "Look at this horrible group of Democrats writing scary stuff, and notice what's happening.
In addition, they are trying to seize power by using all possible options. You see their vanity and corruption.
"They don't care if anyone hurts them as long as they have power in their hands, they want to have power and control, and we won't give it to them".
According to him, "Democrats are on a mission to resist and destroy".
"You see, for the last four days, he's been calling the Democrats "angry, worthless, ignorant, and liars".
He named the Senate Legislative Committee and called the Senate Democrat Danny Fensett, and there was a huge outpouring of support from the audience.
"Do You Remember What I Said?
Did the document fall out of your hand?
Uh-uh what
"No way, oh no way, give me a chance - that's bad sign language, the worst sign language I've ever seen in my life".
There is no abuse of the church's workforce.
people who say everything in their minds are impatient.
I am surprised that so much of the work done by my party is not recognized.
I am better than Minar when it comes to the Labour MPs, but I am not accepted. They all talk about what we think.
My colleague John Ryan has been subjected to the same sort of thing, because she has been the target of a deliberate campaign of discrimination.
I have hosted many shows in the campaign of exclusion that I have launched because I disagree with Jeremy Corbyn.
The issue of responsible economic policy, national security, and other similar issues that have been at odds with the leaders of Europe and Germany
As the Nottingham East Labour Conference announced last Friday, "we want the conference to be inclusive and productive".
Friday night's GC meeting was the best in my eight years as a Labour MP.
Today, unfortunately, it may not be the voice of many conferences, and "good, young" politics has been raised many times, if not more recently.
There is a growing dislike for extreme views in the Labour Party, and ideas are only accepted if they are approved by the party leadership.
This started after the Germain administration, and when I was with him, I thought I could take power by accepting and supporting the same political views, even if I disagree with national security or the EU single market.
when i speak in public, my words don't cause any problems. what causes problems is the misinformation on social media, the anti-political ideas and the ideas that say that i should not continue in labor.
And this is not my experience.
Of course, I believe I'm luckier than my friends, because the comments that come to me are political.
I personally admire his profession and the work of my colleagues who face the harsh sexual and racial abuse they face every day.
What is so irritating about politics is that the amount of influence it receives is so common.
Jeremy Corbyn suggested last week that the Labour Party should develop a culture of tolerance.
The truth is that there is no such thing as the greatest faith, and every non-trust motion to change the electoral law will only weaken the party.
"I have been advised to lower myself and not be a big shot for the past two years, and now I am successful"
But I didn't bring that into politics.
When my grades started to decline after joining Lebron as a student 32 years ago, inspired by the Thatcher government, I thought I could become a local councillor or a government minister to serve several in the Public Service.
I did not hide my political views, including the last election.
No one in West Nottingham is confused by my policy position and disagrees with the current leadership.
I want to say to all those who supported the motion on Friday that I cannot afford to waste time and money on the BRE exits, knowing that it would harm the country's living conditions, business and public utility services based on my loyalty to the Labor Party.
I have a message, not to stop the Nottingham movement, but to the Constitution, whether it is for the Labour Party or the other: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat or political convenience will stop me from doing what I believe is right for your needs.
Chris Leslie is the MP for West Nottingham.
Ayr 38  17 Mellos: The undefeated Ayr went to another
The two late ones are close to the final, but Ayr will undoubtedly finish the day's Tennis Premiership.
They are leading the table with ten games of unbeaten play.
Finally, the strong defensive unit and the ability of the players to take advantage of good opportunities helped them win on the field, and coach Peter Murchey was pleased.
"We have played many games and have not lost a game, and I am happy about that", he said.
"Thanks to Ayr, they created better chances than us", said Mollers Robin Christie.
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute try by Fraser Climb changed the scoring to Ayr's advantage, but the yellow card by Scottish forward Rory Hughes gave the Warriors the lead, allowing Melrose to move better and Jason Bat to try for goals that were not possible.
Climo scored a goal that confirmed Ayr's lead near the end of the half with a perfect penalty, and then scored another goal with his own effort to lead the team to a 17-5 record.
Melrose started the second half well, and Patrick Anderson made the difference to five points, which would have been widened by a change of tackle.
After a long-term injury to Ruard Knott, who was out of action from the start, Ayr was able to hold on to the lead with Stafford McDowell, who was led by Climo.
When Ayr's good-moving Blair Maperson saw a yellow card, Melrose replaced Colvin with a stronger goal to end the game.
Despite the field advantage, Struan Hitchens was sent off for a yellow card after Clemon was out of the penalty area, with Ayr MacPherson, who had the lead, being hit from behind.
A light earthquake continues to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The star of the game is still considering another career, in the restaurant industry.
The current star of the game, Ford Kerren, is considering a move to the hospitality industry and will be named director of the licensed restaurants company after it is formed.
Jack Jarvis, 56, starred in the popular BBC show, written by and starring his longtime friend Greg Hemp.
The organizers said the upcoming ninth round will be the show's final tour and will feature Kiran's next project after Krag Lang.
He is the director of Adrift Morn Limited, as the official records show.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a Scottish Sun source gave a hint that he was looking for Kearny to take part in Glasgow's "successful restaurant business".
'The sea is ours', Fede Hossa hopes that the way will open up for Bolivia, a landlocked country with no sea port, to connect with the Pacific.
The sailors seized a ship carrying machinery in the capital Lapp.
The water of public buildings was raised to the blue flag.
From Lake Titicaca, the main sites of the Amazon are marked with the words: "By law, the sea is ours.
It is our duty to restore it".
The memory of the bloody 19th century famine in landlocked Bolivia is still fresh, and the desire to take over the Pacific Ocean is showing itself without the coast being taken by Chile.
These promises were high for decades before Bolivia filed a lawsuit on October 1st at the International Court of Justice in Galgalaga after five years of relief.
"Bolivia must look at the future with strength, unity and freedom from tension", said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will be able to see the ICJ decision on the big screens in the country, hoping that the trial in the Hague will decide that Chile is the sovereign owner of the sea, a decision that has not produced results in decades.
Bolivia, meanwhile, is not in the mood to accept the controversial and controversial Bolivian president Evo Morales' decision to run for re-election next year.
"We are getting very close to the Pacific Ocean", he said last August.
But some analysts expressed their belief that the court's decision would not be a victory for Bolivia, and if it did, things would change.
The United Nations body, which is based in the Netherlands, has no authority to determine the boundaries of Chileans, nor does it have the authority to determine the outcome of any talks.
The international law expert Paz Zarrat of Chile said that the decision of the International Court of Justice, six months after the conclusion of the last case of the two, "shows that the case is not serious".
The causes of the list of Bolivia can take us back to the last four years.
"The issue of access to the sea has been blocked by the Bolivian administration", he said today.
In her speech, Morales's opponent said that the decision would protect the honor of Chileans.
Bolivia and Chile seem to have a hard time talking about the weather.
Since 1962, two countries have not exchanged ambassadors.
Former President Rodriguez Valtz, who represented Bolivia at the Hague, said the speed with which the court was sentencing was unusual.
"Monday will be a new chapter in Bolivia's relations with Chile, one that will put aside the last 139 years of conflict and work to benefit both countries", he said.
Morals, one of the most prominent presidents in Latin America, said that Calza de la Reina was using the maritime issue to create political fever.
"Bolivia will not give up its legal right to use the Pacific Ocean", he added.
"The decision is a good opportunity to resolve the past"
North Korea says it is unthinkable to give up nuclear weapons unless the US is convinced
North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, said that the country would not give up its nuclear weapons unless it first gains confidence in the United States.
He was speaking at the United Nations General Assembly last Saturday.
The United States must keep its promises, as promised by the leaders of the great powers at the Singapore Summit.
His comments came as the United States, three months after the UN Secretary General held talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore, was trying to restart a now-forgotten nuclear diplomacy.
The continuation of the sanctions, Ri said, is a "nightmare", adding that the US refusal to accept the end of the Korean War is a "failure" for North Korea.
The US is skeptical that Pyongyang will make a meaningful arms reduction deal.
Both Kim and US President Trump want a second round of talks.
Pyongyang is not expected to make cuts in order to protect its security, which has led to widespread suspicion.
Pompeo is scheduled to visit Pyongyang next month and facilitate a second round of Kim and Trump talks along the way.
The Paris Fashion Show has unveiled the industry's achievements with a number of headwear presentations.
If you want to upgrade your helmet collection or protect yourself from the sun, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown have designed a large-size hat for their SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week, which they hope will inspire their next creation.
This winter, Instagram is awash with unusable hats, and designers are turning their eye-catching invention into a catwalk.
The hat made by Valentino was a masterpiece, with a long, feather-like frame.
Other large hats, such as the witch's hat, were decorated with treasure and pineapples, but were not designed to provide head warmth.
Tom Brown also suggested that people wear unusual masks for the holidays.
Other masks in different colors are made to look more like Hannibal Lester than his lip and other items.
While one invention looks like scuba diving and is filled with snorkel and goggles, the rest look like cone-shaped melted ice cream.
If you continue to visit the big fashion show, you're lucky, indeed.
As fans of the style have already guessed, the numerous hats with ties to their beards attract a lot of attention.
The long, wide hat, made of saffron and two feet long, from the long hill called 'La Bomba' was found in Rihanna to Emiliara Tajkowski and many others.
The unique hat cut size is considered the best innovation since the cat, which has attracted the attention of many on social media, and a bag with a pale yellow color is made as large as a swimsuit.
At Paris Fashion Week, the collection of the Ravera SS19 was presented in a black orange bag with a white laser strap, with a fringe on the top.
As the famous stylist Luc Armtage told FEMAIL: 'I expect to see big hats and beach bags on the main road next summer - the designer has made a huge impact, so it's hard to say that there won't be a demand for these large-sized specialties.'
John Edward: For global citizens, language skills are useful.
Private schools in Scotland have maintained academic performance and achieved record highs in 2018, thanks to the hard work of individuals and groups in sports, art, music and other community-based activities.
With over 30,000 students, the Scottish Council of Independent Schools is committed to providing excellent service to students and parents.
Private schools are working with the aim of preparing their students for the career and place they have chosen for further higher education as citizens.
The status of modern languages, as a curriculum, has become a subject of choice in schools, including the education specialist.
Nelson Mandela said, "Let the ability to understand be like the ability to speak to the speaker.
Be of one mind when you speak to the speaker of the language".
It should be borne in mind that we should not rely on English alone to establish relationships and build trust with the people of other countries.
The results of this year in private schools are the languages that have been shown to pass the highest according to the league table.
68% of the students have achieved A in foreign languages.
Data collected from SCIS and focused on 74 member schools showed that 72 percent of students with the highest A grades studied Mandarin, 69 percent French, and 63 percent Spanish.
This shows that private schools in Scotland believe that foreign languages are important for the future of children and young people.
Currently, private schools are teaching STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curriculum and in other languages.
A survey conducted by the UK's Workforce Recruitment and Skills Commission found that 17 percent of employees found it difficult to fill out forms in job advertisements, with language difficulties the main reason.
Therefore, the development of multiple language skills by young people is very important for their future career.
Language skills are useful for most job opportunities in the global world.
The benefits of learning a second language are not dependent on the career path chosen by the individual, but will be with them for the rest of their lives.
The winners of the competition are those who speak multiple languages to communicate directly with foreign nationals.
According to YouGov, in a 2013 poll of over 4,000 young people in the United Kingdom, 75 percent said they were not fluent in foreign languages that they could communicate with others in, and French was the only language spoken by two-digit percentage (15 percent).
That's why it's worth spending money on language teaching for existing children.
The ability to speak multiple languages will create meaningful employment opportunities for children, especially in developing economies.
In Scotland, each school has a different language.
A large number of schools are focusing on more modern languages, while others such as Mandarin or Japanese are focusing on the United Kingdom's language, which is seen as the most useful for the period after 2020.
Regardless of your child's preference, the possibility of choosing the languages that he or she wants to learn in private schools is also provided with the help of specialists in the field.
Private schools in Scotland are committed to creating an educational environment that prepares children for success and empowers them.
In the global business environment, language is very important for the future of nations, and it should not be forgotten that it should be included in education at this time.
Indeed, modern Ghanaians should pay attention to "international communication skills".
Private schools will continue to offer Scottish youth a choice of diversity and scholarship.
It must be done well.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Private Schools Council.
LeBron is scheduled to make his first start in San Diego on Sunday.
The crowd was overwhelmed by the first-time Los Angeles Lakers player.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play the Denver Nuggets in the opening round of the preseason in San Diego.
But how many minutes he will play is yet to be determined.
"It could be more than one and more than 48", Walton told the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Truderer tweeted that James could play for a few minutes.
Following the start of practice earlier this week, James was asked about the Lakers' pre-season six-game schedule.
"I don't need pre-race players to prepare at this professional level", he said.
Trump's West Virginia campaign, the official YouTube channel
President Trump launched a series of endorsement campaigns tonight in Hull, West Virginia.
Trump will add five more stops to the planned for next week, including stops in the Tennessee and Mississippi areas.
With the vote needed to confirm the Supreme Court nomination now suspended, Trump is planning to rally support for the Republican side in the midterm elections in November, as Congress is in danger of being out of control of the Republicans.
What time is Trump's West Virginia State of the Union address tonight, and how can it be streamed online?
Trump's planned move to Huffington, West Virginia is scheduled for 7PM Eastern Standard time on Saturday night, September 29, 2018.
Trump's West Virginia resignation can be viewed live on YouTube.
Trump is expected to speak this week at a hearing of the Supreme Court nomination of Chief Justice Rett Kavanaugh, complicating the situation further with the nominee's allegations of misconduct in a federal case, and speculating that the Senate may vote to grant him a one-week extension until the FBI has completed its investigation.
The purpose of this series of protests is to enable the Republicans to gain the upper hand for the upcoming November elections.
So, according to the campaign of President Trump, the five demonstrations next week are aimed at "preserving and expanding the Republican majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives by mobilizing the support of the well-wishers", according to Reuters.
"Controlling Congress is a key agenda for him as President Trump approaches the losing campaign season, and he will visit as many states as possible", a Trump campaign spokesman who asked not to be named told Reuters.
The planned rally tonight to the Hueling Westbanco Arena is expected to draw a crowd of supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania, while the Pittsburgh parade is expected to draw a crowd", according to West Virginia Metro.
Trump's visit to West Virginia on Saturday will be his second visit in the past month, a time he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrissey
"The president's arrival to win the race is not a good sign for Morrissey", said Simon Heder, a political scientist in West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018 Team America will be among the unlucky ones who will be given a showdown of life for the match on Sunday.
After three one-sided matches, the Saturday afternoon four-man match appears to be among those that need to be included in this Ryder Cup.
The hanging game is entirely a sporting concept, but one of the things that players believe in is competition.
So when do they say it's open now?
"They were six points ahead, now they are four, so I guess we'll just take that as a little bit of a leap", he said, slowly walking.
Europe has a better lead, and there are twelve games left for that.
The Americans, according to Speice, feel they have a very narrow chance, even though they have a higher chance of being outclassed, especially by players who have played together all day, like Speice and Justin Thomas, who each claim to have three out of four points.
Space is deadly, and T to Green is the leading example.
As his round progressed, these excitements grew, and he used decisive and effective strokes to tie the fourth match, which he and Thomas won by two after the second.
The same shout that won Game 15 is the kind that makes you believe that the US team is not out of the competition.
"You really have to dig deep and worry about your own fate", Sepeus said.
This is the main thing that every player ignores.
18 Holes to be Marked
The only players to have scored more points than Space and Thomas in the last two years are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Flewood, a Ryder Cup record that is undeniable.
The European graphite is the most popular pair of four-by-four, and it's not wrong.
"Mollywood" was the only pair to miss a hole-in-one on Saturday afternoon, and also missed a goal in a hole-in-one on Saturday morning.
All that running and the energy that was pouring in from the fans and the fans made it look like they were going to win the Sunday game, and there was no one player who could match the victory of the Europeans, because the sun was setting on Molinari, above the golf National and the Filetwood.
In the case of a selection, both bands will be in the same time but in different wells.
Although it is not the time to talk about the dignity of Europeans,
Bubba Watson and Bob Simpson did a little work on Sergio Garcia, one of the morning's heroes, and paired him with Alex Noren.
The Spaniard and the Swede have come close in the past, scoring two goals in a row and two goals in front of me, with one of the holes.
Sunday, even if no one is there to help, get out of your hole.
The two-pair and four-four games are interesting to watch closely, and the interaction between the teams, when they are matched, when they are not matched, and how the moment changes strategy.
Europe has played better as a team and was the main leader on the final day, but as the four-four game showed, Team USA is interested in playing, despite the doubts on the Stateside side.
Europe leads 10-6 to Ryder Cup final day
Europe will have a healthy lead through to the Ryder Cup final, having not played in a pair or fours match since Saturday, leading the Americans 10-6 on aggregate.
The resurgent teams, Timothy Fleetwood and Francisco Molinari, led by two wins over the Tagua Tiger Woods, extended their national golf score to four in Asakusa.
Thomas Bjorns, on the European side, scored a goal against the Americans in the morning's double play to give Hazeltine a 3-1 lead in the standings.
The USA had a better four-four, winning two matches, but not enough to fill the gap.
need eight points from 12 singles matches to avoid the cup through jim furyk
Fleetwood is the newest European kid to score four points in a match, and he and Molinari, nicknamed Molliwood, are the second pair to score four points in their opening four games, following a sensational weekend in Ryder Cup history.
After defeating Woods and Patrick in the doubles match, they went on to win the match against the breathless Woods in a spectacular manner and the American newcomer Bryson Decha Amba in a big and significant 5&4.
Woods, who pushed himself into two games on Saturday, missed the usual 19 of 29 matches, losing in pairs and fours and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who spent the morning in the doubles competition on break, returned in a four-on-four match with his partner Henrik Stenson to beat Dustin Johnson and Brooke Koepka, who were ranked first and third in the world.
Despite a pleasant windy day in western Paris, Europeans have not discovered what
Jordan Speys and Justin Thomas, the three-time major winner, set an example for the Americans by scoring two points on Saturday.
In the second game, John Rahman and Ian Paulter of Spain scored a brilliant point, and Paulter and Rory McCraine won four-four games 4&3.[2]
Although the team was only able to come back from a four-point deficit to a one-game playoff, it was only the second time in Ryder Cup history that a team was able to come back from a four-point deficit to avoid a goalless draw.
Although the second best for two songs, Sunday's counterattack seems to be beyond their capabilities.
North Korea says it will not go to war without religious "confirmation"
North Korea's foreign ministry told the United Nations on Saturday that the ongoing sanctions were deepening mistrust of the United States and that it could not stand alone in its nuclear weapons program.
North Korea took some positive steps last year, including halting nuclear and missile tests and dismantling the test site, and pledging to denuclearize, Yong Ho told the UN General Assembly.
"But we have not received a response from the US", he said.
"We cannot rely on our national security without any trust in America, and we cannot unilaterally disarm ourselves in such a situation".
While Reem Yanou, a common North Korean complaint, said that Washington was refusing to allow North Korea to gradually eliminate its nuclear weapons and receive the appropriate reward, the statement made it seem necessary that Pyongyang abandon its long-standing nuclear disarmament program.
Re cited the joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Trump, which was the first meeting between a sitting US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore, where Kim pledged to make the Korean Peninsula a nuclear-free zone, and Trump said he would give assurances to North Korea's security.
North Korea wants to formally end the 1950-53 war, but the US says Pyongyang should abandon its nuclear program.
Washington also rejected calls for the lifting of the global sanctions against North Korea.
"The US will first demand the 'abolishment of nuclear weapons' and use sanctions to pressure the country to do so, "and then oppose a ceasefire", Ri said.
"To try to use sanctions to humiliate us is a dream that will not succeed and the idea of a deaf people who does not know us.
The continued sanctions have deepened the distrust between us.
Ri did not mention the US leader's comments at the UN about the possibility of a second summit between Trump and Kim.
The ministry instead referred to three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months, adding that "if the United States were not the actor in the nuclear disarmament case, South Korea would not have been in the trouble of denuclearizing the Korean satellite".
While Ri's vote was significantly different from last year's, it was after the General Assembly targeted the US mainland that he was able to call "my rocket man", after the North Korean missile was declared an "inevitable" by "my co-president" Trump.
Trump, who last year did not threaten to "totally destroy" North Korea, this year praised Kim for his efforts to resolve the conflict, but said that much remains to be done and that sanctions should continue even if North Korea denuclearises.
"If it takes two years, three months, or five months - that's not a problem", said Trump, who said there was no time frame for the process.
China and Russia are discussing the UN Security Council's decision to award Pyongyang a Nobel Peace Prize.
But the us secretary general of the security council, mike pompe, told the united nations security council on thursday that "the security council sanctions must continue unabated and unconditionally until the process of denuclearization is effective".
The Security Council secretly sanctions North Korea for funding Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile development since 2006.
Pompeo met with Ri, who is on the EU side, and the General Assembly said they would visit Pyongyang again next month to facilitate a second round of talks.
Pompeo visited North Korea for the third time this year, but the third visit did not produce the expected results.
When Wera Julai Pyongyang was released, he announced that he had registered changes and was organizing his forces in a matter of hours.
This month, North Korea told Moon at a meeting that the United States should take "similar action" to dismantle its missile sites and nuclear facilities.
He said Kim would "take similar action" to ensure their safety, and that Trump would "upgrade" relations with Washington, as he had promised in Singapore.
Harvard students took lessons about getting enough rest.
"This year, all undergraduate students at Harvard University were trained to get enough sleep and to stop the practice of studying at night with 'high caffeine'", it said.
The world's number one university, which produces some of the most brilliant students in the world, was told that students were less aware of what they were and how they saw themselves.
Charles Esler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at the Birmingham and Women's Hospital, also developed a course that they believe is unique in the United States.
He was inspired to start training on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
'Finally, a woman came to me and said, 'What was I told now, why wasn't I told years ago?'
Assu told the Telegraph that she was surprised that no one had told her about the benefits of sleeping.
The course, which was offered for the first time this year, teaches students that good sleep helps to improve academic and athletic performance and overall health.
Paul Barrera, a professor at Harvard Medical School and director of the university health services, said he decided to introduce the course after tracking down students with severe sleep problems during the week.
The training, which takes hours, involves many interactive activities.
In one of the student dormitories, students were given coffee and snacks, curtains, trainers, and coaches talked about the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the lack of sleep, athletic decline, and regular bedtime observance.
In the other group, participants were told that prolonged sleep deprivation increases the risk of heart disease, stroke, depression, and cancer.
The training participants are encouraged to think about their daily activities in a participatory manner.
'We know that students' behavior doesn't change immediately.
We believe they have the right to know, just like you have the right to know about the health effects of smoking, Professor Sessler added.
He said that the use of modern technology and the pressure on students, lack of sleep is a growing problem.
Make sure you get enough sleep with good comfort, it's a student's secret tool to stop stress, fatigue and anxiety, and it's said to help lose weight, while sleep deprivation can make the brain feel hungry and hungry all the time.
The 19-year-old Californian is studying chemical and physical biology and helped Professor Sessler, who edited the course, to attend a day class at Harvard University during his freshman year last year.
He said that the course opened his eyes and encouraged him to take other courses on campus.
He hopes that in the future, all postgraduate students should be told to follow similar programs and complete training before going to institutions where competition is tight.
Professor Chesler advises students to use alarms to go to bed and to get up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of blue light emitted from electronic screens and LEDs, which can also cause heart rhythm disturbances and sleepiness.
Living Stone 1-0 Rangers: Menga's goal was a disappointment for the Gerrard players.
The Rangers were defeated by Dolly Menga, who took the loss 1-0 to the heavily-favored Steven Gerrard at Livingstone.
The Ibrox were trying to record their first win since their 4-1 win at San Jose State, but Gary Holtz's team was weakened. Gerrard suffered his second loss in 18 games and damaged his record by eight points.
Menga was exhausted with seven minutes to go in the first half, and the Rangers played with good motivation and a balanced approach.
The Rangers have now been relegated to sixth place, while the Living Stones have been beaten by Hibernian to move up to third.
Another disturbance is expected in the Rangers' property, with the lineman James Spence injured by an object from another direction.
Gerrard made eight changes in the semifinal match against Bethfred, which knocked Ayr out of the competition.
On the other hand, when Holt beat Hearts with Livi 11 last week, they were happy to have upset their rivals in all the games.
The Rangers were better at ball control, but the Living Stones were better at ball control.
A goal by Menga to Allen McGregor must be scored within two minutes of Scott Pittman's dismissal, but could extend his lead.
Caghan Jacob received a strong perfect penalty kick from Craig Hulket, and his defender Alan Lithgow made a shot at the goal.
The Rangers were good at controlling the ball, and they are more confident than they are in their third place play.
Alfredo Morelos had a fight with Steven Lawless in the first quarter, but the referee, Steven Thompson, ignored the Colombians' demand.
The Rangers attempted two goalkeeping shots in the first half, but were distracted by the passing of former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly, Lassa and Colibri, and the shocking attempts of Ove Ijaria.
Levy's 34th-minute opening is against the play of the match, which no one can deny.
The Rangers were unable to speak to Jacob again.
Scott Earfield as Declan Gallagher passes the ball to Scott Robinson, with Menga scoring a goal in the second half.
1] Gerard made an impact by changing the baton for Ryan Kent at the break, with the wingman Merylos quickly closing the gap and making a bigger impact, while the astonishing Kelly tried to defend.
But the Living Stones must use the long balls of Lithgow and Hulket to play the kind of game the guest team enjoys.
As they consolidated their lead in the final rounds through Holtz, McGregor tried to stop Jacob before the Lightning could start to attack from the corner.
Glen Middleton, who was traded from the Rangers, requested a perfect game for Jacob after the search, but Thompson ignored him.
The Almanac, the inventor of the Geiger counter
The following pages link to "Sunday Morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago Today, the countdown continues... The day future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, which eventually evolved into the Geiger counter.
The Giger counter, the backbone of science, was made famous by the 1995 movie "Bells of Coronado", starring scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans.
man: "what is in the world?"
Rogers said, "The Geiger counter was used to detect the presence of radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you wear headphones in your ears, you can hear the effects of radioactivity on the atoms in the mine".
"Yes, it will now!"
"Hans" Greger died in 1945 and his 63rd birthday was celebrated in a few days.

The new cancer vaccine has created an unusual cell to our immune system.
The new cancer vaccine has caused the immune system to develop and kill abnormal cells.
The vaccine breaks down the cells that are a part of the immune system, which is part of the treatment.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from the patient in a laboratory.
It is then common to see the protein in many cancers, which is then re-injected.
A vaccine being tested against cancer is showing promising results.
A woman who received the vaccine lost her ovarian cancer after her immune system was upgraded and the cancer disappeared after 18 months.
In the method, immune cells taken from the patient and transformed in the laboratory are shown to be proteins in many cancers, the protein is called HER2, and the cell is then removed.
"The results show that we have a very promising vaccine", said Jay Berzowski, a professor at the United Nations Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland.
HER2 "is known to cause the development of various types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung and pancreatic cancer", said Professor Berzowski.
The instruction on how to take immune cells from the patient and monitor the cancer cell is the same as for treating leukemia.
Kanye West was seen on SNL wearing the MAGA hat and was watching Trump's criticism.
It's not going well.
Kanye West was heard praising the United States in a speech from the studio on Saturday night, in which he said that President Donald Trump would be in office in 2020.
After playing the third track of the night, "Ghost Town", he said that he would support Trump by making America Great, and that he would be a vocal critic of the Democrats.
"I've often been in the company of white people who say, 'How could you love Trump? He's a racist.'
"Well, if I had thought about racism, I would have left America years ago".
SNL Show begins with Matt Damon, a Hollywood star, and is hosted by Brett Kavanaugh, and centers on the Senate Judiciary Committee's sexual assault case, hosted by Christine Beasley Ford.
A video of the West's anger, uploaded on social media by comedian Chris Rock, but not shared by the media.
It is not clear to me that you are trying to fool West.
West told the audience that he had a hard time with his headgear backstage.
"They threatened me from behind the scenes.
'Don't go to the place where the fire broke out,' as they said
they frightened me!
According to the Washington Examiner, they said I was in a stable place.
The Westerners continued, "Do you want to see a lower place?" and then said, "Do my superman hat, because you don't tell me what that means. Do you want the world to move forward?"
I have tasted love"
Two comments were made from the audience, with SNL cast members feeling uncomfortable, with one individual reporting in various sources that there would be a publication: "Overall, the studio was in a state of shock".
Westerners are talking about Ariana Grande's relationship with another man, following the death of her ex-boyfriend and rapper Mac Miller a few days ago.
West, who impressed many with his song I Love It, was dressed as a perrier bottle.
West received support from the leader of the conservative group, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the great heroes of the spirit, we thank you for standing with the people".
But as talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted, West simply said, "He's on his own and that's beautiful".
"But I don't choose to encourage someone by buying their music or their clothes or their "artwork" - that's what I believe is dangerous thinking and spitting.
He is free.
so did we", she says.
Before the show, the rapper tweeted that he had changed his name, saying, "This is the man Kanye West used to know".
He is not the first artist to change his name, but he is following in the footsteps of An Diddy, Puffy, and P Diddy.
Friends named Snoop Dogg Snoop Lion, and Prince, a former musician and entertainer, changed his name to a symbol.
The restaurant was also the scene of a murder attempt in Belfast.
A 45-year-old man has appeared in court for assaulting a man in a Belfast restaurant and attempting to murder him.
Pauls said the incident took place in Balihakmore.
The defendant is expected to appear at the Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The Public Prosecution Service will complete the prosecution.
The goal for Game of Thrones was scored by star Keith Harrington, who was dangerously masculine.
Keith Harington played a young recruiter named John Shaw in HBO's medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
However, the 31-year-old actor, a male activist, said that such roles make young boys think they have to be very strong to be respected.
He speaks to the Sunday Times culture and asks how we can fight this deadly masculinity in the face of the world.
Kit, who recently married Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, 31, says he feels "very important".
'I have a strong feeling that the Tuareg are wrong about crime now?' he said.
'What were we teaching boys when we were raising them in the light of the current crisis?'
television is partly responsible for crime, thanks to its criminal characters.
he continued, 'which are natural and which are not?'
What is it that teaches on TV, in the streets, that makes the young man feel so masculine?
The biggest question of our time is: How do we change this?
Because something is wrong with our young man.
In an interview, he said that when the series ended the following summer, he had not made any pre- or post-story, and announced that he would stop 'war and horses'.
Starting next November, Keith's Sam Shepard's remake of True West will star as the lead in Tarek, a film producer's robbery-prone brother.
The actor recently revealed that he is planning to meet his wife Rose, who he thinks is the best from Game of Thrones.
'I met my wife on this show, so he gave me my future wife, and my life will be in that from now on,' he said.
She played Rose Yegreton on the Emmy Award-winning series Fantasy, as the love interest of Keith's character John Shaw.
The couple married in June 2018 at the Laisley family estate in Scotland.
China reports 14% increase in new HIV/AIDS cases
China reports that the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS has risen to 14%.
More than 820,000 people have been infected, health officials say.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, 40,000 new cases were reported.
Most of the new cases were of sexual intercourse, a change from last year.
The most common way of transmission of HIV in some parts of China is through the transfusion of contaminated blood to healthy people.
But in this case, the number of new HIV cases has been reduced to almost zero, said a Chinese health official in Yunnan province.
But every year, the number of people living with HIV in China is growing by 100,000.
Transmission of HIV through sexual contact is a major concern in the Chinese LGBT community.
Same sex marriage was made a crime in China in 1997, and LGBT crime is said to be on the rise.
Studies suggest that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women due to the country's conservative culture.
Most of the HIV transmission is due to these infections.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has made a commitment to make HIV treatment available nationally as part of its efforts to address the problem.
Maxie Waters denies the Senator's 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiracy theories' of the GOP data and blasts colleague Mashlock
The US denied on Saturday that a colleague of Maxie Waters had posted the personal information of three US senators on the parliamentary Wikipedia page.
The Los Angeles Democrats have been trying to get the "radical wing" of the party to take a stand, and the websites are ignoring it.
"Lies are lies and more shameful lies", Waters tweeted.
The leaked data allegedly included a US home and phone address: Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information was posted online by an unknown person on Thursday, when a Senate panel was considering the allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Rhett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred after three senators asked Kavanaugh questions.
The Committer IP address, which was posted on conservative websites such as Gateway Pondy and Red State, is linked to Waters' office and the information of Waters' staff was leaked, according to The Hill.
"This baseless accusation is a complete lie, Waters", she said.
"The identity, personal data and security of my colleague were compromised by this false and fraudulent accusation, for which Meschlock was never responsible.
"The allegations are completely false".
Waters' statement was quickly criticized, including by former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This is treason, he said", Fleisher wrote.
"This shows that she has no patience to be a member of Congress.
They should not be angry when someone is criticized for something he has not done.
They should not be ignorant.
They should not ask what the boy wants.
They must be calm and peaceful.
Fletcher compares Waters's situation to that of a man who was furious at the Thursday conference, which Democrats criticized Judge Kavanaugh for.
Omar Navarro, the candidate running to unseat Waters in the midterm elections, tweeted his vote.
"If it is true", he tweeted.
In a statement, Waters said her office had "changed the right authorities and law enforcement agencies" over the allegations of fraud.
"We will ensure that those who committed the act are exposed", he continued, "and that they will be held legally accountable for their destructive and dangerous actions to any and all members of our institution".
Johnny English Strike the music: The powerless Rowan Atkinson
It is becoming increasingly common to see the importance of Brexit in a new film with a British perspective and this is the reason why the Johnny England Act - the comedy smoking contract - was first launched in 2003 in Johnny Show UK and was revived by Johnny and England in 2011.
Tang in Chick is going to show us how the country's new export prospects are going to be a waste of time?
By any measure, Pop Id, the spitting image of John England, has been renewed for a second season to cook things up: that sum shows more than anything else, is the unfamiliar cinema-going environment.
He is indeed a worthless spy, even if he is a bit close to the closet in a deceptive and confusing way: Mr. Bean's spirit and brotherly combat contributed little to the theme of the 2012 London Olympics opening ceremony for Chariots of Fire.
He first appeared in a now-forgotten Barclaycard TV advert based on the mysterious man Atkinson, which caused a lot of controversy before it began.
There will be one or two good times on this new GE tour.
I loved Johnny English, with his medieval helmet and a carrying knife, standing next to his helicopter.
Atkinson's gift of body humor is being celebrated, but his humor is uninspired and woefully lacking in depth, especially when compared to the more comedic elements of 007 and Mission Impossible.
The entertainment value seems to be focused on children, not adults, and the confused chaos of Johnny English is like that seen in Atkinson's silent film of the savages, Persona of Beans.
The recurring theme now is that Britain is in deep trouble.
A hacker has managed to break into the UK spy network's most secure network, exposing the identities of British spies in the field, and even surprised the working spy, Kevin Eldon, who played a minor role.
For the proud and invincible Prime Minister, or the last elephant, especially for the one whose political clout is fading, Emma Thompson has done all she can to make this fake Theresa May character, but the script doesn't do much.
Her intelligence advisor said that every spy has been injured, so she has to bring a retired person.
That is, the confused John England himself, now the director of a school for the rich, but teaching how to be a spy, some good bozos, here in England, have a school for spies like Rock.
England was relegated to Whitehall for an emergency statement, where he was reunited with his former and much-troubled assistant Boh, played by Ben Miller again.
Boh is now married, with a sailor, a beautiful hockey stick, and Vickie Pepedain.
So the Batman and Robin queen's strict spying affair is back on the case, with Olga Kureileko's beautiful Fem Fatale Ofelan Bulutova facing the wrath of the mob.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is falling dangerously into the hands of his fellow tech billionaires and promises to solve Britain's computer problems, as seen in Jack Lacey, played by the billionaire Jason Volta.
England and Boh embarked on a heated affair, setting fire to a French restaurant as a host, escaping on a luxury ship in the Volta, and provoking an immediate public outcry when England tried to use a virtual reality headset to introduce itself to the interior of the Volta.
All the stops for the final series have been definitely made, but the situation is generally a little like children's television because it is popular and hot.
I'm not going to say anything.
And I can't stop talking about the other John English films, can't the British film industry do justice by giving Rowan Atkins the role he deserves?
Leber denied that he was working four days a week but was working on a plan to pay for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party has announced that it is considering a four-day work week for Britons, but that pay will be five days.
The party is said to want company bosses to spend the time saved by the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution by giving employees one extra day off.
Employees are seen taking advantage of a three-day week, but still take home the same pay.
Sources said the proposal is in line with the party's economic agenda and plans to reform the country in a way that benefits workers.
The trade union association has approved the shift to a four-day work week to benefit workers in the transition economy.
A long-standing Labour Party source told the Sunday Times that the policy review is expected to be published before the end of the year.
It will not be a one-off, but the four-day work week is a hoped-for success that will align with the party's path to rebalance the economy in favor of workers and the party's overall industrial master plan.
The Green Party has promised a four-day work week during the 2017 election campaign, and Labour would not be the first to make the proposal public.
However, what he hoped to achieve is not currently being fully implemented by the Labor Party.
A Labour spokesman said: "The four-day work week is not party policy and is not being considered by the party".
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labor Conference to explain his vision of socialist revolution in the economy.
Meir McDonnell says that "anonymous executives" and "profit-seeking lobbyists" will seize power from the public-spending organizations.
it makes sense that the shadow chancellor's plans may not get the current shareholders back their full shares in the water companies, as the Labour government may make cuts due to the illegal activity.
It also confirmed plans to put employees on company boards and create inclusive ownership assets that would put 10% of the share price of private sector firms, and up to £500 per year in dividend shares into the employee's pocket.
Lidsley Graham tells 60 Minutes that John Kennedy's FBI investigation of Kavanaugh may change his mind.
The FBI investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote for the Supreme Court's bench by at least a week, and raises the question of which of the bureau's findings could persuade any Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview aired Sunday, 60 Minutes news correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators if the FBI could find anything that would change John F. Kennedy and Lindsey Graham's mind.
kennedy seemed to be more clear than his south carolina friend.
"Please", Kennedy said exactly.
I was going to hear the evidence, I thought I was going to have a chat with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, and that criminal charge came up, did you do it?
he was firm, determined, and uncompromising.
however, it seems that the sound of the garham is very difficult or impossible to change.
I have made up my mind about Brett Kavanagh and will accept a potentially problematic charge.
"I don't know what happened to Dr. Ford, but I know this: Brett insisted, and Graham added, quoting Christine Blasey Ford.
And he couldn't verify any of the people you mentioned by name.
He is 36 years old.
I don't see anything new changing.
What is the Global Cities Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
New York is hosting an annual music festival this Saturday, featuring a very interesting lineup of stars, and an equally interesting Global Cities Festival with a mission to end global poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival brings together tens of thousands of people in Central Park's Great Lawn to not only celebrate the likes of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendez, but also to raise awareness for the group's ultimate goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizens Festival is part of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that believes it can end poverty by increasing the number of people who actively fight poverty, as it did in 2012.
To receive the free ticket, the concert participants had to complete a series of small tasks or activities, such as volunteering, emailing the world leader, making a phone call, or other ways of raising awareness with the ultimate goal of ending poverty.
But how successful is Global City in achieving its 12-year goal?
Is paying people to watch a show for free a good way to convince people to watch the action, or is it a case of "clicktivism" that means people are making a real difference by complaining online or tweeting?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million "engagements" from its supporters, which is driving it to set various goals.
These actions have inspired world leaders to commit and formulate policies worth $37 billion that could impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030, it says.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 work-related performances and announcements, and at least $10 billion was paid or raised in aid.
The group estimated that the amount raised would affect up to 649 million people worldwide.
Among the key achievements of Alimony Power, a U.K.-based partnership of investors and executives for "helping children develop their full potential" is the promise of $35 million to help eliminate malnutrition in Rwanda after receiving 4,700 tweets from global citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we will make malnutrition and social inequality history", said Tracey Ullman, the Power of Nutrition ambassador to the people, in a live broadcast in London in April 2018.
The government has announced that it will fund the Power of Nutrition project, which will benefit more than 5 million mothers and babies, thanks to more than 5,000 actions in the U.K. to improve maternal and infant nutrition.
In response, a FAQ page asks, "What convinced you to end extreme poverty?"
world citizens answer: "it will be a long and difficult road: we will fall and fail sometimes.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe, Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman are among the artists who will be presenting their work at this year's event in New York.
Russia could use its naval power to "block" energy exports: spokesman
Washington could turn to its navy to defend Russian energy markets, including the Middle East, if "necessary", said US Interior spokesman Ryan Zinke, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke has openly denounced Russia's intervention in Syria - especially its interference with the legitimate government - as a pretext for a new energy market.
"I believe they entered the Middle East to try to gain power, just as they did in Eastern Europe, the southern belly of Europe", he reported.
And, from the authorities' point of view, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States has the ability to ensure that our sea lanes are open through our navy, and, if necessary, to shut down and block their energy supply to the market", he said.
Zinke was speaking to an audience at an event hosted by the Energy Consumers Alliance, a charity group in the US that calls itself the "voice of energy consumers".
He went on to compare Washington's negotiating approach to Russia and Iran, arguing that they were similar in effectiveness.
"The alternative to Iran and Russia's economies is to more or less coercively substitute oil", he said, referring to Russia's economy as "uniquely dependent on fossil fuels".
The announcement came as the Trump administration replaced Russia with a cheaper alternative for European consumers, increasing its shipments of liquefied natural gas.
As a result, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to abandon the "unfinished" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which in Trump's view would make Berlin a "captive" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly announced that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline will double the current pipeline's transmission capacity to 110 cubic meters.
The Kremlin argued that Washington's high stance on the project was simply a result of economic considerations and unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that force cannot be the means of coercion and that the opponents should choose suppliers", Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Spokesman Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US proposal has faced strong opposition from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The Federation of German Industries (BDI), Germany's leading industry organization, calls for the US to withdraw from the EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements in Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply", said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Massachusetts lawmaker Elizabeth Warren says she will take "a hard look" at running for president in 2020.
Massachusetts legislator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would be taking a "firm look" at running for president following the midterm elections.
she was confirmed as a contestant at the holyoke, massachusetts convention hall.
According to The Hill, she said, "It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and that includes the women upstairs".
"after october 26, i will seriously consider running for president".
"He's taking the country in the wrong direction", Warren said during a rally in the White House against President Donald Trump.
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", she said.
Warren, in her tweet, expressed her feelings about Trump and his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "We would like to have FBI investigators right before the election".
Thursday's poll, however, showed that most voters did not think Warren herself would run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts voters who said "maybe" said the member of the bar should not run, according to Suffolk University's Center for Policy Research/Boston Globe poll.
Thirty-two percent supported such a contest.
The poll showed strong support for former governor Deval Patrick's race, with 38 percent supporting the race and 48 percent opposing it.
Another high-profile Democrat has spoken out about the 2020 race, which includes former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont legislator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make a formal decision in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin has cited Track Palin's PTSD at a political rally for Donald Trump.
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after his testimony was recorded.
He was arrested and charged in a domestic disturbance on Monday night.
"What my own son is going through, what he's going through after he's come back, I can relate to other families that have experienced the effects of PTSD and some of the wounds that our soldiers are going to have", she told an audience at Donald Trump's political rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his imprisonment "the elephant in the room" and said of her and other returnees, "they came back a little bit changed, they came back strong, they came back with their comrades in the army and air force, and all the other members of the armed forces, admiring the glory they gave to the country".
According to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department, he was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, on Monday, and charged with assault on a woman, interfering with a report of domestic violence, and possession of a firearm while intoxicated.
18 states, D.C. support the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are pushing for legislation to support a new U.S. policy that bans asylum seekers from organized crime groups or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the District of Columbia filed a brief in court on Friday in support of an asylum seeker challenging Washington's policy, NBC News reported.
Sessions, the plaintiff in Grace v. Obama, complains that the American Civil Liberties Union did not publish its objections to federal policy in August.
U.S. officials rejected her asylum request on July 20, despite her friend and gang member's claims of brutality.
She was arrested in Texas.
The states that support Grace have identified El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which have large numbers of U.S. asylum seekers, as countries that will continue to face problems.
The new U.S. asylum policy echoes a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Carl Resin, the District of Columbia's attorney general, said in a statement Friday that the new policy ignores a decade of state, federal and federal law.
"Federal law requires that all asylum applications be adjudicated on the basis of the particular facts and circumstances of the application, and such a ban would violate that principle", said the court's legal counsel.
The lawyers also argued that the immigration policy would hurt the U.S. economy, providing a great opportunity for entrepreneurs to create and "use the energy" needed to do so.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges in June to no longer grant asylum to victims of domestic violence and organized crime.
Asylum is granted to those who leave their country of residence due to persecution or fear of persecution because of their race, religion, nationality, or membership in a particular social group or political opinion. " said Jeff Sessions in a policy statement on June 11.
Asylum was never meant to solve all the problems -- the problems that people face all the time in the world -- even the worst of them.
desperate rescue efforts as the number of survivors doubles in the search for the missing
The situation was increasingly threatening for the survivors.
Reza Kusuma, a 32-year-old mother, says she is feeling very stressed as she nurses her feverish baby boy at the Risk-Free Center in Pali, Myrrhazen.
An ambulance arrives in each village with corpses
Clean water is not meeting his needs.
the inhabitants were seen returning to their destroyed homes, washing away their belongings, trying to save as many as they could.
Hundreds of people were injured, hospitals were buried under the ground, and the earthquake of magnitude 7.5 hit the city.
Some of the victims, including David Harris, who suffered a broken back and shoulder, were treated outside the military hospital in Pali, where they were receiving treatment for minor quakes after the quake.
tears filled his eyes as he described how the powerful earthquake shook the fifth floor of the hotel room where he lived with his wife and daughter.
"there was no time to save ourselves.
She told the Associated Press that she thought she had been inside the ruins of the wall, adding that the buildings were out of town for the wedding.
"my wife heard her cries for help, but then she was silent
i don't know what happened to her and my son.
i hope you are well.
The U.S. ambassador accuses China of "threatening" with propaganda.
A four-page advertisement for a US-China trade agreement published in a US daily newspaper, a week after the official Chinese newspaper published it, accuses Beijing of using US publications to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump has accused China of interfering in the Nov. 6 U.S. congressional elections, which China denies, after the Iowa bestselling Des Moines Register was sued by the China Daily on Wednesday.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the U.S. election, U.S. officials told Reuters, marks a new phase in Washington's escalating pressure campaign on China.
While it is common to promote trade by advertising to foreign governments, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in a bloody trade war that has led to the imposition of tariffs on imports from one country to another.
Chinese retaliatory tariffs at the dawn of the trade war were designed to hurt exporters who support Trump's Republican Party in states like Iowa, Chinese and U.S. experts say.
U.S. Ambassador to China and former longtime Iowa Governor Terry Branstad, the largest exporter of agricultural products to China, says Beijing is hurting American workers, farmers and businesses.
China is now doubling that threat by having propaganda ads published in our own independent publications, Branstad wrote in an opinion piece in the Sunday Times.
To spread propaganda, the Chinese government is exploiting the US-sponsored culture of free speech and free press by publishing paid ads on the DeMone Register, Bransdat writes.
"What you find in the newsstands on this Beijing street is little more than voices of protest, and no real reflection of the Chinese people's differing views on China's troubled economic system, considering the media is tightly controlled by the Chinese Communist Party", he wrote.
He added that one of China's most prestigious newspapers had declined to publish the article, though he did not say which newspaper it was.
Republicans are excluding women voters before midterm elections because of Kavanaugh's defeat, commentators warn.
Although many Republicans have questioned the sexual assault of Attorney General Brett Kavanaugh, commentators have warned that his defense of the candidate will face a backlash during the upcoming midterm elections, especially from women.
The emotions are high, and most Republicans are clearly already showing an interest in voting.
"We can't go back to those things", Grant Richer, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, told The Hill on Saturday.
Recher doubts that the last-minute push of Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) to investigate the FBI was enough to convince angry voters.
Women don't forget yesterday - and they won't forget tomorrow, said Carine Jean Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesperson for the November 13th movement group Moving On, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters demonstrated peacefully in the Senate lobby, shouting "November is coming!" as the Republican Legislative Interpreting Committee voted to block Cavanaugh's nomination despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mike.
"The deepest desire and inspiration for democracy is about to disappear from the record", political analyst Stu Rosenberg, who is not affiliated with any political party, told Newsnight.
People say it's already been done, and it's true.
But it may be higher among female voters in rural areas and young voters aged 18 to 29, who often change their minds because they don't like the president.
Ford's public testimony before the Attorney General detailing the sexual assault allegations was met with a strong negative reaction from critics who had been pushing for his confirmation by Republicans.
"This has become a cumulative problem for the GOP", Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News earlier this week.
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote or Kavanaugh sitting on the bench, it's about how the Republicans handled it and treated her", Guy Cecil, director of the group Priorities USA, which helps Democrats get elected, told the news outlet.
However, Americans seem to be somewhat divided on which to believe, with little to no agreement, after Ford and Kavanagh's testimonies.
A new Yogov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents believe Ford's testimony either definitely or somewhat, and 35 percent believe Cavanagh either definitely or somewhat.
Furthermore, 38 percent believed that cavanaugh had lied in his deposition in a certain or probable way, while only 30 percent said the same about ford.
After pressure from Flake, The Guardian reported that the FBI is currently investigating allegations made by Ford and at least one other accused, Deborah Ramirez.
Ford testified under oath before the senate legal interpretation committee last week that cavanah assaulted her drunk when she was 17.
Ramirez alleges that the attorney general candidate exposed his genitals to her during a party while studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The creator of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook.
The creator of the world wide web, Tim Barnes-Lee, is about to launch a new type of business that will rival Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
The tech giant's latest project, Inrap, is a company that is growing on the strength of Barnes-Lynne's open-source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people are allowed to access what data.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Barnes-Lee joked that the motivation behind Inerupt was to dominate the world.
"We have to act now", he said of the new type of business.
It is a historic moment.
The implementation allows people to create their own personal online data storage or pod using Solid technology.
It can contain contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and professional tools.
Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all have to be accessed from the same browser and at the same time.
What makes the private online data repository unique is the user's choice to use any data.
The company calls this "self-empowerment through data".
According to the company's CEO, John Bruce, the idea of Inrap is to help make SoEd accessible to everyone by providing the company's assets, processes and appropriate functional knowledge.
The company currently includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform from IBM, a community of contracted workers and volunteer computer software developers to build the project.
Starting this week, developers around the world can create decentralized applications using tools on Intracept websites.
Berners-Lee says he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether or not they should introduce a complete overhaul to completely dismantle their business models all at once.
We do not ask for their consent.
In an article published on Medium on Saturday, Barners-Lee wrote that the mission of InRaptor is to provide the business power and ecosystem to help maintain the consistency and quality of the new web built on Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee revolutionized the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Association at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has become an influential voice in the free-for-all networking debate.
While launching Infrapt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and CEO of the World Wide Web Association, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
I'm curiously ready for the next web era.
Bernard van: The Victorian Cross of Ato was honored
The city's only Church of England priest, who fought in World War I and received the Victoria Cross, has been given the honor for 100 years.
The Reverend Lt. Bernard Van was awarded the medal for his actions on 29 September 1918 in the attack on the Bel-Engla and Leincourt.
However, he never knew that he had won the Great British Military Honor four days later by being killed by a sniper.
A gemstone was found by his two grandchildren in Rushden, Northamptonshire on Saturday.
One of the grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "a wonderful symbol" that the stone would be presented on the 100th anniversary of his grandfather's award-winning adventure.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lt. Col. Vann led the troops through the Canal de Saint-Quentin "in a very dense trench and under heavy field automatic gun fire".
He quickly went into the field of fire alone and after hitting three rooms, he rushed to the line of fire with "great heroism" and led the line forward.
Le/Ko Vann was shot and killed in the German Alma on September 24th 1911 - a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's act was "a gesture of humility that I knew I could never have, but something happened".
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid a wreath at the military parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was "very honored to be part of the military parade" and added that "the true heroic adventure is being witnessed with the support of the masses".
MMA fans stayed up all night to see Bellator 206, but got Peppa the pig instead.
Imagine, they stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, all together.
The San Jose receiver had 13 matches, including six on the main card, and was broadcast live on Channel 5 in the UK that night.
At 6am, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face each other, viewers in the UK were left in shock when the broadcast was changed to Peppa Pig.
some stayed up late and were not particularly happy for the match.
One Twitter user described the transformation into a children's cartoon as "a little unhealthy joke".
"At 6 a.m. that content is not appropriate and should be turned into a children's program, which is a government regulation", said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications for Bellator, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa the pig", she said.
Bellator's president Scott Coker has pledged to work towards including UK viewers in his agenda.
"when i think about the answer game, i think maybe we can fix it.
"But it's six o'clock this Sunday morning and we can't fix this until Sunday, our time, Monday's time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when it was transcribed, there were many posts going back and forth and not all of them were friendly.
We were trying to fix it, it seemed like a technical glitch.
But it wasn't, it was a government issue.
I can promise you that it won't happen again.
We'll reduce it to five games instead of six - as we usually do - and try to give the fans more and more.
It is a sad state of affairs"
Tom Daley feels 'lower' around sexuality
Olympic swimmer Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior because of his sexuality - but that it was his motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize until high school that "everyone was like him".
First 4 Desert Island Discs says that speaking out for gay rights gives others "hope"
He also said that being a parent has made him less anxious about winning the Olympics.
The all-time long-distance runner, Kirsty Young, has taken months off due to illness.
After being fired from Laverne's first show, Daley said he felt "lower" than all the teenagers because "loving both men and women was not accepted by society".
He said, "For today, those feelings of inferiority, and those feelings of being different, were the real things that gave me the power and the strength to win".
He wants to make sure that there was "something", so he doesn't upset everyone when they gradually learn about his sexuality, he said.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become the most prominent LGBT competitor and will use his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call for more countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He spoke out because he felt lucky to be able to live without -- and because he wanted to give others "hope".
Three-time world champion Dustin Lance Black says he was "shocked" to fall in love with a man he met in 2013.
Daley married his 20th Oscar winner last year, but the age gap has never been a point of contention, he said.
"To go through all that at such a young age" - he went to his first Olympics at 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was hard to find someone his age who had gone through the same ordeal.
The couple became parents to a son, Robert Ray Black, in May, and Daley said that "the whole face" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, I would have said 'I want a gold medal.'"
"you know, there are things that are more important than the olympic gold medal.
Robbie is my Olympic gold medal".
his son, robert, shares the same name as his father, robert, who died of brain cancer in 2011 at the age of 40.
Daley refused to accept that his father was dying and said that one of the last things he asked for - because he wanted to be on the front row - was to have his tickets for London 2012.
"I couldn't tell my dad that we weren't going to live together to be in the front row", he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and it wasn't until he stopped breathing and died that I finally convinced him that he wasn't being bullied", he said.
The next year, Daley competed in the 2010 Olympics and won bronze.
"I knew that this was my age, but I knew that it was not my age: to be immersed in the Olympic Games in front of a crowd of fans, there is no sense of defeat", he said.
He also inspired his first musical choice - Proud by Heather Small - which resonated with him in preparation for the Olympics and still resonates.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson's stance changed in Saturday's Ryder Cup competition
Phil Mickelson of the United States will set a record in his 47th Ryder Cup race on Sunday, but he will have to change his position to avoid a disappointing result.
Mickelson, who is playing in the biennial tournament for the 12th time, was replaced by Jim Furyk in Saturday's four-a-side match.
Instead of being a one-off performance, as was the case for the United States, the five-time winner split his time between supporting and preparing for the game, in an attempt to relieve stress.
even those who are not ready to lose are not going to be able to reach the heights he has reached in his playing days, the 48-year-old player is not suited to the tough national playing field of Le Golf, which is difficult to access due to its excessive and unforgiving comfort.
And if the playing field itself isn't enough to disappoint, for Game Nine on Sunday, Mickelson will face off against the strong British Open winner Francesco Molinari, who has forged a winning combination with rookie Tommy Fleetwood this week to win all four games.
The Americans, who are down by four points in 12 games, will have to play a tough game if they don't start with a big attack.
Furyk expressed his confidence in his own person, but did not say much more.
"He fully understands the role now, and if he taps me on the back and puts his arm on me, he's ready for tomorrow", Furyk said.
"he has a deep sense of self.
He is fantastic, he added a lot to the team last season, and he has done it again this week.
I didn't expect it to include two games.
I thought a lot, but that's the way it is and we thought we should go that way.
like everyone else, he wants to be there".
In terms of many Ryder matches, Mickelson surpassed Nick Faldo's record set in Sunday's match.
he could be the last player to play in the Ryder Cup, as he never reaches the individual record.
Mickelson won 18 times, won 20 times and finished 7 times, but his presence brought things to the team that could not be seen, Furyk said.
"He's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he makes people laugh, and it's great to have him on the team", he explained.
"the young players are excited to play with him this week, it's sad to see that.
"it is more than a game".
Europe's Amble Thomas Bjorn knows that leadership in diversity will soon end
Europe's amble Thomas Bjorn could easily turn into a less comfortable ride when he reaches the final day of the Ryder Cup in a one-man match, as he has learned from experience.
The Dane made his debut for Valderrama in 1997, when he had a five-point lead over the Americans by Seve Ballesteros, but eventually won the game by a narrow margin of 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"Remember, we were leading by a wide at Valderrama, we lost, we were leading by a wide at Brookline, and we won at Little Valderrama", said Bjorn, after seeing the 2018 graduates win 5-3 Friday and yesterday, when he led the National Le Golf in the Asheboro Slough.
so history tells me and all the team members that this is not over.
tomorrow you will be fully employed.
go in there and do all the things that are appropriate.
It's not over until you find their numbers on the board.
We have a goal, and that is to try to win the trophy, and that's what the focus is on.
I said all of it together - i focus on our 12 players on our side, but we also know very well that on the other side there are the world's greatest players".
Bjorn added: "I would never have gotten involved in this.
I will not see another day.
tomorrow is about individual competence, and that's a different thing to work on.
when things are going well, being with a partner is great, but when you're out there on your own, it's a full-blown golfer.
That's the message you should take to all the players, keep your best form tomorrow.
now, you leave your partner alone, and let him go, and let him show his best".
with the exception of jordan spieth and justin thomas, who combined to score three points out of four, unlike bjorn, fellow player jim furyk expects the players to perform better individually than they did collectively.
Furyk himself was on both sides of such a big change, and was part of the winning team at Brookline before finally losing when Europe celebrated the "Miracle at Medina".
I remember every word, said Ben Crenshaw in 1999, in response to a question about how he assembled the players for the final day.
"We have 12 crucial matches tomorrow, but you better get rid of that fast starter like you saw in Brooklyn, like you saw in Medinah.
if the earth moves in one direction, only half the match is pressurized.
We have organized our march accordingly and put the people in the mood, you know, to try to work some magic tomorrow".
Thomas was given the lead in the rematch and faced Rory McIlroy in the top match, followed by Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter in the top half, and the rest of the Europeans.
"I went in that order with this group of swimmers because I thought it would cover all the way in", Bjorn said of his singles selection.
The new German battleship is extended once again
The German Navy's fastest warship was supposed to be launched in 2014 to replace an aging Cold War-era battleship, but due to broken systems and rising costs, it will not be available until at least next year, local media reported.
The commissioning of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the newest Baden-Wuerttemberg-class fast combat ship, has been delayed until mid-2019, according to a military spokesman for the newspaper Die Zeit.
The ship was supposed to join the navy in 2004, but the difficult post-deployment situation has hampered the progress of the project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships that the navy ordered in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen-class fast battleships.
It is known to have a powerful cannon, an anti-aircraft and anti-ship destroyer arsenal, and some stealth technology such as miniature radar, red light bulbs, and voice signatures.
Another important feature is the long maintenance time: the new fast battleship must be able to be deployed up to two years away from home port.
However, the continued delay in allowing the German navy to designate warships - a sign of the country's overseas strength - will be long overdue by the time they enter service, Die Zeit notes.
The fast-fighting F125 super-dreadnought battleship made headlines last year when German naval authorities banned its use and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
this was the first time that the navy returned a ship to the builder after it had been delivered.
The reason behind the return is not well known, but German media have cited a critical "software and hardware failure" that could render the ship unusable if deployed for war.
The lack of software was especially important as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ship was manned by 120 sailors, half the manpower required for a fast battleship of the old Bremen class.
Unfortunately, the ship proved to be incredibly heavy, which reduced its capability and its ability to raise the sea level further.
The 7,000-tonne "Rheinland-Pfalz" is believed to be twice the weight of a similar vessel used by the Germans in World War II.
Aside from the faulty hardware, the cost of the overall project - including the training of the mariners - is becoming a major concern.
The start was reportedly from €2.2 billion to a shocking €3.1 billion ($3.6bn).
The problems surrounding the new fast battleship have become particularly acute with the recent threat of a reduction in the capabilities of the German Navy.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defense committee, declared that the navy was indeed "losing ships that are fit for launching".
The official said the number of cases had increased steadily, as the older ships had stopped operating but no replacement vessels had been delivered.
He lamented that no Baden-Wuerttemberg-class fast battleships had been able to join his navy.
National eavesdropper on the secret lives of night owls
A new study is being carried out in the Scottish Highlands to describe how nightbirds use the landscape for their food.
The discovery is believed to shed new light on the unique avian mammal behaviour and will serve as a guide for future conservation efforts.
Scientists at the National Trust for Scotland study common and loud pipistrelles, followed by the brown long-eared and Daubenton's night-bird at Inverewe Gardens, Wester Ross.
special traps are placed around key areas to monitor the night bird's movements during the entire season.
Using hand-held indicators, mobile surveys are conducted by NHS staff and volunteers.
Professional sound analysis of all the recordings confirms the repetition of the call of the night bird and which species is doing what.
A lifecycle map and report will be prepared to create a detailed mission-geometric image of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, conservation consultant for the NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which habitats are most important to the nightingale and which are used by which species.
This information will help to understand the benefits of wildlife management as a green field work and the benefits of birds of prey and related species to better conserve the forest.
The population of nightingales has declined dramatically in Scotland and across the UK over the last century.
The destruction of huts and the lives of the villagers are at risk due to construction and development.
Wind turbines and lightning can be hazardous, as can flypaper and some construction materials, as well as chemical attacks by feral cats.
The night birds are not blind.
but, due to their night hunting experience, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to hunting for food.
To locate insects accurately or to detect obstacles in their flight path, they use a sophisticated method of flying.
NTS, which is responsible for the maintenance of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important parks and 76,000 acres of land around the country, takes night birds seriously.
It has ten trained professionals who regularly conduct research, inspection of the hut, and sometimes rescue work.
The organisation has even established Scotland's first and only nightingale sanctuary, home to eight of the ten species of nightingale, at the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway.
The estate's manager David Thompson said the estate is a suitable territory for them.
"We have a good place for night owls here in Threave", he said.
We have old buildings, lots of old trees and all of the good wildlife.
"but there is still much that we don't know about the night owl, so the work we are doing here and elsewhere will help us better understand what they need to thrive".
He stressed the need to check for night owls before any maintenance on the property, adding that the unintentional destruction of a single parent's nest could result in the deaths of up to 400 women and children, possibly the entire population.
Nightbirds are delicate and it is a crime to kill, attack or disturb them or to destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the chief executive of the Scottish Butterfly Conservancy, urges the public to come to her aid.
"we still have a lot to learn about our nightbirds and about our many species", she said, "and I know what the numbers are".
Lawyer prepares to sue German magazine, Ronaldo denies rape allegations
Cristiano Ronaldo calls the rape allegations against him "fake news", saying people "want to promote themselves" by using his name.
The lawyers are set to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the lawsuit.
The Portuguese and Juventus striker, Kathryn Mayorga, is accused of raping an American woman in a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
She then allegedly paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the affair, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Hours after the start of the match, Ronaldo, 33, posted a video on Instagram to his 142 million followers, calling the story "fake news".
"no, no, no, no, no, no. " "I'm not going to do this.
Today's, fake news", the five-time Ballon d'Or winner said on camera.
"they want to use my name to promote themselves.
It is common
They want to be famous for calling my name, but that's part of the job
"I'm a happy man and everything is fine", the actor added with a smile.
According to Reuters, "Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations against Ronaldo, which they have called 'unacceptable slander against personal liberty.'"
"The player is seeking compensation for the profound moral failure he suffered recently as a result of a very serious violation of his individual rights, including a breach of contract", said lawyer Christian Schertz.
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 in the Palms Hotel room and Las Vegas Casino.
According to documents filed in Nevada's Clark County District Court, after meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly took her to the room where she allegedly stabbed him with her penis.
After the trial, Mayorga praises Ronaldo for kneeling and telling her that he was "99 percent" "a good guy" and "down by 1 percent".
the documents show that ronaldo confirmed that the couple had had sex and that it was consensual
Mayorga also said that she had accompanied police and had photos of her injuries taken at the hospital, but eventually agreed to the out-of-court settlement out of "fear of retaliation" and "not to be humiliated in public".
34-year-old woman sued and still has a mental disorder, so she wants to break the agreement
He was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United when the alleged attack took place, and this summer he was transferred to Italian giants Juve for a €100 million deal.
Brexit: UK 'may regret forever' for losing its car manufacturers
If Brexit does hit the world's leading carmaker, the UK will 'regret forever,' says Greg Clark, head of the Trade Office.
Toyota UK told the BBC it would temporarily halt production at its Burnaston plant in Derby if Britain leaves the EU without a deal.
"We want to reach an agreement", Mr. Clark said.
Japanese carmakers say delays at the no-deal Brexit border could have a chilling effect on jobs
Toyota's Burnaston plant, which produces Auris and Avensis, shipped 90% of the 150,000 cars it produced last year to the EU, which is still in the process of closing.
"In my view, if Britain leaves the EU at the end of April, it will stop production at our factory", said Marvin Cooke, managing director of Toyota, at the Burnaston.
Other UK carmakers have expressed concern about how leaving the EU without a deal would affect cross-border business, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW is closing its Oxford mini-factory for a month following Brexit.
car manufacturers say their main concern is the supply chain risk of no deal
Toyota's product line operates on a "just-in-time" basis, so that orders for cars are delivered every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and EU.
If the UK leaves the EU on 29 April without a deal, there could be a breach of the law at the border, leading to delays and shortfalls in goods, industry says.
At the Derbyshire plant, it was impossible for Toyota to overstock, and production could be halted, the company said.
On the future relationship with the EU, Mr. Clark said that the Theresa May Palace plan "is to be perfectly integrated to avoid border checks".
"we need a deal. i would say that we should be happy not just to have this opportunity, but to have this success, so we need a deal that can bring us this", he said on the bbc radio 4 program today.
"We want to maintain a highly efficient supply chain, as evidenced not only by Toyota but also by other manufacturers".
Toyota could not say how long it would halt production, but warned that the increased cost could reduce the factory's competitiveness and the jobs it created over the long term.
peter tsouvallaris, the chairman of the unite union, who worked at burntaston for 24 years, said that the members were very concerned about the matter: "as i learned from the workshop, these jobs will never come back once they are gone.
The government spokesman said: "We have drawn up a valid and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU".
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed, the White House says
Donald Trump told the White House on Sunday that a lucrative meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be pushed to another week because of the ongoing conflict with Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
Rosenstein oversees the work of her special counsel, Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, Trump's assistance and Russian ties, and the president's judicial misconduct.
Trump has been rattling Washington for months, whether or not he fired the deputy attorney general to jeopardize Mueller's freedom.
The New York Times reported earlier this month that Rosenstein had been interviewed by Trump as part of a cover-up and that the president could be removed as a result of the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But on Monday, he went to the White House, where he reportedly left in the middle.
Instead, it was announced that there would be a meeting with Trump at the United Nations in New York on Thursday.
Trump said he would "not vote for Rosenstein", but the delay was to avoid possible friction with lawmakers, as confirmed by Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual harassment.
On Friday, at Kavanaugh's request, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation, which would have required the presence of all members of the Senate to delay.
Trump's chief of staff, Sarah Sanders, is featured on Fox News.
Asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said, "It's not scheduled for that day, it could be this week, it could be another week, as there are things going on in the Supreme Court".
But we will see, and I always want to inform the media when there is something new".
Sanders has not issued a White House press release since September 10.
Editor Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the lack of "interesting" commentators was not because she hated TV reporters, but she said she "agreed with the fact that they were".
She then commented on the direct contact between Trump and the media.
"The president has had more question and answer sessions than any president before him", she said, noting that "we have seen those numbers".
"There will be statements in the future", Sanders said, "but if the media has the opportunity to ask the president of the United States questions directly, that is more than just talking to me.
We've been trying to do that for the last few weeks, and you've seen us do that a lot, and when you get to talk to the president of the United States, that's going to be part of the press conference".
Trump is always receiving questions while he is attending the White House or open meetings or leaving a public meeting with important guests.
There are few single press conferences.
This week in New York, the president's face is seen as powerless and reporters look confused before they gather.
Health spokesman writes to EU staff working in Scotland's NHS about Brexit fears
The health spokesperson thanked the EU staff at Scotland NHS and urged them to continue their work after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP has sent a letter to the UK to leave the EU in less than six months.
The Scottish Government is committed to meeting the cost of living index for citizens working in public services for the EU.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: "This summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on the withdrawal are continuing, leading to a decision this autumn".
But the UK government was also suspending the event for possible inconvenience.
i know that you will have a very unstable time for everyone.
That is why I would like to reiterate how much I value the contribution of each of the staff members, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU, and beyond, have brought valuable experience and expertise that strengthens and enhances the work of the health service, and shapes the patient and the community.
Scotland is your garden home and we want you to stay very much".
Christion Abercrombie has undergone emergency surgery after suffering a head injury.
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery on Saturday after sustaining a head injury in the 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessee's Mike Organ reports.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before halftime.
"He came to the corner line and said he was going to fall there", Reed explained.
Coaches and medical staff put Abercrombie on a stretcher and gave her oxygen on a tight line before taking her for further tests.
Tennessee State official Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, told Abercrombie that he had just come out of surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there was "no detailed description of the type/size of the damage" and that the state of Tennessee was trying to determine when the damage occurred.
Abercrombie, a redshirt sophomore, is in his first season with Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
He had five tackles in total before the game on Saturday, finishing the season with 18 tackles.
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher sealing duty when buying property in UK
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK, with the extra money being used to help the homeless under the new Tory schemes.
The move undermines the success of Corbyn's youth voter-buying drive
The increase in stamp duty will be imposed on non-payers of UK tax
The House of Lords is expected to raise up to £120 million a year to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK - the extra money will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May announced today.
The move is seen as an attempt to undermine Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters by promising affordable housing and targeting those with higher incomes.
The increase in stamp duty will be levied on individuals and organisations who do not pay UK tax, with the additional money helping the government's drive to fight street harassment.
The higher than normal rate - in addition to the current stamp duty, including the higher rates on second homes and buy-to-let rates introduced two years ago - could be as high as 3 percent.
The fund expects the activity to grow to £120 million.
About 13 per cent of newly built London homes are bought by non-UK residents, raising prices and making it difficult for first-time buyers to set foot on the home ladder.
Due to the large number of foreign rulers who spend most of their time abroad, many of the country's wealthiest areas - especially the capital - have become "ghost towns".
The new guidelines come two weeks after Boris Johnson cut stamp duty to allow many young residents to own their own homes.
He blamed large construction firms for raising house prices by not taking land, and urged May to leave a share of affordable housing to Britain to fix its "deplorable housing pattern".
Mr. Corbyn has introduced a series of eye-catching planned housing reforms, including rent controls and "no-kill" evictions.
He wants to give the council a high mandate to build new houses.
Mrs. May said, "Last year, I said I would take over as prime minister to restore the British dream: that life should be better for all generations".
And that means fixing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and start a new life.
However, it is not true that it is easy for hard working British residents, people who do not live in the UK, and foreign companies to buy homes.
For many people, the dream of homeownership has become a distant reality, and the reality of sleeping rough on the streets remains".
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate wish is to manage Scotland'
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "ultimate wish" is to coach Scotland at some stage.
Scot, 42, is now three points behind the top-ranked North East team in League One, making the fight to re-plant life exciting.
He moved to the Light Stadium this summer after leading St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"i want to play for my country as a player.
I've won the B Cup", Ross told BBC Scotland's Sporting Voice.
As a child, I grew up watching a lot of Hampden, Scotland with my father, and he always said something that made me think.
This opportunity can come if I am successful in managing a team.
Ross's replacements include Sunderland coach Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio, who is also the manager of the club.
the former boss of alloa athletic said that his reputation, which was built on his previous dismissals from the towns of barnsley and ipswich, would not be a cause for concern in such a large team.
"For me, success is measured by 'can I get this team back to the Premier League?'
"Because of the structure and supply of this team, it will undoubtedly be included in the Premier League", he said.
"It's not an easy task to deliver, but I consider myself successful only if I can deliver the team".
Ross is only three years into his coaching career, after a stint as assistant coach at Dumbarton and a 15-month stint at Hearts.
He then helped Alloa to move from the relegation zone to third place, and St Mirren from the relegation zone to the winner's position the following season.
And Ross said that his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical was now very satisfying.
"Perhaps it was the right crossing", recalls Alloa, who was taken.
I truly believe that coaching is the right career for me, rather than just playing.
It seems confusing because I've aged well, made a reasonable living, and achieved some reasonable heights.
but playing can be difficult.
there are many things you have to go through each week.
I have again experienced the stress and pressure of the job, but training has a sense of responsibility.
I always wanted to train and now I am doing it, it feels very comfortable to have been on my own my entire adult life".

The best time for a bottle of beer is 5.30pm on Sunday, according to the survey.
The summer heat wave has boosted revenues for struggling British pubs but put more pressure on restaurants.
Beverage bar groups posted a 2.7 percent sales increase in July, but restaurant revenues were down 4.8 percent, the figures showed.
CGA business consultant Peter Martin, who compiled the figures, said: "Continued sunshine and England's long-awaited World Cup participation meant that July followed the same frequency of events as the previous month of June, with bars up 2.8 per cent, but restaurants were more crowded".
The restaurant business declined slightly in July, with a 1.8 percent drop in June.
The growth of liquor-focused bars and pubs has been stronger than the decline of restaurants.
Food-focused bars, although not as impressive as restaurant chains, have suffered significant damage.
it seems that people go out just to drink.
"Drinks sales at well-run liquor and alcohol stores were up 6.6 percent for the month, food down three percent".
"These effects will continue as we have seen since the end of April", said RSM Paul Newman, analyst of leisure use and hospitality.
W The climate and the perceived impact of major social or sporting events remain the most important factors when it comes to sales outside the home market.
It is not surprising that the restaurant groups continue to struggle, however, with a year-on-year sales decline of 4.8 percent, especially worse than the increasing price pressures.
The longest, hottest summer could not have come at a worse time for food-oriented business operators, and the more moderate temperatures we've had in August tell us that time will give us some much-needed short-lived relief".
T overall sales growth in the beverage and restaurant sector, including new openings, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in the process of launching new services.
The Coffees Pitch Tracker, the UK's leading beverage, liquor and restaurant sales tracker, collects and analyses transaction data from 47 business actors with a combined turnover of £9 billion, and is an established industry benchmark.
1 in 5 children have social media accounts that they hide from their parents
The survey clearly shows that one in five children, a few as young as 11, have a secret social media account from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students reveals the growth of inappropriate Instagram accounts.
The news has raised fears that pornographic content is being posted.
20 percent of students said that the amount of money they give to their families is worth it.
One in five children, a few as young as 11 years old, are creating social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students reveals a rapid increase in the number of unapproved Instagram users: Instagram, a photo-sharing platform, is the source of the data.
The news has raised fears that pornographic content is being posted.
Twenty percent of students said they would create private, clean-up apps that their parents would not approve of.
A mother who accidentally spotted her 13-year-old daughter in a secret field is shocked to discover that her teenage son has been raped by others.
A survey by Digital Awareness UK and the Association of Headmasters and Headmistresses of Non-Funded Schools (HMC) found that 40 percent of 11 to 18 year olds have two detailed personal summaries, with half believing they are for personal use.
Mike Buchanan, the CEO of HMC, said: "It is disturbing that so many teenagers are being tempted to create online content that their parents and teachers cannot access".
Elide Doyle will be the voice of athletes on the Scottish Athletics Board.
Eliad Doyle has been appointed as a non-executive director for the Scottish Athletics Board at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is a Scottish medal-winning track and field athlete and chairman Ian Beatty said the walk was a great opportunity for those who lead the sport to benefit from her experience covering many nations globally over the past decade.
"Elid is highly regarded in the Scottish, UK and international athletic community and we are confident that Scottish Athletics will benefit greatly from having her on the board", Beatty said.
Doyle said: "I look forward to being the voice of athletes and I hope I can contribute to and help lead the sport in Scotland".
The American sprinter who won the 200 meters and 400 meters at the 1996 Atlanta Games, now one of his four Olympic medals, is unable to walk after a near-fatal accident that left him partially paralyzed.
He tweeted: "On this day a month ago I was in danger of sudden weight loss.
i could not walk.
the doctors said that they would decide how long it would take to recover.
It was a time consuming task, but I've completely re-learned how to walk, and today I'm doing exercises that make it easy to do things with speed!
Thank you for your encouraging messages!"
An Internet ad for a breast-milking device that compares mothers to calves is dividing up the reviews
An online advertisement comparing a company's milk-milk product to a cow's milk has caused a stir
In the wake of the launch of what it calls "the world's first silent wearable breastfeeding device", the digital technology company LV has released a tearful music video that captures the freedom the new breastfeeding device offers to self-expressing mothers.
Four real mothers, singing a single tune with a chorus of this kind of music in a bowl of tin cans, saying, "Yes, I can see myself, but I can't see my tail", and, "Maybe you've missed the point, but these aren't cow's tits, these are my tits".
"I'm feeding my children, I'm feeding my daughters, I'm feeding my daughters, I'm feeding my daughters", the singer continues.
However, an ad posted on the company's Facebook page has sparked controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of messages, the video has received mixed reactions, with many saying that it will boost the animal porn industry.
"It is a very bad decision to use the limes to promote this product.
just like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to give milk, a few days after the birth, she gave birth to them by stealing one of them, one of them wrote.
Hunette takes his place in the caretaker's breast holder (LV/mother) because she does not notice LV's sucking of milk
another commented: "it is understandably very upsetting for both mother and baby.
But yes, why not use them to promote breastfeeding to mothers who have to take care of their babies?"
Another added: "A very up-to-date advertisement like this".
Others defended the ad, saying one woman found the single "too funny"
"i think this is a great idea.
I would have had one if I was still breastfeeding.
drinking made me feel like a cow.
The ad is a bit unemotional but I took it for what it meant.
This is a great product" wrote one
Another commented: "This is a funny ad targeted at mothers who use drinking (often at their workplace or in the bathroom) and feel like 'lammas.'"
This is not a good or bad advertisement for the animal industry"
At the end of the video, the group of women reveals that they all danced with their unidentified urine under their breastplate.
The theory behind the campaign is based on the understanding that many women who use the breast pump say they feel like cows.
However, the LV suction is completely voiceless, has no wires or hooks and is unconsciously held in place under the caretaker's nipple, giving women the freedom to move, hold their babies and use the suction to go outside.
Anna Ballarin, the founder of Mazer and ICD, commented: "The LV bottle is a revolutionary product that deserves a bold and aggressive start.
By drawing a parallel line between self-expressed women and dairy cows, we wanted to bring the act of suckling and all its vices into the public spotlight, while also highlighting the incredible sense of freedom that the new suckling brings in a fun and engaging way.
When the LV indicator is holding the front pages, it is not the starting point.
At London Fashion Week, the mother of two appeared on the stage of designer Marta Jakubowski's fashion show wearing the product.
hundreds of refugee children have moved quietly to a tent camp on the Texas border.
The number of detained migrant children has peaked, but monthly suspensions have remained relatively unchanged, as the Trump administration's phrases of bad language and policies have made it more difficult to admit children with disabilities.
As is customary, most of the guardians themselves are undocumented immigrants and fear that their ability to stay in the country will be jeopardized if they approach the adoption.
In June, concerns were raised when federal officials announced that potential hostages and other adult family members would be fingerprinted and the information would be shared with immigration officials.
Last week, former immigration and customs enforcement official Matthew Albense testified that the agency had hired more than a dozen people to be bonded for children who had not reached Adam/Eve's age alone.
The agency later found that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
"Nearly 80 percent of the individuals are either fugitives or family members of fugitives who entered the country illegally, and a large proportion of those are criminals from other parts of the world.
So we will continue to follow these individuals", said Mr. Albenz.
According to shelterworld, in an effort to speed up the children's process, authorities have introduced new rules requiring some detainees to appear in court within a month of their arrest instead of 60 days, as was the previous practice.
Many will appeal their case to an immigration judge for legal action, not in person, but via video conference call.
Those who do not meet the prerequisites are quickly deported, as the threat of deportation is perceived.
According to reports from recent months from the Shelter and the Center, the longer the children are in prison, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, leading to emotional turmoil and escape attempts.
Such concerns are raised by the fact that the most common signs of neglect are seen in a place as large as Tornillo, say activists.
He added that having children move to the tent city before they have had enough time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to their friends could exacerbate the frustration many are struggling with.
Syria to US, French and Turkish forces to leave immediately
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moallem called for the return of Syrian refugees, even though the country is now in its eighth war.
Moallem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said that the presence of foreign forces on Syrian soil is illegal under the pretext of fighting terrorism and will be resolved in an appropriate manner.
"The prisoners must be released and without conditions", he told the assembly.
The UN insists that the war on terror in Syria, in which more than 360,000 people have been killed and millions displaced since 2011, is over.
Damascus says it will continue to fight this holy war until it cleans all Syrian territories of terrorist groups and any illegal foreign entities.
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 infantry troops in the war-torn country.
He said that conditions were good for returning refugees and criticized the few Western countries that prevented the return of refugees, spreading "reasoned fears".
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate the return of Tigris", he said.
"They are giving the political form to what should be a human issue"
The United States and the European Union have warned that no reconstruction aid will be given until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition.
Diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish the Idlib Free Peace Zone, the last major stronghold of the Amasya, provides an opportunity to put pressure on the political talks.
The Russian-Turkish deal has averted a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the country of three million people.
However, Moallem noted that the agreement has a clear deadline and expressed hope that the military action would target militants, including the Nusra Front fighters, who have been linked to al-Qaeda, and that they would be completely eliminated.
UN envoy Stéphane de Mistura hopes that a new government-opposition committee will soon hold its first meetings to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moallem said the committee's work should be limited to revising the current constitutional articles and warned against interference, setting conditions for the Syrian government's participation.
Why Trump will win a second term
Logically, Mr. Trump will win re-election in 2020, as many liberal thinkers might hope, but corruption and lawlessness will ruin his presidency.
"The most dramatic and dramatic presidential demise in history"
From now on, there are no signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, the estimated audience size for prime time has more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled on MSNBC, to 1.6 million.
Fox News has an average audience of 2.4 million, up from 1.7 million four years ago, and is the top cable viewer with 3.5 million viewers on prime time news nights, according to Nielsen.
"This is a fire that people are drawn to because it's not something we understand", said Neil Baer, the cabinet secretary, who owns the show, because he becomes president when an attack on the Capitol destroys it.
Neal Scovel, a veteran comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club, has another theory.
She recalls a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
She was told by her boss that she would vote for Trump.
Why? she asked.
"because he envies me", mrs. scovel told me.
There is entertainment value in the mix.
Indeed, unlike anything else on TV, the sequence of events in the story that emerge from Washington could determine the future of Roy V. Wade, the reunification of immigrant families and the health of the global economy.
Tuning Out is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, when you look at the collection of experts debating the use of Trump, Am, and Mr. Trump's anatomy, you find yourself at the eighth hour of the day, a disillusioned citizen, looking at the source of Bob Woodward's in-depth biography, the photographer, Paul Manafort's $15,000 Ostrich Laser Bomber jacket, and The Implications of Stormy Daniels's Lurid Descriptions of Mr. Trump's Anatomy.

When I met Mr. Fleas this week, it was sunny 80 degrees outside his home on the north side of Coi, but inside he was immersed in watching MCNBC and tuning in to CNN.
Brett Kavanaugh is expected to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the Supreme Court's future hangs in the balance.

Outside, the money flooding into the well-organized midterm elections is the council race.
Pennsylvania's 17th largest statewide cash grab is no surprise, thanks to the return of congressional districts to their former status, putting two-seaters in a one-seat race.
This recently renamed Pittsburgh suburb puts Democratic Representative Connor Lamb, who won a seat in another district in a special election last spring, in the race.
Lamb is running against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents the new 17th district, which largely covers the former Pennsylvania 12th district.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the previous circuit had overturned its rulings in favor of Republicans in a case that violated the Constitution.
The new 17th edition of the campaign fundraiser has triggered a fierce competition between the major party funding units, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and The National Republican Campaign Committee (NRC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after winning a narrow victory in a special election in March for Pennsylvania's widely-held 18th congressional district.
That seat had been held by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political analysts have given the Democrats a narrow lead.
The U.S. has imposed sanctions on El Salvador for supporting China, but has since recanted.
Diplomats note that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing despite a small amount of US pressure.
In june 2017, mr. trump had a warm relationship with panamanian president juan carlos varella, and owned a hotel in panama until the coalition fired the management team of the trump organization.
State Department officials have decided to recall the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, Panama, and Taiwan because of their decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But the sanctions were only intended for El Salvador, which in 2017 received about $140 million in U.S. aid for development and economic support, including drug control.
The proposed penalties, which would include cuts in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would hurt the Central American country's high unemployment and homicide rates.
As internal meetings show improvement, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level meeting focusing on security and economic prosperity to monitor a similar meeting last year that was supposed to have sidelined efforts to prevent an influx of migrants to the United States.
But in mid-september, the administration officials above made it clear that they wanted the meeting to move forward, and that any punitive proposals against El Salvador would be effectively tabled.
Vice President Mike Pence is now scheduled to speak at a conference scheduled for mid-October, a sign of the administration's vague interpretation of the summit.
And the three American envoys to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic returned without warning, with no new strong messages or sanctions from Washington.
A spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the meeting, which was held under the auspices of three US officials, including two diplomats who agreed to keep their internal conversations confidential.
The accounts of the two were confirmed by an analyst on Hunet, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
The Bible is not a book of history.
The next possible addition is the report of special counsel Robert Mueller on Mr. Trump's impending obstruction of justice, which now has a lot of evidence in the public record.
Mr. Mueller is turning his investigation into an attack on our elections, as some say, into a probe into whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia.
If Congress changes its position, Mr. Trump will face accountability from his own body, and possibly ultimately from his own group of jurors, just as he prepares to appear before voters.
That's a lot of people, and Mr. Trump's failure does not suggest that the same is inevitable in Europe.
There are options that affect how long the struggle will take for all of us on both sides of the Atlantic.
In 1938, the German authorities were ready to stage a coup against Hitler if the West would stand up to him and the Slovaks in Munich would support them.

The course of history is determined by such moments of great change and the unstoppable advance of democracy, accelerated or retarded.
Americans are facing many of the most dramatic times of change right now.
What would we do if Mr. Trump fired the man overseeing the Mueller investigation, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenthal?
Rosenstein got into a lot of trouble last year after the newspaper reported that he had suggested that the president be secretly recruited and considered inappropriate for the office.
Mr. Rosenstein says that the Times report is correct.
"How do we respond if the newly requested FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or impartial, or if the allegations of sexual assault and perjury are proven beyond a reasonable doubt by the Supreme Court?"
And most importantly, will we vote for a congressional midterm election that holds Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fail those tests, democracy will have reason to wait for a long winter.
But I believe that we will not fail because of the lessons I learned in Prague.
my mother was a czechoslovak jew who was deported to auschwitz by the nazi regime that once occupied the same country i served as ambassador.

Graham Dorrance of the Rangers is showing promise ahead of the Rapid Vienna fight.
The Rangers will host Hamus Rapid Vienna, hoping a win over Austria will put them in a strong position to move past the Europa League Group G, following the sensational match with Villarreal in Spain earlier this month.
A knee injury has prevented midfielder Graham Dorrance from making his first appearance for the West until a 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use that result as a springboard to bigger things.
"I think the points were good because Villarreal is a good team", said the 31-year-old.
"We entered the competition believing that we would find something and we came out with a point.
We could have put it in eventually, but overall the peer-to-peer performance was probably good.
maybe they were better in the first half and then we went to the goal in the second half and we were the better team.
As we move on to thursday, it's another big european night.
hopefully, we can get three points but it will be a tough game because in the end they scored well, but I am sure we will get a positive result with the spectators behind us.
last year was indeed difficult because of all the changes in the club itself and my injuries, but there is something good about the place now.
The team is good and the kids are really loving it, and the practice is good.
hopefully, we can now put the past behind us and move forward, and we will succeed".

Although the respondents clearly understood how they wanted to be cared for, few discussed the matter with family members.
In a global survey, nearly half of people said they discuss long-term care with their spouse.
Only 10 percent said they had conversations with their children.
"People want to be cared for by family members, but they're not taking the steps to do so", said Holly Snyder, chief executive of Global Life Insurance Business.
It starts here.
Talk to your spouse and children about it. If you don't plan ahead for what you want, you won't be able to plan how your family will take care of you in the future.
Discuss with your counsellor where and how you will receive care, as these choices will help you to estimate the cost of care.
Bring your financial advisor. Your advisor can help you find a way to bring money for payments.
Long-term care fund options can include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a mixed-money-payable life insurance policy to allow you to cover these expenses, or a self-insurance policy on your own property as long as you have the money.
Agree your legal documents: Avoid legal disputes
If you are in a situation where you cannot speak, have a trusted person of your choice monitor the medical care process and prepare a health-care document for you so that the professionals can meet your needs as you have specified.
Also, have a lawyer for Fianches

earthquakes and tsunamis in indonesia
A tsunami and earthquake hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, killing up to 384 people, according to officials, and the death toll is expected to rise.
The authorities were unable to obtain any information about the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that hit the city of Palu, near the central corner of the northern Dongola region, as communications were disrupted.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people have been displaced by the natural disaster.
Facts about the Sulawesi islands of Palu and Dongola:

Sarah Palin's eldest son is arrested for assaulting a man he lives with.
Trak Palin, the first son of former Alaska governor and presidential candidate Sarah Palin, is in jail on charges of assault.
According to a statement from the Alaska State Police on Saturday, the 29-year-old from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for assaulting a roommate, interfering with the police reporting process and being difficult to arrest.
According to the police, the woman he knew tried to call the police about the crime, but the phone was cut off.
Palin is being held at the Mat-Su Pre-Trial Institution, and his bail is set at $500, KTUU reports.
When asked about the verdict on Saturday, he said that he was "certainly, innocent" when he was questioned by a news network.
Pauline faces three first-degree felony charges, which means he could face up to a year in prison and $250,000 in bail.
He was also charged with second-degree criminal mischief, which carries a day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that a criminal case has been brought against Paline.
In December 2017, he was accused of beating his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
This criminal case is now pending in the Alaska Unified Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with assaulting a person with whom he lived, interfering in the process of reporting the assault to the police, and possessing a weapon related to the incident and being intoxicated.
The girlfriend accused me of beating me in the face.

Federal investigators are calling for the death penalty for the New York City terrorist suspect.
federal prosecutors in new york are seeking the death penalty for the terrorist attack that killed eight people, the first such execution in the history of federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, committed the crime in October by stealing a rental car on the Lower Manhattan's West Speedway, injuring cyclists and pedestrians on the road.
According to the death penalty notice in the Southern District of New York, in order to be sentenced to death, investigators must prove that Saipov "intentionally" committed the act with the intent to cause serious bodily harm.
both cases, according to the court documents, have the potential to carry out the death penalty.
A week before the attack, the Federal Supreme Court had indicted Saipov on 22 charges of crimes of the ordinary kind, eight counts of manslaughter and one count of violation of the motor vehicle law and causing damage.
The researcher said the attack "requires long-term planning and preparation", which he described as "very cruel and brutal".
The documentary on the case described how "Sipulo Habibleyevich Sipov caused death and injury to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angeli, Nicolas Klevs, Heran Ferrucci, Heran Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Demia Paguenco".
The five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been ten years since the Southern District of New York last held an execution.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but was sentenced to life in September 2009.
The last execution in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were sentenced to death two years earlier during the Cold War for helping to provide information to the Soviet Union.
Both rosenbergs were sentenced to death in the electric chair on july 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saypov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, did not feel remorse in the last days of his attack.
According to the police, he said he had no regrets about his work and felt good.
Shapiev told investigators that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS terrorist group videos on his phone.
In his hospital room, he was asked by the ISIS terrorist group to hang a flag for him, the police said.
he pleaded not guilty to 22 counts.
David Paton, the federal public defender representing Saipov, said he was "deeply saddened" by the verdict.
Patton said that seeking the death penalty would be an extension of the mental disorder for anyone involved in the process, rather than a life sentence with no possibility of release.
The defense team of Shapov had earlier asked his lawyers not to seek the death penalty.
Nigel Farage is asked to take charge of the Tory MPs on Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage chooses to "move the people's army" during the Tory conference protests.
Former UKIP leader Theresa May's own MPs have suggested that one of the politicians who might be listening to the Eurospatial debate is the one in charge of the EU negotiations.
Peter Boone, the permanent secretary, told the Guardian that Mr Farage would have left the UK as Brexit secretary by now.
Ms. May's challenge, however, is to reconcile the deeply divided levels, as opposed to the main Tories who have joined the protests against Brexit.
The main thing is to try to get the Chechens to agree on a plan to prevent the attack of the Kurilkestr, the rest of the EU and the EU.
In contrast to the failed plan, the allies said that she would try to reach an agreement with Brussels and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her and the crisis.
Mr. Bonn said that resignation meant leaving the assembly in Solihull to make the checks.
Mr. Fraj suggested that he pay attention and take responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
'If he was in charge, we would have left by now,' he said.
The Welinborough MP has added: "The Brexit Party is for Chuck Checker".
He opposed the A.A. and said, as he said, we are not involved in the world war.
We should adopt our own laws in our own country.
Mr. Boone has destroyed the public's opinion that has changed since the 2016 election. The British public has changed its mind and wants to remain silent.
Tory brexiteer andrew jenkins is alone in the north, the reporters say: "i'm simply saying, prime minister, listen to the people.
Chechers are not popular with the people, they are not elected by the opposition, and it is not known why our parties and activists make us the first choice.
Please leave the Chequers and listen.
In a message to Mr. May, he added: "The Prime Minister keeps his promises and keeps his job".
Mr. Faraj says to politicians, "You should feel the heat if you want to win the 2016 referendum".
"It is a matter of trust between us - the people - and our political wing", he said.
They are going to try to defeat Brexit and we are going to talk about it today. We will not allow them to do that.
He sent a message to the crowd, he was the one who increased, I want you to organize our political department, feel the heat, feel the heat, feel the heat.
We are gathering the people's activists in this city who are victorious for Brexit, we will not rest until we can help ourselves, self-govern, we are proud of the United Kingdom.
Meanwhile, the rest of the marchers passed through Burningham before making their two-hour protest into the city center.
Activists have raised the cry of Torywich to the Brexit banners after the group was released this week.
The labor leader, Lord Adonis, mocked the conservatives for their security concerns, which had already caused concern as the conference began.
These people have the IT systems in place and all the technology in Canada, because of the borderless, borderless, borderless trade, that's what it's all about.
It is a complete joke.
There is nothing as good as Brexit, he added.

Lewis Hamilton, the Russian Grandmaster, after his team beat Sebastian Vettel to win the world title.
The team's role in the race is crucial, as became clear after Valtteri Bottas gave Lewis Hamilton a Mercedes on Saturday.
From pole, space is a good start and can be used to push Hamilton to attack space and Vettel as he has done in the first two rounds.
Vettel went to the well first and let a Hamilton run off the lead, a decision that needs to be made.
Mercedes made it after the jump and went out of Vettel's side, but Hamilton went a flat course and risked his head to avoid being seen by the Ferrari driver, and crashed into the third corner.
Max Verstappen was seventh in the table, starting from the last row and finishing 21st.
He then ran a long-distance race with the Goma River to take first place in the ALMO and Kimi Raikkonen fourth.
he increased his speed in the eighth round but could not adjust his pace and was fourth in the remaining eight rounds.
It was a tough day because Valtteri did a great job all week and he was the right guy.
Using One Two, the team did an interesting job, as Hamilton put it.
This is a very bad human language.
President trump mocked senator diane fenstein at the political community meeting on saturday, when he refused to release the letter from christian blasey ford in the supreme court case of sexual assault against brett kavanaugh.
In a speech in West Virginia, the president did not directly testify to Ford's address before a Senate committee, but rather to the public as to what was happening in the Senate, which was "average and disgusting and unbelievable".
Something that can be created and something that is beautiful will remain in the Senate for a few days, and when you see a man angry, when you see an angry man and mean and ugly and unbelievable, there is a "W".
When I see them coming and going and saying, "Oh, I didn't do it".
i did not do it.
What is the purpose of the Memorial?
Diane Fenstein, did you know?
Remember her answer... you opened the document - oh, oh, what?
Oh, no, not at all.
i did not.
Hold on a minute.
We're not going to... no, we're not going to", he added, drawing the senator's attention.
She sent a letter to Fenton in February, and in May, she denied that Fenton had left her office in the wake of the unproven case against Kavanaugh.
I didn't make the Ford case, I didn't make the story public, she told the committee, The Hill reported.
She asked me to keep it a secret and I kept it a secret.
her denial was not before the president, who suggested at a meeting on saturday night, that this is bad language.
Maybe she didn't, but what I saw was the ugly deaf language.
The high court case continues, with the three women accused of sexual assault, the president says, are the Democrats bringing the suit for their own ends.
they have decided to take power again in any form.
you see the mediator, the ugly, it's not their business to hurt, it's their business to control who to get power, think about the president's report.

Micronesian air crash: Air New Guinea now says one person is missing after a plane crash in Laguna
A plane bound for the Pacific Lagoon crashes in Micronesia, one person is missing, the rest of the passengers and one crew member is safely aboard the plane.
Air New Guinea said that it was not possible to identify the passengers who had been evacuated on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with the country's authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the missing person.
The airman was not quick to answer the question about the passenger's age, age, age.
Local boats are trying to rescue other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water as it was about to land on the airspace of Chuuk Island.
Seven people were taken to hospital on Friday, officials said.
six of the victims remained in hospital, and are in good condition, according to the airline.
The exact process and the reason for the prosecution are unclear.
The airline and the U.S. both have air forces that landed the plane in Lagos.
Some witnesses said the plane had gone over the Maquoketa.
American traveler Bill Jaynes said the plane was descending too far.
That's a very good thing.
Jaynes said he and others had drowned in deep water and had to escape through the emergency exit.
At that time, the passengers were screaming and yelling, and he suffered a minor head injury.
U.S. Air Force crews working in the area assisted in the rescue effort, using boats to evacuate people before the plane dived about 30 meters (100 feet).
According to information from Aviation Safety, 111 people died in the crash, although the airline that registered the aircraft two years ago was not involved in the crash.
According to the nightly report of the insurgents, the woman was burned with stones
The trial of the man who burned a Mississippian woman to death in 2014 is postponed until Saturday.
U.S. Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett has been questioned for hours as an expert witness in a courtroom.
In the case of the use of a phone recording, he was called by a 29-year-old Qintun Teles guard and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of her death.
The Clarion Ledger reports that Rowlett collected location information from several phones, and that Chambers was with Telis the night she died, contradicting previous suspicions.
The information said he was with Chamber, but he was with my friend Michael Sanford, who had gone to talk to Sanford.
Sanford took his position on Saturday and confirmed that he was not in the city that day.
When the jury asked Telles to tell them the truth, he said, "I was in Sanford's truck that night, and Sanford lied, my car was in Nashville".
Another thing that was unconnected was that Telis had been unconscious for two weeks before Chambers died.
but the phone records show that they have known each other for about a week.
According to Rowlett, sometime after Chambers' death, Telis may have deleted Chambers's text, call, and number from her phone.
There is a divorce in his life, there is a void.
The closing of the defense is scheduled to begin on Sunday.
The judges said he could go to court later that day.

Another black man?!
Enway Nani Suez's couples fighting after a text message from a prostitute
New York nanny sees racist abuse, receives wrong messages from her mother, and says she's black.
These couples have denied their ethnicity, and it is a force of nature.
Leinsey Plaskman, a mother of two, was devastated when she received a new baby sitter, Giselle Maurice, who was black when she first went to work in 2016.
"There will be no other black man", Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband.
However, she sent a letter to her husband, to Mrs. Morris, twice.
After she found out, she fired Placebo-Flaxman's mother, Ms. Morris, citing the nanny who was leaving, the African-American, the job she was doing, and the Filipino he was waiting for, according to the New York Post.
Mrs. Morris was paid for a job and sent home to Uber.
Now, Maurice is fighting the charges, and she's trying to deny that she was originally hired to live in the gig for six months, when Albert was out of contract.
I want the salesmen to know, look, you don't do that kind of thing, there's an ad in the magazine, and they know it's a commercial when I add it.
the couple refused to believe Mourice's racist comments, explaining that it was reasonable for him to resign, after they had spoken to him.
my wife sent me what she didn't want to say.
she is not a racist.
We are not racists, " said her husband, Joel Plasco, in an ad.
would you hold your children accountable for what you say, even if it was a mistake?
Your newborn child?
come.
As a full-fledged, Plasco's wife is only two months pregnant and in critical condition.
will you go away like that?
This is not a good thing to do, added the investment banker.
While the legal case is still ongoing, the court of public opinion is criticizing the couple on social media, opposing their image and ideology.
Paddington publishers fear that readers will compare them to a talking bear, new bear letter reveals
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, was born after the book was accepted, and the letter states that it was difficult to put oneself in the shoes of other white people before it was published.
It's very exciting to learn about Paddington's big success.
Her father, who was a BBC cameraman before he was inspired to write a children's book about a teddy bear, said he was not discouraged by the rejection of his work, and that the book was published to celebrate the anniversary of his death a year after his death.
Paddington, who she said was the family's "essential man", added that he was happy with his latest achievement.
He was a gentle man, and not a proud one, she said.
But Paddington is loyal to him, and that means that if you have children, you will achieve something, even if it's not your job, and you're proud of them.
I think that's how he saw Paddington's success.
Despite his invention, Paddington is always praised.
My daughter is dying and I need to call her.
She rushed the child to the Louis Pasteur II Hospital in Nice, where doctors worked tirelessly to save her life.
she called to say that she was very bad, she didn't expect to do that, but that mr. edna laperos was there.
After finding her, she must be able to tell her that she is dead after eight minutes.
And I did it.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, my dear.
I will be with Kanchi soon.
I will be with Kanchi.
The medication the doctors gave her to fix her heartbeat is slowly coming off and is clearing her system.
She died before him and that was the end of it.
I have to sit here and wait, and this is a revelation.
I don't cry or cry, I am surrounded by my family and people.
I have to get together in a real way.
Mrs. Edna-Laperos, now grieving the loss of her son, was on the plane, away from the other passengers - and forgotten by them.
no one knows, but she does.
I lower my head, and tears are always flowing.
It's hard to explain, but I was on the plane when I felt this deep emotion for Nad.
He needs my love and understanding.
let him know how much he loves her.
A woman holding a postcard of sorrow on a bridge to avenge her suicide.
Two women who lost their loved ones to suicide are working to protect others by sacrificing their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are handing out postcards on the Welsh Bridge and even phones that people can call for help.
Mr. Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he started to suffer from depression and committed suicide at 18.
"I don't want my family to think the way I always think", she said.
Ms. Davis, aged 79, from Leeds, with her daughter, the promising chef, Infection Green.
Everyone knows him for his smile.
as they always said, their smiles filled the room.
However, before he died, he was in despair, as if he were in a dark place.
Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, sought out his brothers after taking his own life.
Ms. Davis said that the results of the knocks I had been knocking on repeatedly were there.
Ms. Davis created the card so that she could tell people where they could go and talk to them, even if it was a friend.
Don't just sit around - you have to work.
Miss Humphreys, a friend of Miss Davis, disappeared not long after her 15-year-old friend's mother died.

Brett Kavanagh's future will be determined by the FBI investigation.
"I think if we could get something like what he asked for - the study is limited in time, limited in scope - we would have to bring a little unity", Mr. Fleck said Saturday, adding that the committee was "diverse" and that Amid Partson strongly opposed Gridlock.
That's why Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to stop investigating.
The secret of their success is time.
With just five weeks to go until the midterm elections in June, as expected, Republicans are working hard to find the person they want to elect as the next Supreme Court justice.
George W. Bush picked up the phone to call the senators, and to influence the campaign, he supported Kavanaugh, who had worked for Bush in the White House and through whom his wife, Ashley, had met Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI releases the results?
There will be elections in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats now sit.
Kavanaugh's chances of winning a Senate floor with a narrow margin are questionable, allowing him to run for vice president, Mike Pence, to break the prison and for the Supreme Court to confirm him.
North Korean death toll dropped under Kim
Many North Korean destroyers fell to South Korea seven years before Kim Jong-un took office, according to South Korean lawmakers.
Park Byung-seog, the Southern Union Data Ministry, said there were 1,127 contaminations since last year - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said that the biggest of these smugglers are the ones who are accused of being the biggest in North Korea and China, which are narrow.
Pyongyang has not commented publicly.
Many North Korean refugees have gained South Korean citizenship.
More than 30,000 South Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the 1953 war.
Many flights pass through China, which has the longest border with Korea and the easiest with the most secretive military shield (the DMZ) of the two Koreas.
China treats these refugees as illegal migrants rather than as refugees and is effectively repatriating them.
The relationship between the South and the North - both of which are technically at war - has changed in recent months.
Earlier this month, the two leaders met in Pyongyang to discuss the possibility of nuclear disarmament.
This comes after a historic visit in Singapore in February by President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un, who agreed to create a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the US law enforcement for the conduct.
"There is no plan against the US, and in this situation, we have no confidence in our national security, no reason to put ourselves in the first place", Mr. Ri said at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh a "hysterical" and said he was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
The head of the lower court, Nancy Pelosi, called Brett Kavanaugh of the high court "hysterical" and said he was unfit to serve on the high court.
Pelosi commented on the interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
I can't help but think that if she did, Pelosi would have testified about Kavanaugh's actions before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Kavanaugh has denied the allegations, and has denied that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford as a child.
In his opening speech, Kavanaugh was emotional, screaming and shaking as his family and his high school years were discussed.
The committee blamed Democrats for the alleged "spoofing" and "concerted assassination" of Hillary, which was orchestrated by liberals angry that she did not win the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony, arguing that he should not serve on the Supreme Court because he was a bully to Democrats.
"As I understand it, he has isolated himself from the Clintonites and Democrats, " he said.
Pelosi is unable to impeach Kavanaugh, and Democrats win a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'm saying that -- he's not going to tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, but he's here to be on trial", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is now a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that Democrats were concerned about the potential of Kavanaugh's administration.
He confirmed that he had heard that Kavanaugh was asking for the overturning of some of the Supreme Court's decisions.
It's not the time for hysterics, it's the time for the person to go to court, it's not that good, Pelosi said.
and women should practice it.
This is a fair talk, months and years pass, and she can't be found without crying.
We cry our anger, Mrs. Steinme, 45 years after my death.
"I don't think it's been known, have you?"
She continued, "I helped a woman who was an executive in a place where she could not help herself, and she cried when she cried, but when she started crying and started to cry, she was crying because she thought she was sad.
I was angry.
and she continued.
And I thought, this is good.
tears can be a source of anger because you haven't helped these people since the beginning.
My fondest memory is of my previous job, a male-dominated office, where I found myself crying, with a big woman holding a scarf around my neck - a cold manager who would slowly pull me up the stairs.
I'd never see you cry, he told me.
they don't know that i love you.
they are concerned about you and are glad you came.
Patricia Scrooder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gray Hart on his presidential bid.
In addition to the marriage, Mr. Hart had a business in a boat called the Falcon overseas and withdrew from the race, leaving Mrs. Schroeder so frightened that she realized there was no reason to prevent her from running for the presidency.
That's not a good idea, she laughed at me 30 years ago.
There were seven other contestants in the race, and the last one they wanted was another contestant.
Snow white as a feather and the seven stars.
She said that because they were late in the campaign, she was with the fundraising, and that she could not participate in the race until she had collected $2 million.
it was a victory.
He found out that her fans were giving $1,000 to the boys, but only $250 to him.
"Do you think they found your wallet?" she asked.
When she announced in her speech that she would not be launching a normal campaign, she was emotionally drawn - thank you to all who supported her, afraid of the system, difficult to raise money and get voters from outside the delegates, and angry about sexual harassment - this was what motivated her.
I think it's a shame, Mrs. Scrooder, to ask how the reprints are.
I think you know that Clinix is my co-sponsor.
I remember this thought, that they put the what on the wall.
Did she cry?
how a trade war between the us and china could be good for beijing.
Salvos opens a trade war between China and the U.S., and the playing field is narrow, with other countries benefiting from Beijing's long-term plans, according to experts.
Donald Trump, the US president, issued his first warning of tariffs this year on crucial Chinese exports of solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The new tariffs are this week's $200bn (£150bn) of goods that are worthless, with half of the tariffs coming from the US to China.
Beijing has always been a big business, with its recent tariff hikes of five to ten cents on $60 billion worth of US goods.
China has vowed to rip off the US and the world's second largest economy will soon be replaced.
"The US has been a major player in the global economy, and the US has been a major player in the global economy, and the US has been a major player in the global economy".
Still, experts say that if Beijing can play right, the US arms trade pressure should be reduced to help China in the long-term plan to reduce economic ties between the two countries.
"The situation is worse when the rapid political decisions of either Washington or Beijing weigh on the economy of their country", said Abigail Grace, a research associate at the Asian-focused think tank Mid-America Security.
Syria is ready to return refugees, says foreign minister
As the Syrians say, we are now ready to welcome the refugees and help rebuild the country that has been ravaged by more than seven years of war.
He is speaking to the UN Secretary General, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moulem, in the context of the country's ongoing unrest.
"Today is very calm and peaceful, thank you for your cooperation in the fight against terrorism", he said.
The government is restoring areas destroyed by terrorism to bring life back to normal.
Everything is now ready for the country that is being liberated due to terrorism and economic measures that are focused on the daily life of one side only.
It is estimated that more than 5.5 million people have fled Syria since the war began in 2011.
an additional six million people in the country are still in need of humanitarian assistance.
al-mu'awlam said that syria would accept any help to rebuild its state.
but he is worried that they will not be able to accept sponsorship from other countries or the dictates of the situation.
