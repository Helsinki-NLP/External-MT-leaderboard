28-year-old chef found dead in San Francisco mall
A 28-year-old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stairwell of a local mall.
The victim's brother testified that he could not imagine anyone wanting to harm him, saying, "He finally got back on his feet."
The body found Wednesday morning at the Westfield Mall was identified as 28-year-old Frank Galicia of San Francisco, the San Francisco Forensic Science Department said.
The San Francisco Police Department said the death was being treated as a homicide and an investigation is ongoing.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told San Francisco station KGO that Frank, who used to work as a chef in Boston, landed his dream job as a chef at San Francisco's Sons & Daughters restaurant six months ago.
A spokesman for Sons & Daughters said they were "shocked and devastated" by his death.
"We are a small team working like a close family and we will miss him dearly," the spokesman added.
Our thoughts and condolences are with Frank's family and friends at this difficult time.
Louis Galicia said that Frank initially lived in hostels, but that "things finally went uphill for him."
"He found an apartment, he had a girlfriend," Louis Garcia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said he could not imagine anyone wanting to harm his younger brother.
He was a kind person with a big heart.
His way of connecting with his family was always to cook us something, to make us dinner, "Louis Galicia said.
He never wanted to be involved in any kind of altercation.
He was the brother who swam with the river.
"For everything that goes wrong in the world, he was that uncut diamond that shone brightly every day," he said.
Anyone with information about the case is asked to call the SFPD's tip line at 415-575-4444.
Jennifer Aniston: I'm always pigeonholed
Jennifer Aniston doesn't always have to be perfect or successful.
The Hollywood star has now made that very clear in an interview.
"I am always put in drawers or get labels glued on from the outside, which usually have little to do with me and reality."
'I don't have the desire to be perfect and successful all the time. '
'To be honest, I'm rather sniffy about these things. '
Jennifer Aniston, 47, can only laugh at being called "Miss Perfect," as she explains in the current issue of Cosmopolitan.
The actress prefers to spend her time at home, in front of the TV, with a loose bun and Mexican food, according to the magazine.
She added: 'We women don't have to be married or have children to be perfect,' the Hollywood star said.
In her new film, "Mother's Day," Aniston stars as a single mother of two sons.
The film will be shown in Germany from August 25th.
Golfer Langer Receives the Sports Pyramid
His experience on horseback is manageable.
At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Langer was looking for some variety with some colleagues with a ride on the beach.
It was a first for the 58-year-old.
CHIO: "Golden Sports Pyramid" for Bernhard Langer
After a few minutes the horses remembered their end of the day, they hunted in a quick gallop home to the feeding troughs.
A kilometer at this pace, I was scared.
"It wasn't a good experience," Langer said.
And with that the riding career ended again.
On Saturday, Germany's best golfer of all time - 101 tournament wins - was back in the vicinity of horses.
He allowed himself to be guided with his family over the layout of the ALRV, he did not even swing on a horse for photo purposes.
Langer was in Aachen for the first time and thus also at the CHIO.
The reason was entirely convincing.
The German Sports Aid presented the man from Anhausen with the Golden Sports Pyramid during a small gala.
The likeable sportsman does not lack for awards.
Federal Cross of Merit, Silver Laurel Leaf, Champions Tour Player of the Year...
Even the British Queen has knighted him.
Langer is the 18th winner of the Sports Pyramid award.
In Aachen he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday.
"This award means a lot to me," Langer says, "because it is awarded not only for sporting success, but also for social commitment."
Langer has been fostering the next generation for decades.
And so he passed on the prize money of 25,000 euros immediately.
The two-time US Masters winner was inducted into the "Hall of Fame of German Sports" with 15 other outstanding athletes on Saturday.
Among the winners are the athletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the gymnast Eberhard Gienger, the fencers Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the rower Peter-Michael Kolbe, bobsleigh rider Meinhard Nehmer, the judoka Frank Wieneke, the show jumper Alwin Schockemöhle and posthumously the handball player Erhard Wunderlich.
Many of these sports legends came to Aachen on Saturday.
After the official part, the illustrious company went to the jumping stadium, where the Lavazza Prize ran.
Bernhard Langer kept his distance from the big beasts.
Clintons and Trump's Economic Policy Comparison: It's All About the Money
Both Clinton and Trump want to invest in infrastructure and block the TTP trade deal.
However, the two US presidential candidates disagree on taxation and energy policy, as well as on a fundamental issue.
Underlying the differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a fundamental, rather philosophical, difference.
The, about the role of the state.
Trump wants to keep those in doubt rather small, warning of how the state can hurt the economy - with taxes and regulations.
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate it to death, he says.
He himself, however, would be very different, Trump claims.
He will scale back regulations massively, and he is pushing for far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and businesses.
Clinton, by contrast, says the state has certain tasks to fulfill, has opportunities for the disadvantaged, and needs money to do so.
That's why taxes on the rich would be raised, she says.
Interestingly, the two are very close when it comes to infrastructure.
Trump and Clinton say almost word for word that investment is needed.
The Democratic candidate even announces the biggest investment in new jobs since World War II.
Government infrastructure investment programs are classic Democratic policies, and are strongly opposed by, say, the tea party wing of the Republican Party, which is critical of the government.
So Trump could still face intra-party discussions.
The differences in energy and climate policy are clearer.
Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and restart coal production in the US.
Oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas; he wants to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement.
Clinton, on the other hand, explicitly wants to expand renewable energies with her investment program, demanding: "One country will become the superpower of clean energy and create millions of jobs."
'It's going to be either China, Germany or America - I want us to be. '
But it's not just infrastructure - the two rivals are not too far apart on international trade agreements, either.
Neither wants to sign the TPP, the Trans-Pacific Trade Agreement.
At the same time, however, both do not want to isolate the US from international trade - they simply want to better protect American jobs.
They should be better paid, Clinton says.
The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a pittance.
She wants to raise it to $15 an hour.
What Trump wants to do on this issue is not entirely clear: at one point he says the minimum wage must go up, then he says it must not be changed.
But the big discussion in the coming months is likely to revolve more around the tax policies of the two camps.
On one side is Trump, who wants to ease the burden on the economy and citizens in order to boost growth.
His critics accuse him of only widening the budget deficit.
On the other side is Clinton, who wants at least the rich to pay more taxes, and whose critics say that raising taxes is not the solution either.
Escape: "Every refugee woman has experience of sexual violence"
Sexual violence is almost a daily occurrence for women fleeing alone.
When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatised.
A house offers refuge.
Four women are sitting in a large kitchen.
Each one has a baby who is at most one year old.
One held her young son in her arms.
He gazes curiously into the room with wide eyes.
His mother stares at the tabletop.
Until she realises she's being watched.
She smiles briefly and kisses the little one.
The scene seems normal.
Until you talk to Katrin Bahr.
She is the Managing Director of Condrobs, a provider of social assistance services in Bavaria, and deals, among other things, with the subject of women on the run.
The four women in the kitchen are refugees.
They live in the north of Munich in one of the few decentralised shelters for single women and their children in Bavaria.
In January, Condrobs opened the facility together with Pro Familia and Münchner Frauenhilfe.
It was recently officially opened.
There are 60 people living there - about 40 women and 20 children.
There are no men - not even as visitors.
The exception is a security guard at the door.
"It is not an exaggeration to say that every woman who arrives here has experienced sexual violence while on the run," says Bahr.
"Men flee because of wars, because they are politically persecuted, because they are threatened with torture or death, or because their families send them to Europe as bearers of hope," she says.
For women, other reasons for escaping predominate: "Many steal away secretly because they see no other way out."
In their home countries, they have experienced sexual violence, forced marriages, honour killings, slavery or forced prostitution.
That drives them on.
On the run, it goes on.
"It is not uncommon for smugglers to demand a sexual act for a bottle of water, for example," says Bahr.
And the women are alone, they are not protected by their families.
Whoever thinks that this will end as soon as they arrive in Germany is mistaken, says Bahr.
Here too, single women in refugee shelters are often regarded as inferior and, at worst, abused.
As a result, she estimates, about 90 percent of the women living in the accommodation in the north of Munich are traumatized.
'Some of the children certainly didn't come of their own accord. '
Many women are so used to not saying anything.
'Or they don't dare to speak openly about what they've experienced because the shame is too great. '
Since they often do not know how to help themselves, more accommodation is only needed for them, Bahr demands.
In Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for housing refugees.
When asked whether they were aware of a project similar to the one in Munich in their area of competence, some of them said no.
In Upper Palatinate and Upper Franconia, for example, there is no such thing in government accommodation.
Even in Swabia, women who have fled alone are not housed separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, press spokesman for the government.
In Upper Bavaria, Lower Franconia and Middle Franconia, some dormitories have floors or own houses only for single women and their children.
The exception is Lower Bavaria, where there are two central accommodations exclusively for women.
The Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality in the European Parliament also calls for women to be housed separately from men.
A study published for the committee said: 'It is very important that men and women are housed separately.'
'If there is a lack of privacy or if men and women are housed together, there can be violence against women, which is ongoing. '
Above all, the washrooms should be separate and easily accessible for women, the study says.
The extent to which the women feel this need for protection can be seen from the crush on the house in Munich.
"Since word got around that we exist, we've had a long waiting list," Bahr says.
You could easily open a second house.
Junior doctors strike: Calls for new industrial action
Junior doctors' representatives have called on their union to approve new industrial action in their dispute over a new contract.
The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has called on its entire council to approve more industrial action from the beginning of September.
The JDC said ministers had failed to address concerns about the contract.
Junior doctors and medical students voted in July to reject a contract agreed with the BMA.
It was rejected by 58% of its members who voted in the elections.
In a letter to members posted on Twitter on Thursday night, JDC Chairwoman Ellen McCourt said the government had remained "stubbornly quiet" on issues that led to the contract being rejected.
She said: 'In light of this, the JDC board voted to reject the proposed new contract in its entirety and requested formal renegotiation on all of your concerns.'
In response to the Government's silence, the JDC board has today made a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA council to approve an ongoing programme of escalating industrial action, starting in early September.
The disputes led to junior doctors striking six times this year, the first total stoppages in NHS history.
The head of the BMA's junior doctors, Dr Johann Malawana, resigned after the vote to reject the agreed terms of the contract, which had been recommended by the BMA.
He told BMA members during meetings held before the vote by 54,000 junior doctors and medical students that the contract was advantageous and should be adopted.
After the vote, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the contract would be compulsory for doctors in England.
Russia and Turkey: An "alliance of outsiders"?
It was a gesture that ended a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and announce an official end to an eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of the St. Petersburg Palace, I cannot help feeling that Ankara most wants this reconciliation.
There was the handshake, yes.
But Putin's smile seemed narrow-lipped, and he radiated little warmth, even by his low-key standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his "dear friend" Putin - five times, according to one report.
I couldn't count it anymore.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their pre-crisis levels, but would even improve.
The next day, one newspaper described Erdogan as behaving as if nothing bad had ever happened.
To me, his enthusiasm seemed to suggest the opposite.
But a sustained coolness radiated by Putin showed that Russia's leader had forgotten nothing.
Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening remarks: Turkey's shooting down of a Russian warplane on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction at the time was furious.
Putin issued a statement accusing Ankara of stabbing Russia in the back.
The offence was even greater, as it was committed by an alleged friend.
Rebuilding trust will be difficult, if not impossible.
Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.
For months, the state-controlled media carried out a ferocious, all-out attack on Ankara.
Suddenly, it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything.
Most serious were allegations by senior officials that Erdogan's own family benefited from the illegal oil trade in areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He has vehemently denied this.
But in St. Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to look ahead.
After all, that meeting took place only because Putin received the apology he wanted to hear from President Erdogan.
Russia achieved some sort of victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of a ceasefire are clear.
Erdogan needs all the friends he can get, first and foremost, after he was almost impeached in a failed coup last month.
Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.
But there are also economic motives.
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - particularly the ban on charter flights, which typically bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.
The number has fallen by almost 90%.
In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when flights resume.
They are counting on a late-season rush to the Mediterranean.
This week, state television predicted cheaper fruit and vegetables once Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again.
As one report in Vedemosti put it: "Tourists long there, tomatoes long here."
But the visit had an added political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West for viewing its response to the attempted takeover as a weak response.
Add to that lingering resentment about the snail's pace of EU accession negotiations, and Putin - eager to capitalize on the chill and reduce Turkey's relationship with the West.
The Russian leader certainly won a bonus in Ankara for calling for support for the elected authorities after the attempted coup.
This is a matter of course for Moscow, which itself has a deep-seated fear of regime change.
The summit in this splendid oceanfront palace allowed Russia and Turkey to portray what one analyst once described to me as an "alliance of outsiders": two countries that feel rejected and mistreated by the West and are now allied.
However, despite the public reconciliation, there are still major differences between the two.
The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently cast itself as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.
Significantly, after nearly three hours of initial talks, both presidents testified at the news conference that they had not even touched on the issue.
Turkey's president deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences, while Putin chose to emphasize them.
There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found on Syria.
But, after months of open hostilities - and given the potential for total disaster when NATO member Turkey shot down the Russian fighter jet - it is surely better that the two leaders at least talk to each other again.
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available to customers outside Scotland
The RBS brand is to be reduced to a back office role, according to the bank's chief executive.
Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank's global ambitions.
The bank has distanced itself since when it nearly collapsed and had to be rescued eight years ago.
During this time, brand strategists have used "RBS" to protect other consumer financial brands.
She has supported international sport with millions of pounds of sponsorship, from Six Nations rugby to Wimbledon winner Andy Murray.
But now it has decided to focus on more national brands.
Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland, but will not be initialised.
In England and Wales, all RSB references, devolved headquarters and listing will move to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other smaller retail brands that will get more prominence - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a tour of customers and staff in Inverness-shire.
He told BBC Scotland: "The RSB brand will become our investor brand and the brand under which our people will be employed as we become more of a bank of brands."
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
What I am saying now is that we are not pursuing global objectives, but local objectives.
Each of these brands will stand for something completely different in their own communities, and our employees will work with customers under these brands.
RBS has already said it will no longer continue its Six Nations sponsorship and that it will increase the visibility of the various brands in its sports sponsorship.
"It's time for us to become the Bank of Brands, because how do we focus internally (we asked) on making this a better bank for customers?" the chief executive said.
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we had said we would be a great bank for our customers and launched these brands.
But with our work, focusing on customer needs and not our own, I think we will see a lot of change.
We can re-launch these brands, so I think the time has come.
Frankie Dettori claims his 3,000th Newmarket win on Prediction
Dettori sprays champagne after a double at Newmarket which earned him his 3,000th win
Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th British win at Newmarket on Friday.
He set a milestone on Predilection, which is trained by John Gosden, at his local track with his second win of the night.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach the milestone in flat racing.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddry and Willie Carson.
Three-time winner Dettori, who has previously won on Ghayyar, said: 'It's special.'
I am very emotional because my family is here too
I'm very happy it happened at Newmarket because I landed here 30 years ago.
It's not a big meeting, it's not Royal Ascot - it's a mundane Friday night with 20,000 people.
I am relieved and very humbled.
Dettori picks up the cheer as he takes victory on Prediction
Two jockeys have reached the milestone in steeplechasing - jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time winner Sir Anthony McCoy, who has racked up more than 4,300 wins in a record-breaking career.
Lester Piggott, the nine-time Derby winner, had 4,493 career wins
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of the modern era and it is no surprise he has reached this milestone that few have reached before him.
He has style and is strong, but it is his tactical intellect that sets him apart from the others in the weight control room.
He is a fantastic ambassador for racing and his enthusiasm and charisma has been inspiring fans for years.
I told Frankie at Epsom a couple of weeks ago that if he wasn't just a weekend and big-race jockey, he would have won £6,000 already!
Frankie has ridden winners in the UK for almost 30 years, which is great.
He has a lively personality, which is good for a British race, but beyond that he is an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a typically flypast
From Flying Finishes to Flying Dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the figurehead of British Flat racing for two decades.
It was nerve-wracking.
A string of big-race wins, including his famous "Glorious Seven" at Ascot in 1996, but he also survived a plane crash and a drugs ban.
Three years ago he struggled when he returned from his six-month suspension but he showed impressive strength of character to defy his doubters and return to his best.
And he is far from the finished article - Dettori has previously said he wants to continue competing until he is at least 50.
Russia's Putin fires chief of staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly fired his chief of staff, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov was for many years part of Putin's inner circle of confidants.
The 63-year-old has been appointed Special Representative for Environment and Transport Affairs.
A Kremlin statement said Putin had "ordered Ivanov's dismissal from his duties as chairman of Russia's presidential administration" without giving reasons.
Anton Vaino, who had been Ivanov's deputy since 2012, was appointed as his successor.
Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in 1972 in the Estonian capital Tallinn, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the embassy in Tokyo.
The Kremlin's website says (in Russian) that he later served as chief of protocol and chief of staff to government personnel.
On his appointment, he told Putin: 'Thank you for your trust.'
I think that the most important task of the government is to support your work as head of state in terms of drafting laws and controls to implement your instructions.
Putin told the Russian TV channel on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.
Are the smiling faces convincing?
The move has shrouded Moscow in secrecy.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin's closest confidants and, like him, works for the Soviet secret service, the KGB.
As chief of staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
In a televised meeting with President Putin, both men claimed that the chief of staff was resigning at his own request.
But despite the smiles for the cameras, few here are convinced - especially now, just before the general election.
So is this the result of some kind of power struggle?
Nobody knows at the moment.
But the official assertion - that a man once touted as a potential president suddenly wants to lead Russia's environmental policy - was met with great skepticism.
In his remarks to Putin, quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said: "It is true that in early 2012 I asked you in a conversation to entrust me with this very complicated - you could almost say arduous - post for four years.
As it turns out, I have been Chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took up the post in December 2011.
He previously served as deputy prime minister and defence minister.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, a former member of the state security service, the KGB.
In the late 1990 "s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov as one of five people he trusted most.
It was once thought that Ivanov could become president of Russia after Putin's second term, because a third term would have violated the constitution.
But that post was taken by another close Putin ally, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister before being re-elected president three-and-a-half years later.
Criminal Minds star Thomas Gibson fired after slamming producers
Gibson was involved in a physical altercation on the set of the show in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce the series, announced his termination in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played special agent Aaron Hotchner, publicly apologized Thursday before announcing his termination.
There were artistic differences and disagreements on set.
I regret the incident, "he said in a statement.
Details of how Gibson's character will be written out of the series, which follows a team of FBI agents, are expected to be released at a later date, according to the statement from ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
The 54-year-old, who previously starred in the sitcom Dharma & Greg, has been with the show since its first season in 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds and have put all my heart and soul into it for the last 12 years," Gibson said in a statement released on Friday.
I had hoped to be there until the end, but that will not be possible now.
I would just like to thank the writers, producers, actors, our wonderful crew and most of all the best fans you could wish for in a show.
The twelfth season is scheduled to air on September 28.
Mystery over fish that landed in garden in Banff
A Banff resident has called for help identifying the fish that turned up in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks the 75 fish could be sand eels spewed from a fountain.
Mr Bain, who lives about 500 metres from the sea, posted a video of the spectacle on Periscope in the hope someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two-inch-long fish.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now linked to Fife
The £1.35bn project is due to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have connected the north deck of the Queensferry Crossing to the viaduct - meaning the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It is the first of four closures of the "deck blowers," which are nearing completion around each of the three towers of the bridge.
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tonnes.
It has 10,000 tonnes of steel, 20,000 tonnes of concrete and 46 cable stays.
The £1.35bn project is due to be completed by May 2017.
Business Secretary Keith Brown paid a visit to the site today and was one of the first to walk from the land to the bridge.
He said: "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Crossing.
We are all witnessing an engineering feat of truly epic proportions in this project, with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel being used for this part of the bridge alone.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for fit.
In total, almost 79% of the entire bridge deck is in place and the final section of the deck is being cast in concrete for the deck at Rosyth today, meaning the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge.
Michael Martin, Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors project manager, said: "The first closure marks a significant milestone in any bridge project.
In this fantastic project, the closure represents pioneering building and civil engineering.
After the installation of the last road deck section and its connection with the north tower deck, which is under construction, we then had to close the remaining gap on the north or land side.
This was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters south.
This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.
Massive because the viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs about 6,000 tonnes and had to be pulled up at an incline of about 3%.
Difficult because the tolerances the team is working towards were tiny - only a few millimetres on each side.
Fortunately, everything went very well.
Moelfre Bay rescue: Three men are "lucky to be alive"
Three men are "lucky to be alive" after they were thrown from their fishing boat off Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI lifeboat station raised the alarm at 13: 20 BST on Friday after a crew observed the incident at Moelfre Bay.
The three men had difficulty swimming to safety as their boat continued to move under its own power.
"We saw the boat turn around near them and we imagined the worst," Moelfre Rescue Station Chief Vince Jones said.
"Fortunately, the strong winds had already blown the boat out of reach by the time we got to the water," he added.
Two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat, while the third man, aged in his 60s, was found exhausted and hanging from a buoy without a life jacket.
They all got on board the coastguard lifeboat and were taken back to the rescue station
Mr Jones said: 'The three men who were thrown into the water are lucky to be uninjured and alive.
The boat engine had an emergency stop line, but this detached when the boat capsized from the person who was piloting the boat.
Someone was watching over these men today.
Seriously injured - man stabs his ex-girlfriend
A man attacked his ex-girlfriend in Hamburg-Harburg with a knife and seriously injured her.
Police said yesterday that the 50-year-old had been given the key to the flat to retrieve his personal belongings.
Instead, the alcoholic perpetrator cut up his ex-girlfriend's clothes.
When she entered the flat, he stabbed her twice.
The 44-year-old woman suffered injuries to her hand and body.
Police were able to arrest the offender.
While destroying his ex-girlfriend's clothes, the 50-year-old called his mother.
She then alerted his sister.
Together with her partner, the 45-year-old wanted to calm her brother down.
But she could not persuade him to leave the apartment.
So she left the house with her partner.
They met the man's ex-partner in the street.
When the two women re-entered the apartment, the 50-year-old pushed his sister aside and attacked his ex-girlfriend.
Who builds affordable housing?
The SPD and the Greens believe that investors should be held much more accountable in future.
How to react to the bad news that Brunswick will lose nearly 1300 affordable homes in the next few years?
The SPD proposes a "Housing Action Concept" for the next Council meeting.
But controversy is programmed.
First and foremost, the question is: who is actually going to build the affordable housing?
No regulation has been put in place so far.
SPD parliamentary group chairman Christoph Bratmann says: "We agree with the Greens: If you want to build on urban land, you will have to designate 20 percent of all apartments as social housing in future."
However, the cheap apartments can also be built in existing buildings.
The big point of contention in the town hall, however, according to Bratmann, is: "How do you deal with investors who want to build on private land?"
"We want investors to build at least 10 percent, but preferably 20 percent, of social housing on such sites."
A new urban housing incentive program, which will cost millions and is yet to be financed, is intended to provide incentives.
The problem, Bratmann said, is that "there is no agreement between the political groups at the moment."
The CDU wants to make as few regulations as possible for investors.
The left wants even tougher conditions for investors.
Nevertheless, Bratmann said, the situation in the housing market is on the verge of worsening.
If the action plan is implemented, this will provide for additional tasks in the construction administration.
More staff is needed.
It is unclear whether we will get the specialists.
But the program is not yet complete: the approximately 1260 new apartments that were supposed to be built anyway.
But how do you compensate for the loss of another 1,300 or so affordable homes, the subsidies for which will expire in the next few years?
By 2020 alone, there will be 500 homes.
Planning spokeswoman Nicole Palm said expiring bonds should now be purchased by the city to prevent that from happening.
Consideration should also be given to bringing homes back into price fixing.
This is possible in the western city.
The problem could be solved in one fell swoop.
Deadlines expire at the end of the year in the western city.
Around 1800 apartments could be brought there back into the price fixing for inexpensive apartments.
But that's not what the owners, the housing associations, want.
Because if the number of social housing in the western city is again increased drastically, one moves away from the goal of so-called mixing.
There should no longer be a concentration of the socially disadvantaged in only a few districts.
The Greens expect that there will still be movement in the discussion.
Group chairman Holger Herlitschke says: "For a broad majority, the CDU must get on board."
The group has focused on more construction sites for single-family homes, he said.
This does not mean, however, that a compromise cannot be reached after all.
Pokémon Go, a chase for health and happiness that pays off
It is fascinating to watch how the world is changing.
The fact that teenagers and children no longer go outside to play, but rather prefer to spend their free time staring at screens, has been lamented by many over the past decade.
Pokemon Go is about getting people off their couches and becoming more active.
Screen time was initially limited to the TV, then to video games and finally to smartphones.
So it's great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive.
I am, of course, referring to the Pokémon Go craze, an app based on the characters first created for video games in the 1990s (which later evolved into a cartoon series, playing cards, and other spin-offs).
Like many pop culture phenomena, interest fell slightly before the game's release in the US, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
The launch in other countries was postponed due to massive demand, which overloaded the servers.
Within days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
How does it work?
In short, players go outside with their smartphones looking for Pokémons that are tracked by GPS and, once found, can be "photographed" (via a screenshot on their phone) or "captured."
A generation who played the game when they were younger joined the craze and leapt off the sofa in search.
In the US, the game has led to a significant increase in the steps the "average" person takes each day.
Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch that tracks 35,000 users, recently told The Washington Post that within two days of the game's launch, the number of people who exercise for 30 minutes a day jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company doesn't know who is playing Pokémon Go - it just sees the raw data to boost performance.
Many public health education campaigns aimed at getting people to "take 30 minutes off," "get off the sofa" and "be active every day" fell on deaf ears, because many public health messages are boring and come from people who look miserable.
Nevertheless, the importance of sport cannot be overstated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps with weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to list here.
But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it gets people to do something outdoors that they enjoy.
This covers three pillars of health - exercise, fresh air and sunshine, and fun.
Some people even make new friends while hunting.
As ever, there are grumpy old game changers who have to complain about something.
And yes, someone could run against a door.
What's the point?
There has been a breakthrough.
Even though smartphone apps like Fitbit have been able to track our activity in the past, they haven't given us any reason to exercise like this game does.
The new will lose its allure and use will diminish over time.
However, because of Pokemon's success, there will be more games that combine apps and virtual reality with real-world activity, helping many people in the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier.

Simone Biles wins gold in women's gymnastics
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is immune to all that.
Dynamic on the jumping horse.
Effortlessly on the beam.
Stunning on the ground.
Brilliant all round.
And now, finally, Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast climbed to the all-around title on Thursday, widening the gap between herself and the rest of the world under the spotlight at the Olympics.
Her overall score of 62.198 was well ahead of silver medalist and "Final Five" teammate Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.
American gymnast Simone Biles competes on the beam during the women's individual all-around gymnastics final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday.
Biles is the fourth heterosexual American to win an all-around title, and the fifth overall, as she cements her reputation as the best of her generation, or even of all time.
She burst into tears as her final result was shown and her long journey came to an end at that moment.
This success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who have taken their sports to new heights:
Biles has dominated her sport for the past three years, winning 15 world championships - including 10 gold medals - with such amazing routines that she has a mixture of ambition and precision that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called her "the best gymnast I've ever seen."
A final test awaited her in Brazil, a competition that was not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes as between her and a burden of outsized expectations.
Not returning to the family in Spring, Texas with a handful of gold would be seen as a disappointment.
Americans Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman embrace after winning gold and silver respectively in the women's all-around gymnastics final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday
Biles picked up her first medal on Tuesday while serving as an exclamation point at the farewell ceremony for retiring team coordinator Martha Karolyi.
Though Biles has insisted she never planned for the future during her long road to the top, that's not really true.
Some of her floor routines - which include her trademark tumbling pass - are tuned to Latin music that would fit at home on the street outside the Rio Olympic arena.
This is no coincidence.
The girl, adopted by her grandparents as a young child and discovered by trainer Aimee Boorman's mother during a school trip to the gym where Boorman worked out, became a force.
She has not lost an all-around competition since the summer of 2013, a winning streak that will last as long as Biles wishes.
Even though Mustafina led easily through two spins, the picture was deceptive.
Floor bars and floor gymnastics - where Biles holds the world title - were lurking.
She caught up again with 15.433 on the floating beam - and added another with a 15.933 on the floor.
Raisman hugged her gently as they awaited their final date - a mere formality - and tears streamed down Biles' shiny red, white and blue eyeliner as the vision she once described in her scrapbook became a reality.
Raisman's performance was revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for third place but the bronze medal went to Mustafina in a tiebreak.
This time, the 22-year-old team captain, nicknamed "Granny" by the Americans, had a head start.
After her floor routine, she threw kisses at the audience, overwhelmed by a comeback that at times seemed dubious.
As for Biles, the 19-year-old's fast-spreading tweet from earlier this week has a whole new meaning:
Police: 3 victims shot in serial killer case while listening to music in car
Two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot dead while chatting and listening to music in Phoenix's first serial killer case in a decade, according to police reports released Thursday.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis's daughter Maleah were shot June 12 while the car was parked in a driveway, authorities said.
The offender fired eight shots from a handgun while standing on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle, the report said.
Police said the triple homicide does not appear to have been the result of a robbery as the attacker did not take the handbags or the $2,900 that was in the possession of one of the adult victims.
Phoenix police spokesman Sgt. Jonathan Howard said the shooting led investigators to take a closer look at whether it was linked to four previous attacks.
In total, seven people were killed and two others injured in nine attacks in four months, mostly in Hispanic neighborhoods.
"It's happening in a residential area in front of a house," Howard told KHPO, a CBS affiliate, earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have used several vehicles, including a brown Nissan from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Investigators refused to disclose the evidence that led them to conclude that the attacks were linked and committed by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized for her injuries and later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter Maleah died at the scene.
A witness told police it was not unusual for her to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
Authorities also released a police report on the shooting, which targeted an empty pickup truck half an hour before the triple murder and is believed to have been the work of the serial killer.
Investigators found bullet casings and recovered a bullet from the seat as well as bullet fragments from the engine compartment.
Mother of 6-year-old with microcephaly: 'It's getting better'
Like most six-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But like most of his peers, Edmund has microcephaly, the result of a genetic disorder that his mother, Elizabeth Picciuto, knew nothing about during her pregnancy.
When he first came home, my first thought was, I can't do this.
I can't do that.
I didn't get involved in that.
Which isn't true at all -- of course they did, "she said.
She and her husband Vincent have been told that Edmund may never be able to recognise her and that he may not even survive.
Some doctors even went so far as to suggest he should be institutionalised.
"My first response was, 'I didn't know people were still doing this,'" Picciuto said.
Edmund can walk with the help of a walking aid.
Edmund was unable to sit or crawl until he was three and still cannot speak.
But he is making slow progress.
He can walk and cycle with assistance.
He also loves to play and sing with his two brothers.
Elizabeth shows the sign language Edmund came up with for "Please sing something to me." "
"We teach him sign language," Picciuto told CBS News.
But it's not a typical sign language -- she says. Edmund invented some signs on his own.
Microcephaly has a variety of causes: genetic as in Edmund's case, as well as infections with viruses such as measles or the Zika virus during pregnancy.
Symptoms and prognoses can vary widely.
It is too early to say how it will affect the lives of those infected with the Zika virus.
Picciuto recalls the emotional cost of an uncertain future.
I kept asking, what's going to happen?
What will happen?
And she still doesn't really know.
I haven't asked for the prognosis in a long time because I don't expect anyone to really tell me.
But Picciuto has some hopeful advice for mothers of babies with birth defects caused by the Zika virus.
It's getting better.
You know it's going to get better for you.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rains, flooding prompt rescues in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rains and widespread flooding in Louisiana forced the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday, with more rain expected throughout Saturday.
Numerous rivers in southeastern Louisiana and southern Mississippi flooded their banks and threatened widespread flooding after extreme rainfall, the National Weather Service reported.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and help is already on its way to the affected communities.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the governor's Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, said requests for flood vehicles, boats and sandbags were increasing.
Steele said the community of Tangipahoa alone had requested tens of thousands of sandbags.
A flood warning system is in effect for much of southern Louisiana through Saturday.
The weather service said an additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall in the area.
A flood warning system was in effect in southern Alabama on Friday, while rain continued to fall in the Mobile area.
The Comite River near Baton Rouge and the Amite River near Denham Springs, both in Louisiana, are expected to reach record levels over the weekend.
Meteorologist Alek Krautmann says both rivers could inundate many homes in suburban areas near Baton Rouge.
He also said downstream flooding in Ascension Parish is a danger because it will flow slowly into Lake Maurepas over the trodden rivers.
The Tickfaw River, south of the Mississippi state border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached its highest level ever recorded at 9 a.m. on Friday.
Rescue teams were still plucking people from floodwaters in Amite and Wilkinson counties in southwest Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson were among those rescued near Gloster on Friday.
Hansford, 62, says water from Beaver Creek, which is normally more than 400 feet from his home, rose sharply overnight.
He said another stepson, who lives nearby, had warned him.
"We woke up and the water was pouring in and out," Hansford said.
It reached my waist.
His wife told Hansford that in the 48 years she lived there, she had never seen such a high point of the river.
Hansford said he and his family members all have disabilities and he is the only one who can swim.
Hansford said emergency responders rescued all three in a large military truck and took them to the nearest fire station in Gloster, where they remained until Friday.
Krautmann said the flooding had "spread quickly" as heavy rains continued and that authorities were considering evacuation orders.
According to Krautmann, an observer near Livingstone reported 13.75 inches of rain from midnight to Friday morning.
Krautmann said the ground had been soaked considerably by the rains since Wednesday.
Authorities said heavy rains and road flooding caused residents to be rescued from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and classes to be canceled in five school districts.
CBS affiliate WWL reported that a councilwoman in Tangipahoa reported 200 homes flooded.
Residents were evacuated to two churches, both of which have now been flooded.
Parish Superintendent Robby Miller said authorities had rescued 72 people and seven pets washed up in the floodwaters.
Emergency shelters have been set up in the towns of Amite and Hammond to house evacuees.
"Once the water starts to recede, they will be able to go back to their homes," he said.
In the town of Hammond in Tangipahoa, nearly two dozen roads were closed because of the flooding, and sandbags were provided for residents hoping to keep water out of their homes and businesses.
"The last major flood we had was in March," said Lacy Landrum of the city council.
This appears to be a similar incident.
In Mississippi, Harrison County Emergency Manager Rupert Lacy said rain continued to fall on the Gulf Coast.
He said a handful of homes were reported as flooded on Thursday, but as of Friday none had been reported.
Keith Townson, manager at Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has lived in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places I've never seen before," Townson said, "and it's still coming."
Mahaj Brown, 6, "riddled with bullets," survives Philadelphia shooting
Police say the 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, the second time this week that a 6-year-old child has been shot.
The boy's grandparents identified him to CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.
The grandparents said Brown suffered multiple gunshot wounds, including in the loin, leg, arm and abdomen, but that he was conscious when he was transported to the hospital.
"He went through a lot, his little body was riddled with bullets," his grandmother, Delores Melendez, told the station.
I just can't believe it.
The boy's condition was described as critical at a hospital and he had to undergo several surgeries.
The boy's family told the station he is expected to make a full recovery.
He should have started first grade at a local elementary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in Germantown.
Three men, two aged 29 and a 32-year-old, were also shot.
One of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition; the other two victims are in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The boy was found shot in the front seat of a car along with the 29-year-old, who is in critical condition, the station reported.
The other two victims were not in the car and police are investigating whether one of the injured men may be the perpetrator.
Investigators told CBS Philadelphia that there appeared to be crossfire between several gunmen.
Cartridge casings for assault rifles traced to various assault rifles littered the scene.
It seems that this was clearly an ongoing struggle.
On the street, on both sides of the sidewalk, there were pods.
There appear to have been several armed fighters who were very actively involved, "Philadelphia Police Chief Anthony Ginaldi told the station.
Several homes and vehicles in the area were also hit.
No arrests have been made and police are reportedly reviewing the surveillance video.
On Tuesday, another 6-year-old girl was hit in the arm by a ricochet as she played outside her home in the West Oak Lane neighborhood.
She is recovering and police are still searching for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That's what I envision among the women's Olympic gymnastics team, and for more than one reason.
First, I have been to every summer Olympics since 1984, and the United States has never been so dominant.
And second, this team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who have been inspirational to many young girls of color.
The structure of this team, rounded out by Aly Raisman, who is Jewish, and Madison Kocian, who is Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This team is finally mirroring the United States.
It has solidified the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of the sport.
For the past four years, the number one female gymnast has been African-American.
Last year Simone and Gabby were # 1 and # 2.
That shows strength.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was a surprise Olympic champion and America cheered.
Now the world has been able to witness the incredible performance of three-time world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez as they delivered unexpected yet masterful gymnastics routines.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth straight heterosexual American to win gold in an individual all-around event for women.
Team member Aly Raisman won silver.
We are witnessing the pinnacle of this sport, but this is not the way gymnastics classes across the country look.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all took the same path as Aly and Madison to make the Olympic team.
They are the "last five" because the next Olympic team will have only four gymnasts on the team, and this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as coach.
But the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport, and gymnasts are primarily in private gymnastics clubs maintained by parents who pay for the training, furnishings, travel, clothing, competition, and hotel costs (for the coaches and their gymnasts and families), and the list goes on and on.
The majority of these gymnastics clubs are in affluent suburbs that can support the business.
At these clubs, the gymnasts receive all their training and that is an expensive and long-term commitment for the families.
Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, have both coached their athletes since they started gymnastics.
We need to make gymnastics more affordable and accessible to the communities of countless young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I started my gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
At my events, we provided free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youth (mostly black and Hispanic) and coached national and international champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer high quality gymnastics to the youth who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.
This combination offers lifelong health benefits as well as academic and professional success.
It's the inspiration of this team that gets thousands of young girls interested in gymnastics and that's great.
It is so important to participate in sport, especially for girls.
This is such an exciting time.
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real representation of "girl power" by winning Olympic team gold and thank you for motivating so many young girls from different backgrounds to start their journey to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
Junior doctors to stage further strikes after rejecting Jeremy Hunt's proposal
Ministers had hoped to end the row over the changes by agreeing a reformed contract with British Medical Association officials, but 58 per cent of the 37,000 junior doctors who voted in the election rejected it.
In July, Hunt unveiled plans to force the contract, saying the NHS was in a "no man's land" and any further delay would be damaging to staff and patients.
The first junior doctors are to be given a new contract that includes changes to night and weekend work to improve care at inhospitable times.
Dr Ellen McCourt, chair of the BMA's junior doctors committee, said in a statement last night: "Junior doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, particularly that it will fuel the current workforce crisis and fail to treat all doctors fairly."
With only eight weeks remaining before the first group of doctors are covered by the new contract, progress must be made and time is running out.
Efforts by the BMA to resolve the disputes through talks have met with reluctance from the government to get involved, and sometimes deafening silence.
This followed a promise made by Jeremy Hunt just last month that his door would always be open.
"Jeremy Hunt must act now, lift the imposition and address the concerns of junior doctors," he said.
If he fails to do so, junior doctors have made it clear they are prepared to take further industrial action.
The last strike at the end of April saw almost 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments postponed as nurses and specialists were called in to provide cover for doctors on the picket line.
Ministers had hoped to end the row over the changes by agreeing the reformed contract with officials from the British Medical Association.
The BMA wants better pay for the 54,000 junior doctors who will be covered by the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, director general of NHS Employees, called on junior doctors to end the strike.
Mr Mortimer said: "Industrial action achieves nothing of the sort, but it puts strain on already overstretched teams and service providers and only causes concern, distress and disruption for patients, carers and their families."
Over the last two months, we have spoken to the Assistant Doctors Committee and have responded positively to concerns about guardianship and whistleblowing with the Ministry of Health and other ministries.
Employers hoped that the continued positive engagement on other key issues - such as posting, flexibility in training, additional training for those returning from professional leave, training boxes, mutual recognition of the curriculum, training leave and the gender pay gap in medicine - was a sign of how serious employers, Health Education England and the Department of Health were about meeting agreements with the BMA in November, February and May.
The £2-a-day drug that can lower heart attack risk
Thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £2-a-day drug after the authorities recommended giving it to more people for an extended period.
Ticagrelor, an anticoagulant, reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease.
The drug is already given for 12 months after a heart attack, which reduces the risk of a stroke or another heart attack.
The NHS regulator NICE has recommended taking it for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
The NHS regulator NICE has recommended taking it for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Around 140,000 people suffer a heart attack each year and a quarter of them suffer another heart attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulations of fatty material in the artery walls that form plaques.
If the plaque breaks apart, it can cause a blood clot that blocks blood flow to the heart, causing a heart attack.
When the clot dissolves, it can flow through the bloodstream and block blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already had a heart attack are at a higher risk of having another.
Ticagrelor, manufactured by the British company AstraZeneca and marketed under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots less likely.
The draft guidance from NICE, published today, recommends a 12-month intake of 90mg of Ticagrelor, followed by 60mg twice-daily aspirin for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Evaluation Centre, said: 'Despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of people who have suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with disastrous consequences.'
Fear of another heart attack can have a significant negative impact on a person's quality of life.
Experience shows that icagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
With a preliminary recommendation from Ticagrelor, we are pleased to be able to expand treatment options available to thousands of people who can benefit from it.
Information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor - in particular the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years, and the draft guidance does not recommend any treatment beyond that period.
Culture of political correctness allows electoral fraud to flourish in Muslim areas
Former Tower Hamlets mayor Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year on corruption charges following a government report
A culture of political correctness has led to widespread voter fraud in Muslim communities being deliberately ignored, a damning government report revealed today.
Former Cabinet minister Sir Eric Pickles has launched a verbal attack on the police, election watchdogs and town halls for ignoring evidence of vote-rigging because of "over-sensitivities about ethnicity and religion."
The former minister for integration and local government, who is now a corruption king, said that intimidation of voters on religious grounds was so bad that police should be allowed to set up barriers outside polling booths to protect intimidated voters.
He recommends that voters carry identification cards to prove their identity in elections.
At present, a voter only needs to provide his or her name and address.
The report proposes that non-removable ink should be applied to a person's finger when they cast their vote, in order to prevent them from voting twice.
Whistleblowers should be given more protection, says Sir Eric.
He calls for the press to have more access to municipal documents and decisions made by unofficial committees or working groups.
"This is not only to protect against electoral fraud, but also to protect the local government from the broader culture of corruption and financial fraud that goes with it," he said.
The report was ordered by Downing Street in the wake of the Tower Hamlets electoral scandal in east London.
Last year, a special election court ruled that the incumbent mayor, Lutfur Rahman, should be removed from office after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices.
The court found that Rahman had "cynically perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community" and that he had silenced his critics with accusations of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman is said to have "campaigned on the basis that it was the religious duty of Muslims to vote for him."
Up to 300 votes were either doubtful or the result of an imitation in which one person votes as someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud across the country.
He made particularly alarming remarks about fraudulent postal ballots - in which older members of the Muslim community put pressure on people to vote for a candidate of their choice.
Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean up the electoral system, including using ID cards to prove identity
His report said: "As evidence, pressure has been put on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, particularly women and young people, to vote according to the will of their elders, particularly communities of Pakistani or Bangladeshi origin.
"There were concerns that... state institutions had knowingly ignored such behavior because of" politically correct "sensitivities about ethnicity and religion."
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including banning political activists from processing postal ballot papers to stop "election harvesting."
The report, which is being considered by Theresa May, also calls for tougher registration checks to prevent the electoral register being used for immigration and welfare fraud.
Consider options to ask voters for their ID before the election.
Use non-removable ink on a person's finger as soon as they cast their vote to prevent them from voting twice.
Conduct systematic checks on a person's nationality to ensure that they are eligible to vote.
A three-year limit on requests for an automatic postal vote.
Ban political activists from processing complete postal ballots and envelopes of postal ballots.
Give police the power to set up barriers around polling stations.
An amendment to the law facilitating an intimidation charge under the Representation of the People Act 1983.
Ban photography at polling stations.
Requirement that only English be used in polling stations (with the exception of Wales).
Intensify training to ensure staff enforce the rule that voters go to the polling booth alone.
Sir Eric slams the Metropolitan Police, saying it is' astonishing 'that no criminal charges have been brought in the wake of the Tower Hamlets case.
"The electoral court has declared Lutfur Rahman and his deputy unfit because of a litany of corrupt and illegal practices," he said.
He was found guilty on a number of grounds - in accordance with the high standards of criminal procedure.
He also criticises the ineffective "tick-box" checks on town halls "election registration departments.
Sir Eric said: 'Last year's court ruling in Tower Hamlets was a warning sign.
Our country has a proud heritage as the mother of parliaments, but the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and denial by some authorities threaten that reputation.
Crazy about Kate's cycling doppelganger and other famous Rio Olympic lookalikes
Fans of the 2016 Rio Olympics got into a frenzy this week over French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who has proved to be an impressive doppelganger for the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympian is far from the only athlete competing for gold this summer to feature his own famous doppelganger - at least not if social media is to be believed.
In honour of the Rio Olympics and all the famous faces currently flashing on our screens, FEMAIL has compiled a list of Olympians who bear more than a passing resemblance to Hollywood celebrities.
The hunter and the wolf: Team member of the US archery team Brady Ellison, left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since childhood
Aside from Kate's doppelganger on the racecourse, many people on the internet pointed out how a certain archer could be the twin of A-celebrity Leonardo DiCaprio.
US archery team member Brady Ellison has caused a Twitter storm after pictures emerged of him looking eerily similar to the Wolf of Wall Street star.
In fact, the archer noticed the craze on social media and admitted that since he was a child, he's been told he looks like Leo.
"I personally don't see much resemblance, other than facial hair," Brady told the Huffington Post.
'He's a handsome guy, so I take that as a compliment. '
One of the most popular comparisons since London 2012 will no doubt come to the fore this year: the striking resemblance between British long jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
The Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina with her big, expressive eyes is said to be able to pass as a doppelganger for the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to Glee star Matthew Morrison for years.
Up a gear: This user believes Nathan is the 'athletic version' of the Inception actor
Another enduring comparison has been drawn between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who has similarly heavy eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver medal swimmer Yulia Efimova has more than just suntanned skin and blonde hair like actress Annalynne McCord, while American Nathan Adrian has been described by fans as an "athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt."
Strong women: Football star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, right, have similar facial shapes and eyes
Not the only one: One Twitter user was delighted that others noticed the similarities
Theory put forward: According to this user, there may be a reason for the pair's resemblance
One Twitter user declared her satisfaction that 'the rest of the internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are almost identical.'
In fact, US football star Hope Solo and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter have incredibly similar facial shapes and eyes.
Other popular comparisons included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to that of actress Laura Linney, and gymnastics gold medalist Gabby Douglas, who has her own beautiful broad smile similar to that of Bring It On star Gabrielle Union.
CBC Olympic commentator apologizes for saying Chinese swimmer "died like a pig"
Byron MacDonald's analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's fourth-place finish in the 4x200m freestyle swimming relay outraged viewers of Wednesday's CBC live broadcast of the Olympic Games.
Canadian broadcaster CBC was forced to apologise after one of its commentators said the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer was "acting like a pig" and "died like a pig" during the race.
Commentator Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was switched off when he made his own comments at the end of the 4x200m freestyle relay.
MacDonald, who had been brought on board the CBS commentary team to add more "colour," could be heard saying: "This little 14-year-old Chinese girl has lost touch, baby."
Too excited, went off like a pig, died like a pig.
Thank you for that.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second leg of the relay in 1: 57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada's Taylor Ruck, allowing the Canadians to close the gap on China.
Viewers across Canada reacted quickly online after being shocked by the tone and language
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted, "Did the CBC commentator just say that the 14-year-old swimmer from China" died like a pig "????
The idiot didn't realise they were still on air. '
Ai Yanhan of China was described in the final women's 4 x 200m freestyle swimming relay as: 'This little 14-year-old Chinese girl has lost touch, baby.'
Criticism of Byron MacDonald on Twitter was swift and harsh, with many taking him to task
Twitter users didn't hold back when they heard how insensitive Byron MacDonald was
Another Twitter user Sarah Paradis wrote: 'Wow, # ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and make us all look like racists. # disgusted.
A short time later, Scott Russell, who hosted the CBC show, apologized live for MacDonald's comment, saying, "We apologize that the comment was broadcast over a swimming performance."
It was an unfortunate choice of words, we're sorry it happened. '
CBC eventually apologized over 90 times to people who responded to the remark via Twitter
Fellow commentator Scott Russell was forced to apologise on behalf of MacDonald
CBC copied and pasted his apology to more than 90 other Twitter users who had complained about MacDonald's comments
The network also quickly apologized and issued a statement.
We sincerely regret that these statements were made and that it was possible for them to be broadcast.
We were quick last night to apologise to our viewers on air and to our followers on social media.
To be clear, Byron's comments were about the swimmer's performance, not her as a person.
Nevertheless, they were inappropriate and an unfortunate choice of words. Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized on the show and tried to justify his remark by saying it was not his intention for it to be construed as a personal attack.
"I would like to take a moment to apologize for the comment I made after the women's swimming relay on the CBC Olympic broadcast," he said.
'I was referring to the swimmer's performance, not her as a person. '
Of course no disrespect was intended and I'm very sorry. '
Shoppers in Primark outraged by woman shamelessly trying on underwear in the middle of shop
Shoppers didn't know where to look when a woman took off her clothes in the middle of a Primark to try on underwear.
To make matters worse, she looked at what she looked like in it, took it off and put it back on the shelf.
She continued to browse and try on four pairs of underwear at a shop in Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone.
The Primark store in Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone where the woman tried on the underwear before putting it back on the shelf
Mother-of-two Jenny Davidson, who was in the store at the time, said that after the mystery woman tried on the underwear, 'she got dressed again and left the store without buying anything.'
She said: 'People couldn't believe what they were seeing.'
Standing in the middle of the sales floor, she took a pair of underwear from the display, took off her own tights and pants and tried them on.
wasn't even trying to find a more discreet place to do it - she was just standing there, cheeky like Oscar. '
'Everyone was staring as she took off her underwear, which she obviously didn't like because she put it back on the shelf. '
She repeated the same thing with three more knickers before finally deciding she didn't like anything, getting dressed again and walking out.
didn't seem bothered that anyone was watching her - or thinking about the person who might buy the underwear she'd tried on. '
Ms Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said: 'How disgusting to think someone would take home underwear that was on another person and not washed.'
The incident happened on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms Davidson added: 'I understand staff tried to pull the clothes from sale after she left - which is just as well.'
'I'd hate to go home with a new pair of underpants and find out another woman had them on and undressed and they weren't washed. '
A Primark spokesman said: 'Primark is aware of the incident which occurred at our Folkstone store on Tuesday 9 August.'
All eligible products have been withdrawn from sale.
How to protect yourself from gun attacks with Krav Maga
The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a little safer for you.
We spoke to Rhon Mizrachi, a Grand Master of the Krav Maga Association in New York, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close range.
Regardless of whether you are approached from the front or the back, this video will show you how to turn the tables on your robber.
If you are approached from behind, the first thing you should do is turn around so that you can see your attacker and "get out of the line of fire," Mizrachi says.
Then grab the weapon between your forearm and your shoulder before punching it in the face with your free elbow.
Then strike him in the groin with your knee and twist the weapon out of his hands as the attacker writhes in pain. Hit him in the face with the barrel and move backwards while pointing the weapon at him.
For attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the line of fire, grab the weapon and twist it so the attacker cannot shoot.
At the same time, shift the weight onto the weapon and strike the attacker on the chest, then twist the weapon out of his grip before moving backwards and pointing the weapon at him.
Sounds difficult?
Watch the video to see exactly how Mizrachi does it.
But remember that in the event of a robbery, it is safest to hand over your money - unless you are a Krav Maga Grandmaster.
Traveller Ian Wright scrapes his tongue in Europe's dirtiest places for a guide
A British traveller put his immune system and gag reflex to serious scrutiny - licking some of Europe's dirtiest and most disgusting places.
Presenter and travel writer Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk, scraped his teeth on a euro bill, railings at Piccadilly Circus, a flush button on a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system.
Before licking each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he was going to get involved in.
But the experiment, dubbed "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," yielded some surprising results.
The thought of licking the flush button of a train toilet, which has already been used by thousands of others, may be utterly repulsive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.
During his tour of Europe, Mr Wright spoke to doctors and health professionals about promoting gut bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, nothing he licked left more than a bad taste in his mouth.
Mr Wright became known for testing the resilience of his gut by travelling the world and eating weird and wonderful things.
From public railings at train stations to flushing toilets, the task definitely tested his immune system
In the film, he said: 'Even as a child I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things into my mouth, soil, worms and mud water.'
In the film he certainly lived up to his reputation.
The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.
His sample swab showed a luminometer count of over 4000 units.
In comparison, the luminometer number of freshly washed hands is less than 60.
But there was one Russian toilet he refused to lick after its luminometer reading exceeded 4,000 units, while freshly washed hands had one of fewer than 60
Mr Wright and Finnish dairy producer Valio produced the travel film The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, which shows the number of bacteria in different places such as the bathroom
In the film, he says: 'It comes close to the worst I've smelled in a toilet.'
There is nothing dirtier than that!
I'm not going to lick anything here because it's disgusting in here.
"The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with Finnish dairy manufacturer Valio.
The company is equipping Mr Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamins C and D to help promote gut bacteria and the immune system.
Valio's senior vice president for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa said: "We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that is fascinating to watch and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics.
We did crazy brainstorming sessions that ended with us saying, "Let's call Ian."
They claim interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon
Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a broader context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system.
The growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we have been able to provide consumers with more information about it in an interesting way.
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added: 'Let me put it this way - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had licked some of the things I told him to lick, like the disgusting Russian toilet shown in the film.'
Of course, there were things where it was easier to get Ian to lick them and others where it was quite difficult.
I'm glad we got some of those dirty treats on film. '
In a 2015 survey conducted by Valio, 84 percent of all respondents associated lactic acid bacteria in particular with gastrointestinal well-being, and 58 percent said they use products containing added lactic acid bacteria at least occasionally.
Anti-social family demolish council flat in Saltash, Cornwall
An anti-social family left their council flat after being fined £50,000 for terrorising their neighbours.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were kicked out of their property in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long list of complaints.
After they were forcibly removed from their property, shocked employees of the housing association found the property in an irreparable condition.
The walls had gaping holes, wooden floorboards were torn open, garbage was strewn on the floor and graffiti was smeared on the walls.
The family have been relocated and are now believed to be living in private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, who works for property management at Cornwall Housing, said she feared the flat would not be repaired.
She said: 'It's been an absolute nightmare for people here and I don't think people need to live that way.
There are many things to consider as this property is likely to be seen as a not-so-nice part of Cornwall.
The family is notorious and so is their reputation.
The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment and police said the terror inflicted on the family included street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of residents, substance abuse, drug dealing and excessive screaming, arguing and swearing.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, was given an anti-social behaviour order in June.
Old rubbish was found in some rooms of the house, which may be demolished
Wooden floorboards have been ripped up at the property where drugs were traded in the past
Neighbors testified that they saw her fight in the street and regularly called the police
Cornwall Housing forcibly evicted her and her partner from the property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to move out voluntarily.
The resignations were cheered by relieved neighbours who said their lives had been turned into hell.
One testified: 'They didn't care about anybody.'
We lived next door to them for 20 years and it was always bad.
The innumerable times we tell the police here are unbelievable.
'We couldn't sleep this morning. '
We got up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to that!
Now that they are finally gone, it will be nice.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager at Cornwall Housing, said the family had failed to co-operate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house, which the police were called to at regular intervals, for 20 years
Rubbish and old toys were thrown down the overgrown side of the community centre
He added: "It is a disgrace that the tenant failed to take any responsibility for their behaviour and that of their family, as delogation is always the last step Cornwall Housing will consider.
This was a very difficult case as the behaviour was extreme and her actions must have been terrible for her neighbours to witness.
I appreciate all the work done by my team, Devon and Cornwall Police and members of the community who have bravely approached us and provided us with the information.
I hope this development will bring comfort to some neighbours and send a message that anti-social behaviour will not be tolerated.
Fitzpatrick said all three sons had lived in the house at different times but that they were all in their 20s.
A dirty mattress left on the floor in one of the bedrooms of the house after being delogated
Property management workers will now have to clear piles of rubbish surrounding the house
In 2014, police raided the house and found more than 70g of cannabis as well as scales, paraphernalia and cash totalling £1,700.
Skeldon was fined after pleading guilty to possessing a Class B drug with intent to supply.
She claimed the money was for a headstone belonging to her son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car crash in 2013.
Having been homeless, Tanya and her partner are now believed to be living in private accommodation in Plymouth.
Many of the walls of the house were daubed with graffiti.
Police say they will delete tenants who do not comply with house rules
Angela Crow, of Devon and Cornwall Police, said the delay was a clear warning to other tenants who do not comply with house rules.
"This goes out to those who think they can behave without self-blame, as well as those who have been harmed by such behaviour," she said.
Devon and Cornwall Police will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behaviour and will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal panic after low-flying military jet flies over beach
Sunbathers in Aveiro, Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
A Portuguese Air Force P-3C Orion plane made an incredible dive
The Air Force said it was on a training flight but insisted there was no safety risk
This is the moment terrified tourists start panicking after a low-flying jet crashes over a crowded beach.
Dramatic video footage showed the military plane flying almost within touching distance of sunbathers on the beach in Aveiro in northern Portugal.
The holidaymakers jumped up when they understandably began to worry about the noise from the jet engines, without first seeing what was coming through the clouds.
The incident took place yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the many holidaymakers posting videos of the dramatic fly-by on social media, said: 'It flew really low twice and there was a moment when it looked like it was going to crash.'
Nuno Arroja added: 'I was surfing and it felt like the plane was coming down on me.'
Tourists on Aveiro beach were panicked when the plane came out of the darkness and flew incredibly low
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and had to fly so low that it was the only way to spot them.
The spokesman said the jet flew slightly lower than usual due to poor visibility caused by nearby wildfires, but the air force insisted safety was not at risk at any time.
Wildfires have ravaged parts of mainland Portugal this summer, killing four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot was forced to fly so low due to the conditions - heavy fog and fire smoke - which restricted his visibility
The plane was on a training flight when the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise
Supercup: Barca with worries against Sevilla
Sevilla - FC Barcelona will fight on Sunday for the first step towards the first title win of the new football season.
The Catalans take on Sevilla in a duel for the Spanish Super Cup away, with the return leg at the Nou Camp three days later.
The double winner will have to do without Neymar, who is competing in the Olympic football tournament with Brazil, in a showdown with the defeated Cup finalist and reigning Europa League champion.
Goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen is also missing.
The German suffered a knee ligament sprain in training, clearing the way for Barca at least for now in favour of Claudio Bravo.
The Chile international and Ter Stegen have been vying for Barcelona's number one status for two years.
Coach Luis Enrique has so far avoided a clear decision on the matter, leaving Bravo out in the league but leaving Ter Stegen out in most of the rest of the competition.
Ahead of the first competitive match of the new season, the Spanish champions have cast doubt on the fitness of the squad, who were humiliated 4-0 by Liverpool in a friendly on Saturday.
Even in the 3-2 win over Sampdoria on Wednesday, Lionel Messi and Co were not really convincing.
Sevilla, meanwhile, have to digest the 2-3 defeat after extra-time in the European Super Cup against Real Madrid and are aiming for their second triumph in the "Supercopa de Espana."
Barcelona are the record winners in the competition with eleven wins so far.
Ma Long in a league of her own to win table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new Olympic table tennis champion.
The 27-year-old defeated his compatriot and "defending champion" Zhang Jike 4: 0 (12,5,4,4) in a one-sided final in Rio de Janeiro on Thursday.
The world number one thus clinched the "Golden Grand Slam" with successes at the World Championships, the World Cup, the World Tour Finals and the Olympics.
Japan's Jun Mizutani took bronze.
As expected, the two Chinese made it to the final and won the title among themselves.
Thus it was clear that for the third time in a row a Chinese would win the singles title under the banner of the Five Rings.
The last non-Chinese on the top Olympic podium was former SVS-Lower Austrian Legionnaire Ryu Seung-min from South Korea.
Ma and Zhang were left to their own devices at the plate, with no coaches between sets or during time-outs.
They had retired to the stands and left their charges alone in the fair competition against each other.
'I've played the matches up to this point for my country. '
"I'm playing for myself in the final," Zhang had said.
After the match, gold and silver medallists posed with the China flag.
The match itself was unexpectedly one-sided.
Ma only really struggled with his 28-year-old opponent in the first set.
He then set the tempo at the plate, leaving Zhang with just 13 points.
Ma's superiority did not produce the expected rousing match.
But there were plenty of breathtaking rallies nonetheless.
Mizutani won the bronze game against 40-year-old Vladimir Samsonov 4: 1.
The Belarusian suffered a rib injury in his quarter-final against German European champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov, and was subsequently undergoing medical treatment, but "in the end" had to make do with sheet metal.
By the way, the Swedes Jan-Ove Waldner (38 / 2004) and Jörgen Persson (42 / 2008) came fourth in the Olympics at a similarly high table tennis age.
Donald Trump admits' huge problems' on the campaign trail
US Republican leaders are plagued by massive concerns about losing their majority in traditionally conservative states.
Presidential candidate Donald Trump has now admitted weaknesses in his campaign in the Republican stronghold of Utah.
It was a rare moment when the normally cocky and confident multi-millionaire expressed something of a concern, correspondents said.
After knocking out 16 rivals within his own Republican camp, doubts are now growing about his success in the fight for the White House.
"We have tremendous problems in Utah," Trump told evangelical Christians, whom he asked for support in key states like Ohio, Florida and Virginia.
False reports about his candidacy were to blame, he resumed his well-known media scolding.
Republican strongholds are wobbling
Utah is usually a safe seat for Republicans.
According to a June SurveyUSA poll, Trump and his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton were tied.
Other institutes see Trump ahead, but not by the margin customary for Republican candidates in the state.
Arizona and Georgia are also considered at risk.
In an interview with CNBC, Trump, when asked how he would stop Clinton's march, replied: "Just like I've done so far."
He added afterwards: "Either this will be successful or I will have a very nice, long holiday."
He did nothing more than "tell the truth."
'If it doesn't work out for him in the end for reasons of political correctness, that's fine, 'Trump continued.
Then I return to a very good way of life.
According to press reports, the party has threatened to cut off funding to support Trump's campaign if he fails to show better poll numbers.
Instead, he said, they want to give more support to Republican congressional candidates.
Olympics: Brazen cheat fails doping test
The IOC wants to set up a disciplinary commission on the case.
Kenya's track and field athletes are facing hardship after the second doping scandal at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics.
Kenya has sent a coach home after an attempted doping test at the Olympic village.
The International Olympic Committee said it would immediately set up a disciplinary commission to investigate the case.
A Kenyan official said the former sprinter and current coach, John Anzrah, had given a urine sample in the Olympic Village under the name of 800-meter runner Ferguson Rotich.
This was reported to Kenya's team management by the doping controllers.
The world governing body, the IAAF, has asked the IOC for information on the case to launch its own investigation, an IAAF spokesman said.
"Depending on the results of the investigation and subsequent action by the IOC, the IAAF will make an assessment," an IAAF statement said.
"He (Anzrah) went to the doping control station and pretended to be Ferguson Rotich, gave the sample and signed it," Kenya's head of mission Stephan Arap Soi said.
He was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete who was on the World Anti-Doping Agency's training control list.
Ferguson Rotich had finished fourth in the 800m at the 2015 World Championships in Beijing.
Four days earlier, Kenya's athletics delegation chief Michael Rotich had been withdrawn from the Rio Games.
He is alleged to have told athletes in his country about pending doping tests in exchange for money.
According to media reports, he was arrested at Nairobi airport on his return.
Kenya has been under special scrutiny by the IOC for some time now after numerous doping violations.
Announcing the IOC's more than 2,000 doping target checks ahead of the Rio Games, it was unusual for athletes from Kenya and Russia to be targeted in particular.
Before the Summer Games in Brazil, the World Anti-Doping Agency had put a lot of pressure on the African country to put in place an anti-doping law and a functioning control system.
The law was passed a few weeks before the start of the Olympics.
As a result, WADA removed Kenya from the list of countries whose anti-doping measures comply with WADA rules.
Kenya is considered a great runner nation.
The country's track and field athletes won the most medals at the 2015 World Championships in Beijing.
In a series of television reports by the ARD, accusations were repeatedly made that doping agents are easily accessible in Kenya and that there is a significant mentality of sports fraud.
IOC member Richard Pound recently called for a similar investigation in Kenya as he did into Russian track and field.
It could be proved that widespread and systematic doping took place in this sport.
Russia's track and field athletes were subsequently banned from the Summer Games.
Salzburg's "West Side Story" with Cecilia Bartoli
In the Shakespeare year, the Salzburg Festival presents "West Side Story" with Tony and Maria as tragic lovers, similar to Romeo and Juliet.
Including a surprising Cecilia Bartoli.
A musical conquers Salzburg: "West Side Story," Leornard Bernstein's masterpiece.
Artistic director Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical to the temple of classical music and fulfilled a childhood dream with the role of Maria.
In the orchestra pit, the Simón Bolívar Orchestra conducted by the Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel: "This music is full of rhythm," he enthuses.
We always say that it is very Latin American.
There are many Latin American ingredients in their tempo and melody.
It is a wonderful mixture, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.
I would say that we really have Bernstein's music in our blood!
In this production Bartoli plays an older Maria.
She recalls wistfully her love affair with Tony, while the younger Maria plays and dances.
The role of Mary has always fascinated me.
Firstly, because she is musically extraordinary!
And then there's Mary's personality.
As she puts it in her song: "I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and witty and bright."
So she is clever, naïve of course, and very passionate.
"She's very similar to me, my Italian character, which I have as a Roman," Bartoli laughs.
Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."
It is such an honour for us to work with her.
She is a tremendously generous person.
And Bartoli returned the compliment: "Dudamel is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate!"
Conducting is a necessity for him.
You can see it in each of his movements, in his looks, it is his life!
It's such a huge opportunity to be able to share this musical experience with him.
We both have a rather southern temperament, a fire, a passion and also a cheerful approach to life, which is very important!
For the American director Philip W. McKinley, "West Side Story" is highly topical: "This play is about prejudice and fanaticism."
Today we have the refugees, at that time the Puerto Ricans went to New York, and the inhabitants of New York did not want them.
They are the same issues, and they are as meaningful today as they were then.
Fifty-nine years later, the piece is still relevant.
London schoolgirl who joined ISIS was killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIS, has reportedly died in Syria.
Lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said her family learned of her death in Raqqa, Syria, a few weeks ago.
She was believed to have been killed by a Russian airstrike in Raqqa, the group's stronghold in the country, ITV News reported on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 and, according to her family, died shortly after she planned to leave the war-torn country and return to England.
"One can only hope that the only good thing is - as a reminder and warning to others that these are the risks involved in going to a war zone - to prevent people from ever making that decision," Akunjee said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other schoolgirls from east London boarded a plane bound for Turkey and then a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultana's family have been told she married an ISIS fighter in Syria - and became a widow within months.
Reid says Clinton will stick with Garland as Supreme Court nominee if she wins
Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid believes Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton will nominate Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court.
Senate Republicans have blocked Garland's confirmation since he was nominated by Barack Obama in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says the next president will nominate the successor to the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.
Reid said Thursday during a conference call that he expects Clinton to pick Garland "with some degree of certainty."
A spokeswoman for Reid later said that he had not yet spoken to Clinton about whether she would nominate Garland and that he was speculating.
He praised Garland and said Clinton's team would not be troubled by a new candidate.
Garland is the chief justice for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
Raid said Republicans blocking Garland's nomination were lackeys and accomplices of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He also noted that Donald Trump is unfit to be president.
Treats wants nude calendar for "women and men"
Treats magazine has teamed up with photographer David Bellemere to release a 1970s Pirelli-inspired calendar for 2017.
But instead of famous naked people, they want to find the next generation of top models for their 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Treats editor-in-chief Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his nude magazine was different from old-school Playboys because "Playboy is for men."
I do it for women.
Apparently, he thinks the calendar does.
"We need to return to the representation of timeless and classic nudity, where both women and men feel comfortable and inspired by these images of a female body," Shaw said in a press release announcing the calendar's release.
Women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art.
Models can submit their images online or in person to open casting calls in Los Angeles and New York.
Turkey: Kurdish community expects mass exodus
"Those who do not conform and praise Erdogan are sitting on packed suitcases," said Ercan Karakoyun, chairman of the Gülen-affiliated Dialogue and World Foundation.
In the short term, the Kurdish community in Germany expects tens of thousands of refugees to flee from Turkey to Germany.
In the medium term, it could even be "a few hundred thousand," according to Ali Toprak, president of the association.
Due to the crackdown of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the attempted coup, the Kurdish community in Germany expects a mass exodus to Germany.
"In the short term I expect tens of thousands, in the medium term a few hundred thousand refugees from Turkey in Germany, if the Erdogan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition," the association chairman Ali Toprak told the "Welt" on Friday.
Because the government had already imposed punitive measures on Kurdish strongholds months ago, 500,000 Kurds were fleeing within Turkey.
The foiled coup would be followed by secular and opposition ethnic Turks.
Many will want to start afresh in Europe if they continue to be oppressed in Turkey.
"It cannot be the case that a state that takes in refugees itself produces refugees in its own country," Toprak said.
The head of the association lamented the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish, but also in Alevi cities.
Erdogan wants to increase the pressure on the remaining Kurds to leave.
"They are the last large minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have already been exterminated or driven out in the last hundred years," said Toprak, who is also a member of the CDU.
The head of the association demanded that the German government "position itself as sharply as Austria against Erdogan and his supporters."
A "witch hunt" against Erdogan critics is also taking place in Germany.
For the first time in the last few months, I no longer feel safe in Germany.
The German branch of the Gülen movement also fears that many Turks will flee abroad.
More Turks will seek asylum in Germany, especially Kurds and members of the opposition.
Branding them Gülen supporters is destroying teachers and other academics "livelihoods.
"Those who do not conform and praise Erdogan are sitting on packed suitcases, including Kemalists and secularists," Ercan Karakoyun, chairman of the Gülen-affiliated Dialogue and Education Foundation, told Die Welt.
As the newspaper reports, citing figures from the Federal Ministry of the Interior, even before the coup, Turks were the largest group of asylum-seekers in Germany recognised for political persecution.
At the cut-off date of June 30, this had been 11,386 people, i.e. just under 29 percent of all those recognised as entitled to asylum (39,625).
This survey does not include those who have fled war, poverty or lack of prospects.
Asylum-seekers under the Basic Law are exclusively politically persecuted, i.e. individually persecuted by the state.
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: "Going where it hurts"
Strange Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania: The locals get nothing from the summer election campaign - and holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to vote in the state parliament.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood.
2021 the state election will not take place again directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Schwerin parliament decided already at the beginning of the year.
Because it doesn't get any stupider than it used to be: summer holidays, heat and state election campaigns - that bites.
The locals, who are to be persuaded by the campaigners, are on holiday.
The vast majority of holidaymakers who are in the country, on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee on the way, are not locals, so may not vote for the state parliament.
In addition, there are practical problems: during the holidays, helpers who hang up posters, inflate balloons, distribute flyers and count votes are hard to find.
Until 4 September 2016, the election day and the last holiday day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has to endure another election campaign just past the people.
The hot phase, if that can be said at all, has just begun.
And it is also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of an SPD / CDU coalition, must fear for his office.
The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now well behind the CDU in opinion polls.
It will be interesting to see how strong the newcomer AfD performs and what is left of the coalition at the end.
Sellering, 66 years old and head of government since 2008, is running an almost inconspicuous election campaign, aside from his billboards.
He travels around the country, distributes roses and chats a little with people, just like his legendary taciturn predecessor Harald Ringstorff did.
Otherwise, Seelering has got cold feet and blames Chancellor Merkel for the AfD's blossoming.
Her refugee policy, her "We can do this," has accelerated the rise of right-wing populists, which is now likely to cost him his fine office.
The CDU, with its top candidate, the Minister of the Interior Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced what it is like to campaign in the wrong place at the wrong time.
She has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to major rallies; Merkel's parliamentary constituency is in the northeast.
But the target group was not right, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony than Mecklenburg and Western Pomerania.
"There was probably the majority from other federal states," Vincent Kokert, Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, recently complained to NDR.
But it doesn't hurt anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel.
Otherwise, the Northeast CDU largely dispenses with the usual campaign stalls in market places and in front of shopping centers with umbrellas and balloons.
This, Kokert says, only plays a "minor role."
The Union, too, has noticed that its base in the countryside is crumbling, that it has to make a great effort to reconnect with the people.
It is like the left, the SPD, the Greens: hardly present in the vastness of the country.
The advice of the CDU campaigner Kokert to his comrades-in-arms, however, is also self-revealing: "They have to go where it hurts, namely where the people are: village festivals, golden weddings, every birthday party has to be used."
Because much is at stake, Sellering has now called his SPD to a particularly committed election campaign.
In polls, the Social Democrats were last on 22 percent, behind the CDU (25) and just ahead of the AfD (19).
In the 2011 election, the SPD had clearly won with 35.6 percent ahead of the CDU (22).
The Greens, a small party with seven percent in the polls, are expected to make the leap into the state parliament.
They are making a modern virtue out of holiday misery, and are largely posting their election campaigns online.
"Online election campaign," is what the chairwoman of the state Claudia Müller calls it.
Otherwise, Green campaigners will be looking for local voters among the holidaymakers.
Silke Gajek, the leading candidate, is currently riding a houseboat through the Mecklenburg lakes and still finds it beautiful.
Her impression: "Voting leave in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is not a punishment."
B27 redevelopment: Restaurants suffer from closure
There is nothing to complain about the speed with which the B 27 is being renovated.
Praise is lavished on those responsible for the works, which start at 5.30 in the morning and do not finish until around 8pm.
"They made everything pretty jagged," says Elvira Tetzlaff from the jet gas station.
This is a super team.
There is also no delay.
At the beginning of the week, the construction site could be moved to the south as planned, and everything should be ready by the end of October.
The courtesy of those responsible for the construction works, for example when it comes to setting up makeshift driveways, is also praised.
Since the construction site moved southwards on Monday and the closure of Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen was lifted and the connection to Rottenburg resumed, the traffic situation within the town has eased.
Citizens can now drive on both sides of the B 27 from Ofterdingen.
The evasive traffic through the town seems to be decreasing.
"There were some significant complaints," says Florian King, the deputy head of the department responsible for traffic management of the refurbishment.
The residents of Bachsatzstrasse, Steinlachstrasse, Hafnerstrasse and Weiherrain had to deal with more traffic noise because many were looking for surreptitious paths and trusting their satnav rather than the signs.
As a result, some trucks got frayed in residential areas.
Since the speed limits were also not observed, the municipality requested the measuring vehicle from Mössingen.
"There have been significant transgressions," said King, who briefed himself on the situation on the ground.
Since two to three have been flashed per minute.
The fastest driver was travelling at 77 km / h in the 30-km / h zone.
But since the construction site moved on, things have quietened down.
For the businessmen on the B 27, it is only a small consolation that the road is now open again for customers from Rottenburg.
Businessmen don't like to look at the cards.
But everyone you ask can see that the B 27 renovation has led to a drop in turnover for them.
However, some are more affected and some less so.
For those who have less to do with the "end customer," i.e. those who produce for other companies, the refurbishment has hardly any consequences.
At the Maier dealership, too, Thomas Sulz speaks of a "slight decline at most," but also concedes that, of course, "there is a lack of running customers."
The places along the street are the hardest hit.
J. Albert Göhner, owner of the steakhouse, formerly Krone, is clear.
That is already existential.
Not just him, he said, but all restaurants had been "hit hard."
The customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil were missing.
We have to be happy about every euro of turnover.
He puts the drop in sales at "well over 50 percent."
Road redevelopment had "set his business back two years," he said.
He had to lay off half of his employees.
If I had a company with 4000 employees and half of them had been made redundant, the policy would have reacted differently.
Instead, the President of the Federal Government, Jörg Schmidt, replied to a question from Göhner as to whether there could be financial compensation by pointing out that the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the location on the B 27. Now, it would also have to bear the disadvantages arising from the refurbishment.
Göhner knows of other counties where something like this has been handled more generously.
For all his complaints, Göhner is certain that his restaurant will continue to exist.
After all, the family business has been based here since 1715, he points to its long history.
He can understand why other regulars stop by less frequently now because of the complicated traffic management.
If you can't drive here, it's nice somewhere else.
Göhner has no doubt that his regular clientele will return after the renovation work has been completed.
Despite the BSE and avian influenza crises, Göhner considers the impact of the B 27 works on his clientele to be the biggest crisis his restaurant has experienced in its long history.
Six months of construction, that's brutal.
Legislation is constantly being tweaked in the name of fighting terrorism.
Following the recent attacks, the Minister of the Interior de Maizière is now presenting a thick security package.
But what does a status of tolerance have to do with terror?
And what does the coalition partner have to say about all this?
Thomas de Maizière gives the Reconciliator.
At the presentation of his new security package, the Federal Minister of the Interior said that all of his proposals were "politically acceptable" to his coalition partner.
They don't ask too much of anyone.
Other, more far-reaching issues would first be discussed within the parties.
I am also involved in this.
But as home secretary, he said he wanted results and a "achievable consensus" within the coalition.
After the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, De Maizière took some time before presenting his conclusions on security in the Republic.
However, these are now all the more extensive.
Some things are already known, announced and aimed at: the fact that a new security authority is to take care of cracking encrypted communications is nothing new.
Nor does the fact that Germany has to implement several EU directives on passenger name records and gun laws.
The call for more video surveillance and staffing for security agencies comes as no surprise, either.
In part, de Maizière is launching a second attempt at proposals that have so far been impossible to make with the SPD: He wants to make advertising sympathies for terrorist groups a criminal offence and strip jihadists with dual citizenship of their German passports.
"These will be difficult points for the SPD," concedes the CDU man.
Nevertheless, he considers this to be reasonable and does not demand anything that does not stand a chance with the coalition partner anyway.
de Maizière also presents a few new ideas.
Some of them have it in them: he is planning fast-track deportation procedures and more opportunities to detain people before they are deported.
Refugees who are deliberately brought into the country should have their smartphones checked in advance and social media accounts disclosed for a security check.
When it comes to tolerating rejected asylum seekers, he wants to put some in an even worse position than before - for example, those who commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers in order to conceal their identity.
Some of this is politically and legally sensitive.
Some things also seem half-baked and leave questions unanswered.
And on some points - on the unequal treatment of the patient, for example - the question arises: what does this actually have to do with security and terror?
Yes, says de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the issues of refugees and terrorism.
But it cannot be denied that the perpetrators of the attacks in Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.
In addition, many people were concerned about security in view of the high number of refugees.
And things that deeply concerned people could not be left out, even during election campaigns.
There has been a huge focus on internal security.
First the attacks in the neighbourhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.
Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.
There is a great deal of uncertainty.
And yes, there are election campaigns to come.
The Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly positioning themselves on the subject of internal security.
Tensions have been running high between the two parties in recent days.
First a nasty dispute about the equipment of the Federal Police, then about a collection of security policy ideas from some Union interior ministers, in which the heads of departments also call for a ban on the burqa and a renunciation of dual citizenship.
Here, too, De Maizière is striving for conciliatory tones.
He said he did not think about abandoning the double pass.
We have pacified the discussion in Germany.
It does not make sense to reopen them.
And he said he had constitutional concerns about a burqa ban.
Whether his own package is constitutional in all its corners, and whether it is indeed "reasonable" for the coalition partner, remains to be seen.
There are some things in it that could cause controversy.
But the SPD is also currently trying to raise its profile on the subject of internal security.
Party leader Sigmar Gabriel is signalling a cautious willingness to talk, saying: "The SPD is ready to talk about anything that helps to further increase security."
Volkswagen is still coming through.
Despite the diesel scandal, deliveries are rising worldwide.
However, things are not going smoothly in all markets.
There is a fuss about a term in the recall.
Volkswagen starts the second half of the year with more subdued deliveries.
Despite the diesel affair, Europe's largest carmaker has continued to post a plus in the course of the year so far thanks to its many brands and some well-performing markets.
However, in July, the core VW brand weakened, especially in Western Europe, again weighing on overall sales, as reported by the Dax-listed company.
Worldwide, the VW brand sold 4,99,100 cars in July, 1.8 percent fewer vehicles than in the same month last year.
In Western Europe alone, the second most important market after China, sales were 14 percent below the same month last year.
In its home market of Germany, deliveries fell by almost a sixth.
Head of Brand Sales Jürgen Stackmann attributed the weaker figures from July primarily to two fewer sales days in Europe.
In addition, there has been a reluctance to buy in some core markets due to "changing economic conditions."
In addition to the situation surrounding the attempted coup in Turkey, the British vote to leave the EU also had a negative impact, a spokeswoman explained.
In the USA, where the exhaust fumes affair first escalated, there is also further a minus to book.
The Chinese market is a major support for VW.
All in all, the mainly affected house brand of Lower Saxony continues to be lightly affected by the diesel scandal: after the first seven months, deliveries have fallen by only 0.9 percent to 3.37 million vehicles.
Chief Sales Officer Fred Kappler continued to report an increase in sales from January to July.
Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles during this period, 5.904 million worldwide.
Volkswagen had used software to manipulate emissions tests.
In Germany alone, VW is calling around 2.5 million cars to the workshops for retrofitting.
In the course of the retrofitting, VW confirmed that the retrofitting of the cars has no negative effects.
After retrofitting the vehicles, there was no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine performance.
The carmaker is issuing customers with a "guarantee-equal" certificate after the conversion, but is not talking about a "guarantee," as it said in business circles on Friday.
The reason is legal niceties.
The "Focus" had reported that Volkswagen is now offering its German customers a guarantee for converted diesel models.
This was confirmed last Monday by VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport.
The Ministry of Transport confirmed that the meeting took place.
"VW must fully comply with the requirements of my commission of inquiry and the KBA."
"Deviations from this will not be accepted," Federal Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) said, according to the ministry.
VW has taken over the guarantee that there will be no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine performance after the conversion and that all vehicle values relevant for type approval will remain unchanged.
Volkswagen itself, however, does not use the term "warranty," as it was said in business circles.
With the broad term "warranty," Volkswagen sees the possibility that customers, for example, come to a workshop half a year after the conversion with an engine failure - and could trace this back to the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do with it.
It was also in the customer's interest to avoid any uncertainty as regards possible warranty arrangements in the event of any other damage that had nothing to do with the exhaust gas scandal, it was said.
That is why VW does not use the term "warranty."
Raiffeisenbank Gmund am Tegernsee will be the second bank in Germany to charge punitive interest to wealthy savers.
Bank chief Josef Paul said on Thursday: "It is only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros in current or overnight money accounts."
The Federal Association of German Banks speaks of an individual case and sees no signal in it: Normal savers "would not have to fear to pay penalty interest on their savings pence."
If banks store money overnight at the European Central Bank (ECB), they must pay a penalty interest rate of 0.4 percent.
From September, Raiffeisenbank Gmund will be charging this fee back to private and corporate customers for deposits of more than 100,000 euros in current or overnight money accounts.
"The first 100,000 euros are free."
"The next 100,000 will cost 400 euros a year," Paul said.
He has been guarding EUR 40 million for some time, which could be withdrawn from one day to the next and which he could not exploit.
"They are in my central bank account and incur a 0.4 per cent charge," he said.
'I can't put a price on every million dollars. '
He now passes on the costs according to the polluter pays principle.
Simply leaving the cash in the vaults of the Raiffeisen bank would be far too dangerous: "I have already experienced four robberies, I do not want the fifth!," said the bank's executive board.
Most customers would understand and switch to other forms of investment.
Few migrated to other banks.
The Cooperative Association of Bavaria said: "The ECB's extreme monetary policy stance incurs significant costs for all banks."
Carrying them alone is "economically not possible in the long term."
Some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account management, credit cards or transfers.
The Thuringian Volks- und Raiffeisenbank Altenburger Land hit the headlines in 2014 with punitive interest rates on deposits of three million euros or more.
Michael Kemmer, chief executive of the Banking Association, said: "We do not expect retail customers to have to pay fees for deposits across the board; competition among banks and savings banks in Germany is far too strong for that."
One banker said that on Lake Tegernsee there was "a clientele that is a little more lavish in terms of wealth."
"This can be a problem for a small bank" if it keeps money for free.
The Gmund Cooperative Bank, founded in 1911, has branches in Bad Wiessee, Rottach-Egern, Kreuth and Tegernsee.
The region is home to well-known actors, sportsmen and entrepreneurs.
The Cooperative Association of Bavaria "is currently not aware of any other banks that charge compensation for deposits by private customers," said spokesman Ernst.
At the end of June, Uwe Fröhlich, President of the Bundesverband der deutschen Volksbanken und Raiffeisenbanken (BVR), declared: "The threshold for going negative towards private customers is very, very high."
Competition is fierce and there is a risk of an exodus of investors to competition.
Customers in Germany will not put up with this across the board.
Destination records: who actually buys records?
Lonely, middle-aged men love records.
Before you rush to the comment section to litter him with crude insults under the pseudonym Non-Alone Middle-Aged Men, this statement is taken from actual data.
According to YouGov, the much-talked-about resurgence of records is not down to a boom in millennials wanting to embrace the novelty of physical objects, but to mid-life nostalgia.
Those who have recently bought a record are likely to be between the ages of 45 and 54.
In fact, the 18-24 age group is the least likely buyer.
It is also not hoarding by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older record buyers are more likely to keep their feelings to themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).
But are YouGov's results correct?
If this blog were a news report on television, the camera would follow me as I walk down a busy street in Soho, wearing a modest grey suit and gesturing wildly before stopping, holding my hands and saying something insistent like, "So, let's take a closer look."
So, let's take a look.
While the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings that once housed independent sellers - there are still a handful of fantastic record shops.
I would probably ask the cameraman to turn off the camera for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and temperament through observation.
Stuart, 55, from Glasgow, whom I follow from Sister Ray (two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (eight middle-aged men, one woman, presumably in her 20s), is in London for a day for a meeting and goes to the shops to fill the few hours.
Is he a collector, I ask?
"I guess so," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These records, pictured above (he emailed me the snapshot, I didn't follow him home), line the walls of his living room.
The reason he has such a significant number of albums and singles is the result of his disposable income: he is now able to buy records he could not afford when they were released and buy items he sold again when he was young and broke.
"A lot of the things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70s that came out when I was 11 or 12, things where I was probably a bit too young to buy them," he says.
He agrees that those who buy records tend to be more introverted and enjoy spending time alone, adding: "I don't smoke and I don't drink a lot.
That's my vice.
Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes many of the clients he meets apply to the YouGov profile.
However, he has also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media hype, people who have heard about the comeback and feel compelled to buy their old records again.
From the conversations I have had, people have usually got rid of their collection around 1998 or 1999.
Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their records again, "he says.
This would explain the boom in fans of the record revival of a certain age.
But what about the supposed emotional significance of records?
It only takes a few seconds in a store like Phonica to realise that record shops offer a reassuring community of like-minded people.
According to Wez, some of the older customers took umbrage at the contactless payment system.
Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retire to the stability of familiar record sleeves, objects that evoke happy childhood memories.
"I think sometimes it can be filling a void or having material possessions as a kind of comfort," Wez says.
That's the way it is with me as a collector and I think that's the way it is with a lot of people.
It's an easy way to keep yourself mentally engaged.
"We're like their social workers!" whispers a member of staff from a stack of records.
An ICM survey in April revealed that nearly 50% of people who bought a record last month had not listened to it.
The survey also found that 41% own a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record do not own a record player.
At this point in the news report, I would probably look very concerned as I scroll through a stack of bossa nova compilations.
Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (three middle-aged men), has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the revival.
"Someone came in here recently and said," I don't own a record player, but I'd like to buy a Radiohead record so I can put it on the shelf, "" he says.
This is not a big percentage, but it is definitely happening.
More product-oriented, less music-oriented.
We have people saying, "I don't have a record player."
These are younger people, not older people, who are slowly coming in.
Fopp, which has devoted almost an entire floor to the records, has a more colourful audience when I enter.
There are couples in their 70s, tourists taking photos, teenagers and middle-aged women.
Even if the atmosphere is a little less relaxed than in the abovementioned stores - Wild Beast's latest synthesizer and sex-packed pop instead of experimental jazz booms out of the speakers - it's good to see such diversity among customers.
None of them look particularly lonely, but nagging psychological trauma is hard to detect when standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been walking around the store for several minutes looking at the variety of records for sale.
She does window shopping rather than bulk shopping.
She doesn't earn much, so collecting records isn't a real option, she says.
It costs a lot.
It's easy to listen to music from a computer or some other way, but the beauty of records is... "she drifts off with a smitten sigh.
I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.
My last stop is a store said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: Urban Outfitters.
While pretending to be sampling the denim hotpants, I watch a group of young teenage girls cluster around Polaroid cameras for a moment before a father and daughter decide to buy a Crosley record player.
To your left is a staircase, a wall full of records by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, the essential records for an average collection.
No one looks at them - perhaps because they are purely decorative, some so high up that it is impossible to touch them.
It's pure "record art."
But given that any attraction to these items could mean more money for the industry and send some customers to the depths of Soho for more, there's nothing to complain about.
It is no surprise that a demographic that has more time and money than others is also the one that spends the most on luxury items like records.
Although my research found that YouGov's findings are true, they do not take into account, at least in record stores in Soho, the large number of female collectors and record lovers that exist in reality, record stores and online forums.
These people probably work hard at school or in offices.
They certainly don't spend their Thursday mornings browsing Berwick Street record shops and flicking through records while avoiding the staring gaze of an eerie 30-year-old fake presenter towering over the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Greenland shark is the longest-living vertebrate - video report
Scientists say the Greenland shark has the longest lifespan of any vertebrate on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who studies sharks, says the record was set by a female believed to be between 272 and 512 years old and five metres long
French Court Rejects Bid to Demolish Jungle Refugee Camp Stores
A French court has rejected an offer by authorities in Calais to demolish dozens of makeshift shops and restaurants in the Calais Jungle, home to thousands of refugees.
At a court hearing this week, authorities in Calais argued that the state should be allowed to demolish 72 makeshift shops where people inside the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer hairdressing services, or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in makeshift restaurants.
The Calais prefecture argued that these sites should be demolished because they would create a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and there would be a fire and sanitation risk.
Humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important because the free meals offered by the state-backed association and other groups did not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.
They added that the makeshift shops and restaurants often provide accommodation and free meals for people in need.
A court in Lille ruled that there was no legal basis for deporting people who run the 72 makeshift shops, but acknowledged that the Calais prefecture's concerns were "perfectly understandable."
Judge Jean-François Molla said grocery stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role than just feeding people who "live in extremely precarious conditions."
He said the areas provide quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers.
One of the places at risk of demolition was the camp's Jungle Book Kids' Café, a not-for-profit offering 200 meals a day, English and French classes and advice on asylum for the hundreds of vulnerable unaccompanied minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed the petition to preserve the Kids' Café.
In a letter to the Guardian, it said the closure "would be a disaster for these children, the youngest of whom are eight years old."
The two aid agencies Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the Jungle camp had risen to more than 9,000 - the highest number so far - after a surge in arrivals over the summer.
Despite Olympic disappointment: Martin remains combative
Despite his disappointing performance in the Olympic time trial, professional cyclist Tony Martin does not want to let himself be beaten.
'I will continue to focus on the World Championships, remain confident and keep fighting, 'the 31-year-old wrote on Facebook on Thursday ahead of his departure from Rio de Janeiro.
He has no explanation for his miserable 12th place at Sugarloaf.
"I honestly find it hard to comment on yesterday's time trial," Martin said.
He said he needed to calmly analyse the reasons for the debacle.
Martin actually wanted to fight for the title at the World Time Trial Championship in Qatar in October.
'I'm going to look at everything that we've changed in recent times. '
"That includes my position," wrote the three-time time time trial world champion, who lost more than three minutes to Olympic champion Fabian Cancellara (Switzerland) in the 54.5 km race on Wednesday.
Olympics: Tennis pro Siegemund misses out on semi-final
The victory of Laura Siegemund ended in the quarter-finals of Rio: The world ranking 32nd from Metzingen missed by a 1: 6, 1: 6 against Monica Puig (Puerto Rico / WTA No.
34) the semi-finals of the Olympic tennis tournament.
Siegemund, who has been plagued by back problems, could only hold her serve once and looked weak compared to previous rounds.
On Thursday, medal hope Angelique Kerber (No.
The Australian Open winner faced Britain's Johanna Konta (No 10).
Tommy Haas was the last German professional tennis player to win a silver medal in Sydney in 2000.
There had last been two German DTB starters in the quarter-finals of the Summer Games in 1992.
Never before has a German duo reached an Olympic singles semi-final.
Group joins start-up for live video game broadcasts
Watching other people play video games is a huge trend - and Microsoft wants to profit from this as well.
The technology group is buying start-up Beam, which specialises in this hobby.
Microsoft did not say on Thursday how much money would be spent on the acquisition.
Beam only launched its service in January and already has more than 100,000 users.
You can watch others play, but you can also intervene yourself.
For example, they can give players missions, face enemies, and provide equipment.
Gaming giant Activision Blizzard is launching a new HD video service for the booming world of e-sports.
Facebook is supposed to help on its way to becoming a global media event.
The advertising industry is already paying attention.
Employees of the start-up, which is currently based in Seattle, Washington state, will move to Microsoft's headquarters in Redmond, California, according to Beam co-founder and CEO Matt Salsamendi.
The takeover is not intended to change anything for customers.
Beam will be integrated into the video game division around the Xbox console, according to Microsoft.
The market for live streaming of video game activities is currently growing rapidly.
Well-known platforms are Twitch and YouTube Gaming.
Twitch was bought by online retailer Amazon in 2014 - for almost a billion dollars.
YouTube Gaming is owned by Google parent Alphabet.
Here comes the Enforcement Trailer
Germany's speedometers have to adapt to the next generation of speedometers: In various federal states, including Hesse and Brandenburg, new speed cameras are being tested that are supposed to transfer speed offenders particularly effectively.
The futuristic-looking Enforcement Trailers by Vitronic from Wiesbaden can be used, for example, at accident areas where it would be too dangerous for mobile measurement by the police.
For example, at motorway construction sites or bridges to be renovated with a temporary speed limit, there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure that the speed limit is observed there with a stationary speed camera.
However, a permanent mobile setup can be too dangerous or time-consuming.
The Enforcement Trailer is self-sufficient: its battery lasts five days during continuous measurement operation, and the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem.
Laser measurement technology can also be used to record all vehicles across multiple lanes simultaneously.
Variable speed limits and bans on entry by time, lane and vehicle class can also be monitored.
According to the manufacturer, the trailer can be moved when raised with any car with a trailer hitch.
So that it is not simply stolen, it is lowered in the measuring mode, so that the wheels disappear in the armoured and incidentally also bullet-proof outer shell.
In addition, a built-in alarm system should protect the speed camera from vandalism.
According to Vitronic, the trailer has been tested in various federal states since 2015 and is now also in use.
Foreign authorities are also flashing the new technology: France recently ordered 100 units, up from an order of 150 last year.
Great Britain take silver in rugby sevens after Fiji take gold
Great Britain's impressive performance in the Rugby Sevens final came to an abrupt halt at the final hurdle on Thursday night when they were beaten 43-7 by Fiji at the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji delivered a masterclass in handling, side-stepping, back-heeling, line-running and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any colour.
The defeat was sweetened by the not-so-bad consolation prize of a silver medal - Britain's fourth on the day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament, in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The Boks' emphatic defeat, 7-5 in the semi-final on the same day, could backfire on them in the final.
But regardless, Fiji would have beaten a 15-man team at their very best on this form.
It might be some consolation for GB - but it probably won't - that at least one Brit will have a gold medal around his neck tomorrow: Fiji's head coach Ben Ryan, the former Wimbledon chief executive.
GB have had a difficult road.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game in the Adelaide Sevens.
Here, they lost only one.
This defeat will hurt, but the progress is amazing.
Fiji started beautifully and let England's attacks bounce back for fun.
It felt like running into a moving bus for captain Tom Mitchell and Co. and the World Series winners went 5-0 up when Osea Kolinisau poked over in the corner.
With four minutes left, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner, which he converted.
12-0 and GB barely touched the ball.
A superb tackle from Mitchell stopped the mountain of man Leone Nakarawa to score a third goal but it only stopped Fiji.
Jasa Veremalua scored a touchdown in the right corner in the seventh minute to make it 0-17 for GB.
Nakarawa added another since the restart and there was still over a minute of play... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou surged through more of Team GB's weak tackles and stormed to the line to score.
The conversion made it 29-0 by the break.
It's as if Fiji were born to play the sevens, while GB are still learning.
So it is.
GB made fundamental changes at half-time and closed the Fijian gap... for a full four minutes, which was good by first-half standards, until Joshua Tuisova went through after a brilliant interplay by Fiji.
Dan Norton kicked a try for GB, scoring a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7 lead, but the game was long in the South Sea Islanders' favour as fans sang, waved flags and danced in the stands.
It wasn't hard to admire Fiji's playful approach.
Mata Viliame put the icing on the cake with another try in the dying seconds.
The whistle sounded, the Fijis embraced and GB kicked the turf, crushingly beaten.
Earlier in the day, Fiji had beaten Japan 20-5 in the semi-final and Great Britain edged out South Africa in a tight semi-final - Great Britain's conversion of the difference.
Kyle Brown put the Boks ahead in the first half but Dan Norton breached the line with impressive footwork and scored under the posts in the second half.
A brilliant late tackle from Marcus Watson, brother of Anthony, from the England 15-a-side team, secured the win - and a silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired to rowing victory by coach's cancer battle
There will be no more emotinous gold than at these Games and that means something.
From the first rowing stroke to the last, 220 hard blows that will go down in history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found extra meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.
Even if it was just the two of them at the helm, there were three voices in the boat and the echo of coach Robin Williams was ever present as they rowed to their second consecutive Olympic gold in the women's coxless pairs, the first women in the history of British sport to set such a benchmark.
Their dominance was absolute, their 39th unbeaten outing, which is also unprecedented.
What we see are two brilliant athletes gliding across the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not fully reflect the nature of their triumph.
Behind every gold in rowing is a battalion of willing helpers contributing to the incremental advances that make all the difference, and nobody was more helpful than the coach who, 30 months ago, didn't know if he would even survive that day when he was diagnosed with cancer.
As he said, he was risky.
I had bladder cancer, which can be operated on, and they did.
If you don't, it spreads everywhere.
It would have been a pretty bad situation.
It changes the outlook a little bit.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio were lucky that he was able to begin treatment in early 2014, off-season, which kept the interruption to a minimum, if that is the right term in such circumstances at all.
I needed money, so I needed to get better soon.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and I was walking around the ward - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said a few steps would be enough.
That's how it starts.
Rowing itself is a challenge, but that makes it an even bigger challenge.
In the immediate aftermath of the victory, her first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nerve-wracking morning talking a little more than usual and trying to process his own fears.
Stanning, who served in Afghanistan as a captain in the Royal Artillery Regiment, said: 'I've been an emotional wreck this week, which is maybe a bit extreme, but it means so much.'
It just repeats how much it means to me, how much me and Helen and Robin have worked together.
It's been three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin we wouldn't be anybody, so a massive thank you goes out to him, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have asked for a better person to coach or a better coach.
Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a race in the last five years.
The pair had a hard rhythm that their opponents could not keep up with.
Even in the last 500 metres, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to catch up, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.
We were very caught up in the moment.
Helen shouted "stay in the process, stay in the process."
It is really important not to get carried away.
We had a good start and at the same time we weren't looking to do anything great.
We didn't want fireworks today, we just wanted to get a good result, go out and win the race, which we did.
The couple will take a year off before making any decisions about their future.
Glover is due to appear at a wedding next week, her own with TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't want to say this was my last race.
That would have meant too much pressure.
In London, it took me about six months to realise I was an Olympic champion.
It was all so new to me and I was so stressed.
Here it took about four minutes.
It feels so much better, "she said.
Excellent clarity for 31 years
The managing director of the Veitensteingruppe, Ruppert Göller, is retiring.
The association is regarded as "exemplary throughout Bavaria."
A small Franconian drinking water association as a model for the large water producers.
This was said some time ago in the original tone in a contribution of the Bavarian Broadcasting Corporation.
A little later, the Water Forum of the Government of Lower Franconia paid tribute to the Zweckverband.
The work of the Veitenstein Group was considered "exemplary throughout Bavaria."
Rupert Göller, who worked for the Zweckverband for 31 years, including 28 years as managing director, is behind all this.
He has now retired at the age of 65.
The Drinking Water Association of the Veitenstein Group, based in Kottendorf in the municipality of Breitbrunn, extracts about 150,000 cubic metres of water annually and supplies 32 villages and hamlets with about 5,500 inhabitants.
The member municipalities are Kirchlauter, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the city of Baunach.
Water supply contracts are in place for other towns and municipalities.
The current chairperson, Breitbrunn's mayor Gertrud Bühl (FW), recalled that Rupert Göller was hired as a water warden in 1985 and had already been appointed managing director of the Zweckverband in 1988.
"His duties have been very varied and ranged from water pipe construction and maintenance to office and organisational work, budget preparation, calculation of fees and contributions to emergency operations at weekends," she said.
Among the most notable events, she mentioned the commissioning and inauguration of the new wells (1994), the purchase of land in the area of the new wells (1998) and compensation for farmers, the renovation of the elevated tanks (1999), the new purchase of a central computer control system (2004) and the partial renewal of water pipes.
There was no standstill whatsoever and innovations were constantly introduced, because water is life and drinking water is the most important food.
In her eulogy she praised Göller's faithful, reliable and correct service over 31 years.
He has put a lot of heart and soul into his Water Purpose Association and he has lived the Water Purpose Association as if it were his own business.
A few weeks ago, as a true practitioner, he was able to present the successful concept of the Veitenstein Group for reducing nitrates to the Water Forum of the district of Lower Franconia.
For this he received a lot of recognition and praise.
Rupert Göller, for his part, praised water warden Alfons Griebel, who had worked with him 28 years.
He is the best water warden and he was a loyal squire.
Together we were an unbeatable team.
From his point of view, he described the well construction and the restructuring of the association as highlights.
The biggest challenge and the most difficult assignment, however, was the rupture of the pipe at the elevated tank near Kirchlauter on 3 January.
Here we had to work through the whole night at minus 17 degrees so that the villages could be supplied with water.
Even the supply of Neubrunn could only be maintained once, because the elevated tank from Pettstadt was filled with hoses.
The management of the Drinking Water Purpose Association was handed over to Daniel Stürmer from Lauter, who succeeds Rupert Göller.
Soprano Anna Netrebko is open about her son Tiago's autism - and addresses other concerned parents: 'You need to have the courage to talk about it.'
"Medicine has made great progress," the 44-year-old told Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera.
When her son was diagnosed with the disease, she believed she had to die.
But eight-year-old Tiago has made good progress and is now learning privately in New York, where he has the best therapists.
"To give an example, when I ask him something two years ago when I was singing at La Scala in Milan, he doesn't remember anything," Netrebko said.
But he is the luckiest man on earth.
Tiago comes from Netrebko's association with the bass-baritone Erwin Schrott.
She is now married to tenor Yusif Eyvazov.
Relationship crime in Bargteheide - Man shoots his partner
A 35-year-old man shot his partner and fatally injured her in an apartment building in Bargteheide (Stormarn district) at around 10.45 a.m. on Friday.
"The man himself called us and said he had shot his partner," a police spokeswoman said.
The perpetrator is on the run, and the public is searching for him.
Meanwhile nationwide, because Sven S. could be on the road by car.
The man is about 1.80 meters tall, muscular, tanned and has a bald head.
Police have since released a photo of him.
However, it is a few years old.
Meanwhile, the man is bald.
The man is not to be contacted directly.
He was still able to carry the weapon, police said.
Anyone who sees Sven S. should call 110.
The police call it a "relationship crime."
The victim was born in 1988, the perpetrator in 1981.
At first, the competent police in Lübeck did not want to provide any information on the course of events or the relationship between the perpetrator and the victim; however, they confirmed that one person had been killed.
'It's a homicide. '
"We are not saying any more at this time," a police spokeswoman said.
According to eyewitnesses, a Special Operations Command (SEK) was at the scene.
Steel - bright spot for German steel industry
The crisis-stricken and energy-intensive German steel industry is spared millions in additional costs.
Financial burdens on the sector from the promotion of green electricity are off the table.
The exemption from the renewable energy surcharge for existing installations for so-called self-generated electricity in the German steel industry remains in place, Federal Minister for Economic Affairs Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) told the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" (WAZ, Friday edition).
"I am really glad that we were finally able to achieve this after two years of tough negotiations."
The European Commission had initially planned to charge the steel manufacturers who use gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption.
According to the German industry association, the steel industry was threatened with additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year.
Gabriel told the WAZ that there was now an agreement in principle with the EU Commission after talks with Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.
Only when the generators in the steel mills are replaced will there be an EEG levy of 20 percent.
But even this is not levied in the steel industry.
IG Metall welcomed Germany's agreement with the EU Commission on self-generated electricity.
This would largely establish the status quo of the previous regime.
The successful efforts of Gabriel are of particular importance for the steel industry.
"This is a first step in our 'Steel is the Future' campaign."
'There's more to come. '
"Climate and employment targets must also be weighed when reforming emissions trading," IG Metall CEO Jörg Hofmann said in Frankfurt.
Since the financial crisis of 2008, the steel industry in Europe has suffered from overcapacity and considerable price pressure.
The situation worsened further last year when China, the world's largest producer, threw steel onto the world market en masse in the face of weakening domestic demand.
European producers accuse Chinese steel companies of price dumping.
Over the course of this spring, the situation has eased somewhat.
On the one hand, imposed import duties on imported steel are having an effect and, on the other, the economic outlook in China has brightened.
It is unclear how sustainable the price recovery is.
German industry leader Thyssenkrupp remained cautious on Thursday.
Prices would have stagnated again recently.
The industry is reacting to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.
Thyssenkrupp did not want to rule out closing individual plants.
At the end of 2015, around 86,000 people were employed in the German steel industry.
Despite rising prices and increasing orders, German steelmakers remained cautious in July.
At 3.4 million tonnes, they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the same month last year, the German Steel Industry Association announced on Friday.
After a brief increase in May, production fell for the second month in a row.
Since the beginning of the year, production has been two percent below the previous year's level.
The association anticipates an increase in output in the coming months thanks to an improved order situation.
Community, Mind, Health: Singing is good for seniors
Singing has accompanied Ursel Kipp all her life: as a young girl she was in the school choir, she studied music as a teacher, and today the 78-year-old sings in a senior choir.
"Singing moves me - emotionally and physically," she says.
After rehearsals, she says, she feels balanced, cheerful and overall more alive.
She is doing something good for her health and her mind.
Singing is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler from the German Senior League.
Most seniors sing in a choir and share the joy of music with like-minded people, describes Hackler.
By regularly being together seniors can socialize and maintain social contacts.
This is because social and family structures often dissolve in old age, and a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.
Ursel Kipp also experienced this in her choir: "To coordinate and organize, to be able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together."
Singing can be exhausting in a positive sense, says Hackler.
This is because seniors train deep and controlled breathing.
Those who regularly demand their lungs do not get out of breath so quickly, even in everyday life.
Even when it comes to preserving the sound of the voice in old age, singing is an ideal hobby.
Singing often has a very special effect on older people, says Ursula Lenz from the Federal Association of Senior Citizens "Organisations.
In the older generations singing together was much more important, it was part of everyday life, both at school and in leisure time, she explains.
Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs awakens many memories in older people, often associated with positive feelings from their youth.
Through lyrics and especially melodies, even people suffering from dementia remember events from a long time ago.
When singing, the head is also required to perform particularly well, explains Lenz.
Concentrating on one's own voice and a given rhythm at the same time and adapting to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.
Especially older people, who live alone, practice not only to concentrate on themselves.
Another positive aspect is the recognition you get from singing in a choir, says Hackler.
An enthusiastic audience is a great compliment.
Self-esteem also grows through singing in a choir.
To show oneself: when I practice for a long time, I get better and grow beyond myself - this experience strengthens me.
So there are plenty of good reasons to start singing.
If you want to try out a new hobby, don't hesitate - even if you think you have little talent, advises Lenz.
You don't sing alone - with 50 people singing, who hears when a note goes wrong?
In search of the right offer, seniors have different options, says Hackler.
If someone from your circle of acquaintances sings in a seniors "choir, you can simply join in.
Many towns also offer overviews of the choirs in the area.
Anyone wishing to sing in a church choir can contact the congregation or the church leader directly.
Many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet.
If you don't have access to the internet, you can ask your family, friends or neighbours for help with your internet search.
If you want to sing, you should definitely join a choir, advises Hackler.
Singing is good for the soul and has something liberating - this applies to all ages.
Cats react more sensitively than cats to the cries of the kittens
Biologists in Hanover have investigated the effect of calling cat babies on adult animals.
To their surprise, the meowing did not leave the males indifferent either - however, in contrast to the females, they always behaved the same way.
Female cats can recognize the arousal of kittens by the meowing of the kittens.
They react ten percent faster to sounds from kittens who think they are in great need, as scientists from the University of Veterinary Medicine and the Hannover Medical School (MHH) have discovered.
Hangovers also react to the calls of kittens - but always in the same way.
"Apparently, the acoustic differences between the meowing of less and more excitable juveniles are either imperceptible or of no importance to the males," said biologist Wiebke Konerding from the MHH.
She is the lead author of the study, which was published this Friday in the journal BMC Evolutionary Biology.
In a previous study, the research team had already found that the duration and pitch of kitten cries varied with the urgency of their need for help.
A total of nine adult males and eight females from MHH livestock farming were observed.
On the one hand, they were played calls from little ones who were taken out of the litter box for three minutes and separated from their mother and siblings.
On the other hand they were confronted with cries of more excited kittens, which were lifted up additionally.
Despite the small sample size, the researchers consider their results to be significant.
"All females, even those that did not yet have offspring of their own, reacted differentiated to the cries," Konerding said.
They turned to the loudspeaker more quickly when it played the calls of the more excited kittens.
This ability is possibly innate or develops with sexual maturity.
"One surprise was that the males reacted at all," the biologist said.
In the past, scientists have repeatedly studied the reactions of women and men to baby sounds in humans.
Some studies also showed that women reacted more sensitively to infants, regardless of whether they were already mothers or not, reported biologist Marina Scheumann.
Podolski reaches for Supercup with 'Gala'
Hakan Sükür is a football legend in Turkey.
An arrest warrant has been issued in Turkey for former football star Hakan Sükür.
He is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
For the first time since the coup attempt, an important football match is taking place in Turkey.
Ahead of the battle between the arch rivals Besiktas Istanbul and Lukas Podolski's Galatasaray Istanbul for the Konya Supercup, the official line is clear: "Business as usual."
Even when the state of emergency was declared after the coup attempt in July, the government asserted that the everyday life of ordinary citizens should not be affected.
But this does not apply to those suspected of belonging to the movement of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, who has been blamed for the coup attempt.
And it doesn't stop at football.
The public prosecutor's office issued an arrest warrant for the former star kicker Hakan Sükür.
The South Korean, who now lives in America, is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
Sükür is said to be a supporter of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is blamed by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for the coup attempt.
Although the state of emergency, initially imposed for 90 days, will last until October, it has virtually no effect on the lives of most Turks.
Erdogan declared the night-time "democracy guards" in public squares across the country over on Wednesday.
Sport, like the country as a whole, is divided between supporters and opponents of Erdogan.
Fans of working-class club Besiktas, in particular, traditionally do not count among the president's friends.
What unites the majority of Turks, however, in the face of dramatic historical experiences, is the outright rejection of military coups.
Even the fans agree - regardless of whether their hearts beat for Galatasaray or Besiktas.
Lukas Podolski will be particularly important for cup winners Gala.
The 31-year-old from Cologne proved his sporting value last season: With 17 goals and nine assists in all competitions, he finished his first season as his club's top scorer.
He scored the winning goal in the final against Fenerbahce.
The Fanatic newspaper hailed him: "He was the best on the pitch."
He has finished the season in an outstanding way and secured the trophy for his team.
Thanks to "Poldi," the disappointing season for the record champion came to a conciliatory end.
After reaching the knockout stages of the Champions League, the "Lions" were also eliminated early in the Europa League.
In the Süper Lig it was only enough to rank sixth.
The season hasn't been good.
The cup was the only way to win something.
"We have achieved that and that is the most important thing," Podolski said.
The season went better for champions Besiktas.
Particularly thanks to Mario Gomez, who laid the foundations for a 14th title with 26 goals of the season as the top scorer in the Süper Lig.
That is why fans continue to hope for the 31-year-old's return.
Gomez, who is under contract at AC Florence and only on loan to Besiktas, announced after the coup attempt that he would not return after his European Championship holiday due to the political situation in the country.
"If Mario wants to come to us, he just has to say it," Kicker magazine quoted club director Fikret Orman as saying.
In order to do so, however, the striker would have to be willing to forgo around a third of his annual salary, estimated at 7.5 million euros, Orman clarified: "We cannot pay his salary at Florence."
Despite doping, these athletes still have a medal chance at the Rio Olympics
Justin Gatlin, 34, has twice been banned for doping (2001 and 2006).
Rio de Janeiro - Whistleblower Julia Stepanova is not allowed to compete in Rio.
Other convicted track and field sinners can only laugh at this - they are fighting for medals in Rio.
Doping continues to dominate the headlines at the Rio Olympics.
The Russian swimmer Yulia Yefimova, who had claimed her starting right shortly before the Games after a doping suspension, was mercilessly booed and booed at her start (100m breaststroke).
It was a bizarre scene: With a put-on smile, she had strutted into the hall and had provoked with her performance.
When it was clear she wasn't going to win gold, the crowd erupted in cheers.
But there are plenty of other athletes who will be competing at the Rio Olympics despite their doping past.
Here is an overview:
Justin Gatlin (100, 200, 4x100m relay / USA): The 34-year-old is one of the most controversial figures in athletics.
He has already been banned twice for doping (2001 and 2006 to 2010).
Since his spell, the 2004 Olympic champion and former world champion has run even faster than before, clocking 9.80 seconds in the 100m and being Usain Bolt's biggest challenger.
Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce (100, 4x100m relay / Jamaica): The two-time Olympic and seven-time world champion served a six-month suspension in 2010 after she was found to have taken the painkiller oxycodone.
The 29-year-old defended herself saying she had severe toothache after surgery.
Sandra Perkovic (Discus / Croatia): In 2011, the 2012 Olympic champion, 2013 World Champion and 2010-2016 European Champion tested positive for the banned stimulant methylhexanamine.
Perkovic denied knowingly taking the drug and was banned for six months.
The four furthest throws this year go to the big favourite for gold.
LaShawn Merritt (200, 400, 4x400m relay / USA): The Beijing Olympic champion and two-time world 400m champion tested positive in 2010 and was banned for 21 months.
A penis enlargement drug was responsible, Merritt said.
This year, the 30-year-old is the fastest man in the world over 200m and 400m.
Ivan Tikhon (hammer throw, Belarus): Hardly any athlete has been deprived of so many medals.
Tikhon lost his 2005 world title nine years later after he was diagnosed with testosterone doping.
The 40-year-old also had to give up Olympic silver in 2004 due to steroid doping and the European Championship title in 2006 due to testosterone abuse.
He was also stripped of his 2008 Olympic bronze medal following a ruling by the International Court of Sport (CAS).
With 80.04 m he is ranked second in the world.
Liu Hong (20km walk, China): The world record holder and favourite for gold only tested positive in May, but will still be allowed to compete in Rio.
The 29-year-old world champion was found to have taken a banned dietary supplement and the World Anti-Doping Agency's (WADA) ban was lenient, expiring on July 13.
Bomb Terror in Thailand - Austrian Woman Injured - Several Dead
The Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman, Foreign Ministry spokesman Thomas Schnöll said Friday morning.
She had suffered cuts and was being treated in hospital, but had already been able to leave.
She had planned to return home at the beginning of September.
It is not yet clear whether Austrian citizens were also affected by the further explosions on the holiday island of Phuket as well as in the southern cities of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon.
According to Schnöll, the Foreign Ministry is in constant contact with the local authorities in this regard.
In Hua Hin, some 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok, two bombs exploded in a nightlife district on Thursday evening.
According to police, a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.
Two more IEDs went off Friday morning, killing another person, according to authorities.
A bomb explosion was also reported from Phuket in the morning.
A taxi driver was injured in the explosion near Patong beach, which is popular with holidaymakers, according to police.
Then, in Surat Thani on the country's southeast coast, another bomb exploded, killing a city employee.
The explosive device blew up in a flower bed outside the coastal police station, according to authorities.
Finally, detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the southwest coast and in Chumphon on the southeast coast left several injured.
The explosions in Hua Hin are believed to be linked, it said.
"The bombings bear the same signature," Army Gen. Danai Kritchavee told reporters Friday morning.
'We're assuming it was a co-ordinated attack. '
He said it was too early to comment on possible motives - but it was likely the actions of Muslim rebels.
Thai media also sought to identify a pattern in the attacks, typical of bombings by Muslim separatists in the south of the country.
Thai police, however, said the attacks were not related to the Islamist insurgency or international terrorism.
"This is just local sabotage, limited to limited areas and provinces," said a spokesman in Bangkok.
On the contrary, it is believed that the bombs were planted by opponents of the ruling military junta.
In recent days, the authorities had received intelligence indications of imminent attacks in the south of the country - but they were not informed about the exact time and locations.
It was not yet clear which group was behind the attacks.
Police ordered officers across the country to step up security around key government buildings, as well as airports, train stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.
In Thailand, there are always smaller bombings, but they are mostly not directed against tourists.
Hua Hin is home to a palace that was used for years by Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej.
After the recent bomb explosions, the Austrian Foreign Ministry recommends on its homepage to follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities absolutely.
High security risk (security level 3) applies to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla as well as Preah Vihear and its surroundings.
Following clashes between security forces and Muslim populations, unnecessary travel to these provinces is discouraged.
Increased security risk (security level 2) applies to the rest of the country.
The attacks on Thursday and Friday came just days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drafted by the military junta.
This gives the military great influence also in the coming years.
Junta leader and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs were an attempt to create chaos as the country moves toward stability, an improving economy and tourism.
The military junta, which seized power in 2014 after a period of bloody unrest, credits itself with restoring stability and order to the kingdom.
But the military has also failed to contain the Muslim insurgency that has been simmering in the country's far south for years.
More than 6,500 people have already been killed in the conflict.
Almost a year ago, 20 people - most of them foreign tourists - were also killed in an attack on a popular Hindu shrine in Bangkok.
It was the bloodiest attack in the country's recent history.
The right-wing "Identitäre Bewegung" (Identitarian Movement) has been targeted by the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution.
According to several state offices, the constitutional protectors in the federal government have also placed the group under observation.
"In the 'Identitäre Bewegung' (Identitarian Movement), we see evidence of efforts against the liberal democratic order," Hans-Georg Maaßen, head of constitutional protection, told the Deutsche Presse-Agentur in Berlin.
For example, immigrants of the Islamic faith or those from the Middle East are vilified in an extremist manner.
That's why we're watching the movement now.
The "Identitäre Bewegung" is a group with French roots, which has also been active in Germany since 2012.
It opposes "multicultural delusion," "uncontrolled mass immigration" and the "loss of one's own identity through alienation."
Constitutionalists in nine federal states - Bremen, Bavaria, Hesse, Berlin, Baden-Württemberg, NRW, Lower Saxony, Saxony and Thuringia - are already observing the "identitarians."
Maaßen said his agency coordinated closely with the state offices in making the decision.
"Groups like the 'Identitarian Movement' are trying to pick up where they left off," he said.
In general, extremists try to address them with youth-oriented language, often with pop music.
Islamists as well as right-wing extremists would do so.
This is not a cosy advertisement for one's own cause.
The propaganda is meant to appeal to people emotionally.
Young people are particularly vulnerable.
This is dangerous.
Recently there had been reports from several federal states about contacts of the "Identitären" to AFD politicians.
Maaßen said he had no knowledge of the matter.
For the protection of the Constitution, possible contacts of this kind are only relevant after a certain point.
It depends on whether the party in question - in this case, the AfD - changes direction and becomes extremist through certain people who are extremist.
The decisive factor, then, is whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party.
This was not discernible.
Regarding the significant increase in right-wing crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee shelters, Maaßen said he would not yet speak of right-wing terrorism in this context.
In recent years, however, we have discovered that right-wing terrorist structures can exist.
There was the group 'Old School Society' or the Freitaler Group.
It is quite possible that further right-wing terrorist groups or micro-groups will form, planning attacks against asylum seekers, refugee homes or attacks with other right-wing extremist motives.
However, there was no recognisable Germany-wide or Europe-wide control of right-wing terrorism.
Previous groups had been formed at the regional level or in social networks.
Maaßen expressed concern that many attacks were carried out by people who had not previously appeared in the right-wing scene.
That's the worrying thing.
Many of the suspects in attacks on asylum shelters were not previously known to be criminals, politically motivated criminals or right-wing supporters.
"So many people have committed crimes that previously had nothing to do with right-wing extremists, who may have been politically indifferent or voted for the CDU, SPD or Left, for example, but who then became radicalised through right-wing extremist propaganda."
Rio 2016: Robel Kiros Habte becomes an internet hit
Olympians or world records don't always make the headlines at the Olympics.
This is shown by the courageous performance of Robel Kiros Habte at the Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro.
At the Aquatics Center, the slightly overweight swimmer from Ethiopia swam so slowly that he was temporarily out of sight in the TV pictures.
It just disappeared - no matter how far the neckline was selected.
Habte went on to become an internet viral hit on social media.
In fact, the 24-year-old finishes his heat 48 seconds behind and takes 59th place out of 59 starters.
But it was rather his less-than-athletic figure that attracted the attention of the international media.
Why is the 24-year-old still taking part in the Olympics?
The Ethiopian was given special starting rights by the International Swimming Federation.
This will be distributed to promote swimming in underrepresented countries.
Since most athletes run in Ethiopia, Habte just wanted to do something different.
Preparation is everything: Robel Kiros Habte is getting ready for the big race.
The first nicknames quickly made the rounds.
Some media referred to him as "Robel the whale."
Paraphrasing a "wealth belly," the English tabloid The Sun mocked him with "Dad Bod."
His time of one minute and almost five seconds in the 100m freestyle did not matter.
Comparisons with "Eric the Eel" have also been made.
At the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, Eric Moussambani's run attracted media attention.
The appearance of the swimmer from Equatorial Guinea was unforgettable, as he had to compete alone in a preliminary round of the 100m freestyle.
Moussambani was cheered on at the time.
The then 22-year-old only learned to swim eight months before the Olympics and had never run such a long distance before the competition.

Geretsried - The owner of a shop on Neuer Platz has been robbed.
Police said the 67-year-old woman had left her shop about 5.30pm on Monday and forgot to close a ground floor window.
When she returned at around 8.15am the next morning, about 250 euros had disappeared from the till.
Traces of the perpetrator could not be found.
There is also no video surveillance.
Trump doesn't see looming election defeat as close
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at a campaign event in Florida.
If the US presidential election is anything to go by, Donald Trump already has an alternative.
He'll just go on holiday.
If Donald Trump loses the US presidential election in November, he would not care: "Ultimately, it will either work out, or I will have a very, very nice, long vacation," the Republican candidate said in a telephone interview with the US television channel CNBC.
If it wasn't enough for him in the end for reasons of political correctness, that's fine, Trump said.
For example, he described US President Barack Obama and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton as the founders of the terrorist group Islamic State (IS).
Opposition has been building within his party lately.
Post enters the trade with electric vans
An electric delivery vehicle from Deutsche Post in action.
The interest of other companies in the vehicle is obviously great.
The Post Office also plans to sell its StreetScooter electric vehicle.
The company intends to start trading the transporter shortly.
From next year, the Post Office will also be offering its electric vans on the free car market.
"We want to get into selling to third parties," a Post spokesman said on Friday.
The company has been considering for months whether to sell its self-developed StreetScooter, which delivers letters and parcels, to other companies.
Post executive Jürgen Gerdes had said that there were always enquiries, for example from craftsmen.
According to the news magazine "Der Spiegel," the Bonn-based group intends to enter mass production of the vehicles shortly.
The company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year per shift at the post-owned factory.
Gerdes had announced that the Group wanted to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and was aiming for a complete conversion to environmentally friendly vehicles in the long term.
"We're going to take a very, very robust step toward 2020," he had said in late July.
I can imagine that we will be converting the entire fleet.
The StreetScooter has been active on Germany's roads since 2014.
GfK management resigns after disappointing business figures
Consumer research firm GfK is replacing its CEO Matthias Hartmann.
The resignations came suddenly - but not entirely unexpectedly.
The difficult situation of the market research firm GfK foreshadowed that the longer the promised successes remain, the more uncertain CEO Matthias Hartmann's chair will become.
Turbulence at the top of the Nuremberg-based market research firm GfK: After yet another disappointing business figures and the resignation of the company's management, the global number five in the sector is about to make a fresh start in terms of personnel.
GfK CEO wants to leave the company at the end of the year.
The Chairman of the GfK Supervisory Board, Arno Mahlert, will leave the Supervisory Board with effect from 12 September.
The company announced that Gerhard Hausruckinger, a former member of the Executive Board, will assume leadership of the Executive Board as of September 1.
He is to officially assume the function of a "spokesman for the board" until a successor is found for Hartmann.
The company cited "differing views" on its long-term business strategy as the reason for the resignations.
A company spokesman declined to give details on Friday.
Who will lead the market research company in the future is currently unclear.
Investors said on Friday that shareholders had recently been disillusioned with the continued lack of success of the restructuring that was initiated years ago.
Mr Hartmann has been at the helm of GfK since 2011.
"The fruits of the restructuring are still not visible even after five years," it said.
In view of the recent poor GfK business figures, every shareholder will become restless at some point.
"If that were the case at BMW, the Quandts would do the same," it said.
After setbacks in previous quarters, the company was also unable to halt its loss in the second quarter of 2016.
At EUR 361.2 million, sales were 6.1 percent lower than in the comparable quarter of the previous year.
Sales in the first half of the year fell by 3.4 percent to 721.2 million euros.
Profit in the second quarter was mainly impacted by the company's declining value in view of its difficult economic situation.
The impairment of goodwill of 139 million euros, which became necessary in the Consumer Experience division, resulted in a net loss of 148.2 million euros for the Group.
In the second quarter of 2015, GfK generated a net profit of 19.7 million.
Accidents - Bus slips into ditch in Krummhörn: Eight injured
Eight people were injured in an accident involving a coach with 43 senior citizens as passengers on Thursday in Krummhörn (district of Aurich).
Two of the occupants suffered serious injuries, police said.
The 66-year-old driver of the bus of a travel company from Eisenach had to swerve an oncoming truck, which partially drove on the oncoming carriageway, according to her information.
The bus veered off the road to the right and slid into a ditch, a police spokeswoman said.
"Due to the location of the bus, people were unable to leave the bus on their own," she said.
The fire brigade freed the occupants.
Six ambulances and an ambulance arrived at the scene of the accident on Highway 2.
The uninjured passengers were taken back to the Krummhorn neighborhood of Pewsum by a regular bus.
There they should wait for a replacement bus from the travel company.
Investigators appealed for the lorry driver and any witnesses to come forward to police.
From 1 October 2016, the fees per cubic metre of wastewater will be 3.44 euros instead of 2.10 euros for the Neudorf / Reuth / Welschenkahl wastewater treatment plant; 3.36 euros (previously 2.26 euros) for Zultenberg / Lindenberg / Lopp and 3.64 euros (previously 2.18 euros) for Azendorf.
At the plant in Azendorf, the sewage fee will increase again at the latest if appropriate improvement measures become necessary.
According to an approximate calculation, the wastewater price in Azendorf will then be 4.37 euros per cubic metre.
As mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, with the approval of the budget by the district administration Kulmbach it was determined that for these sewage plants undercoverings accumulate.
The Kasendorf market is legally obliged to operate the plants in a cost-covering manner.
From 1 October 2016, the citizens as well as the commercial and industrial enterprises from Welschenkahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to dig deeper into their pockets.
Fee increases range from 48 to 67 percent.
As head of administration Herbert Schmidt pointed out to the committee, a recalculation of the fees for the wastewater plants of the market municipality was necessary.
In the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over- or undercoverings from the previous calculation period are also to be compensated.
Schmidt justified the drastic fee increases on the grounds that all three wastewater plants were relatively small installations with a very low amount of wastewater, ranging from 6,800 to 12,000 cubic meters per year.
For example, expenditure of several thousand euros on necessary repairs would have a serious impact due to the low distribution base.
In addition, the volume of wastewater in all three plants is slightly declining.
Furthermore, in the past calculation period, refurbishment and repair expenses were incurred to a considerable extent at all three plants, not least due to their age.
The plant in Azendorf is almost 30 years old, the plants for Welschenkahl, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp are almost 20 years old.
Schmidt pointed out that the mechanical ventilation system in the Azendorf wastewater treatment plant had to be replaced due to damage.
At the Welschenkahl pumping station, the conveyor systems, which are almost 20 years old, had to be completely overhauled and at the Lopp pond treatment plant, the first sewage pond had to be dredged after almost 20 years of operation, the sewage sludge had to be disposed of and an additional ventilation system installed in order to be able to comply with the water regulations also in the future.
Schmidt: "In addition to these extraordinary expenses, there were the advanced support and maintenance costs, which must be taken into account accordingly in the new calculation period."
The same applies to electricity costs, which in the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012 were still significantly below the current level.
Steinhäuser made it clear that due to the low amount of waste water accumulated in the three plants, the costs for operation and maintenance "completely break through."
Schmidt added that the market community has been spared large maintenance costs for the wastewater plants in the past 20 years.
According to Steinhäuser, the situation for the aforementioned plants will remain precarious in the long term, especially as the supply area of the Friesenbachtal Wastewater Supply Association cannot be extended by these plants because they are in deficit.
Bulgaria Reports Inflation for First Time in 8 Months
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1% in July on a monthly basis.
This is the highest level since June 2012 and the first above zero since October last year, when a positive 0.2% was recorded.
Annual average inflation over the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was -0.8% as measured by the CPI.
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared with June 2016 was 101.0%, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0%.
Inflation since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared with December 2015) was -0.2% and annual inflation in July 2016 compared with July 2015 was -0.2%.
Compared with the previous month, the following groups of consumer goods saw price increases in July 2016: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%); transport (1.8%); leisure and culture (6.3%); restaurants and hotels (1.2%); miscellaneous goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell for clothing and footwear (2.2%); furniture, appliances and routine maintenance (0.5%); health (0.1%).
Prices remained unchanged as in the previous month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco; housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels; communications; and education.
Snapchat 'anime' effect criticised as Asian cartoon
Snapchat says the filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it is insensitive to race.
With its filtering tool, Snapchat enables around 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in a way that borders on the absurd.
You can transform yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Lichtenstein painting.
The filters are blunt, feature-twisting tools that generate more than 30 million enhanced selfies a day.
All the missteps are made public.
Snapchat filters have drawn criticism in the past, accusing the app of promoting blackface or promoting white skin as a beauty ideal.
When it proposed a filter to some users this week that gave them slit eyes, false teeth and puffy cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asians - "yellow face."
They wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a larger problem the company has with diversity.
The news and outrage were widely shared on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat announced it had disabled the feature.
The company offered an apology: The filter was meant as an homage to anime characters, not a caricature of Asians.
But to outsiders who have experienced racism, the filter reminded them of hurtful stereotypes.
Others emphatically rejected the anime comparison.
In an email, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet about the photos was widely shared, wrote that the filter was "hurtful and unpleasant to say the least."
She added that "it's hard to argue with the juxtaposition of a very disgusting Asian caricature and the filter effects.
It shows that the filter is not yellowface, but that the yellowface has been pulled to the pejorative extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company to cross these cultural stumbling blocks.
American culture seems to be engaged in an endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in our hands.
And Snapchat's large audience of young people - who are more diverse in race than their older counterparts - may be more likely to expect sensitivity.
When one of Snapchat's filters creates an image that is offensive to a user, "it's much harder for such things to go unnoticed than it used to be," Katie Zhu, 25, said in an interview on Thursday.
On Thursday, Zhu, who works as a product manager and engineer for Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account, prompting others to do the same.
In an essay for Medium and in a telephone interview, she said she believed race-related controversies reflected a lack of diversity in hiring practices at Snapchat.
Zhu criticized the largely white, all-male leadership and ended her essay with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat.
"Either they don't have diverse representation of people with different skin colors in their workforce so they can make such decisions," said Zhu, a Chinese-American, "or they have people with different skin colors who work there but aren't in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to speak out against it."
Others share her opinion, a complaint that Snapchat has left largely unanswered.
The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and refers to its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to discuss the cultural backgrounds of its employees, but according to a spokesman, the company recently hired a human resources manager who focuses on underrepresented groups and internal integration efforts.
For her part, Zhu said she will keep her Snapchat account closed, adding, "I wonder if they need more users like us to say that's not OK."
Military leaders falsified ISIS intelligence, Congressional committee finds
Military officials from the United States Central Command altered intelligence to paint a more optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than actual conditions on the ground would have allowed, a congressional committee of inquiry said in a report on Thursday.
The preliminary report, prepared by a task force of Republican members of the Armed Services Committee, Intelligence Committee, and the Defense Budget Committee, reported deep dissatisfaction among Central Command intelligence analysts who reported how superiors were changing their assessments of America's efforts to fight the Islamic State.
Central Command, or Cencom for short, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which oversees American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"Intelligence that was typically nodded off by senior Centcom commanders regularly painted a more positive picture of America's counter-terrorism efforts than actual conditions on the ground would have permitted, and was consistently more positive than analysis by other intelligence agencies," a newspaper article quoted the report as saying.
"What happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analysis is presented to our political leaders," said Ken Calvert, a Republican member of the House of Representatives.
The leadership failures at Centcom extend to the very top of the organisation.
The 10-page report details persistent problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts to train Iraqi forces.
While it provides no direct evidence that Obama administration leaders have given instructions to alter the reports, it shows how analysts have faced pressure from their superiors to paint a more optimistic picture of the threat posed by the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
"During the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and testimony to Congress were significantly more positive than is true," the report noted.
For example, a Centcom official announced publicly that a military recapture of Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, remains under Islamic State control.
"After months of investigation, this much is clear," Mike Pompeo, a Republican congressman from Kansas, said in a statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, Central Command leaders altered intelligence reports to downplay the threat posed by ISIS in Iraq.
Republicans created the task force after it was leaked that analysts were concerned about the manipulation of Islamic State reports.
The report, released on Thursday, will be completed with more detailed findings as the investigation continues.
In addition, further investigations of Centcom reports by the Department of Defense inspector general are ongoing.
Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee released their own findings on Thursday that agreed with some of the conclusions of the Republican task force.
"In 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an overly constrained process for producing intelligence assessments on ISIL and the Iraqi security services," the committee's top Democrat, House member Adam B. Schiff, said in a statement.
That process, Mr. Schiff said, "delayed the release of intelligence reports," damaged morale among analysts and "left unduly little room for dissent."
But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats said they found no evidence of White House interference with Centcom analysts regarding a "particular political opinion."
The preliminary results of the congressional investigation were released Tuesday by The Daily Beast.
Last August, the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon's inspector general, which was launched after complaints from Centcom analysts.
Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that the Defense Department would not comment on congressional reports while the inspector general's investigation was ongoing.
But he also noted that "experts sometimes have very divergent opinions on the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence community and the Department of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important national defense issues."
The investigation has repercussions beyond the question of a successful American-led air campaign in Iraq and Syria (a claim now being made by a growing number of Defense Department officials).
Last year's allegations, however, have raised questions about the extent to which President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, and other crisis regions.
Criticism of classified information about the Islamic State is reminiscent of more than a decade ago, when a Centcom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote about how, against the advice of many analysts, the then-George W. Bush administration envisaged only a small occupation force in Iraq and spent little time worrying about the aftermath of the 2003 invasion.
Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the uprising against current Islamic State coverage.
Last year, according to government officials, Mr. Hooker's team concluded that, contrary to what the government had said, airstrikes against Islamic State-held refineries would not have a significant impact on the terrorist group's financial position, as they would have used makeshift refineries to sell oil on the black market.
That finding, however, was not made public, The Times reported in September.
Centcom's then-commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by lawmakers for his overly positive assessment of the war situation at a Senate hearing.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced at Central Command by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.
USA win fourth match in women's field hockey, with showdown with Great Britain looming
A day after scoring three goals during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also scored the first two goals for the U.S. women's field hockey team in a match Thursday against India that the Americans won 3-0.
Five goals in two games was supposed to be a memorable performance, but Bam, 27, said she could not remember ever having done so.
"I have no idea," she said.
I'm not one of those people who remembers their goals.
But she knows this: the Americans are 4-0 in Olympic competition and are tied in first place in their group with the British, who remain unbeaten after their 2-0 win over Japan.
Great Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final match of the first round.
Both teams have already qualified for the quarter-finals, and the game will decide which of the two teams will finish first and second in their group of six.
The first place finisher will stay out of the way of the strong Dutch women, who lead the other group.
Whatever the outcome of Saturday's match, the American's success story has caused a surprising stir, four years after she finished last of 12 places at the previous London Games.
Bam was part of that team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had her first hockey stick at the age of three (her two older sisters played the sport at Drexel University), and at the age of 16 she became the youngest U.S. national player in the team's history.
She missed the 2008 Olympics because she failed to qualify for the squad.
Then came 2012, when it all went wrong for her and her team.
The following year Craig Parnham, an Englishman, became coach of the national team and things began to change for the better.
"A culture change, a mental change and a physical change," Bam said.
We didn't have the workload in London that we have now.
We were able to completely change the rudder.
On Thursday night, Bam opened the scoring in the first half with a backhand strike from close range.
India had gone into the game without a win in the tournament, but the team proved surprisingly tough, holding the score at 1-0 until the third quarter, when Bam took the game into his own hands.
She sprinted with the flat ball down the left flank, then moved to the middle and scooped the ball into goal to give the Americans a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez scored the final goal midway through the final quarter.
The shutout was the first of the tournament for the U.S. goaltender, Jackie Briggs, who had allowed one goal in each of the previous games.
She's got a run.
Just like Bam.
"We're in a good position," Parnham said, but how good will depend on the outcome of Saturday's next game.
Amid the Rage of the Olympics, the Zen of Trampoline
Wherever you are, however late it is, it is the Olympics.
The events in Rio de Janeiro feel constant and inescapable, a frantic relay between competition and aspiration.
It is as if the Olympic torch itself were a burning baton, passed from crossbowman to swimmer to gymnast to triathlete.
You can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor talk in the coffee shop queue without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the argument between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, entering the Olympics for the first time and a swarm of women with dimples, could easily have been one of those household names broadcast in prime time, built up through sponsors and feel-good TV commercials, if he were a swimmer, gymnast or even fencer.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is competing for gold in Olympic trampoline gymnastics.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event the same way.
Further from the centre, partly in the shade, are the non-universally recognised sports: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
We will always have the breaststroke and long may it reign.
But if I may modestly make the case for my particular favourite, let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.
Although trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it made its debut in Sydney, it has been so poorly perceived for the last 16 years that many of those I interviewed did not know it was an Olympic sport at all.
This could also be regional ignorance.
Although the United States sent athletes to compete, it has never won a medal in trampoline jumping, and until 2012 had one athlete who made it to the final round.
The Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians the prices for the women.
Dong Dong of China and Rosie MacLennan of Canada will defend their gold medals from London this year.
Trampoline jumping has a certain outsider charm, partly because to the unenlightened ear it sounds more appropriate for a clown school than for the Olympic Games.
At this point, I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a down-to-earth enthusiast.
It has humorous potential - the cartoonish tremor of its never-ending impact - but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, the two sports that essentially unite it.
The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means "springboard."
Aspiring winners jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot up to 30 feet in the air and have to perform a series of falling movements (spins, pike and somersaults) before landing on their feet.
According to the official Olympic programme, they are evaluated according to their execution, degree of difficulty and "flight time."
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio.
The most common Olympic vector is straight.
Medal hopefuls must go further, faster, up and over in their pursuit of gold, sometimes to the finish, sometimes back and forth, up and down the playground.
They are not only chasing the finish line or the exit wall, but also another mocking target on television: the world or Olympic record.
The single-minded pursuit is noble, admirable, even fanatical - and it is enough to move even a spectator to tears.
But it's also what I find a little tiring, even watching these games.
The trampoline offers a reprieve from this.
The vector of the trampoline jumper is above.
Moving forward is not the goal.
He or she bounces off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, going up, then down, then back up effortlessly.
Here, too, there is competition, not without difficulty, of course, but during the exercise there is no frantic attack on the target, no arching into the distance, only the dreamy, elegant suspension of time and gravity.
It's as Zen as competing in the Olympics can be.
The women's qualifying and final will take place on Friday afternoon, streaming at 1pm Eastern Time; the men's final on Saturday, also at 1pm.
NBC will air the finals as part of an afternoon block on both days starting at 2 p.m.
Amid the Olympic mania, they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is likely to be overlooked in the general uproar.
If raising awareness can only be achieved by gasping and objectifying male athletes - as male US gymnasts recently suggested, according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr Dooley can expect his new fan base to be gasping for air.
"A Generation Protests" in Ethiopia, Long a U.S. Ally
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators calling for political change in Ethiopia met with violent opposition from the government.
Witnesses say dozens of protesters were killed in gun battles during clashes with police.
Is Ethiopia about to collapse?
For the past decade, it has been one of Africa's most stable countries, a solid Western ally with a fast-growing economy.
But in recent months, anti-government protests have rocked the country and spread to more and more areas.
Last week, thousands of people took to the streets demanding fundamental political change.
The government's response was ruthless, according to human rights groups.
Witnesses said police shot and killed dozens of unarmed protesters.
Videos circulating of the protests, believed to be from last year or early this year, show security guards beating young people with sticks as they were forced to do a handstand against a wall.
The head of the UN human rights agency is now calling for a thorough investigation.
"It has always been difficult to hold this country together, and it will be even harder in the future," said Rashid Abdi, the Horn of Africa project manager for the International Crisis Group, a research group.
After Nigeria, Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is valued by the West.
American military and intelligence agencies are working closely with the Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats beyond the region, especially in Somalia. Few countries in Africa, if any, receive as much Western aid.
Ethiopia's economy expanded at a remarkable pace.
Its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new commuter train in the capital, Addis Ababa.
The streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
While Ethiopia has been far from a model of democracy - human rights organizations have consistently cited government repression - the country's opposition has been curtailed, effectively silencing dissidents.
Many were sent into exile or prison, killed or driven into the wilderness.
But that could change.
"If you oppress people and they have no other options but to protest, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopia.
All the youth are protesting.
A generation protests.
There are numerous complaints covering everything from land use to a stranglehold on the ruling coalition's power.
After a widely criticized election last year, the ruling party and its allies won the opposition's last seat and now control 100 percent of parliament.
At the same time, tensions are rising along the border with Eritrea; a battle over the jagged, disputed line claimed hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, which have been more or less defeated in recent years, could take advantage of the turmoil and rearm.
Several factors explain why, after years of simmering beneath the surface, feelings of resentment are now exploding.
The first seems innocuous: smartphones.
Only in recent years have many Ethiopians been able to communicate through social media, as cheaper smartphones have become more common and Internet services have improved.
Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, as it does periodically, especially during protests, many people can still communicate through Internet proxies that hide where they are.
Several young Ethiopians said they gathered to protest.
The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.
For eons, the Amharas, who hail from Ethopia's predominantly Christian highlands, have prospered in politics and economics while exploiting the Oromos, many of whom are Muslim and live in lowland areas.
But that, too, is changing.
"We are coordinating under one umbrella," said Mulatu Gemechu, an Oromos leader.
The largest protests took place in areas of Amhara and Oromos.
Many Amharas and Oromos feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the Tigray ethnic group, who make up about 6% of the population and are dominant in the military, intelligence, commerce, and politics.
The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Mr Meles, a former rebel leader, was Ethiopia's prime minister for 17 years until his death from an undisclosed illness in 2012.
He was regarded as a tactical genius, a man who could think around corners.
Analysts say he was particularly adept at spotting early signs of dissatisfaction and using special envoys to process opponents and neutralize them.
"The current regime lacks that basic skill," said Mr. Abdi, a conflict analyst.
Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen to replace Mr Meles for relatively obscure reasons.
Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say he does not enjoy the trust of the Tigris-controlled security services.
Many fear the result will be more bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such turmoil was in 2005, when thousands protested against elections that analysts said appeared to have been botched by the government and subsequently stolen.
During the ensuing raids, many protesters were killed, though fewer than in recent months, and this period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, and for measurable progress in poverty reduction.
But obviously this has not prevented the intensification of the Ethiopian government's internal resentment.
And it is taking on a dangerous ethnic shape.
Last month, protesters attacked shops run by Tigray in Gondar, an Amharic city, and hatred of the Tigray is becoming increasingly common on social media.
Analysts say the protests put the U.S. and other Western allies in a strange position.
The American government used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights over neighboring Somalia, although it recently announced that it had closed that base.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it does not want its ally to collapse in an already volatile region.
"This," Mr. Abdi said, "is a very thin line."
Donald Trump says his claim Obama founded ISIS was' sarcasm'
Donald J. Trump sought on Friday to dispel the latest controversy surrounding his campaign by saying his repeated claims that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the Islamic State terror group were not serious.
The clarification raised new questions about the Republican presidential candidate's communication skills, including whether he is capable of communicating clearly and intelligibly with the American public.
It also puts his comrades-in-arms, who are trying to protect him during an eventful period, in the peculiar position of having to explain statements that he might not have meant at all.
After making the suggestion at a campaign rally Wednesday night, Mr. Trump rowed back on Thursday's claim, insisting in interviews that he had no intention of suggesting that the president and Mrs. Clinton created ISIS.
But in an early morning tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was simply being sarcastic.
The tweet was in contrast to the previous day, when Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews that he meant the allegation entirely seriously.
When conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt tried to help Mr. Trump soften the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate wanted nothing to do with it.
The latest storm of criticism is pouring down on Mr. Trump as he tries to shift his campaign's focus to the economy because of falling poll numbers.
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton gave speeches on the economy in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Mr. Trump tried to return to the issue.
Posting on Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring.
Mr. Trump has already offered sarcasm in his defense.
He drew heavy criticism in late July when he said the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but later said, "Of course I meant that sarcastically."
This method allows Mr. Trump to push the boundaries of language in politics and then row back as needed.
"I think it's one of his methods of testing how certain messages are received by his fans, how they're received, and then, if necessary," clarifying "depending on how the reaction turns out," said Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who monitors the language of both candidates.
But I also think he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.
Instead of softening the tone for the presidential election, Mr. Trump has adopted an even more caustic tone as his poll numbers have continued to decline.
A new NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist poll released Friday showed a wide lead in the states of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.
While Mr. Trump generally tries not to apologize for his provocative remarks, he often accuses his critics of distorting his statements or misunderstanding his humor.
But while he is increasingly the focus of attention in the final months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump's jokes have put his loyal supporters in the uncomfortable position of having to stand by him, no matter how provocative his statements may be.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York and one of Trump's most prominent advocates, went to great lengths to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview on Thursday.
"I think what he's saying is legitimate political commentary," Mr. Giuliani said when asked about the veracity of Mr. Trump's statements about whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton founded the Islamic State.
It is true, in that sense, that before Obama, ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called them backbenchers, completely false, and it was because he was pulling troops out of Iraq.
Most mainstream Republicans try to argue that the Obama administration, in which Mrs. Clinton served as secretary of state, allowed ISIS to spread by failing to aggressively control the situation in the Middle East.
Ahead of campaign rallies in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media, accusing them of riding roughshod over his every word and of being biased against him.
He taunted the "poor, pathetic" TV pundits trying to understand him, saying, "You can't!"
Some Democrats scoffed at Mr. Trump's apology as just further proof that he was unfit to be president.
Once driven out of the market by price, cafe in Greenpoint returns
Verb Cafe was a shabby cafe in Williamsburg, where you could only pay in cash, didn't have Wi-Fi, but served good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, prices have driven it out of its Bedford Avenue store front.
Soap Cherie, which Verb replaced in the summer of 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.
Locals mourned it as the last loss in a gentrifying city.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know New York is changing, but I still can't believe CBGB is dead, except the Chelsea Hotel and Verb is now a soap store."
But if New York is change, it is also reinvention.
A revived Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similarly unpretentious atmosphere.
The coffee is also still good.
The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the old cafe, who is the owner and managing director of the new cafe.
He started working at Verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end.
When a customer offered to provide funds for a new field office, he was excited to do it, he said.
Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot of things under wraps.
Verb uses the same distributor for the bagels bought the same espresso machine model.
It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.
But Rodriguez said he also wanted to experiment.
He introduced new ingredients.
The menu includes bacon and cheese sandwiches and toppings such as capers and sautéed onions.
There are natural rice bowls.
The café no longer serves beer, but fresh juices are available.
After nine months, Rodriguez said he noticed a steady stream of old regulars.
"A lot of old customers have also been pushed out of Williamsburg by prices," he said.
On a recent Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was one such customer.
Oliveira, 34, used to live in Williamsburg and attended the school regularly.
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she would walk the walk.
After the verb closed, she gave up drinking coffee for a while, she said.
"I realised it was because of the coffee and the culture in the verb that I liked," she said.
Now she drinks coffee again, even though she ordered blended chai tea that day instead of her usual iced coffee, which is another new addition.
Tom Rosenthal is since the beginning of the verb in 2003 another long-standing and loyal customer.
He would go there before work and invariably order the same thing.
"I came in at seven, every day, like a Swiss pocket watch, and they made my bagel with butter," he said.
Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu.
These days, Rosenthal still gets his usual order, but sometimes he alternates his Everything bagel with bacon, egg and cheese.
Rodriguez said he held no grudge against the soap store taking over the old business premises.
In fact, the owners of the soap offered to make Cherie a special soap for Verb with the cafe's cold-brewed coffee as an ingredient.
"I think we're going to respond to their offer," Rodriguez said.
And the traditional Polish inhabitants of Greenpoint have also accepted the café.
A new customer has translated the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez said he plans to issue it soon so his new neighbors feel welcome.
The location also has other advantages.
A local juice shop wants to bottle and sell the cold-brewed coffee.
There is a chance that the café will expand to an adjacent building.
For many customers, a new verb is enough to get their old favorites.
Joseph Witt, a regular customer, said he was devastated when the cafe closed.
When the new cafe opened, Whitt said that entering the eatery and ordering a new coffee felt like a homecoming.
"I had to smell it," he said.
The depressing food of the economic crisis in "an abundant meal"
In March 1933, shortly after becoming president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt had lunch in the Oval Office.
As a foodie, President Roosevelt had a penchant for Fifth Avenue delicacies such as pâte de foie gras and Maryland turtle soup.
His menu that day was more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and a plum pudding for dessert.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added, "It was also a message to Americans about how to eat."
The couple live in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.
Coe's last book, "Chop Suey," was about Chinese cuisine in the United States, while Ziegelman's book, "97 Orchard," about life in a Lower East Side apartment building, tells the story from a food perspective.
Her latest collaboration, "A Decent Meal," to be published Tuesday by Harper's, chronicles the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.
They showed culinary solidarity when they met with a reporter for dinner at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a small, no-frills takeaway in the Flatiron District that has been in business since the stock market crash of 1929.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a cream cheese sandwich with pieces of olive, while Coe, 57, ate turkey with mashed potatoes and vegetable mixture.
When the reporter ordered meatloaf, the couple found it suitable for a discussion about food in the era of the Great Depression.
"Rich foods were very popular," Ziegelman said.
There was peanut bread, liver cheese and bean bread.
They were made from one ingredient and something cheap that stretches the ingredient.
Imagine eating so many peanuts that they serve as dinner.
Coe grinned.
"It must have settled in my stomach like lead," he said.
In the years before the Great Depression, the table in an American household, especially in rural areas, was an all-you-can-eat buffet.
Teams of women cooked for male field workers and freshly baked pies were served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during World War I. "A Square Meal" chronicles the ways in which the country coped with no longer being the land of larvae.
"It was a time when food became a central, tense issue for Americans," Coe said, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
The new budget diet was just as fraught: Mysterious foods like breads and casseroles became staples, and the casserole dish was a "wonderful way to recycle leftovers," Ziegelman noted, because chefs could hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy sauce.
Fresh fruit has been replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
Meat, which for years was the center of American cuisine, has become a rarely served luxury.
Strange mixtures were tried, as calorific and nutritious satisfaction took precedence over taste or even common sense.
During her research for the book, which also includes recipes, Ziegelman prepared a dish from that era, baked onions with peanut butter.
"It wasn't a popular addition at lunchtime," says Coe.
Ziegelmann continued: 'It was surreal.'
Peanut butter and baked onions don't match.
It was typical of many of the household recipes.
Household economists - including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - drove the country's eating habits like never before or since.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "household policymakers" and rise to the challenge of turning pimps into delicious meals, like creamy spaghetti with carrots.
"A Square Meal" is a feast of historical delicacies.
Particularly palatable are the accounts of the government's response to starving citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's let-me-eat-cake attitude.
While publicly praising the simple Iowa farmhouse cuisine of his kitchen, he dined like the multi-millionaire man of the world he has become.
"He liked continental cuisine like fish with cucumber sauce," Coe said.
He ate in an almost gilded dining room and wore a tuxedo.
He was gloriously out of touch.
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, had not asked him to set an example with his stomach.
As described in the book, Mrs. Roosevelt's hiring of a housekeeper with no interest in flavors resulted in the White House producing the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most desolate. "
Many of the Great Depression-era ways of dealing with food were discarded as soon as the country got back on its feet.
The legacy lies in our continued focus on calories and food, Ziegelman said, as well as how science has been applied to food.
When writing the book, the couple said they had a better understanding of Ziegelman's mother-in-law's eating habits - such as how she couldn't throw away food.
"She had a real fear of food waste," Coe said.
Ziegelman recalled, "It actually made people sick."
There was the windbag incident.
After the plates were cleared at Eisenberg's, she and Coe pulled out a dessert they had prepared at home: the plum dessert that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
"It's called Prune Whip," Ziegelman said, adding that giving humble recipes a fancy name was a common trick.
There was no whipped cream, just prunes, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone reluctantly dipped a spoon into the tough brown mica.
Amazingly, it didn't taste bad.
Coe won three golds.
Like a can-do budgeter, he told his wife, "A few chopped walnuts would help."
Killed in Bomb Attack: He Was Aleppo's Hero
He risked his own life to help others: Khaled Omar.
He was the hero of Aleppo: Khaled Omar dedicated his life to the people of Syria.
He risked everything to save the lives of others.
Now the 30-year-old has himself died in a barrel bomb attack by the Assad regime.
Omar was a member of the White Helmets, a civil defence group which, according to Bild newspaper, has so far saved the lives of almost 60,000 people.
2900 volunteers are risking their own lives to pull people out of bombed-out homes and provide first aid in the war zone.
They are the heroes of the war in Syria.
Omar was the face of the group: in 2014, a video of him rescuing an infant from the rubble of a house went viral.
It made the Syrian a shining symbolic figure in the horror of war.
However, he never saw himself as a hero, saying, according to Bild: 'For me, this is the real jihad.'
"When I die saving lives, I think that God sees in me a martyr."
Shortly before Omar himself was killed in an attack, he had spoken in a video about the latest bombings in Syria.
The helicopters dropped four barrel bombs over Alzadia district, one of which was filled with chlorine gas.
A woman and two children died and seven people are suffering from shortness of breath.
"We are now removing the toxic remnants of the bomb so that children do not play with it," Bild quotes his last words before he died.
The Assad regime's deadly bomb was intended to hit terrorists.
Greenland shark: The oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old
Rare sight.
Greenland sharks usually only come to the surface in winter.
This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the research vessel Sanna.
He was born in 1624 and swims with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.
Greenland sharks don't produce offspring until they are 150 years old.
The Greenland shark swims leisurely along the bottom of the North Atlantic, reaching an average distance of 1,220 metres in an hour.
Only when it matters, the five-metre-long animal accelerates to a whopping 2.6 km / h - and at this top speed is half as fast as a seal.
However, this slowness of life seems to be a silver bullet for old age.
Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal Science about a Greenland shark that could be 392 years old.
"Madness," says Alexander Scheuerlein from the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock, commenting on this lifespan, which represents a world record for vertebrates.
The evolutionary biologist has long suspected that Greenland sharks are getting rock-old.
The only thing missing was the evidence.
Greenland sharks are difficult to observe, as they live mainly in the Arctic Ocean off the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitsbergen.
Because they prefer water temperatures of around six degrees Celsius, they usually only appear on the surface in winter.
Accordingly, researchers know little about the lifestyles of Greenland sharks.
They measured their slow motion speed when they equipped six animals with a transmitter off Svalbard.
These sharks still prey: Researchers found the remains of a seal in an animal's stomach, while another had swallowed the jaw bone of a young polar bear.
Possibly they hunt sleeping animals or patrol at the bottom of the ice-sea and look for carcasses, that stagger down from higher water-layers.
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues studied 28 Greenland sharks caught by fishermen from the depths of the North Atlantic off Greenland or Svalbard between 2010 and 2013.
The smallest shark was just 81 centimetres long, while the largest measured 502 centimetres.
To determine the age of the sharks, they used the carbon-14 method to analyze the lens core of the sharks.
This center of the eye lens arises even before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained therein are not renewed later.
The two smallest sharks had remarkably high levels of carbon-14 in the lens core.
They were therefore born after the early 1960 "s, when nuclear weapons tests dumped large quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.
In contrast, the lens core of the third smallest animal, 220 centimetres long, contained a small surplus of carbon-14 from nuclear weapons tests, so it must have celebrated its 50th birthday when it was examined in 2012.
All larger Greenland sharks, on the other hand, had normal amounts of carbon 14 in their lens core, which is produced by cosmic rays in the atmosphere.
In fact, the carbon 14 clock showed an age of 335 years for a 493-centimetre Greenland shark, while the record-breaking shark, at 502 centimetres, is likely to be 392 years old.
It was known that female Greenland sharks only produce offspring when they are longer than four metres.
The researchers were now able to assign an age to the length.
Since one of the animals, measuring 392 centimetres, was probably on the threshold of sexual maturity and its age was determined at 156 years, Greenland sharks apparently take at least a century and a half to reproduce.
That, too, is likely to be a world record for vertebrates at the moment.
That such methusalems live primarily in icy waters is no coincidence.
The previous record holder, a 211-year-old Greenland whale with a 120-year-old harpoon tip stuck in its neck, was also caught off Alaska.
Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often runs on a low flame.
They mature later - and age more slowly.
In order to keep themselves warm in cold water, the animals often grow particularly large.
This is because the volume grows much faster than its surface, through which the animal loses heat.
The heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much greater than that of one gram of elephant.
Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.
"A smaller animal lives more dangerously and should concentrate on having as many offspring as possible as early as possible," explains Scheuerlein, an evolutionary biologist.
A very large animal, on the other hand, should invest its resources in a long life.
Building plot in a double pack
In the most recent meeting, the local council focused on topics relating to construction.
With relief the committee took up the communication of mayor Robert Putz that "finally the marketing of the recently designated residential building areas can begin."
After the land, parcelling and development issues have been resolved and applications for surveying have been made, nothing stands in the way of the sale of the properties in the residential areas "Straßlweg" and "Schönau-West" (Binderstraße area - extension section 1) to interested parties.
The municipal council is convinced that the building sites in the rural and quiet residential community of Schönau appeal to young families and feisty seniors alike.
As it was said, prospective builders can now report to the town hall, and the allocation of the plots is expected to be discussed by the local council at its September meeting.
In order to be able to respond to requests for further commercial establishments to be established in connection with the creation of jobs, the local council decided to amend the land use plan, which was only newly drawn up in spring this year, in some areas.
In the Unterzeitlarn area, for example, the business park already designated there will be expanded by two plots in the direction of the state road 2112.
Frankfurt benefits from Brexit
In competition with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg, the city on the Main therefore has the best chance of attracting jobs and companies relocated from London.
"It is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Brexit vote," says Michael Voigtländer, Head of the IW's Financial Markets and Real Estate Department.
After the Brexit referendum, it is uncertain whether financial firms will be allowed to continue to operate from London throughout the EU.
For the so-called EU passport, registration in the UK has so far been sufficient.
Major US banks are taking advantage of this.
Several banks have already announced plans to relocate jobs.
The lobby group "Frankfurt Main Finance" expects to create 10,000 new jobs on the River Main within five years.
According to the IW, Frankfurt is the seat of the European Central Bank (ECB), which combines responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the eurozone, as well as other important authorities such as the European Insurance Supervisory Authority (EIOPA) and the Risk Council (ESRB).
Although the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has its headquarters in Paris, it is less important to the financial sector than the ECB.
"Proximity to the central bank is important for banks, as it enables them to communicate directly with the supervisor," says IW Professor Voigtländer.
Luxembourg is home to a large fund industry, but, like Dublin, it performs worse on infrastructure.
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the large airport.
The city also has easily available commercial real estate.
"In Paris, it is not so easy to find free, high-quality offices," says Voigtländer.
In addition, rents for first-class commercial properties on the Seine are 50 percent higher than on the Main.
In addition, Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than its competitors thanks to good medical care and infrastructure, as well as less crime.
According to a ranking by management consultancy Mercer, the city ranks seventh, Luxembourg 19th, Dublin 33rd and Paris 37th.
Even if quality of life is a question of preference: "With its already strong position as a financial location for the European domestic market, Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors," concludes the IW.
Despite the Brexit vote, however, London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe, according to the economic researchers.
According to figures from Landesbank Helaba, around 144,000 people worked in the banking sector in London at the end of 2015, compared with 62,500 in Frankfurt.
Gilead Receives Legal Costs from Hepatitis C Patent Dispute with Merck
A U.S. district judge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to reimbursement of legal costs incurred in its hepatitis C litigation with the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was relieved of $200 million in damages for infringing two Merck patents related to Gilead's blockbuster drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni after a US judge uncovered a pattern of misconduct by Merck, including perjury and other unethical conduct.
In filing the suit on Thursday, U.S. District Judge Beth Labson Freeman said Gilead is entitled to relief from costs incurred while defending the case.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, which dominates the market for a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure more than 90 percent of patients with the liver disease.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other claiming ownership of laboratory work involving sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in Gilead's drugs.
US-backed forces say they have retaken full control of Manbij from Islamic State
US-backed forces have retaken full control of the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last IS fighters in the city left it, a spokesman for the group said on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (DKS) are currently combing the city following the departure of the remaining group of fighters who have been buried inside the city.
They have freed more than 2,000 civilians held hostage by the militants, Sharfan Darwish of the Manbij military council, which is allied with the DKS, told Reuters.
"The city is now under complete control, but we are cleaning up," he told Reuters.
Clintons earn 10.75 million in 2015 and pay 34.2% federal tax
Hillary Clinton released her 2015 tax return on Friday, which showed the Democratic presidential nominee and her husband had an income of $10.75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 34.2%.
In 2015, the Clintons gave $1 million to charity, mostly to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton earned nearly $5.3 million in speaking fees; the former secretary of state reported an income of $3 million from publisher Simon & Schuster for her book about her tenure at the State Department.
Clinton's vice presidential nominee, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, released his tax returns from the past decade with his wife, Anne Holton.
They paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3% in 2015.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set standards for financial transparency," Clinton campaign aide Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
In stark contrast, Donald Trump is hiding behind false excuses and backtracking on his past promises to release his tax returns.
It is common for US presidential candidates to release their tax returns, even though they are not required by law to do so.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have cited a tax audit by the tax authorities as the reason for his refusal.
"The ball is in your court," Clinton campaign aide Ian Sams wrote on Twitter, referring to the release of the Democratic presidential nominee.
On Thursday, Michael Cohen, Trump's special counsel, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to release anything until the tax audits are complete.
Trump's critics, including 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, have already said that his refusal raises questions about his wealth, charitable donations, business dealings, and various other ties, particularly with Russia.
Clinton has already pounced on the issue, releasing a video online on Friday in which senior Republicans call on Trump to release his tax return.
She also raised the issue during a speech on the economy in Michigan on Thursday.
"He refuses to do what every other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and release his tax returns," she told the crowd.
Politico reported that Trump paid little or no tax for two years during the 1990s, and a New York Times business journalist on Friday quoted a number of tax lawyers and accountants saying that could still be the case.
Federal taxes have become an issue on the campaign trail.
Clinton supports a scheme named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett that would ensure that people earning more than $1 million pay a tax rate of at least 30%.
President Obama also supports the proposal.
During a campaign rally for Hillary Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway industrial conglomerate is based here, called on Trump to meet to exchange their tax returns.
Buffett said he had also been subjected to an IRS tax audit and that Trump was "afraid" of voters, not the tax authorities.
Clinton's campaign has released tax returns dating back to 2007.
The Clintons, who now live in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average effective federal tax rate of about 32% between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 40.5%.
The Clintons' 2015 tax return showed they earned only $100 of their income, unlike the majority of Americans.
Their main investment was a low-cost index fund, from which the Clintons taxed dividends and income of $109,000.

Condoms with chili powder, firecrackers promote Tanzania's elephant conservation
Conservationists in Tanzania are using an unorthodox way to stop elephants from going to human settlements - throwing condoms filled with chili powder at them.
The method has proved effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which came up with the idea years ago, has stepped up its promotion with the U.S. Conservation Service, training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a nonviolent four-step method to protect their homes and crops without harming animals.
Previously, many used spears to defend themselves.
Friday is World Phone Day, which is dedicated to animal welfare.
"Since we developed the... toolkit, we have seen a shift in attitudes within these communities, where they are much more confident that they can keep elephants out of their fields without harming elephants," Honeyguide CEO Damian Bell said in a statement.
The first two steps include lighting the elephant with a torch and blowing a horn.
If he is not deterred, a so-called "chili cloud" is thrown.
Chilli powder mixed with soil is packed together with a firecracker into a condom, the end of which is closed to the fuse.
When lit, the condom bursts open with a bang and sprays fine dust of chilli powder into the air.
A whiff quite usually already out to chase away the elephant.
A last option is a launcher that blasts gold rain fireworks into the air, causing a loud, bright explosion.
City Council decides unanimously: No new kiosk on the banks of the Rhine in St. Goarer
Usually the St. Goarer accept investment projects from traders with a kiss of the hand - especially the retail trade in the core city is considered to be clearly expandable.
However, the city council unanimously rejected the application to build a new sales kiosk on the banks of the Rhine in the immediate vicinity of the Rhine balcony currently under construction.
"In principle, we welcome new traders, but at this location in an exposed location on the banks of the Rhine, this kiosk does not fit," explained Michael Hubrath for the CDU parliamentary group.
Jewish director smashes Berlin hotel because Israeli code was removed after "Arab" request - RT News
A French director with Jewish roots sparked a media uproar after revealing that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not list an Israeli code because Arab guests had "requested" it, according to a staff member.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentary "Shoah," vented his anger at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his last stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the hotel's shortlist of countries.
However, the country was not listed among the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible that Israel was eliminated and erased in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany?
Lanzmann wrote.
Instead, the Kempinksi Bristol offers a way to dial Israel through its own call center.
Seeking an explanation, the director turned to the hotel reception.
The response he received there "shocked him," Lanzmann wrote.
The hotel employee said the move was a "deliberate decision by Kempinski Hotels management."
The reason behind this caused even more anger in the director.
"The majority of our guests are Arabs and they demanded that the area code be deleted," the employee of Lanzmann was quoted as saying.
Israeli Ambassador to Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called it a "great shame," reports the Süddeutsche Zeitung.
We were shocked and dismayed by this event.
It really is very shameful.
The fact that this has happened in Germany in this very hotel chain is an even greater disgrace.
That needs no explanation.
We expect the hotel to "draw the right conclusions," the official said.
The incident sparked quite a response on the internet, with people calling the whole thing a scandal.
Some suggested the Kempinski Hotel had "caved in" to the alleged demands of Arab guests.
"Shame on you," said another post, pointing out that the hotel, which is located on the noble Kurfürstendamm, is close to a synagogue.
The hotel quickly denied all allegations, calling the incident an "oversight" and "apologizing" to Lanzmann, Der Spiegel reported.
"There was never a direct order" not to include Israel in the quick dial list, "the Sueddeutsche Zeitung quoted a spokesman for the Kempinski Hotel as saying.
It adds that the country code has now been added.
Police use tear gas & rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students
Students clashed with police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo on Thursday as they gathered to demonstrate against the government's reforms to the public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the demonstrators.
The trouble began when police officers tried to disperse the students, leading to police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstrations to express their dismay at the plans.
Under proposals by Sao Paulo state governor Geraldo Alckmin, slightly fewer than 100 public schools will be closed, while 300,000 students will be moved to save money.
Some of the protesters were seen spraying graffiti against interim President Michel Temer on walls.
The latest protests came days after demonstrators took to the streets en masse in support of suspended President Dilma Rousseff, who was impeached by a Senate vote to remove her from office.
Trade between Russia & Iran soars 71% - RT Business
With the lifting of sanctions, trade between Moscow and Tehran grew by 70.9 percent year-on-year, according to Russia's ambassador to Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan.
Interest on the part of Russian companies in doing business in the country has grown sharply since international sanctions against Iran were lifted, the ambassador said.
Russian companies are establishing existing ties with Iran, while new firms are ready to gain access to the market.
Of course, the further development of trade is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran, "Dzhagaryan said.
He noted that trade turnover between Russia and Iran in the first five months of 2016 increased by 70.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $856 million.
In particular, Russian imports to Iran jumped by 91.5 percent to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran rose 16 percent to $158 million.
Trade was boosted by deliveries of machinery, agricultural vehicles and weapons, "the ambassador said.
Dzhagaryan expects a record number of Iranian tourists to visit Russia this year.
Last year, the Russian Mission abroad issued about 35,000 visas, mainly travel visas, to Iranian citizens.
Furthermore, Iran reached the top 20 countries in terms of the number of tourists to Russia.
You could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia from last year, will be broken, "he said.
At the same time, relatively few Russians visit Iran, something the ambassador hopes will change.
"I personally recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, which have preserved monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition," he said.
Witnesses sought: Drinks market raided in bushfire
A robbery took place on Thursday evening at the Rewe XXL beverage market on Waldbröler Gerberstraße.
Holding a firearm, three darkly dressed people, who had their faces covered, demanded cash from the employee of the beverage store and then fled first on foot and then presumably in a silver VW Golf.
Police have not said how much money was seized.
The perpetrators are said to have been between 1.60 and 1.70 meters tall, thus relatively small.
The beverage market is directly accessible from the parking deck of the Rewe-Markt and difficult to see.
After the attack, the perpetrators must have run in the direction of Gerberstraße, Friedrich-Engelbert-Weg and fled from the gravel parking lot opposite the parking garage entrance with the silver car, possibly in the direction of B 256 (Schladernring).
Anyone who made any observations in connection with the robbery at the time of the crime (around 7.45pm) is urged to contact police as a matter of urgency.
Nagold: Fun and games at summer time
The children and youths of the social pedagogical day group / social group work of the Child Protection Association Nagold spent eight beautiful and happy days with their carers on their summer holiday in Nussdorf, near Mühlacker.
During the first week of school holidays, the cheerful group was accommodated in the quietly situated Hardtwäldle leisure centre.
Several full-day excursions were on the program.
On the one hand we went to Bretten with the visit of the petting zoo.
On the other hand, to Maulbronn, where there was a special guided tour for children in the world-famous monastery.
The third excursion led to Pforzheim.
In the Celtic Museum in Hochdorf the group learned a lot about the daily life and food of the Celts.
On hot days the group enjoyed themselves at the Tiefensee in Maulbronn, which invited to jump, swim and splash.
Children and carers were spoiled with their own home-made dishes such as the Sauren Spätzle, the Seebronner Pfännle, Iselshauser-Bloff, the Englischer-Breakfast and Tübingen Bolognese.
In workshops batik was made, beautiful pieces of jewelry made of pearls and stones or a Roman mill game was made of wood.
Other highlights of the leisure time were fishing in a nearby pond, evenings by the fire and the final "Colorful Evening."
On the day of the trip home, the sun was shining and the children and teenagers returned home satisfied.
Haigerloch: Pilgrims to the Door of Mercy
The altar servers from the pastoral care unit Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were on their way on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.
Together, four stages were completed.
In order to bridge the time until the next pilgrimage of all altar servers in Rome in probably two years, the Chief Administrative Round of St. Anna has decided to prepare and carry out a pilgrimage lasting several days.
Various pilgrimage destinations were examined and a decision was finally made for the episcopal city of Freiburg, where a special pilgrimage destination was offered this year on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy, with the Door of Mercy at Freiburg Minster opened for this purpose.
16 Minis from Bittelbronn, Gruol, Haigerloch and Heiligenzimmern set off.
The evening before, Father Storost sent out the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrim crosses and imparted the pilgrim blessing.
From Horb by train to the starting point Villingen, where there is also a cathedral of Our Lady and thus the pilgrimage from the cathedral was started.
The individual day tours were framed by a short impulse with different prayers, songs and texts in the morning and evening.
But also on the way the minis stopped at field crosses, chapels or churches again and again to sing together a song from specially compiled pilgrim song booklet.
For the overnight stays parishes of the local parishes were available.
At the stage destinations, Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller provided a tasty as well as fortifying dinner and breakfast.
On the second day we continued via Furtwangen to Gütenbach.
The next day, they started the stage to St. Peter, which was the most strenuous stretch of the way, because in sweltering heat, they had to first descend about 500 metres in altitude and then climb it again.
The deserved reward was a barbecue at the swimming pond in the evenings.
After the morning impulse on the fourth day of pilgrimage in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter, we went on the final stage to Freiburg.
Visibly relieved and happy, the minis arrived at Freiburg Cathedral in the late afternoon and passed through the gate of mercy.
With a small impulse God was thanked here.
In the evening mass in the cathedral, the minis that arrived at the pilgrimage destination were welcomed by co-operative Markus Obert.
After the service, the pilgrims could visit the sacristy and the high altar.
The next day there was still time for the Breisgau metropolis.
In the afternoon we went back to Horb by train.
In the end, all participants agreed that the days were marked by spirituality and a strong community experience.
Scot Callum Skinner storms home as Brit wins cycling gold
Scotland's Callum Skinner raced to glory in the men's team sprint in the velodrome in Rio last night as the Great Britain team defended their London 2012 title.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow took on the anchor role that his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy had made his own, and the youngster made the legend proud as he stormed home to claim victory from favourites New Zealand.
England claimed a shock victory four years ago, while Hoy claimed the fifth of six Olympic golds.
They repeated the trick after finishing a modest sixth at the Track World Championships in London in March, despite Hoy's resignation.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.
They did so in time when Hindes showed up.
Hoy's retirement created a void that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Skinner was the man they stuck with when they saw potential in the Scot that has now unfolded.
Hindes, Kenny - who won with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner set an Olympic record in the qualifying rounds, but the New Zealanders won in the first round.
And the British trio won their duel for gold.
Hindes was just behind after his lap, but Kenny put the team ahead and Skinner held on.
A change in strategy was a big part of the transformation, with Hindes moving into higher gear to slow him down and allow Kenny, and especially Skinner, to keep up the pace.
Hoy watched from his position as a BBC pundit and caught the eye of Skinner, Kenny and Hindes as they climbed to the podium.
Skinner, 23, from Glasgow, said: 'It's a flattering comparison.'
I'm just here to do my best and make a name for myself.
We set an Olympic record in the final round and beat the world champions.
It was just incredible.
There is no better way to win this.
Following Kenny and Hoy's 2012 triumph, Hindes admitted he deliberately fell off the track after a poor start.
He later retracted that statement and there was no objection from England's rivals.
With such a commanding victory, there was no such problem this time.
Hindes said: 'It feels like London with all the GB flags in the stands.'
We've come together as a team over the last three months.
We came away with so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics.
This is an event, a gold medal for the nation who have won seven out of 10 titles in both Beijing and London.
If that is a barometer of our progress over the last five months, it is a successful five days in the velodrome.
With Kenny's form, it is within the realm of possibility he could repeat Hoy's victory of three Olympic gold medals in one competition.
That would mean a haul of six gold medals and one silver for Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (an apparently sacred date for British sport, on which Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were also born).
That would be the same as Hoy's.
Kenny will next compete in the sprint, which starts today and will run over three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said: 'I'm just enjoying this for the moment.'
The team event is always the best.
You can win it with your team-mates.
It feels a bit lonely to win on your own.
Hindes said: 'If he wins two more gold medals he should be knighted.'
It was the only medal contest of the day but there was more good news for England.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest time in the four-kilometre race.
They finished in 3: 51.942.
The world record, which won gold at London 2012, was 3: 51.659.
The first and final round (22.42) takes place today on the second day of the competition, with Wiggins sure to be the focus.
He had been arguing with officials before qualifying yesterday when officials called him in to measure his height.
In the women's event, which continues tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie advanced in a world record time of 4: 13.260.
Team GB are relying on their strong track cycling team to dominate the middle period of the Olympics and pick up a slew of medals.
After a truly extraordinary display of utter dominance in Beijing and London, expectations for Rio have been lowered.
Dramas have played out in the background, including the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April amid allegations of sexism and bullying, and the retirement of the likes of Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, judging by the first night of competition in the velodrome, it looks as though GB's now legendary reputation, which reached its peak at the perfect moment, could be repeated once again.
Future of Portland smelter in doubt due to energy contract cancellation
The future of the Portland aluminium smelter in Victoria - and hundreds of workers' jobs - are at stake as the plant operator terminates its energy supply contract, cancelling all supply contracts, the energy company said.
The move follows the Victoria government's decision earlier this year not to award any further subsidies to operate the plant.
A 20-year subsidy expires in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs at Alcoa's Portland plant are at risk.
As many as 2,000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk if the plant closes.
There could also be knock-on effects, as the smelter consumes about 10 per cent of Victoria's total electricity generation.
Alcoa closed the Point Henry smelter in 2014, leading to the closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
Alcoa's Portland smelter is losing money and risking closure.
The move follows years of speculation about the plant's future, initially as a result of the strong Australian dollar and most recently because of the electricity price for the plant.
AGL, which supplies the major aluminium smelter with its Loy Yang A power station in Latrobe Valley, said it expects three other owners to terminate their contracts.
The plant is majority-owned by a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, of which China's CITIC and Japan's Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares.
"AGL expects the Portland facility to continue to operate, which means further physical demand for electricity from the smelter," the company said.
AGL also said the contracts were so-called "hedging deals" that should have come into effect from November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month notice period so they will end in 2017.
"As a result, AGL expects the contracts to contribute to revenue in fiscal year 17," the electricity supplier said.
Any potential revenue impact on AGL from FY18 onwards is currently constrained by forecasts from the strong wholesale electricity futures markets.
AGL said it had already written off the value of the contracts in its annual accounts of $187 million in "anticipation of termination."
Alcoa said the decision to cancel the contracts would not affect Alcoa's "ability... to operate the smelter or provide electricity to the smelter."
The US company said it entered into a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which should have come into force from November this year, although it has yet to explain why it has withdrawn from the contract.
Analysts are warning of the possible closure of the Portland smelter in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the industry's poor economic conditions.
Referring to analysts' testimony earlier this week, Chief of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said Portland consumes about 600 megawatts of electricity annually and Tomago about 900 megawatts.
If both plants were to disappear from the market, it would mean a significant reduction in demand in the [electricity market].
And that would not be good for us as generators, "he said.
More than just a Kardashian reality TV star, Kendall is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of manager and mother of the Kardashian-Jenner clan Kris is on the cover of the coveted September issue of US Vogue.
Kendall, who is a brand ambassador for Estee Lauder and walked at fashion weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
'In a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover made me cry, 'Kendall wrote.
The unveiling of the cover was followed by a bizarre (or simply Keeping Up with the Kardashians-like?), scripted reality video showing the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (with the exception of Rob and Caitlyn, and in the presence of the most popular showbiz uncle and producer of Keeping Up, Ryan Seacrest) forgetting their sister's cover and ending with a classic twist: they have all planned a surprise party.
This is the clichéd plot of almost every birthday episode of a children's show (Seacrest delivered the line, "You thought we'd forgotten you?," with the honesty of a cartoon rabbit on an 8am slot), but Kris somehow had to let her other girls participate in the publicity.
The September issue of Vogue has certainly ushered in a new era for the Kardashians.
Kendall's big sister Kim may have beaten her for the Vogue cover (she and husband Kanye West were featured on it in April 2014), but the cover of the magazine's September issue is a league of its own.
The September issue of Vogue is the best-selling issue of the year.
With a volume that resembles a coffee table book rather than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a large number of advertisers (according to Fashionista, 615 of the 832 pages of the tome were advertisements).
The unveiling of its cover star is so eagerly awaited that images from the magazine have been leaked for the past two years even before the official announcement.
Women who have been on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have clearly been more "celebrities who model" than "models who are celebrities" on the cover.
Oscar winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga won the honor.
But even with the slim chance that Ms. Jenner - described by the magazine as the "breakthrough model" of her generation - falls into the former category, she is in good company.
These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or today's teenagers who know how to make a good Snapchat video (even if all of it applies to Jenner).
They are really talented women who excel in the entertainment industry.
Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lemonade.
Of course, not everyone likes Jenner's success.
Jenner's position in the fashion world has always been tense with her reality TV history.
In June, former Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid, calling them 'the bitches of the moment.'
Those feelings boiled over again when the news broke with Jenner appearing on the Vogue cover.
But riding roughshod over the grievance seems to be missing the point.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue.
She's a supermodel in every sense of the word.
She runs for Marc Jacobs.
She's promoting her Estee Lauder primer.
She and all her sisters sell pictures of themselves on their respective paywall apps.
She sells pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter to LOVE magazine.
And in her free time, she appears on reality TV, presumably just to see her sister Kourtney and their children.
Community centres turn away 160,000 people a year
More than 160,000 of the country's most vulnerable are turned away from community centres each year as the industry braces itself for the impact of further funding cuts on already congested operations.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly the elderly, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and those who have no funds for unfair dismissal and the like - are already turned away when they apply for free legal advice and assistance.
Community legal services, already overstretched, are bracing themselves for further cuts.
Starting in June next year, these legal centers will lose another 30 percent of their federal funding.
Queensland's director of community justice centres James Farrell said the latest survey by the National Association of Community Justice Centres found thousands of people are already turned away every year.
Farrell said the situation would only get worse without a reversal of the federal government's decision.
"Queensland's community justice centres are chronically underfunded, meaning thousands of people are being turned away from vital services they need," he said.
People who leave violent relationships, people with unmanageable and crushing debts, families going through separations, workers who have been unjustly made redundant - all these people have legal problems and this survey shows that they cannot get the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by 30 per cent from June 2017, meaning thousands of vulnerable Queensland people will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help.
We call on Attorney-General and Federal Justice Minister and Queensland Senator George Brandis to immediately reverse these funding cuts so that people can get the help they need when facing legal problems.
Last year, the state government delivered on its pledge to raise legal aid funding to the national average.
It is now time to look at the needs of community law centres and their client communities and for the Palaszczuk government to invest in this important work.
Donald Trump campaign indicted after staffer allegedly pulled gun
New York: Donald Trump's campaign has been charged with alleged inaction after it was revealed that its North Carolina campaign manager pointed a gun at a staffer while they were traveling in a Jeep in February.
The incident is described in an indictment filed Wednesday in Charlotte state court by Vincent Bordini, a former software programmer for the state's campaign.
Bordini said he waited months for the matter to be settled internally before realizing "it wasn't going to happen."
The campaign manager, Earl Philip, "pulled out a gun, put his right index finger on the trigger, and rammed the barrel into Vincent's knee," Bordini said in his indictment.
After complaining to the local and regional campaign management, Bordini determined that at least four other people had already had the same experience with Phillip, he stated in the indictment.
"Weapons don't have to be fired to cause harm," Bordini said.
The indictment comes just two days after the Republican presidential candidate sparked an uproar when he told a crowd in North Carolina that the "Second Amendment people" - gun owners and gun lovers - should take action if his rival Hillary Clinton is elected and appoints judges.
Trump's campaign made clear that the media had taken his words out of context and that he would not incite violence.
Bordi's complaint seeks damages from the campaign for breach of duty of care and from Philip for bodily harm and permanent mental harm.
Trump's press secretary Hope Hicks could not be reached for comment.
Attempts to contact Philip also failed.
WCCB, a local news station in Charlotte, reports that Phillip is no longer an employee of the campaign.
Calls to his consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services, were not answered.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has waged a controversial campaign so far.
The case is Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, Supreme Court, County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Berlin / Schwerin: Survey ahead of state elections: SPD and CDU lose
In the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania (4 September) and Berlin (18 September), significant losses are looming for the governing parties SPD and CDU.
This was the result of representative surveys conducted by the polling institute INSA for the "Bild" newspaper (Friday).
While the red-black governing coalition could continue to govern in the north, this is not possible according to the poll results in Berlin.
In both federal states, however, the SPD would be the strongest party and thus have a good chance of continuing to form the head of government.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the SPD plummeted from 35.6 percent five years ago to 24 percent.
According to the poll, the party is now just ahead of the CDU, which could come back to 23 percent.
Third place is disputed between the left and the AfD.
The Left would get 19 percent (previously 18.4 percent), the AfD would be represented in the state parliament for the first time with 19 percent.
Despite slight losses, the Greens returned to the Schwerin state parliament with 6 percent (previously 8.7 percent).
NPD and FDP would not be represented in the state parliament with 3 percent each.
According to the poll, the SPD would only gain 23 percent in the Berlin elections for the House of Representatives (2011 election: 28.3 percent).
The CDU reached only 18 percent after 23.4 percent.
This would put it behind the Greens with 19 percent (2011: 17.6 percent), but ahead of the Left with 15 percent (previously 11.7 percent).
The AfD would be represented in the House of Representatives for the first time with 14 percent.
With 5 percent, the FDP could hope for a return, but the Pirates would miss the entrance in contrast to 2011.
Nokia 9000 Communicator: The first smartphone
E-mail and the Internet in slow motion: 20 years ago the Nokia Communicator came onto the market.
Its successors now dominate the world - its manufacturer suffered a disaster.
The device weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.
It was thicker and bigger, so it didn't sit well in your hand.
On the contrary, it was pretty clunky.
The built-in memory was initially eight megabytes, which would be enough for about two high-resolution selfies today.
An iPhone now ships with at least 16 gigabytes.
The Nokia 9000 Communicator went on sale exactly 20 years ago, on 15 August 1996 - and it was the first smartphone.
For a few euros, lovers can still buy the devices on the Internet, but they somehow date back to the Stone Age of the Internet age.
Twenty years ago, however, the Communicator was a sensation.
The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product as a "pocket-sized office" a few months earlier at the Cebit computer fair in Hanover.
In fact, the new mobile phone could do a lot for the standards of the time: SMS and e-mails could be sent and received, and the communicator could also be reached by fax.
Even access to websites was possible via HTML browser, albeit painfully slow.
A calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.
There was a small antenna, and the phone could be opened like a laptop.
Then there was a small keyboard and a black-and-white screen.
Pretty proud was the price: 2700 D-Mark, about 1400 Euro.
The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany in 2015 was 392 euros.
Nobody could have guessed in August 1996 that the Communicator would be the beginning of the smartphone era.
Everything has changed since then.
The smart phones are a success story, though not for Nokia.
The mobile phone division of the Finns experienced an unprecedented disaster, was eventually sold to Microsoft and wound up.
Today, the market is dominated by providers, all of whom came much later than Nokia.
Being online anytime and anywhere is a daily routine for many people today.
In 2015, there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide.
About 1.4 billion devices were sold, of which Samsung and Apple alone account for 555 million units.
Worldwide sales of the devices amount to around 400 billion euros.
Add to that the well-run businesses of countless app providers and telecommunications companies.
In the meantime, an entire industry has emerged around smartphones.
The decisive breakthrough to the mass market came only at the beginning of 2007, when Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced the introduction of the iPhone at Mac World.
He promised three devices in one: a music player, a telephone and an Internet communicator, all easy to use via touch screen.
Apple's triumphant march began, and the iPhone is still the company's most important product today.
Nokia, Motorola and Blackberry, which dominated the market, were lagging behind.
They eventually disappeared, and Blackberry has struggled.
Apple and Asian suppliers such as Samsung now call the shots.
Twenty years after its invention, the smartphone is a matter of course.
On average, every German now looks at his mobile phone 88 times a day.
"We all have to learn to put our smartphones away," said Janina Kugel, who is responsible for human resources on the Siemens Executive Board.
Permanent accessibility has become both a curse and a blessing.
England must steer the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity not just to our local communities and across London, but across the country.
For me, that was Heathrow's biggest attraction, just as it was back in London in 2012 when we went to great lengths to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the Games.
The Olympics brought great benefits to Stratford and the East End.
And we will do that again by creating new opportunities for locals and businesses near Heathrow.
For our local communities, we will already create 10,000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs and end youth unemployment around the airport.
Just as they were ahead of us at London 2012, there will be those who think the challenge of Heathrow expansion is too great.
I have been told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will embarrass ourselves on the world stage.
The doubters were wrong in 2012 and they will be wrong again at Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers every question asked of it.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for the many, not the few.
Expansion is a way to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211bn of economic growth and leave a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and across the UK.
We have a great team at Heathrow who have implemented an £11bn infrastructure investment programme in time and budget, from T5 - voted the world's best airport terminal for five years in a row - to T2, built in the middle of the world's two busiest runways.
Now they are poised to deliver a third runway, backed by £16bn of private investment.
The London 2012 Games were a huge success for GB and I am confident the expansion of Heathrow will be one of them.
It is time we channelled that Olympic spirit and expanded Heathrow while safeguarding our future trade and creating a legacy of skills and employment of which Britain can be proud.
Lord Paul Deighton is chairman of the Heathrow board and former commercial secretary to the Treasury
Adblock Plus, Facebook in "cat-and-mouse game" over ad blocking
For companies that make money from online advertising, attempts to circumvent ad blocking amount to a "cat and mouse game," according to one of the software companies.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that it would block ads on its desktop page, Adblock Plus posted a blog post saying that users could update their filters in the program to block ads on the social network again.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that its desktop page would change the encoding of its ads to make it harder for ad blockers to detect which part of the page is advertising.
But Adblock announced that it has found a new way around the new codes.
In a blog post, Adblock spokesman Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of back-and-forth battle between the ad-blocking open source community and the bypassers has been going on since the invention of ad blockers," and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come up with a new solution.
The fact that the world's largest social media company has joined the fight is a strong indication of how worrying ad blockers have become for the industry.
Worldwide, about 200 million people use ad blockers, nearly four times as much as in 2013, according to a study last year by Pagefair and Adobe.
With 1.03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook through their mobile devices, mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of Facebook's advertising revenue.
The company is targeting ad blockers on desktop PCs because mobile ad blockers have no effect on Facebook's mobile app for the social network and Instagram, a spokesman said.
Advertising on desktop PCs accounts for a sufficiently large share of revenue for Facebook to consider such a move a worthwhile investment.
On Tuesday, Facebook said it would update its "ad preference tool" to give people more control over ads targeted at them.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblock's new filters were worrying because they would also block content on the site that is not advertising.
"This is not a positive experience for users, so we plan to address the issue," a Facebook spokesperson said in an email.
Ad blockers are a blunt tool, which is why we have instead focused on developer tools like Ad Preferences to put more control in people's hands.
Woman run over on Swiss motorway in suspected suicide
The victim was lying on the motorway in the middle of the night.
Police are appealing for witnesses after a woman was run over by several vehicles on a motorway in the early hours of Thursday in a suspected suicide.
The incident happened on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight.
A woman lay on the street in the dark "in an act of desperation" and was hit by several cars, Vaud police said.
It is clear that a Swiss woman, aged 49, who was run over by several vehicles, including a lorry, wanted to kill herself.
She died at the scene.
Several drivers have already been questioned, but some have still not been identified, said police, who are urging them and any witnesses to the incident to come forward.
An investigation has been opened, which is a "logical" step in such a situation, Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it remains to be seen whether any of the drivers will be charged.
Was a collision avoidable?
That's something that the prosecutor has to decide, "Hofstetter said.
Two similar cases in the last five years show that drivers are not held accountable.
In each of the two cases - in which a person walked on the motorway in the dark - it was decided that motorists did not need to assume that a pedestrian was walking on the motorway in the middle of the night, as the newspaper said.
Last year, a policewoman was cleared of negligent homicide after she ran over and killed a man who was lying on the A1 near Payerne one night in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had been drinking and had passed out in the street, the court heard.
The court found that the policewoman -- who had responded to an emergency call -- was driving in a justified manner and that the presence of a man in the street was a "completely extraordinary and unpredictable situation," the judge said.
Anyone with further information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should contact the police on 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was once habitable
Venus was once likely habitable, according to projections from a new NASA climate model.
Scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to discover Venus' past using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus, with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere, might have once had Earth-like conditions.
Scientists have previously suggested that Venus' slow rotation could be explained by its dense atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus may have had a thin, Earth-like atmosphere and yet continued to spin slowly.
The model also illuminated the topography of early Venus.
The planet is thought to have more arid regions than Earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to host life and protect it from rapid evaporation.
Early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent dull.
"In the GISS model simulation, the slow rotation of Venus exposes its dayside to the sun for nearly two months," GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio said in a press release.
This heats the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, acting like an umbrella to shield the surface from much of the sun's heat.
The result is average temperatures a few degrees cooler than those on Earth today.
The model produced a history of Venus that resembles the evolution previously suspected by planetary scientists.
Although it was once presumably habitable, Venus -- over several billion years -- was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light.
Their oceans evaporated and their water vapour was burnt away by ultraviolet light.
When its hydrogen escaped, all that was left was a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect -- Venus as we know it today.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns as Avalanche coach
Patrick Roy resigned Thursday as coach and vice president of hockey operations for the Colorado Avalanche, citing a lack of say in the team's decision-making process.
Colorado's alternate president / general manager Joe Sakic confirmed the decision, noting that the club will immediately look for a new coach.
"For the past three years, I have performed my duties as head coach and vice president of hockey operations of the Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination," Roy, 50, said in a statement.
I've thought long and hard over the summer about how I could improve this team to give it the depth it needs and take it to a higher level.
To achieve this, the vision of the coach and vice president of hockey operations must be perfectly aligned with that of the organization.
He must also have a say in decisions that affect the performance of the team.
These conditions are not being met at the moment.
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked him for his contributions to the team.
"Patrick informed me today about this decision," Sakic said.
We all appreciate what he has done for our organization and wish him only the best for the future.
Roy was named the league's best coach during his debut season with the Avalanches in 2013-14, winning the Jack Adams Award.
He led the club to 112 points and first place in the Central Vision, but Colorado was beaten in the first round of the playoffs by Minnesota and missed the postseason in each of the last two years.
The Avalanches posted a 39-39-4 mark in the 2015-16 season and fell five points behind the Wild for a second wild-card spot in the Western Conference.
As a Hall of Fame goalie, Roy won four Stanley Cups -- two with the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers resume talks, suspend strike
Industrial action over pay for North Sea oil workers will be suspended while all parties to the dispute sit down for a new round of talks, negotiators said.
Strikes against oilfield services provider Wood Group have been sporadic on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group and the Unite and RMT unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the winding-down process of the current dispute," a joint statement said.
We will be holding some full-day meetings over the next few weeks, starting early next year, to address the issues anew.
Unions said their latest strike, the first in more than 25 years, was a protest against possible pay cuts of up to 30 percent.
Wood Group has cut rates on its North Sea contractors by around 9 per cent this year due to negative market pressure.
The company's rate cut follows a 10 percent decline for onshore contractors in 2014.
The company said additional cuts will give the company the space it needs to get through the market downturn.
Shell, for its part, has laid off thousands of people and announced plans to wind down its oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries as it streamlines its operations as a result of its mega-merger with British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure from lower crude oil prices, an economic situation exacerbated by Britain's decision in June to leave the European Union.
Scottish MP Dave Anderson met with labour leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest industrial disputes to have taken place in the North Sea in a generation.
The North Sea is important for the regional economy, he said.
"In the North Sea and across the country, we need an economy that works for the many, not just the few," he said in a statement.
Less than $1.4 billion is expected to be spent on new projects in the North Sea in 2016, compared with an average of about $7 billion over the past five years.
Kepler measures rotation rate of stars in the Pleiades cluster
The latest mission with the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers collect the most complete catalog of rotation rates among the stars in the Pleiades star cluster.
The new data help astronomers understand why stars in the cluster rotate at different rates and how the rotation periods correlate with planet formation.
"By comparing our findings with other star clusters, we hope to learn more about the relationship between a star's mass, its age, and even the history of its solar system," Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, said in a press release.
The star cluster of the Pleiades is 445 light years from Earth.
Many stars in this cluster, formed about 125 million years ago, are now reaching adulthood.
They are spinning the fastest now.
At peak rotation rates, these maturing stars emit large amounts of stellar winds.
As these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a braking effect on the stars.
As a star ages, its rotation rate begins to slow.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by detecting the time between the appearance of a recognizable starspot -- such as sunspots.
The latest catalog of rotation rates indicates that more massive stars spin more slowly than less massive stars.
Rebull compares the stars to dancers, with larger stars spinning slower than smaller ones.
"In the" ballet "of the Pleiades, we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive, whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," Rebull said.
Because the star cluster of the Pleiades is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities such as rotation rates.
"The Pleiades cluster provides an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions, younger and older," Rebull said.
We still have a long way to go to learn more about how, when and why stars slow down their rotation rates and hang up their "dancing shoes," so to speak.
Rebull and her colleagues have written extensively in three newspaper reports about their latest analysis of the rotation rates of the Pleiades, which will soon appear in the Astronomical Journal.
Controversial baseball star resigns
The tears ran from base to base for Alex Rodriguez faster than the U.S. baseball star in his prime.
Following his emotional resignation announcement, the 41-year-old professional will wear the jersey of his New York Yankees one last time on August 12 against the Tampa Bay Rays.
'I love this game and this team, 'he said.
"I say 'goodbye' to both," the 14-time All-Star Game participant told Major League Baseball (MLB).
Rodriguez has been voted the league's most valuable player three times, winning the World Series with the Yankees in 2009.
Signing a 10-year contract has earned him $27 million annually since 2007.
Until the end of his contract on 31 December 2017, he will continue to serve as a consultant and youth coach - on full salary.
As a player, Rodriguez paid it back with performance for a long time.
He reached major milestones with 696 home runs, 3114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ("runs") for the Seattle Mariners (1994-2000), the Texas Rangers (2001-2004) and since 2005 for the Yankees.
Only two other baseball players, Hall of Fame members Hank Aaron and Willie Mays, have similar scores in key statistics.
But the 41-year-old is unlikely to be inducted into baseball's Hall of Fame.
Because as successful as Rodriguez - nicknamed "A-Rod" - has been on the field, so controversial is his demeanor off the field.
Back in 2009, the superstar admitted on "ESPN" that he had taken banned steroids between 2001 and 2003.
In August 2013, he was suspended for 211 games until the end of 2014 for his involvement in the so-called Biogenesis scandal.
Rodriguez is considered a prime suspect for receiving performance-enhancing drugs for years through an anti-aging clinic in South Florida.
Following a legal dispute, the ban was reduced to 162 matches.
"The league might even have done me a favor in 2014 because I played 20 years without a break," Rodriguez said at the time.
His farewell days are not without noise, either.
While many baseball legends return to the big stage in their final games, Rodriguez has often had to sit on the bench.
'My job doesn't involve a farewell tour. '
"My job is to try to win every game," Yankees coach Joe Girardi said.
At least Rodriguez, who was married to actress Cameron Diaz and is said to have had relationships with pop star Madonna and actress Kate Hudson, got expressions of sympathy from fans of Yankee arch-rival Boston Red Sox.
"We want A-Rod," supporters chanted during the 4-9 loss to Rodriguez's team.
Olympics 2016: Chen Xinyi, Silvia Danekova and Adrian Zielinski are first doping cases
Caught: Weightlifter Adrian Zielinski, from Poland, is banned from competing in Rio after testing positive for doping.
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games will be overshadowed by the first official doping cases.
An athlete caught cheating almost won a medal.
Ahead of the seventh day of competition, the first official doping cases of the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro have come to light.
Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 3000-metre steeplechaser Silwia Danekowa from Bulgaria and Polish weightlifter Adrian Zielinski tested positive in Brazil and were excluded - just before the start of the already critical athletics competitions, this news comes at an untimely time.
Chen was diagnosed last Sunday with the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide, which is used as a masking agent for doping substances.
The International Court of Sport (CAS) confirmed her exclusion from the Olympics on Friday afternoon local time.
The 18-year-old finished fourth in the 100m butterfly final on Sunday, missing out on a bronze medal by just 0.09secs.
Chen was due to compete in the 50m freestyle heats on Friday.
Chen has applied to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) for the opening of the B sample and a hearing.
The national federation takes the matter "very seriously and demands Chen's full cooperation in the investigation," Xinhua quoted from a statement saying: "We will cooperate with the International Sports Court (CAS) and will accept the verdict."
For the first time in history, it is no longer the IOC but CAS that is responsible for sanctioning athletes with positive cases.
News of Danekova's positive test also leaked out on the night of Rio, with the 33-year-old going on the offensive herself.
'I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive, 'she told Bulgarian TV channel BNT.
She is innocent, "the only explanation could be supplements," the athlete said.
According to the report, the banned substance is believed to be the blood doping agent EPO.
Danekova has been provisionally suspended and the B sample is also said to have tested positive, according to BNT.
Bulgaria's Prime Minister Boyko Borisov was quick to criticise the athlete.
"I do not understand why the athletes do not draw the right conclusions," he said: "We Bulgarians are under observation, so many have already been excluded."
For example, all weightlifters from the chronically doping-ridden nation will not be allowed to compete in Rio.
On Friday it was also revealed that Adrian Zielinski, the London Olympic champion in the 85kg class, had tested positive for the anabolic steroid nandrolone three days earlier, as had his brother Tomasz.
Both deny taking the drug, but both are not allowed to compete in the class up to 94 kg.
Before the start of athletics, the case of Danekova in particular is another serious blow to the reputation of the entire sport.
The world governing body, the IAAF, had banned the entire Russian team, with one exception, for systematic doping, and the runner nation of Kenya produced plenty of bad news in Rio.
In the sport of swimming, the earlier offences in China had also caused violent disputes between the athletes.
The Frenchman Camille Lacourt harshly attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang.
"Sun Yang pees purple."
"When I see the podium in the 200m freestyle, I want to throw up," Lacourt said on French radio.
Sun was also at the centre of an altercation with Australian Mack Horton.
"I have no time or respect for doping cheats," he said.
Sun tested positive for the stimulant trimetazidine at the 2014 Chinese championships but only served a three-month suspension.
Data theft: How perfidious hackers extort their ransom
Programmers of extortion malware are currently targeting companies - and succeeding in doing so.
According to a recent survey of 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany by Malwarebytes, the malware defense specialists, 40 percent of the companies surveyed have been the victims of an attack with extortion software at least once in the past twelve months, sometimes several times.
In Germany, almost 20 percent of companies have already been the target of ransomware extortion.
40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ransoms demanded by the perpetrators in order to be able to use the attacked systems and data again.
According to the observations of Malwarebytes, the perpetrators increasingly specialize their extortion software in attacks on corporate networks.
If they are successful there, the potential ransom to be extorted will be significantly higher than for private users.
"We are currently witnessing a frighteningly rapid evolution of malware," explains Malwarebytes CEO Marcin Kleczynski in an interview with "Welt."
In 2008, most malware programs were still designed to send advertisements.
Then the perpetrators discovered extortion software for themselves.
At first, private users were the target, but the switch to corporate attacks has been alarmingly rapid in recent months.
Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: Once active on a victim's computer, it specifically searches for recently modified files such as Word, Excel or database files, as well as archives of pictures and videos.
The Ransomware encrypts these files and permanently deletes the originals.
The software then presents the extortioners "demands.
In order to get the encryption code to the files, victims must transfer money - usually in the form of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin.
But where the personal photo database is at stake for private users, companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases, without which production stops.
Accordingly, the damage is higher if a Ransomware strikes.
22 percent of the affected German companies reported losses in turnover due to Ransomware, 13 percent even had to interrupt business completely, in one case people were in danger of their lives.
In Germany, several hospitals have already been the victims of attacks, whose patients can be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records.
"We always say to the victims: don't pay, you are only promoting the problem," Kleczynski explains.
But 80 to 90 percent of the companies that pay get their data back.
It is difficult for managers to dismiss the offender's claim when the operation is at a standstill.
The hackers, on the other hand, know this and try everything to build a good reputation.
In a recent study, the security researchers at F-Secure examined the user interfaces and contact with the extortioners and come to the conclusion that the perpetrators are actually trying to set up a kind of customer service in order to earn more money.
They chat to their victims about how to pay with Bitcoin, set up freely accessible support websites or decrypt sample files for free.
And if private individuals are released after payments of a few hundred euros, companies sometimes have to negotiate hard and pay five-figure sums in order to get their data back unencrypted.
In view of the potentially high and relatively risk-free profits from ransomware extortion, the hackers are becoming more professional and share the work, explains security expert Chester Wisniewski of the antivirus provider Sophos: "A single person can write a ransomware within about a week."
However, it is more likely that it is three or four people.
The programmers then sell their malicious software in the form of a software kit to the actual extortioners.
The previous malware kits were created by buying the malware itself, advice and additional tools for a one-time, fixed price of between $1000 and $10,000.
"A customization tool is included so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," Wisniewski says.
The blackmailers then look for more hackers to distribute the freshly purchased software among the victims.
We live in a service economy.
So you log into one of the underground forums, buy the set from a criminal and commission another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.
Payment is made per infected computer.
"Usually, criminals then hire spammers to spread it," Wisniewski explains.
The risk of ransomware is now known at many companies that back up their data better.
Over 50 percent of the company IT managers in the Malwarebytes survey trust to be able to fend off ransomware by means of file back-ups and scanner software.
Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.
"If data encryption alone is no longer a sufficient threat for successful extortion, the perpetrators instead threaten to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations," explains Malwarebytes CEO Marcin Kleczynski.
Depending on the type of data, the damage potential is thus many times higher than before.
In the future, the perpetrators could also target completely new targets on the Internet of Things.
At the Defcon hacker conference, security researchers demonstrated how they could gain control of a thermostat connected to the Internet.
In the middle of winter, unlocking such a blocked heating system could well be worth a ransom for some victims.
If the perpetrators then block an entire production line in a factory instead of the heating in the future, ransomware could also become an issue in Industry 4.0.
One for all
HONDA HR-V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
Honda wants to pack everything into the small HR-V: a little SUV, a little coupe and even the versatility of a minivan.
It sounds rather overloaded, but the HR-V, which was constructed on the same new platform as the new Jazz, actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life.
Although the HR-V, which is only 1.60 m high, seems rather small, the passengers have plenty of space in the front row as well as in the rear, and it does not appear cramped at any point.
The materials of the interior are well crafted and look pleasant, only the upper side of the cockpit falls off a bit.
The HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles in terms of storage space.
There is not only a luggage compartment of 453 litres with raised backrests and 1026 litres with folded backrests, but there are also the "Magic Seats."
This is less magical than it sounds: the seats in the rear seat can be folded up like cinema chairs, offering storage space that is 1.24 m high from floor to ceiling.
The boot is easy to load, but the loading height of 650 mm is slightly higher than that of the comparable Peugeot 2008.
The tested 1.6-litre diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V very powerfully in wide speed ranges thanks to its torque of up to 300 Nm.
However, he is likely to do his job a little more quietly.
The everyday consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is pleasing.
There is another engine: a 1.5-liter gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp.
All-wheel drive is not offered.
The handling is well-balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort.
But the steering should be a little more direct.
The equipment leaves nothing to be desired in the tested top-of-the-range "Executive" variant.
The safety systems include the City Emergency Brake Assist (works at speeds up to 32 km / h), the collision warning system and Lane Keep Assist.
The collision detector is sometimes irritating because it evaluates many obstacles as "approaching objects" when manoeuvring.
The high beam assistant works very reliably.
And the intelligent speed controller reacts to traffic sign recognition and slows down the speed if necessary.
However, full connectivity is only available for the top equipment: 7-inch touchscreen, sat nav, app integration and more.
Two USB and one HDMI jack are located under the armrest and are therefore somewhat cumbersome to reach.
The roughly 29,000 euros for the well-equipped top-of-the-range diesel is fine.
Those who do not want to invest so much will receive the petrol engine from 20,000 euros, the diesel from 23,000 euros.
The engines comply with the Euro 6 emission standard.
With the HR-V, Honda offers a versatile and everyday car.
Airline not liable: Fall on passenger bridge
An airline is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the passenger bridge.
Because an adhesion is conceivable only with dangers, which are typical for the air traffic, argued the higher regional court Duesseldorf (Az.: 18 U 124 / 14).
The plaintiff had broken a kneecap in the fall.
However, the accident could have happened anywhere - it was a general risk to life, the court heard.
The airline did not have to pay compensation to the man.
Illness: When does the organiser pay?
Ill holidaymakers will only get money back after their trip if the cause of the illness can be found without doubt in the hotel.
However, this is only the case if more than ten per cent of the guests have been proven to show the same symptoms.
In the case being heard, one family was seriously ill with diarrhoea and vomiting on the second day of their holiday in Turkey.
She spent almost the entire holiday in the room.
The holidaymakers attributed their illness to a faulty sewage treatment plant, which allegedly polluted the seawater.
The family felt the trip was flawed - and sued the tour operator.
In court, the plaintiffs were unsuccessful.
The sewage treatment plant was indeed defective.
But the organizer only found out about it shortly before the plaintiffs left.
Until then, he had to assume that the seawater was OK.
He did not violate his obligations to provide information, the ruling said.
Especially since no impurities were found in the samples of the water.
The illness of several hotel guests - possibly through infection with each other - belongs to the general life risk.
Of 691 guests, only 38 fell ill.
De Maizière said that after the violence perpetrated by refugees in Würzburg and Ansbach in July, many people were worried about further attacks.
The state had to react prudently and decisively at the same time to terrorist threats.
What is certain is that our country will not respond to the violence of the perpetrators with hatred and division.
We will not allow the terrorists to triumph.
If criminals had to leave the country more quickly, however, this would increase security and also strengthen public support for refugee policy.
De Maizière wants the proposals to be implemented by the 2017 Bundestag election.
He also announced a further reinforcement of security forces "in the mid-four-figure range over several years."
Advertising sympathy for terrorism should be made a criminal offence again.
Video surveillance is to be improved and gun laws amended in such a way as to make it more difficult, above all, to buy weapons on the Internet.
According to de Maizière's words, the recently much-discussed duty of confidentiality for doctors should be preserved.
However, he wants to look for solutions in dialogue with the medical profession as to how the danger to citizens can be reduced, he said with a view to mental abnormalities, for example.
In order to counteract the radicalisation of refugees, the Minister believes that better social care is necessary.
Teachers need to be better prepared to deal with traumatised people.
To prosecute criminals in specific areas of the Internet (darknet), de Maizière plans to employ undercover investigators.
SPD leader Gabriel said: "The SPD is ready to talk about anything that helps to further increase security."
It was important that the Minister of the Interior spoke out clearly against actionism.
"That was a slap in the face for the snipers in the CDU / CSU," Gabriel told the newspapers of the Funke Mediengruppe (Friday).
De Maizière had previously rejected calls from the Union for a burqa ban and the abolition of dual citizenship.
He considers a general prohibition of full veiling to be constitutionally problematic.
You cannot ban everything you refuse, and I am against wearing the burqa.
One could talk about rules, for example, in traffic or for witnesses in court.
Green Party leader Simone Peter accused the minister of trying to simulate vigour and ability to act with new anti-terror packages.
Left-wing party leader Bernd Riexinger said: "A tightening of the right of residence will not bring more security to the people of this country."
Better traffic flow on the motorway feeder
Traffic jams on the bypass regularly - here a picture from November.
But that is about to change: the right-hand turn lane is to be extended.
This is good news for all drivers who are stuck in traffic jams on the surrounding road every evening during rush hour when driving on the motorway feeder (A 43).
The Landesbetrieb Straßenbau will extend the right-hand turn lane by 700 metres in the area between Hammer Straße and the Weseler Straße exit next Tuesday and Wednesday (16 / 17 August).
Drivers can then turn right directly from Hammer Straße.
The big advantage: traffic is distributed earlier, which improves the overall flow of traffic on the busy section of federal highway 51.
The CDU parliamentary group in the Münster-West district representation had the idea for the extended exit.
The narrowing of the road on the feeder annoys motorists, especially between 17: 00 and 19: 00.
On weekdays, the backlog extends to the bridge over the Albersloher Weg and sometimes beyond.
The reason is the needle eye on the B 51 shortly before the exit Weseler Straße.
From here, traffic is diverted only in one lane over the motorway bridge.
The second lane had to be dismantled a good three quarters of a year ago.
The reason: static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer has the necessary load capacity to accommodate mainly heavy goods traffic on two lanes.
How long this bottleneck and the associated work-day traffic jams will last, the responsible state enterprise cannot say.
However, this is expected to take years: the bridge will have an official residual service life until 2034.
For the extension of the right-hand turn lane, the state company deliberately chose the less congested time during the school holidays, because obstructions could be expected.
Traffic will pass the construction site in one lane on Tuesday and Wednesday.
Intercultural Journey: Cultural Offers for Schools
The international class of the forest school attended the play "The Invisible House."
The association Nima's and the Young Theatre are now planning a music project.
The Nima's association enables young people with a migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster.
The "International Class" of the Waldschule Kinderhaus attended a performance of the award-winning play "The Invisible House" by the Junges Theater Münster.
In the context of the "Intercultural Journey" initiated by the Nima's association, 19 pupils between the ages of eleven and 15 visited the production in the Little House.
Since the beginning of the year, the association, which has set itself the goal of the cultural integration of young people with a migration and refugee background, has offered schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project.
Most of the young people in the class came to Münster between September 2015 and March 2016 from Afghanistan, Iran, Serbia and Syria, among others, and spoke little German.
Thanks to the choreographies, scenic images and video animations, it was nevertheless possible for them to follow the course of the action, according to the press release of the Junges Theater Münster.
The association Nima's, founded by Dr. Tannaz Westerberg from Sprakel, and the Junge Theater will work together in the coming season as part of a musical theater project.
From October to December, young people with and without a refugee or migrant background between 14 and 20 years of age will have the opportunity to attend professionally supervised courses in the fields of singing, dance, drama and music.
Offers for children and families in the field of theatre and theatrical language teaching are in the planning stages.
The project "Intercultural Journey" continues.
In view of the increased number of refugees, the association expects many classes to participate.
Rain instead of shooting stars: hope for better weather
The weather has put a stop to shooting stars in the southwest of Germany on Friday night - but there is still hope.
Due to clouds and rain, the night was ill-suited for observing the celestial spectacle, said Hans-Ulrich Keller, chairman of the Welzheim Observatory, on Friday morning.
Our hope is for Saturday night.
The weather is supposed to be good, then we will surely see many shooting stars in the sky.
The star scales are Perseids, which are among the fastest shooting stars at 216,000 kilometres per hour.
They get their name because they seem to come from the constellation Perseus, which rises in the northeast.
Relaxing night: Tips against sleep disorders
In the evening you roll around forever, at night you lie awake for hours, in the morning you can't think about sleep even long before the alarm rings.
This is anything but relaxing.
After all, one is in good company with such problems: According to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults have sleep disorders and more than ten percent often or permanently experience their sleep as not restorative.
How do sleep problems or sleep disorders manifest themselves?
There are several forms of sleep disorders, and there can be a variety of underlying causes, emphasizes Hans-Günter Weeß, board member of the German Society for Sleep Research and Sleep Medicine.
However, what is commonly understood by this is insomnia, i.e. a disturbance of falling asleep and falling asleep.
Many people find sleeping through particularly unsatisfactory or insufficient, says Jens Wagenknecht, board member of the German General Practitioners Association with practice in Varel in Lower Saxony.
What is behind sleep disorders?
The causes of sleep disorders are complex.
This can be due to organic, psychological or behavioural factors, as well as medication.
It is not uncommon for a sleep disorder to be an expression of another disease.
"Very early waking is common, especially with depression," Weeß says.
And it may be that different factors cause each other.
For example, someone who has a herniated disc can lie down badly, wakes up every two to three hours and possibly begins to ponder everyday problems and worries, Weeß gives an example.
This leads to tension and sleep is no longer possible.
When should I go to the doctor with insomnia?
Anyone who does not sleep well for at least three nights a week for a period of one month and is impaired during the day should see a doctor, advises Weeß.
The impairment can look very different: one is exhausted, tired, unrested, has difficulties with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical complaints such as stomach or headaches.
In order to alleviate the sleep disorder, it is important to find out its causes.
Treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy or medication - classic sleeping pills only in exceptional cases and for a maximum of two weeks.
Professor Ingo Fietze, Head of the Interdisciplinary Sleep Medicine Centre at the Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin, emphasises that there are hardly any established sleep physicians in Germany.
Therefore, if you have problems sleeping, you should first consult your GP, advises Weeß.
This can clarify with investigations whether the problems have a physical cause.
Who should go to the sleep laboratory, and what happens?
Doctors advise examining in the sleep laboratory, for example, in case of snoring with breathing interruptions, in case of pathological daytime tiredness, in case of sleepwalkers or if the cause of a sleep disturbance is not found, Fietze explains.
You don't really have to prepare for the examination.
You should spend the day as normal.
"Just don't take an afternoon nap, please," Fietze says.
After wiring, you go to bed at your normal time.
In addition to the electrodes on the body, you wear nasal glasses, a chest strap and a sensor on your finger.
In addition, a camera on the ceiling records the sleeping person.
How can sufferers get to grips with the problems?
There are quite a few adjustments you can make for a better night's sleep.
Weeß enumerates: regular bedtimes and getting up times, not lying in bed too long, not sleeping during the day, not watching TV to fall asleep, avoiding alcohol and not looking at the clock at night - then you start counting immediately, and that is not beneficial at all.
What the jungle camp has to do with missing swimming medals
Former German swimmer Markus Deibler has commented via Facebook on the disappointing performance of the DSV team at the Olympics.
In December 2014, he won gold for the first time at the World Short Course Championships in Doha, setting his first world record at the same time.
Now former DSV athlete Markus Deibler has taken to Facebook to defend himself against his criticisms of his former team-mates.
"In a country where an Olympic champion gets €20,000 and a jungle king €150,000, no one should be surprised by a lack of medals," the 26-year-old wrote on his Facebook page on Friday night.
The support system in swimming is bad, but the doping controls are very good.
This means that we cannot compete with countries that promote a great deal and do not look or even practise doping so closely.
"I'm not saying we should stop the controls here," he said.
If he wanted to make a comeback, Deibler would have to be registered with the German National Anti-Doping Agency (NADA) nine months before his first start.
It should be the same with countries.
"If you cannot be checked by independent inspectors of WADA / FINA for a certain time before the World Championships / OS, you are not allowed to participate," demands the Hamburger, who now runs an ice cream parlour.
Airport: Gang of luggage thieves arrested
Professional thieves at Düsseldorf Airport
Civilian investigators from the Düsseldorf police succeeded in arresting two women and two men aged between 50 and 61 on Thursday.
The suspects had committed several bag and luggage thefts as a gang.
Around 9.30pm, plainclothes officers in the Düsseldorf airport area recognised a gang known to police from previous theft offences.
The two women and two men had committed a number of offences since mid-July this year and had proceeded jointly, in a division of labour and in a particularly professional manner.
Specialists from the Criminal Inspectorate 34 can prove that the thieves, who entered Germany specifically to commit crimes, committed four crimes.
They had captured a total of more than 15,000 euros.
Old buildings, a few lime trees, a few cobblestones in between: Rigaer Strasse in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not look like this at first glance, but the police consider it to be one of the city's "dangerous places."
If you walk along the road from east to west, you will pass playgrounds, a freshly painted kindergarten and a health food store.
Someone sprayed "Ugly!" on the facade of a grey house.
Across the street from a Lidl, which is also soon to be demolished, construction is already underway: by 2017, a house with high windows and 133 new rental apartments is to be built here.
Articles about this "trendy district," as the competent real estate company Friedrichshain calls it, have been mostly illustrated with burning cars in recent weeks.
The reason is the house with the number 94: Once it was occupied, now the inhabitants have leases, but rooms on the ground floor are still occupied and are used for events.
Since the beginning of the year, Berlin's Senator for the Interior, Henkel, in particular, has repeatedly spoken out in favour of a police crackdown on the project, describing the area as a "no-go zone" for police officers and the 94 as the starting point for autonomous violence.
After the rooms on the ground floor, the Cadet Forge, were cleared with 300 police officers on June 22nd, the police patrolled for three weeks with 30 to 40 officers and three crew cars on site, cordoned off parts of the street and prevented visitors from entering the house with number 94, according to official statements.
Meanwhile, construction workers renovated the rooms on behalf of the unknown homeowners.
On July 13, a Berlin administrative court ruled that the eviction had been illegal, and a day later, police and construction workers left amid cheers from sympathizers and residents.
On this summer afternoon, the street seems peaceful: parents go for a walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others chat before late.
In the immediate vicinity of the house projects are an elementary school and kindergartens.
Left-wing violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in the neighborhood since 1999, and Jana *, who is raising three children here, are particularly annoyed by the police presence.
They share concerns about rising rents and gentrification with the residents of the housing projects.
It doesn't sound like a neighbourhood that wanted police protection from vandalising leftists.
The rift that the Berlin Senator for the Interior and the police are opening between squatters and their neighbours does not seem to exist in this way.
Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working-class district, which still has a low average income and a high risk of poverty compared to the rest of the city.
Squats and the housing projects born of them have also long been part of the neighbourhood: in 1990, numerous houses in the former GDR were occupied, including almost the entire Mainzer Strasse very close to the Rigaer.
While the people of Mainz were evicted in a real street battle under a large police presence, many of the projects in Riga were legalized and are still inhabited by the people who occupied them 26 years ago.
At the same time, the district has increasingly become a magnet for tourists and Berliners from all over the world in recent years: residents from GDR times and former squatters now share their neighbourhoods with them.
This is also reflected in rents, which have risen by almost 60 per cent since 2009 on new rentals.
Many of the new buildings in Riga are being attacked as symbols of this development: they can be recognised by discarded windows or freshly painted facades that have been pelted with paint bags.
No other street has been mentioned so often this year along with the words "left-wing violence."
One reason that not all neighbors see this as a problem may be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: according to statistics, crimes such as assault are almost exclusively committed against police officers.
The majority of crimes are property damage, which tends to hit new buildings and newly renovated houses more.
For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in a rented house next to the controversial 94 for 17 years, there can be no question of uncertainty.
As far as violence is concerned, it's reassuring: the people in 94 are their neighbors, and they certainly weren't.
Even the famous burning cars have not been around in Riga for some time.
For the trained architect, her street is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary: "Here you help each other, live together on the street and get more out of each other than anywhere else."
Neugebauer deliberately moved to Rigaer Strasse - and stayed there.
That is why it was so important to her that the residents get their street back: from the police, the politicians and the media, who all suddenly claimed sovereignty of interpretation over the district in July.
But in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer, the street continues to be taken away from them: through faceless new buildings in former vacant lots that displace the old residents.
"At the end of the day, these are condominiums that are not of interest to a lot of people here - they tend to be people who are not so well-heeled," she says.
'I absolutely don't condone violence and destruction. '
But what should you do if no one ever listens to you?
There is frustration on all sides, including the police and residents.
Kerstin Neugebauer has little sympathy for newcomers who are annoyed by paint bombs: the house projects and the left scene belonged to the neighbourhood.
Anyone who moves here should be aware of this - just as someone who moves to a pub area can't complain about noise there.

Urbach: Annika Deuschle is the new Refugee Commissioner
Annika Deuschle is the contact person for integration and organisation.
She is also a local social worker.
Annika Deuschle has been the Refugee Commissioner for Urbach since July.
The social pedagogue supports the administration team headed by Achim Grockenberger.
She sees herself as a point of contact for all stakeholders: refugees, the Refugee Aid Working Group, administration, authorities and anyone else involved.
Regine Kunde from the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deuschle is now here, the egg-laying woolly sow who has one problem above all else.
This is what some had said - not so much mocking as aiming at the multitude of desirable tasks - when the administration wanted to advertise the job.
We were looking for an administrative specialist with a talent for languages and people, combined with many years of experience in the field of social work, namely an egg-laying woolly mouse.
But administrative work is not her central area, says Annika Deuschle.
Above all it is about organization, work with the people on site and also behind the scenes as well as networking.
The 31-year-old has been with the club for around six weeks.
She has a 50 per cent job for a three-year term.
"It was high time," says Regine Kunde, that Annika Deuschle supported honorary and full-time actors.
There are big and small problems, organisational, human and communication problems.
New containers will soon be available in Wasenstrasse
Finding accommodation for the refugees who have been recognised has been a serious problem for some time.
The municipalities are responsible for the connecting accommodation.
They must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented accommodation.
The costs of building, renting or renovating these accommodation must be borne by the municipalities themselves.
Responsibility changes from the district administration office to the municipality and job centre.
Problem: There are available properties, but not every landlord wants to offer his flat.
The search has been very difficult for some time.
De facto, the administration does not find private housing.
So far, it has not worked, relying on private dwellings, Deuschle said.
Therefore, communal housing must be upgraded, as the saying goes.
So new containers will soon be erected in Wasenstrasse.
But only apartments are not enough.
Perspective is the key word, Regine Kunde and Annika Deuschle agree.
In addition to permanent residence, there are traineeships, apprenticeships, school places, one-euro jobs and temporary jobs for refugees and migrants that have to be found or established.
"More seats would be good," Regine Kunde reports.
Many work in the building yard or help caretakers, do community service - and this is motivated and very tidy, as Annika Deuschle reports.
She hopes the work will have a positive impact on the community.
This is "not occupational therapy."
Activity does not just mean work.
The day needs a fixed structure, Deuschle and his customers say.
People need to develop a sense of belonging.
Therefore, there is a need for offers such as sports, contacts with locals and, above all, language courses.
Professional courses are rare.
So administration and volunteers are also stepping in.
It is crucial that the refugees get the feeling that they are wanted and welcome in Germany.
The long duration of the proceedings was a problem.
They have to explain to the refugees that it is taking time and that they can bridge the time sensibly, for example with language courses.
Anyone who at some point develops the feeling that he cannot help anyone in Urbach, is not allowed to work and is useless, will never integrate.
The clear majority is motivated.
But there are also problem cases, says Kunde honestly, "people for whom nothing is possible." The work of Deuschle and Kunde is therefore always also to motivate others.
It was all a "mammoth task," he said.
A difficult question: After recent events, are they afraid of radicalisation, even in a small community like Urbach?
"No," Regine Kunde says quite clearly, "which some might call naive." However, she cannot and does not want to rule out residual risk.
But the helpers are already aware of this.
These incidents are also an issue for the refugees.
They are afraid that the attackers will bring them into complete disrepute.
"They want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine Kunde.
Many would like to stay in Urbach.
So senior and volunteer staff on the ground and in the region need to look for work.
They always keep in mind that a new influx of refugees and migrants could soon arrive in Urbach.
Does Germany need a cap?
Politicians shy away from answering this question clearly.
Actually, it's unfair to put them on the spot.
"In Urbach we have not yet arrived where we would like to go," says Annika Deuschle.
No new refugees, that would ease the situation.
Regine Kunde also makes it clear that the people of Urbach are already busy integrating the existing people in a sensible way.
There are currently around 100 people, mostly young men.
But when people are in need, they have to be helped, both women agree.
The political situation in the world is so complicated that there are no easy answers.
Schorndorf: Burglar with helicopter wanted
The police helicopter flew over different areas for about an hour - unsuccessfully.
Two unidentified men violently broke into an apartment in an apartment building in Lindenweg at around 8.50am on Friday morning.
The inhabitant surprised the two and beat the mischief to flee.
The two men were about 1.65 to 1.70 meters tall, probably masked, both wearing blue jeans and black hoodies.
They fled towards the city centre.
Police deployed several patrol crews and a police helicopter to help with the search.
The search was unsuccessful.
The unidentified men may have been seen near the apartment before the crime or during their escape.
Baden-Württemberg: Police investigate snack bar after rocker attack
After an attack on an Ulm snack bar, the police are investigating six suspects from the rocker milieu for serious breach of the peace.
Evidence and drugs were seized during searches of homes, police said on Friday.
Around 20 masked men from a rocker-like group had thrown bottles and stones at the window of a takeaway in July, according to police.
They then allegedly attacked two guests and slightly injured one.
They then fled.
Damage to the snack bar and the adjacent building amounted to 10,000 euros.
According to the investigators, it is about an argument in the Ulm rocker milieu between a Kurdish and a Turkish gang.
