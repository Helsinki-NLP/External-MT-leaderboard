No liberating amendment for Tymoshenko by parliament
The Ukrainian parliament today refused a request to abolish the paragraph on the basis of which opposition leader Yulia Timoshenko was convicted under an amendment to the Criminal Code.
The amendment, which could have paved the way for the release of the imprisoned former prime minister, was rejected by MEPs at the second reading of the motion to reduce the penalties for economic crimes.
Timoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison in October for entering into an allegedly unfavourable contract with Russia for the purchase of natural gas.
The verdict is not yet final, and the convicts "appeal is due to be heard in court in December.
Timoshenko himself described the verdict as political revenge by the regime, and in the West, too, the trial raised suspicions of the court's bias.
The motion to remove paragraph 365, on the basis of which the former prime minister was convicted, from the criminal code was supported by 147 deputies.
226 votes would have been needed to pass it.
Libyan victory
The history of the Libyan liberation struggle or Libyan rebellion already knows its losers.
Muammar el-Qaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert, and without him, the war is over.
Now only the winners are to be defined.
As is customary in this region, Islamists win the elections, the question is only which - the moderate or the radical.
The National Transitional Council upheld the customary law of Sharīʿa, of which God has a certain conception.
Libya would become a crime-free country, because you cut off your hand for theft.
Women, too, should quickly forget about emancipation, possible renegades are executed, and so on.
Instead of a single dictator, the Koran will in future unite society of mutually feuding tribes.
In short, an order will prevail in Libya that would be hard to imagine and, above all, hardly desirable in this country.
Only - our lifestyle is not the only one and objectively seen probably not the best and would hardly suit the mentioned Libyans.
Seen in this light, it is rather strange that the Muslim fighters let themselves be helped at all by the infidel dogs.
Their excuse may be the fact that NATO air strikes were not led by some American general, but by Allah himself, whose omnipotence was praised after every successful strike.
The victors in Libya? The West is not one of them.
We only took part in an exchange of fire, we served the interests of Islam, and our politicians disposed of a political ally in the person of the dictator, without any benefit whatsoever.
After the fresh and bad experiences from Afghanistan and Iraq, we preferred not to have a military occupation of Libya.
That leaves the locals with one worry - the expulsion of the Crusaders.
But will the oil companies get the black gold for a mockery price even without occupation?
Hardly, and for once, the West can rightly boast of its selflessness when it comes to protecting human rights.
Unless the Sharīʿa representatives spoil it for them.
Beginning of a new era of crisis
France and the rest of Europe in the focus of investors.
On Tuesday, a statistical storm roared through Europe.
The individual states published their GDP figures for the third quarter.
The Czech economy stagnated compared to the previous quarter, while Germany and France grew.
But today, the bond market is breaking all records.
Investors are keeping an eye not only on Greece, but also on Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
The statistical offices of Europe, Germany, the Czech Republic and some other European countries published their provisional economic forecasts for the third quarter.
Germany's GDP grew by 0.5%, as expected, and France's by 0.4%.
At the same time, both countries revised their data for the second quarter, in which Germany recorded higher growth than originally expected (growth of 0.3% instead of the forecast 0.1%), while France admitted a slight decline of 0.1% (initial data spoke only of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent in the third quarter of this year compared to the previous year.
Compared to the previous quarter, however, the gross domestic product stagnated and, according to the Czech Statistical Office, confirmed the trend of a slowdown in economic performance.
The results are therefore worse than analysts "forecasts.
Key events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent in the third quarter of this year compared to the previous year, but it stagnated compared to the previous quarter.
According to preliminary and seasonally adjusted data, the German economy grew by 0.5 percent in the third quarter.
Across the eurozone and the EU, the economy grew by 0.2 percent between July and September compared with the previous quarter, in line with analysts "expectations.
The Greek economy shrank by 5.2 percent year-on-year.
The yield on its 10-year government bonds climbed to 28.45%.
Yields on Italian and Spanish government bonds rose to critical levels.
Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium and other countries are also beginning to experience problems...
Czech government bond yields remain below 4%, although the situation in the region is deteriorating.
In Germany, voices are being raised that the ECB should become a creditor of last resort.
The Czechs qualified for EURO
They won 1-0 in Montenegro and are now celebrating their qualification for the World Cup
The football selection has mastered the toughest task of the whole season!
They won 1-0 in Montenegro thanks to a well-taken goal from Czech goalkeeper Čech and a wonderful goal from Petr Jiráček.
With a large portion of luck, Czech football was able to defend its luxurious advantage from the home game and will once again not be missing at the European Championship.
IHNED.cz followed the promotion game in a detailed report.
Little excitement in the first half and a huge amount of luck in the second.
Thanks to the weakness of the home team, a brilliant Czech and the hero of the day Jiráček in Montenegro, the Czech selection won quite happily 1: 0 and thus redeemed their ticket to the European Championship.
Also because of the precise defensive play of the Czech teams they were able to put more pressure on the Montenegrins only in the second half.
The unlucky ones of the match were Damjanovic and Vucinic, who squandered two huge chances.
Thanks also to an excellent Petr Čech, the Czech selection will participate in the European Championships next year, and it is also gratifying that a bonus of around 200 million goes to domestic football.
From the first few minutes, they played some really combative football.
Both teams combined for a long time and so it was played mainly around the centre line.
Also in the second half the pressure of the home team failed and the wide tees in front of the penalty area were successfully repelled by the Czech defence.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country's core program.
They formed a living shield.
A few hundred college students formed a live sign around a nuclear facility in Iran.
With this gesture, they wanted to show their support for their country's nuclear program before a possible Israeli attack.
The students had prayed in front of the building Tuesday afternoon and then announced the deaths to the United States and Israel.
A few hundred students from the university in Isfahan, Iran, formed a living sign around the nuclear technology center in Isfahan, where uranium is processed, on Tuesday.
By doing so, they wanted to show that they are prepared to protect their country's core programme with their own lives, if necessary.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) recently stated in its report that Iran appears far from giving up its efforts to acquire a nuclear weapon.
There is also talk in Israel of a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
Students had prayed in front of the entrance to the complex at noon and then announced death to the United States and Israel.
In the event of an attack aimed at crippling Iran's nuclear program, according to the Israeli press, the center in Isfahan would also be the target of Natan's nuclear enrichment plant.
A Fat Child's Menu: It Doesn't Eat Breakfast and Eats Sausage for Dinner
More than a third of children aged 9 to 13 are overweight, with 9 per cent of pupils and 5 per cent of children being overweight.
Recent surveys have shown that obese children mostly come from families with unhealthy lifestyles.
This shows once again how important the milieu in which a person grows up and the examples that surround him are for the healthy development of a person.
Sausages are up to half more often on the tables of obese children than in families where normal-weight children live.
More than 19 per cent of the overweight children had chips for dinner on the day before the awareness campaign under the motto "Obesity is no coincidence."
Exercise is not one of the most popular pastimes in families with young children, but it also affects the majority of today's pupils - only 15 per cent said their parents find time for active exercise at least once a week.
Survey of 900 children
The survey was conducted last year towards the end of the school year and surveyed almost 900 children from primary schools across the Czech Republic.
This was the second year of the "Obesity is no coincidence" campaign, which is supported by the General Health Insurance Fund and Unilever.
So far, more than 12 thousand students from 4th and 8th grades have participated in the project.
Unhealthy diets and lack of exercise in the family are crucial factors that are responsible for the alarming increase in the number of children who are overweight or even obese.
"For example, only half of the children surveyed said they eat breakfast, breakfast, lunch, dinner five times a day - one of the main requirements for a healthy diet," according to one of the survey results.
No breakfast and sausage for dinner
Experts point out that even relatively small things, such as the family's regular breakfast time, are important for a child's healthy development.
In the Czech Republic, however, only 23 percent of the families of students have breakfast.
And - in most families, everyone has breakfast on their own.
Worst of all was the finding that one in ten families do not have breakfast at all.
Breakfast is considered to be the cornerstone of a healthy daily diet.
The survey showed, among other things, that the families of overweight children are much more likely to consume unhealthy fries.
And almost everyone - regardless of weight - drinks sweet sodas every day (70 per cent)
While more than 40 percent of the children surveyed play sports, less than half of their parents do - just 15 percent.
Compose your own menu
Another part of the survey enabled selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to create their own menu based on their appetite and opinion.
"What Czech children between the ages of 12 and 15 prefer in terms of nutrition is far from the ideal of a healthy diet.
Among her favourite dishes were many pastries, meat dishes and, of course, desserts.
"What is particularly alarming is the great popularity of sweet lemonades," the final report of this survey emphasises.
At lunch, the main course, pasta came out on top over poultry.
The children almost did not like legumes at all and the popularity of fish and vegetable dishes for lunch was also very low.
Return to health
At the same time, the survey also showed that children are quite willing to change their eating habits if they are given the right information.
"In the control group of respondents, who completed the questionnaire after completing the educational lecture" Obesity is not a coincidence, "there was in many cases a significant shift in preferences towards principles of healthy eating," the results of the project show.
This was evident, for example, in the sweet sodas, where many children began to give priority to ordinary water.
The children also ticked poultry or fish as the main dish of the day much more often in the questionnaire and were willing to eat fewer dumplings or sweet foods.
Professionals claim - a stylist must also be a good psychologist
In the introductory article on how stylists learn, I was a bit grumpy that it was a bit too much stuff to start with.
I had no idea what was to come.
Lectures by three professionals from the industry, the clothing of problematic figures and a seminar on how things work "on the pitch."
There is worse to come.
The closer we get to the test, the more information and practical tasks await us.
But even if the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, it is still fully booked.
This time we debated with director Alena (not a single man attends the course) how to dress a woman who does not have an ideally proportioned figure.
And that, after all, is most of us.
Some have a too short neck, others a too boyish figure without neat curves and still others are chubby.
It is up to the stylist to visually conceal broad shoulders, lengthen the neck or conjure up the necessary curves.
We also got tips on how to dress a woman like Jennifer Lopez - with a big bosom, wide hips and narrow waist - pretty and figure-hugging without looking too provocative.
For example, if the difference between waist and hips is so great that the skirt or pants really don't fit, you should get at least one piece made to measure.
You won't regret it, because well-fitting clothes are simply priceless.
You feel much better in a tailored skirt like this than in an off-the-rack one that keeps slipping up and down, sticking out at the waist, etc.
In turn, boyish figures can permit themselves to wear clothing with wrinkles, bulbs, appliqués, embroideries or ruffles.
With this amount of information and figure types, I am glad that I have a whole week to thoroughly go through everything.
And yet I am afraid that, given the homework assigned, it is almost impossible to accomplish.
Each of the students was assigned a celebrity to come up with matching outfits for - daywear and evening gowns.
In doing so, we should take into account the current appearance, the fashion style of the respective star and his figure type.
I'm supposed to "dress" Miranda Kerr, who you may know from the Victoria's Secret campaign.
Inside, I cheer, because for me personally, this is much better than dressing, say, Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who has probably gained a hundred kilos lately (well, that's a bit exaggerated), or even the young Selena Gomez.
The garments are to be cut out of magazines or searched on the Internet, printed out and then edited graphically.
The "mood board," as the whole result is called, is meant to express our very personal style and our relationship to graphic design.
It is very important to also think about the graphic side of styling.
The stylist not only attracts the models physically, but also designs the so-called product page in the journals (according to specific specifications, for example trend handbags, coats, etc.).
Stylist and designer Mario Kameník told us about this.
But only on Sunday.
This means that a stylist must have a good overall view.
The Saturday lecture, filled with information about figure types, was spiced up by three visitors from the industry:
by the stylist Jan Pokorný, the fashion designer Jakub Polanka and the fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and that a stylist should be able to exploit this.
And a savvy stylist can work with a single piece of clothing in very different ways.
The magic word is variability.
For example, you can wear a trench coat over jeans, like a T-shirt or coat, but you can also wear it on the naked body, wear heels and wear it as a dress.
Simply roll up the sleeves or the collar and the whole look looks completely different.
"Play with it," he insisted.
But the most important piece of advice I got was this: "First, you need to know the rules perfectly."
"Only then can you hurt them," Jakub said.
It finally dawns on me why we have to tick all these boxes, what can be combined with what, and why, even if you often see something completely different in fashion magazines.
Not to mention fashion shows.
Thanks to the photographer Ben, I now know that a stylist must have prepared many more clothing variations than he ultimately photographs.
So you have to be prepared to style at least fifteen for a ten-page fashion story (i.e. ten outfits).
And also that the clothing in the photo in combination with other accessories sometimes looks completely different than in reality.
So you have to take all of this into account when designing the outfit.
Jan Pokorný also confirmed that image and style sometimes account for half of the success.
Just look at Madonna, a not-so-brilliant singer whose image and marketing have made her a global star.
In the Czech Republic, the services of a stylist are rather reserved.
Even famous people often think of this as money thrown out (the main thing is that I bring something, how I look is secondary).
And if one of us already has a style, then we should expect that he or she will most likely force a very different (smaller) size on us than he or she actually needs.
Then you only have to google afterwards to find with certainty that the tabloid press writes that the corresponding celebrity has gained or lost weight again, and so on.
On Sunday, Jan and Mario urged us not to believe that a stylist only needs to focus on fashion and then "assemble" the outfit.
In his work he has to communicate with the people he styles and he has to be a clever psychologist.
Evaluate people without pandering to them and standing by their opinions.
'If any manager orders us to sift through her wardrobe and add pretty pieces, we can't sort her out the whole wardrobe and say - my God, that's terrible. '
"You have to find at least a few commendable things to recommend what you can wear," Mario says.
He also showed us in very concrete terms what a so-called "placebo" must contain.
In other words, a bag that is buttoned at the waist and in which you carry all the necessary proprietorships with you.
In addition to such clear items as scissors, hair removal dispensers or safety pins, it also contains such utensils as a nylon thread (this helps the stylist take photos of products such as handbags or hats), special clips that can be used to pull the clothes back in case they are too large (pins or other clamps are prohibited to prevent the fabric from breaking) and, of course, sewing equipment.
So that we not only have to listen, but also try something practical, we learned how to stick shoes properly.
Even when photographing in the studio, where the floor is level, you can damage the sole of the shoe, let alone the outside.
We were glued and glued...
You are not even allowed to touch the shoes with the scissors, so as not to damage them.
So you have to be really skilful.
Mario delighted me by unreservedly praising my "creation."
The aforementioned skill is not exactly my strength.
All this was only a fraction of what we heard at the second weekend continuation course.
One thing has now become clear to me - dedicating yourself to styling at a professional level is not child's play.
V Need for Speed: "The Run" - the illegal race across America

A series of entirely avoidable, amateurish mistakes turn what was originally a carefree ride into a routine early shift.
It was possible to fulfil a large part of the ambitions, but what use is that if no one was obviously in the mood to do a little more.
Even before it hit the shelves, the new part, subtitled "The Run," aroused high expectations.
He promised to take the old game series "Need for Speed" back to a new dimension and in the playable demonstration examples it seemed to be more than just one of many action racing games.
We were also curious to see how the adapted passages, in which the main protagonist gets out of the car and continues on foot, turned out.
But as one is used to with NFS, in the end a lot is different than one had expected.
Sure - potentially they're pretty decent arcade races, but overall the game is diminished by some unnecessary mistakes that have been more or less present in this series for a couple of years.
So these are actually no longer mistakes, but rather signs of a basically incomprehensible laziness of the game developers.
The adventure begins very well.
For starters, you are introduced to the story, whose main character Jack has certain personal problems; the only solution seems to be to take part in an illegal race across America.
In San Francisco, on the West Coast, you get behind the wheel - with the task of being the first in New York.
The basic idea contains a whole series of interesting elements.
The entire route is divided into ten stages and more than fifty individual races.
This means that each race is held on a different track and that the stages take place in different, sufficiently different and interesting environments.
One does not for a moment feel that game would offer the same thing over and over again.
Some environments are also very nice to look at, although the technical level of the graphics does not exceed that of the earlier parts of the series.
So nothing earth-shattering.
But the drive through the desert, through autumn landscape or high up through deeply snowy landscape seems visually very pleasant.
Every now and then, untypical elements bring a little variety to the individual races.
In the desert, for example, one is surprised by a desert storm that severely restricts visibility.
In the mountains, on the other hand, you have to be very careful not to be buried by an avalanche.
By the way, the individual races are built in quite well one after the other.
Only a few, but they are enough.
For a while you try to overtake the prescribed number of opponents (in principle a classic race), then you have time to catch up (classic race against the stopwatch), then you can expect a personal duel with a single opponent.
And in addition, the police get involved, who want to screw up the whole thing.
A novelty are passages in which Jack leaves the car.
It is more about certain interactive animations in which Jack flees from someone and where the player has to help him by pressing the right button at the right moment.
So nothing complicated.
It is surprising, however, that there are far fewer such passages in the game than one would expect (actually only three).
In the end, this is rather to the advantage of the game, because this element has at least no chance of becoming boring - it belongs in the context of the above to the elements, which make the game more varied.
The driving model follows in the footsteps of the previous parts.
That is to say, from today's point of view, it does not uproot trees, but on the other hand, one could not say that it is bad.
If you are looking for realistic simulations, you have to look elsewhere.
But the local driving model continues to do justice to an action-packed race, although you could find better ones in the competition.
Until then, everything is fine.
Real problems only emerge after some time.
In contrast to the driving model, the collision model is not quite O.K.
A game of this kind is hardly to be expected to calculate complicated deformations and collisions, but if you have practically no idea how the car behaves before hitting any object, then obviously not everything is in order.
Typical example: when overtaking or passing oncoming cars, you only "touch" the other car slightly in some places, but in other, almost identical situations, you go skidding and do wild pirouettes.
Or drive the cart straight to scrap metal.
Thanks to the restart system, this does not matter, but it is annoying from time to time.
The restarts are solved like this: if you have total damage or land far off the track, the game throws you back to the last clue of the track.
Except - in every race you only have five restarts.
When you have exhausted them, everything starts all over again.
So the restarts are more like a tool, in case something doesn't work out, but you better not rely on it.
Sometimes, however, even the restart does not help, there is nothing else that helps than to learn the critical section from the head.
What is particularly unpleasant is that the same things often happen in the same places.
Some corners, for example, have to be driven through in a very specific way, otherwise you just don't fit through.
Elsewhere, you will always find "civilian" cars in the same configuration, whether you come first or fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
This is especially annoying in situations when you see that the opponent in front of you easily passes two oncoming cars, but by the time you get there yourself, the cars are already in such a position that you have to drive around or brake.
And it doesn't matter when you get there, because everything is designed so that this situation always happens right under your nose.
The opponents have other advantages.
Throughout the game there are a few places where you are always overtaken by the same opponent in the same place and again without regard to the time.
The craziest part of this is at the end of the game on the long bridge, which you pass in the opposite direction.
The opponent obviously has to overtake you here on the devil come out.
And if he is already in front of you, then of course he takes your view, so that at the beginning you drive your own car a few times in lumps.
Sure - you just want to make the game more exciting and exciting, but this intention is so clear that it quickly misses the joy of the game.
And that's a pity, because despite a simpler driving model, the game is quite entertaining and in places so action-packed that you almost don't know where your head is.
And in principle it does not matter what is "to blame" for it - the concept with fifty unique routes, the arrangement of the races in such a way that no boredom can arise, or something completely different...
Changing cars during the races is also an unusual idea.
One must not overlook the gas stations along the route, because it is here that one can change the car, although in most cases the car that one has is sufficient.
The cars are divided into three categories.
The sports cars are well suited for urban areas, the strong American sedans for the straight highways and exotic super sports cars for technical driving, for example on the hairpin bends in the mountains.
Hand in hand with the mode of the game story is also the task mode (challenges) - that is, the races in the individual locations that you know from the story.
Here there are not only medals to be won, but also experience points for your own profile, which is common to the tasks (challenges) and the history.
In order to get to the higher driver level, different objects have to be unlocked: from the car to the backgrounds for the profile.
This is also connected to the online autolog function, which, among other things, compares your own results with those of other players and also provides other collective functions.
One of the more incomprehensible carvers is a situation in the last race in history.
Here you come by car into a subway tunnel (because of me), where you race along the rails in the dark (because of me).
Numbers between 150 and 200 km / h look on the speedometer (because of me), but suddenly a subway comes from behind and drives you uncompromisingly to scrap metal.
In our editorial office we will probably argue for a long time about whether this was a blackout of the game designers or whether the authors think us so stupid.
The technical side is nothing overwhelming but at least the overall visual impression is in most cases quite appealing and here and there even brilliant.
All the more annoying is that with some exciting moments the refresh rate slows down and sometimes quite dramatically.
However, this applies in particular to accidents with a larger number of participants, where a continuous FPS is of no use anyway.
Sound reproduction is OK and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In an effort to appeal to as wide a range of rather young audiences as possible, a soundtrack a lá "something from everyone" was created - but who buys such a game just because of the music?!
The overall impression of Need for Speed: The Run? Feelings are rather mixed.
If the game were not diminished by the totally unnecessary mistakes mentioned above, we could have asserted with the breasttone of conviction that The Run is the best piece of NFS in recent years.
But somehow the game seems unfinished.
A great pleasure in itself, but you should be prepared for these mistakes to strike you in the eye with the power of airport spotlights.
Concert of the "Students of the Velvet Revolution" with singing ensembles of Charles University
For the third time, the Festa Academica festival offers the amalgamation of the World Student Day with the anniversary of the Velvet Revolution, along with a musical experience.
In the course of the festival, about twenty professional and university choirs will present themselves.
The focus of the festival will be on the two concerts, which will take place on 17 November.
"Charles University is very involved in the festival."
"The choir of the Faculty of Pedagogy and the Faculty of Humanities studies is represented among the participants, and the rector, Václav Hampl, is a member of the festival committee," said Jakub Čaloun, head of the organizing team.
The absolute highlight of the festival is the public concert of technical school choirs, which will take place on 17 November from 14: 00 on the square in front of the National Technical Library in Dejvice.
The program includes the composition "Celebration Jazz Mass" by the famous Czech jazz musician Karel Růžička.
In the evenings, the concert "Students of the Velvet Revolution" (Studenty sametu) takes place in the gala rooms of the Folk House in Vinohrady, with university choirs also performing, not excluding choirs from Charles University.
Festa Academica's aim is not only to celebrate World Students "Day in a dignified manner and commemorate the 22nd anniversary of the Velvet Revolution, but also to present choral music at the highest level to the public and to promote creative cooperation among young people.
The main organizer is the Association of Czech Choirs in cooperation with the Johannes Kepler Gymnasium.
The event was held under the auspices of Bohuslav Svoboda, Mayor of Prague and Václav Hampl, Rector of Charles University.
The festival will take place from 16 to 20 November in Prague and Pardubice.
In addition to festive concerts, the schedule also includes numerous music meetings, student happenings, matinees and other events.
Interested parties can find detailed information on the website of the festival www.festaacademica.cz
Ambassador Vicenová:
The Czechs have a reputation as negativists and eurosceptics
"The Lisbon Treaty has noticeably unbalanced the balance between the individual institutions."
I didn't expect such a hard war to break out. '
"It will take five or six years for the waves to calm down and for everyone to get used to their new role," began Milena Vicenová, the Czech Ambassador to the European Union, quite sharply in her lecture at the Faculty of Law.
She showed how seriously she takes the motto "Understandable and open about Europe" in the first part of her lecture, in which she managed to describe the individual institutions of the EU and their mutual relations in such a clear and comprehensible way that many lecturers in the law faculty of Charles University would have envied her.
Ms Vicenová also praised the new Permanent President of the Council of Europe, Herman Van Rompuy:
"Initially there was criticism that he was too inconspicuous - a grey civil servant who was not up to such a role, but I have to say that it took everyone's breath away how well he handled the matter.
"He is a man who manages to listen patiently to twenty-seven member states, to communicate with them and, above all, to have clear ideas about how the EU should proceed.
She then explained the new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy as an answer to the question "Who is this - the European Union? Which number should I call?," i.e. as an important step towards the agreement and better readability of EU policy towards states such as China or India.
No one wants to ban us from owning our oil hats
Mrs Vicenová also devoted herself to the agenda according to which the European Union has lived, is living and intends to live in the near future.
She described the Czech Presidency of two years ago as a success.
The Czechs had overcome the financial crisis and the gas crisis and had also organised the Eastern Partnership Summit.
She described the case of the government during the Presidency as a great negative, which had greatly damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU currently has its hands full.
In the Ambassador's words, things were pretty hectic, not only in the Presidency, but also in the ensuing crisis, which has not yet been resolved.
The EU's seven-year budget still has to be approved, which makes things much more complicated precisely because of the current economic situation.
Whether it will be a lean and frugal budget, which sectors of the economy will be given priority, which countries will receive more and which less - all this is now on the agenda.
The Ambassador also recalls her own slogans when she came to Brussels: "Understandable about Europe."
"If I don't like something, it's greyish abbreviations, foreign words and technical jargon that no one understands.
As a citizen, how am I supposed to know whether people in Brussels really come up with crooked or round cucumbers and bananas of different sizes, or whether someone actually wants to ban us from using curds.
It would also have liked to use EU soil to get more Czechs into European institutions.
The prospect of a two-speed or multi-speed Europe
According to the EU ambassador, the Czechs have a reputation for being Eurosceptics who perceive the negative rather than the positive sides of the matter.
This makes the weak representation of Czechs in European institutions all the more galling.
Many factors are to blame for this, including the reluctance of our candidates, their inability to write letters of motivation and, last but not least, the weak support of the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, she also highlighted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group, the so-called V4.
"Believe me, when a Pole or Hungarian comes to me and a Slovak is nearby, the Frenchman next to me says:" Hey, what are you putting your heads together - is that your V4 again? "and it makes a pretty sour face.
According to Ms Vicenové, the EU expects, above all, tough rules for the budget policies of the member states in the future.
It regards the concept of a two-speed or even multi-speed Europe as much more real than a "European federation."
"We have here the countries of the euro zone and the countries outside the euro zone.
"We have the Schengen area and we already have the institute of strengthened cooperation."
'For the first time, it has been said that only those countries that want it should work together and those that don't want it should quietly stand aside. '
"There will be more and more such institutions, which will ultimately lead to a strong" multi-speed Europe, "" Ms Vicenová expects.
In this regard, she also appreciated the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuy in enforcing the principle that all issues affecting the entire EU must be discussed by all member states, not just the eurozone countries.
Brand Story:
The innovator IBM enters the second century of its existence
If you were looking for a suitable word that most accurately characterizes IBM's strategy, it would probably be the word "longevity."
For the general public, IBM is synonymous with a technological revolution, known as a modern company, although a century has passed since its inception.
The foundation for this longevity was laid by its first boss - the visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He already advocated that countless global problems could be easily solved if people were willing to think a little.
His slogan "Think!" thus became the trademark around which the life of the future giant would unfold (and at the same time the title of the company's in-house magazine, which IBM began publishing as early as 1935).
This was also the basis of the corporate culture thoroughly prepared by Watsen.
"For us at IBM, this long-term thinking means a continuous movement towards the future.
IBM survived and succeeded for a century because it remained true to its principles and did not shy away from changing everything else around it.
This allowed us to transform technologies, business and society in the course of our first century.
We hope to achieve even more in the next hundred years, "said Samuel J. Palmisano, the current director of the company on the occasion of the anniversary.
Sophisticated system
Watson was already providing social care for its employees in the 1930s - in a similar way to the entrepreneur Baťa in Czechoslovakia: IBM employees were one of the first American employees to have paid holidays, insurance from the entrepreneur, plus elegant uniforms as work clothes, and a well thought-out remuneration system for the best innovators and traders.
IBM's long-term relationships with its customers are just as sophisticated.
The company was brilliant at promoting talent from the very beginning - IBM was one of the first companies in the world to eliminate all discrimination - and was able to choose accordingly.
Also in line with this anti-discrimination strategy is the current plan to replace Palmisan at the top of IBM next year with a woman - Virginia Rometty.
She has been with IBM for thirty years and has previously held the position of Head of Sales, Marketing and Strategy.
In recent years, IBM has been conducting so-called online brainstorming sessions, from which many future strategies and innovations arise.
No wonder - there are plenty of ideas, as the company employs almost half a million people.
An institution with a good reputation
Their unshakeable position in the business guarantees the company a strong image both internally and externally.
"From the beginning, IBM had the concept of an institution rather than a mere technology company," said Rosabeth Moss Kanter, a Harvard Business School professor and author of a book on IBM.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps solve business problems using technology," added George Colony of consulting firm Forrester Research.
As the company itself points out, there is a difference between merely being present in the market or shaping it directly through this presence.
IBM - known as "Big Blue" in the United States because of its logo - has grown into one of the largest companies in the world in a century.
It is one of the most versatile technology companies in the world - IBM develops hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting and consulting services across an incredible range of products, from servers to nanotechnology.
Of all American technology companies, IBM holds the most patents, and five of its employees have already won the Nobel Prize.
His best-known inventions include ATMs, credit cards, financial swaps, barcodes and the floppy disk.
With about $220 billion in market value (market capitalization), IBM was the second-largest technology company this year (just behind Apple), overtaking Microsoft for the first time since 1996.
Looking ahead
Not all products and innovations met the tastes of today's customers - unhappy were, for example, the attempt with the own operating system OS / 2, the online service Prodigy or the computers IBM PC jr.
"Business is about moving forward, so you can't be emotionally tied to the past," says Samuel J. Palmisano.
So IBM has no problem building its foundations on different platforms - and if they don't work, leave them.
In contrast to the rival Microsoft, which basically stands or falls with its operating system Windows.
Promising technologies
Services make up the bulk of IBM's profits, with software and hardware accounting for one-fifth each.
As recently as 1990, hardware was the most strongly represented with a share of more than fifty percent.
Since 2000, IBM has sold $15 billion worth of low-profit assets, while at the same time investing $58 billion in purchasing promising technologies.
In these investments, IBM continues even after 2008, when the modern financial crisis first swept the world like a storm.
Here, too, IBM remained true to the legacy of its first chief executive, Thomas J. Watson, who increased its investment in the midst of the Great Depression.
So far, it seems that IBM has emerged unscathed from today's crisis.
The value of IBM shares has rocketed by 120 per cent since 2008, and the company's net profit is growing steadily.
IBM's corporate slogan is: Everything can be changed - only the values cannot be changed.
That is another reason why it can be expected that this flexible giant will also master the next crisis.
IBM History: From Cheese Slicer to Space Flights
IBM (International Business Machines), founded a hundred years ago in New York, initially had a rather complicated name - Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
It only took over the name IBM in 1924 - originally it was a brand name for a subsidiary in Canada and South America.
The foundation stone for the later company IBM was laid by the merger of four companies whose history goes back to the eighties of the 19th century.
They possessed technologies such as the famous smart card clocks for registering the start and end of work.
Charles Ranlett Flint, who also chaired the Supervisory Board until 1930, became the architect of this new company.
And it was Flint who hired the chief executive of the rival company, Thomas J. Watson, to help him run the company.
This leader even eclipsed the founders of IBM - the invincible culture and identity of the company is based on Watson's ideas to this day.
Watson ran the company until 1952.
IBM, as its name suggests, began manufacturing and distributing all kinds of machines for the trade - from sausage and cheese slicers to cash registers.
In the first four decades that Watson led the company, he doubled its sales to $9 million, and the company gradually expanded to every continent.
Watson was so indispensable to the company that he sat in the executive chair for forty years, only then was he replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his leadership, IBM began to develop artificial intelligence and also developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, IBM engineers and computers helped NASA guide flights into space - to Mercury and Saturn, and in 1969, the famous human flight to the moon.
In 1964, IBM developed the first family of computers with the same architecture - the IBM System / 360 series.
A classic PC, which defined the computer standard of that time, was introduced in 1981 under the name IBM 5150.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, but bought the consulting arm of PricewaterhouseCoopers, thereby fully entering the high-value consulting and services business.
The strategy that has paid off for IBM over the past three years is the concept of "Smarter Planet."
It represents the intention to use technologies wisely in areas not even previously planned, for example to improve the situation in transport and urban management.
In the retail sector, IBM recently launched the "Smarter Commerce" platform to help merchants manage the entire commercial cycle.
IBM also has a strong history in the Czech Republic.
As early as 1932, IBM established a subsidiary in what was then Czechoslovakia - the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, IBM ČR also operates a strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
The Central and Eastern European Headquarters is located in Prague and is also home to a world-class team of researchers working on voice recognition technology.
Darina Rychtářová on her unfaithful husband:
Iveta - you can keep this donkey, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Rychtářová (53) says - now it's over!
After her husband Josef Rychtář (53) became her lover from the protector of Iveta Bartošová (45), Darina still had the hope that Josef would awaken from his pink dream and come home.
But now her patience is finally over and she has set herself clear rules for the rest of her life.
"Josef can come home, but not more than my partner," D. Rychtářová explained.
When Darina Rychtářová offered the singer I. Bartošová refuge in her own house, she would not even have dreamed how it would turn out with her husband.
When Iveta, at her insistence, moved out and back to Říčany after 30 days, Josef immediately went with her.
Indeed, he even publicly professed his love for her.
As time went on, Darina resigned, and it even seemed as if she wanted to reconcile with her unfaithful husband - but now she finally gave him a run for his money.
Rychytář does not care who his wife sleeps with
If Rychtář does leave Iveta Bartošová in the future, he will certainly not be welcomed back home with open arms.
'He's the biological father of my dreams and if he wants to end his days in our shared home, I'm not going to throw him out. '
"Not as a beloved, lost old donkey, however, but as a person with whom I still have certain ties," Mrs. Rychtářová revealed, but she also said that she had already separated from him emotionally and insisted on mutual decency alone.
Until now, Josef has carried with dignity the fact that Darina has locked the back door for him.
'I respect my wife's decision. '
'I'm staying with Iveta, that's not going to change. '
'My wife wants a paper marriage and I respect that, 'he said.
"The company keeps running, I take care of the repairs, the garden, the property, I do the shopping."
"I have a normal conversation with Darina, except we don't share the bed," J. Rychtář told the newspaper Blesk.
If Darina wants to find a new love, he doesn't want to stop her.
'We don't sleep with each other, so I don't care if she has a boyfriend or who that is.
I am aware that this is my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and therefore I accept all responsibility.
The worst female bad habits: What about you?
When men are asked to name some typical female bad habits, they invariably promptly shake off some of them.
Dear women, do you recognize yourself in the following lines, in which we review a few bad habits that make the blood flow in the veins of the men?
Shopping addiction
Does her husband accuse her of being a shoplifter?
Do you have to buy at least one quarrel a week?
Do you like to go shopping and may it be a little more with promotions?
In your case, then, it really is a weakness.
Some women are at least aware of this and try to keep their shopping habits under control.
But hand on heart, what woman can bear to wander through a clothing store in search of a well-fitting outerwear and not try them all out (in all possible colour combinations) in the cabin?
Even though shopping is a hobby for most women, for men it is often pure hell.
Think about how many times you've told your husband - you'd better stay out of it...
Constant discontent
'Am I not too fat? '
"I would have to lose at least five kilos - should I start jogging or do gymnastics?"
"Do you even like me?"
Does that sound familiar to them?
Yes?
Then you are probably one of those women who are downright obsessed with how they look.
This does not mean that you should let go, but many men are allergic to the fact that their wife is constantly complaining about her appearance.
The stronger sex agrees - with the increasing frequency of complaints, the women are increasingly intolerant.
Order and cleanliness in the first place
It's a battle against windmills.
Clean windows, wipe tiles and dust, scrub the tub - and do so at least twice a week.
Do you scold your partner because he once again tramples on the clean tiles with dirty shoes, do you scold the children because the recently scrubbed sink is dirty again and because the glass door on the living room cupboard has fingerprints again, when polishing is so much trouble?
If you suffer from this kind of "deviance," then you should know that nothing should be exaggerated and that order and cleanliness in family life should not come first.
In the final analysis, this excessive purity can also damage reciprocal relations and, above all, peace in the family.
Sticks
"Dirty gym pants go in the laundry basket."
"Do you really want to wear the old socks again tomorrow?"
'You don't just throw a wet towel on the floor. '
If your partner is subjected to such a tirade, you should not be surprised that it gets him on the palm of his hand.
Of course, this is not a bad thing, they just want everything to be in order.
If the men knew, the women might not have to complain so much.
Gossip
Some women like to clap and gossip, and there are whispers behind their backs, or even slanders, or alliances are forged.
Women are focused on relationships, which is why they like panting through such topics as - who, where, with whom, how and why.
Probably every one of us women has a bit of harmless gossip in store.
Hand on heart - this is probably common to all women.
But this is not to be confused with gossipers of the crudest calibre, to whom nothing and no one is sacred, who probably despise everyone around them and who pose a considerable danger, especially for women's collectives.
Jágr and Voráček helped Philadelphia to victory with their assistants
The ice hockey forward Jaromír Jágr played a big part in Philadelphia's 5-3 victory on the ice in Carolina with two assists in Monday's NHL game and is thus once again the most productive Czech player in the NHL.
The thirty-nine-year-old hockey star benefited in both cases from Claude Giroux, who added an assist and was named best player of the match.
Jágr's teammate Jakub Voráček also recorded two assists in the same game.
Jágr told reporters after the game that he had predicted a big night for Giroux.
'I told him before the game that he'd score a hat-trick today. '
That's kind of what I felt. '
"Every now and then you get that feeling," said Jágr, whose action gave Giroux a goal on the Flyers "first shot.
A little later, the second goal also had "a Czech trace."
Voráček grabbed the puck behind the Hurricanes "goal and passed it between the circles to Maxim Talbot.
A second before the final whistle of the first third, the home player Patrick Dwyer scored a short-handed one, but the second third belonged to the Flyers again.
Specifically Giroux.
He scored his third goal, then Wayne Simmonds deflected his shot for his fourth goal.
'I love playing with him, 'he said.
"I don't want to say he's the best player in the league, but he's definitely in the top three," Jágr said of his center.
"It would never have occurred to me in my life that at the end of my career I would play with such an ice hockey player as he did."
'I'm really happy about that. '
'I'm cutting my game back. '
"All these years in the NHL my teammates adjusted their game to me and now the tables are turned," Jágr smiled.
Carolina added drama to the game with goals from Tuoma Ruutua and once again Dwyer, who scored from a penalty shot, scored.
Matt Read averted any further complication by winning two-on-one.
"Excellent Pronger was still in our zone."
"He caught the puck, I picked up speed and (Read) moved to the far post."
"I tried to hit him and I am glad that it worked out," Voráček described the last goal of the match from his point of view.
The victory put Philadelphia atop the Eastern Conference.
Czech Montreal defenseman Jaroslav Špaček was injured in the game against Buffalo and retired in the second half because of an upper body injury.
In addition to their experienced Beck, the Candiens also lost their lead in the penalty shootout 2: 3.
Tomáš Plekanec could not convert one of the penalty shots.
More than the lost points probably hurt the coach of the home team the high illness-related failure in the defense - they played the game with only five defenders to the end.
'That's bad. '
'We finished the match with just one experienced player, the rest were young players, 'he said.
"But there is nothing we can do about it, we have to deal with it," Mr Martin said.
'With every change, one attack after the other and we didn't have anything to counter that. '
"We should have made the game easier and got the puck out of our third."
There were still reserves here, "said P. K. Subban, one of the defenders.
Czech goaltender Ondrej Pavelec fended off thirty Tampa Bay shots and contributed significantly to the 5-2 victory over Winnipeg.
Five different shooters were involved in the Jets' goals, which ended a streak of five straight losses.
Development of travel prices since 1989
Until 1989, there were only five approved state travel agencies in the former Czechoslovakia: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
At that time, travel agencies sold mainly trips to the socialist countries of the Eastern Bloc, whereas only the chosen ones were allowed to go to the West.
And so Czech tourists travelled to the Baltic Sea (to the German Democratic Republic - the GDR), to the Soviet Union (Sochi on the Crimean peninsula on the Black Sea), to Bulgaria and Romania on the Black Sea and to Hungary on the Balaton.
A clear exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when you were allowed to travel to Yugoslavia, then Yugoslavia took a pro-Western course and therefore travel to Yugoslavia was severely restricted.
A great paradox of those socialist times was that not even citizens of the Eastern Bloc (including the Czechoslovaks) were allowed to travel freely within the framework of the socialist countries.
For example, if a ČSSR citizen wanted to travel individually to Poland or even to the Soviet Union, he would need a so-called invitation letter, otherwise individual travel would not be possible.
Even back then, travel agencies offered trips to the West, but then you had to accept huge queues or spend the night in a sleeping bag in front of the travel agency, or at least have "good acquaintances" in the travel agency.
Even that was far from the end of the story.
The so-called foreign exchange pledge - the condition for leaving for the West - was only given to "politically reliable" people - the others were not allowed to travel at all.
After all, the Czechoslovak currency was not a freely convertible currency, so it would have been impossible to find the necessary financial resources (Western currency) for a trip to the West without a foreign exchange commitment.
The vast majority of Czechs therefore spent their holidays inland, no wonder that the Czechs bought innumerable weekend houses and dachas - a habit that continues to this day.
The Velvet Revolution of 1989 was followed by a travel revolution by the Czechs.
While until 1989 holidays in the GDR or Bulgaria were the measure of all things, last year the Czechs spent 4.5 million of their holidays abroad in countries all over the world.
An enormous paradox, of which we are no longer aware, is the fact that until 1989 it was impossible to travel to Croatia, currently the most popular holiday destination for the Czechs, because it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
Right from the beginning of the 90s of the last century, the foreign exchange obligation to neighbouring Western European countries was abolished, causing a huge wave of short visits, especially to Vienna in Austria and to Germany.
For a long time, the Czechoslovaks simply could not get enough of their travels to the West; everyone wanted to be there at least for a few days.
When travelling to Paris, Czech holidaymakers slept in tents in the park, because who would have had the money for an accommodation in a hotel or a guesthouse at that time?
A typical feature of Czechs travelling abroad at that time was a trunk full of canned goods, beer and sausage, etc.
Another important milestone was the introduction of the freely exchangeable Czech crown - after decades, our tourists were finally able to buy the Western currency freely.
Our standard of living, and therefore average salaries, increased, leading to another important moment in 1997.
Thanks to the increased demand for travel, travel agencies began to regularly prepare trips by charter flights after 1997, which made air travel incredibly cheaper compared to the past, thanks to the ability to negotiate volume discounts.
By the end of the 1990s, the Czechs, with the exception of the USA, already had currency-free payments with all the advanced countries of the world, which made travel even easier.
Another interesting moment in the history of "post-velvet" travel came in 2000, when, thanks to high demand, the first direct charter flight to an exotic country - Thailand - was launched.
Since then, direct charter aircraft with Czech passengers have been flying to sunny countries far away every year; this year, twelve exotic destinations have been flown directly from the Czech Republic.
About 100 thousand Czechs travel to exotic countries every year!
Another significant moment in the epoch that marked our "post-revolutionary" development came in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the USA abolished visa requirements for Czech tourists, which definitely placed our country among the most developed countries in the world.
In 2008, for the first time in their history, Czechs spent more than half of their holiday abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in their history spent more than CZK 15 thousand per capita on a single holiday, including costs at the resort.
The Annual General Meeting is supposed to find a new chairman - again a stalemate threatens.
Czech football has not had a chairman for almost five months and the threat is that Ivan Hašek's successor at the helm of the Czech Football Association (FAČR) will not even be known after the extraordinary general meeting in Nymburk on Thursday.
As yet, there is no agreement on the electoral rules under which elections are to be held.
And without them, there can be no vote at all on the three potential successors.
Three interested parties want to manage Czech football - Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
In June, Hašek resigned from his position, calling on his colleagues to unite and find a strong personality who could lead football in the future.
Only - in the era after Hašek, the old quarrels between the two chambers of the association, which could not agree on a common candidate, broke out again.
This became very clear on 16 September, when the new chairman was to be chosen.
The delegates of the General Assembly came to the People's House in the Prague district of Smíchov for free, because the negotiations did not lead to any result and it was not only about the election itself.
It was not even possible to agree on who actually has the right to vote at the plenary meeting - only the statutory representatives or the functionaries with power of attorney.
Agreement was reached, at least in part, on this single point, which was also helped by the recommendation of the Institute of State and Law, whose opinion was that representation on a power of attorney was not permissible.
However, disputes over electoral rules continue.
Nor did the Executive Committee shed any more light on the matter, at whose meetings - whether ordinary or extraordinary - there is, in principle, nothing else on the agenda at all.
Even if views on the election changed a few times, the key point remained the same.
The question is: how to proceed in the third round to avoid a stalemate?
"The point of contention is whether to proceed in accordance with the statutes or whether a completely different model should be found," stated Dušan Svoboda, one of the three vice-chairmen of FAČR, who represents professional football in management.
According to the statutory model, the winner in the third round is the candidate with the highest percentage of support in the chamber for which he is running.
Moravia is reportedly prepared to accept the compromise that the winner will be the candidate who receives the higher number of votes from both chambers.
The Czech side, on the other hand, insists on the condition that the winner receives at least a two-thirds majority in this percentage vote count.
"Then the two preliminary rounds will have no meaning at all, this mode would call into question the entire bicameral concept," Svoboda understands the objections of the Moravian side, which would find it best not to bend the electoral rules, but to vote according to the valid statutes.
Surprisingly, Tomáš Paclík agrees with this, even though it appears that of all the candidates, the statutory electoral rules are the most likely to suit Pelta.
"My wish is that as far as possible the election will be in accordance with the statutes."
"So that no nonsensical alternatives are devised, as at the last general meeting," declared the owner (of the football club) Victoria Plzeň, who is a candidate for the first time and who distinguished himself from Pelta in his statements.
But Pelta remains optimistic.
In his opinion, the new chairman will be known in Nymburk and he believes that the candidates will cooperate constructively in the future.
'The national team's possible qualification for the European Championship today would certainly help calm tempers. '
"When football rides the euphoric wave, the willingness to cooperate is greater," says the official from Jablonec, who brings the greatest experience of all three adepts, both on a professional and regional level.
Rajchl is more reserved.
"I hope for an agreement, but the situation is unfortunately ambiguous."
"This is not a matter between the people of Bohemia and Moravia, but there is some effort to" adjust "the regulations for their own purposes."
'That's why another blockage at the AGM is not out of the question. '
"I hope, however, that common sense will ultimately prevail," Rajchl said.
But there is not much time left for all sides to come to an agreement.
Some negotiations were supposed to take place directly in Montenegro, but who knows whether the football generality will be complete by the time the qualifiers are played.
The charter plane with which, among others, Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl were to fly to Podgorice could not take off at all in the morning in Prague due to a technical malfunction, and so they feverishly searched for a replacement variant, how to bring a part of the Executive Committee to the venue of the barrage game after all.
In the end, the meeting at ministerial level, which is supposed to take place on Wednesday, will probably be decisive.
Josef Dobeš, Minister of Education, Youth and Physical Education, would have liked to bring the divided parties within the country's largest sports federation to an agreement.
The stakes are high: state subsidies, the credibility of Czech football and also the forthcoming general meeting of ČSTV, which is supposed to show Czech sport the new direction after the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclík goes into the fight for the position of chairman because he does not see a suitable candidate
If Tomáš Paclík, the head of the Pilsen Footballers "Association, had been able to identify a strong candidate before the extraordinary general meeting, who would have fulfilled all his expectations about the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR), he would not have engaged in the fight for this top position at all.
'If there was a good candidate, I'd fight for him and not vote for him. '
"But in the current situation it was not possible to find such an adept," said Paclík ČTK.
The main reason for Paclík to enter the duel with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchl is to prevent the alleged favourite of the election, Pelta, from reaching the top of the FAČR.
Paclík also stresses that, if he wins, he intends to serve as chairman for only one year, i.e. until 2013, the date of the Annual General Meeting.
In the position of chairman, he would like to see an experienced top manager who is not too involved in football.
'I've spoken to some of the people in question personally. '
'It's hard to believe some people told me they didn't want to identify with Czech football at the moment.
"Such views would have been welcome to change," he said.
Most of all, Paclík is said to be disturbed by Pelta's association with the chairman of the Pilsen District Football Association Roman Berbr, a man with a controversial reputation who is regarded behind the scenes as a powerful lobbyist with the ability to influence delegate votes at general meetings.
For this reason, it is unacceptable for Pelta to hold the position of chairman.
'If he wins, it would preserve the status quo and it wouldn't happen in Czech football at all. '
"The support of Berbr, a clever businessman, would be doubly bad for football," Paclík stressed.
He also alludes to the fact that Pelta's name came up some time ago in connection with phone tapping investigations into a corruption affair, from which Pelta emerged with impunity.
'I don't know what prestige a Pelta win would bring to (football). '
"And how would we stand in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Paclík, who is a little more relaxed about his earlier statement that he would sell the Pilsen football club if Pelta became president.
Should Pacquiao win in Thursday's election, however, he could well envision working with Pelta in the future.
So does another candidate - Rajchl, whom Paclík supported before the October AGM, which ended in a fiasco.
'He (Pelta) would be the first one I'd go to. '
'He's got great ability. '
'I'd like to think of him as head of the national team, for example. '
'But I don't think he's capable of running the FA as a manager. '
"I don't stick my nose into things that I don't understand," said Paclík, who caused a stir in September by leading the dismissal of the referees "commission with Luďěk Macela, who was replaced by Dagmar Damková.
Paclík himself claims that he is equal to the role of the president of the association.
Citing his skills in managing private companies, he has also been the boss of Pilsen since last summer, which celebrated its first league triumph with his support in May.
'I've got the power to make a difference in the football environment and contribute to a certain cultivation of that. '
"In order to limit the influence of certain interest groups, which tend to influence disciplinary and appeal committees, which degenerates into unsavoury situations," said Paclík, who makes no secret of his antipathy towards, for example, Sparta boss Daniel Křetínský.
One of his priorities would be to strengthen relations between the FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which he would lobby political leaders for more money from the lottery tax to be channelled into sport.
'That's one of the key things the new chairman should be looking at. '
"When it comes to taxing gambling, as the political parties say, I understand their reasoning, but they also need to be very clear about where the money is going," he said.
Paclík does not regard his association with the Pilsen Club as a handicap either, although he stresses that the FAČR chairman must be "non-partisan."
Pelta in turn is connected with Jablonec, Rajchl with the Prague Dukla.
'It's not ideal. '
"It does not make much sense to me, however, to hypocritically transfer my shares in the Pilsen Club to a third party in order to return after a year and a half," Paclík clarified.
Pelta promised new FAČR bylaws that would prevent a stalemate in the future.
Two days before the general meeting of the Football Association, one of the candidates for the presidency, Miroslav Pelta, promised that, if elected, he would campaign for the FAČR to be given new statutes that would rule out disputes over the electoral rules in the future.
The official from Jablonec is confident ahead of Thursday's hearing in Nymburk and believes the campaign will certainly be defused if the Czech selection is successful.
Pelta had promised even before the unrealized election in September that if elected, he would focus on the national team and raising funds.
He decided only at the last moment to take part in the election before the last general meeting, so the two-month break might help him defend his ideas about running football and present them in a broader context.
'People at all levels are dedicated to football, they're impatient, so they expect the chairman to be known on Thursday. '
"He feels that it is high time for the association to be run by someone," says the man, who is mainly associated with the Jablonec club, but who also worked for many years at Sparta and on the executive committee.
That is another reason why he believes he has sufficient experience to lead Czech football.
He is convinced that the euphoria that prevailed at the time of Ivan Hašek is responsible for today's problems with the election.
"Unfortunately, at the Annual General Meeting in June, articles of association were approved that were not as perfect as everyone had assumed.
If they hadn't allowed different interpretations, we would have had a chairman by September, "Pelta said.
He used the revision of the most important document of the civic association as a lure for the delegates.
'If I become chairman, I'll take it personally and be ready to take personal responsibility if it doesn't work out. '
"It's a matter of principle, he can't be without it," Pelta said.
Furthermore, he does not try to differentiate himself from his opponents.
He had already announced earlier that he could envisage working with Jindřich Rajchl, whom he recognizes for his legal education, and he knows well that his opponent would be his first deputy.
He also did not attack Tomáš Paclík for a long time, who again did not leave a dry thread on Pelta.
He's been in football for over a year and he's already had some success. '
'But his attacks were disparaging and a lot of people were shocked by his campaign, 'she said.
"This is another reason why many now doubt his real character," Pelta told his opponent, who seems to be true to the proclamations he made back in September.
In his opinion, his most powerful weapon is knowledge of football, from the lowest echelons of the game to the national team.
And this should be the poster child for Czech football.
"I would also seek to end all affairs, from the Bohemian affair to the echoes of last year's corruption scandal."
"Right after that, I would go into negotiations with the private and state sectors to secure sufficient funding for the whole of football," the forty-six-year-old candidate told ČTK two months ago.
At the time, he also promised that his arrival at the top of Czech football would not mean any personnel purges.
"I would first have to familiarize myself with the work of all employees," he said in the direction of Strahov, where there is understandable nervousness due to the long period of anarchy.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios that accompany the upcoming Annual General Meeting, he believes that the delegates will not travel to Nymburk for nothing on Thursday.
'If the only contentious issue is how to vote in the third round, we'll get over it. '
"Football needs credibility and it will only regain it if it finally has a new leader," Pelta remains optimistic two days before what could be the defining day of his managerial career.
Rajchl promises that the FAČR will start to work hard under him
If the current vice-chairman Jindřich Rajchl is elected as the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic at the general meeting on Thursday, it is said that many people in the Association will be in a bad mood.
Rajchl promises that if elected, he will start to work hard.
He wants to introduce systemic changes and make the members of the executive committee responsible for individual football areas.
He also promised to solve Bohemian's case, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money into football and otherwise continue the work started by the previous chairman Ivan Hašek.
'As chairman, I want to dedicate myself to football as a whole, 'he said.
Starting with the international contacts to UEFA and FIFA, over the national selection, the professional football, up to competitive football for the youth. "
"This is not to say that I want to do everything on my own," Rajchl said in an interview for ČTK.
"I am a team player, so I would like to distribute the powers in the executive committee in a way that each member devotes himself to a certain area."
And I'm going to work hard to make sure that football moves forward with milestones in every segment. '
A lot of people wouldn't be happy about that because instead of just criticising other people's work, she would have to start working really hard herself, "he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement, I have considered not running at all.
'I'm known to work 20 hours a day. '
"But I need to know that it makes sense and that there are people behind me who are not constantly throwing clubs between my legs and questioning every step I take," he said, explaining why he hesitated.
'But a lot of people told me I shouldn't give up because other people would do the same. '
"This is trust that must not be squandered," he said.
Allegedly, he is also motivated to continue the work he started under Hašek.
'We've done a lot of work in two years and I don't want to throw that away. '
"Processes have been started that will probably only take effect in a few years, and I would be reluctant to see anyone stop them," he said, expressing his concern that if the other candidate - Miroslav Pelta - is elected, the situation could revert to the pre-Hašek times.
'I believe in systematics and that's something Mirek Pelta doesn't do. '
'Above all, there are people behind him who would do football in such a way that it would only be for the chosen few, 'he said.
I can be accused of some things, but not that I'm biased. '
'I'm trying to be objective. '
"I want football for everyone because then everyone will be well and not just the chosen ones," Rajchl said.
He also contradicts the claim that he is just a Czechs "president.
"Even though some people say the opposite, I really intend to do the best for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to consider whether the league should not be divided into a Czech and a Moravian part, the winners of which would then be promoted to the Premier League."
"Then it could not happen that today only three Moravian clubs play in the league, which is a problem especially for the young players in Moravia," says Rajchl.
Now that Tomáš Paclík, the head of the Pilsen club, has joined the fight for the position of chairman, Rajchl does not dare to assess his chances of being elected.
"I feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has elected me as its vice-chairman and now recognises that clear successes are behind me," said Rajchl, who also considers the saving of tens of millions of crowns on unfavourable contracts, the agreement of television contracts and the negotiations on the lottery law as his success.
On the other hand, he is partly to blame for the FA not pulling together.
While he says of Pelta that "he was disqualified from the outset to restore confidence in Czech football," he considers his second rival - Paclík - to be a strong candidate who really has something to offer football.
"No one can question that he has done an excellent job in Pilsen in just one year."
"If elected, he would probably continue the work initiated by Ivan Hašek, and he would obviously not fundamentally change the staffing of the commissions."
He certainly wouldn't want to turn things in his favor, "Rajchl said of his rival.
Europe's most beautiful pools
Jump into the blue
By Julia Stanek
Paddling pools with a UFO look, state-of-the-art pools in Budapest: Those who travel through Europe can experience their blue wonder - and after a city tour or a hike, relax their tired legs in whirlpools.
A book shows where wellness in water is most beautiful.
When Iris Meder went on a research trip in the past year and a half, one thing was not to be missed in her luggage: her swimsuit.
Lying backwards on the water, she looked up into artfully designed domes, swam towards marble cherubs waiting for her at the edge of the pool, and marvelled at meticulously restored Art Nouveau swimming pools.
If she liked a bath, she quickly wrote it down in her notebook - along with interesting details about the construction and history of the building.
Architectural historian Meder explored more than 200 swimming pools in this way - and now introduces them in her recently published book "Badefreuden": Volksschwimmhallen in Munich, historic bathing palaces in the Black Forest, "hardcore concrete buildings" in the Taunus.
Her "journey to the most extraordinary baths in Central Europe" took her through 13 countries: in addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and one city each in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old German is a true bathing culture enthusiast.
She doesn't have much to do with sport, says Meder - it's just different in the water.
It is annoying that swimming fans have to put up with blue tiles and the stench of chlorine, while joggers can breathe in the beguiling scent of spruce forests or listen to the cheerful chirping of birds in the park.
"I asked myself one day why swimming pools always have to be so ugly," says Meder, who lives in Vienna.
"So I started collecting beautiful baths."
Water surface doubles architecture
Splashing in the diving pool and essential sauna oils - the wellness factor in baths is so great because all the senses are catered for, according to Meder.
And if the builders have made an effort, swimming pools can be a real treat for the eyes: "Instead of a floor, bathrooms have a surface of water."
"On the one hand it is transparent, but on the other hand it reflects the beauty of the whole building."
Everything doubles visually: high vaults, colorful tiles, springboards.
The small-format illustrated book "Badefreuden" (bathing pleasures) conveys interesting facts about the architectural and cultural history of historical wellness oases on 190 pages - but above all, it makes you want to take a leap into the blue.
The pool collector Meder discovered remarkable specimens during her research in Hungary.
In addition to splendid spas such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi Bath in Budapest, she found nitrate-containing waters in a rustic karst cave (cave bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) and a thermal bath, the basins of which are filled with alkaline water and are located in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).
Spectacular views, on the other hand, are offered by many heated outdoor pools in Switzerland and Austria: while the entire city can be seen from Zurich's rooftop pool, the outdoor pool of a swimming pool in St. Anton offers views of the snow-capped Arlberg - and: in the steam bath, there is a window from which you can watch the goings-on on on the ski slopes.
Perhaps the most unusual pool design awaits bathers in Längenfeld: the Aquadome Ötztal looks like a UFO that has just landed in the Alps.
In winter, it steams from three open-top shells, while the mountains of the Ötztal valley rise into the sky in the background.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Not in every swimming pool did the pool collector Meder get the smell of chlorine in his nose.
Many thermal baths smell of sulphur, in the Árpád bath in the Hungarian Békescsaba there is such a strong smell of heating oil that it is hard to believe you have ended up in a health bath.
The smell comes from the alkali-hydrogen-carbonate-containing medicinal water, which is almost black and whose silt sticks to the skin as soon as you slide into the pool - a wellness experience of a special kind.
But there was one place where Iris Meder was disappointed in her search for beautiful bathing spots: when she wanted to visit the outdoor and sunbathing area in Luhatschowitz, Czech Republic, she found a cordoned-off area.
The bath, designed by architect Dušan Jurkovic in 1902, has since been closed.
When Meder glanced through the weathered windows of the red, white and yellow Art Nouveau building, she saw weeds growing between the tiles.
The decay, on the other hand, was counteracted in a magical swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
This bath has already been built in three phases; one can discover not only neo-Romanesque elements dating back to the time of its construction in 1844, but also a Moorish hall in the Alhambra style, added around 1900.
Since its careful modernisation in 1995, Palais Thermal has been the favourite pool of pool connoisseur Iris Meder - and not only because she originally hails from the Black Forest.
"It is quite an achievement to merge such different building styles into such a great unit," says Meder.
With such a palace, the dive in the thermal pool is apparently only a minor matter.
Agricultural speculation
Deutsche Bank lets commodities business shine through
By Christian Teevs
Is Deutsche Bank abandoning its agricultural commodities business?
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to examine the consequences of speculation for the world's poor.
Then, in January, the CEO wants to draw conclusions.

For German citizens, the situation is clear: according to a study, 84 percent of Germans find it unacceptable for banks to speculate on agricultural commodities such as wheat or maize.
Two-thirds of those surveyed even want Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions to withdraw from this business because it exacerbates the problems of the world's poorest.
This is the result of a Forsa survey commissioned by the consumer organisation Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
In it, the author Harald Schumann shows that bets on global commodity exchanges drive up prices - and that the banks are therefore partly to blame for the global hunger problem.
The campaign of consumer advocates is specifically directed against Deutsche Bank CEO Josef Ackermann, even if major banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act similarly.
Commodity bets were originally intended to hedge traders against price fluctuations.
But most experts now agree that gamblers have decoupled from supply and demand - and are profiting at the expense of the poorest.
Unlike its US competitors, Ackermann responded to the criticism by promising to investigate the allegations and saying that no deal was "worth risking Deutsche Bank's reputation."
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is currently examining the allegations in the Foodwatch report.
The audit is expected to be completed by the end of the year, when the results will be presented to the Executive Board of Deutsche Bank - along with recommendations on how to deal with them.
At the end of January, the head of the bank will announce the consequences.
The end result could be a reduction of the commodities business, or even a complete abandonment.
Ackermann tinkering with his image
Foodwatch chief executive Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but reiterated his criticism of the financial industry: "Betting on rising food prices is a stark reminder of how recklessly banks are damaging the public good today."
Ackermann now has a special duty as the top banking lobbyist.
"Deutsche Bank must remove all assets from its portfolio that use money to bet on food prices," Bode said.
"It does not matter whether Mr Ackermann is concerned about people suffering from hunger or the reputation of Deutsche Bank."
Ackermann's insight comes as a surprise at first glance, but it is clear that the Group CEO wants to present a perfect picture just a few months before he leaves office.
Deutsche Bank announced on Monday that the CEO will not join the Supervisory Board as planned.
By moving away from the controversial agricultural speculation, he could improve his image.
And he hardly needs to worry about potential losses - his successor would have to deal with that after all.
One in two would quit commodity investments
Foodwatch is trying to keep the pressure on the manager high.
So far, more than 30,000 internet users have taken part in the organisation's campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey for which the Forsa Institute surveyed 1,001 people on 7 and 8 November.
Just eleven percent therefore consider it legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer investments that bet on food prices.
Many bank customers would also draw personal consequences if they learned that their bank participates in such transactions: According to the survey, one in two would terminate all investments in which money flows into commodity speculation.
Forty-three percent would discourage acquaintances from such a bank, and 49 percent said they would consider canceling their account and switching to another institution.
21er Haus in Vienna
The relocated pavilion
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
An architectural history with highs, lows and happy endings: The Austrian World Exhibition Pavilion in Brussels in 1958 won prizes, became a museum in Vienna, stood empty and decayed.
Now it is being reopened as an exhibition centre.
If one raves about modern post-war architecture, clear shapes, glass halls, bold curves and new building materials that are typical of the belief in technical progress, then the Austrian pavilion designed by architect Karl Schwanzer for the 1958 Brussels World Exposition is an apt and famous example.
s pavilion was awarded the Grand Prix d'Architecture for its light and floating steel-glass construction.
The building is still considered a milestone in contemporary architecture.
He made the architect so well known that he also built Austria's pavilion at the next World's Fair.
In 1973 he finally became internationally famous with his legendary BMW four-cylinder house plus a bowl-like annex in Munich.
The pavilion, which was planned as a temporary exhibition building, was erected in the Swiss Garden near Vienna's Südbahnhof station after the World Exhibition, rebuilt and opened in 1962 as a museum of the 20th century - it was called the "20er Haus."
However, the building was neither spatially nor technically suitable as a museum - no walls for hanging art, no good climate.
Nevertheless, it was used until contemporary art in Vienna got a new house.
Since 2001, the building has stood empty and come down more and more.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has rebuilt the pavilion, it is now called "21er Haus" and will be used as a museum for contemporary art in the future.
On Tuesday evening, the Belvedere Museum, to which the building belongs, will open its first exhibition there - a stroke of luck in every respect.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, who became the new director of the Austrian Gallery Belvedere in 2007, pushed through the new beginning.
Husslein-Arco, an art historian with a doctorate and a considerable career as a figure skater in her youth, later at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and as founding director of the Museum der Moderne Salzburg, pushed through the renovation with politicians and conservationists, raised public funds and private sponsorship money and determined its use.
In addition to contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba were to be exhibited by the foundation of the same name, there was to be a café and a bookshop, and an office building was to be built.
Strict supervision, small budget
Krischanitz was the ideal cast for the performance.
Not only because he had sensitively rebuilt and expanded Joseph Olbrich's Secession in Vienna and won the competition, but because he studied with Schwanzer at the Vienna University of Technology and the pavilion was an "enormously important place" for him, where he had viewed the exhibitions "almost every weekend."
He knew the original design, and he knew the problems of the building, which had already lost its generosity and lightness upon its transfer to Vienna and its conversion.
There were far bigger problems with the current conversion: the building was "an energy extractor," says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glass façade were replaced, glass fibre reinforced insulating glass was used and the glass roof was replaced by special safety glass.
Refrigeration bridge steel girders have been reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled ceilings have been rehabilitated.
Two basements provided space for the new use, a lowered light trench between the house and the street provides the lighting, a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new building, but still the light Schwanzer Pavilion.
The original exterior doors have remained, the house is painted in the old red-brown anti-rust colour.
And the cinema hall is exactly as it used to be.
And all this under the strict supervision of the monument authority and with a small budget.
"Often a material had to be found that was good and cheap and also pleased the monument protection office," says Krischanitz, pointing to a rough floor in the basement.
Despite all constraints, problems and modifications, the building has remained flexible and light.
It was difficult with the pavilion, "which came from Brussels," Krischanitz said recently, a typical "drop-in-the-city story."
Such architecture is "always in the wrong place" and nevertheless wants to "awaken a real consciousness."
In this case, however, the 21er Haus is not in the wrong place, because an urban stroke of luck has occurred: the completely new "Hauptbahnhofsquartier," with office and residential buildings, is currently being built around the Schweizer Garten.
And another stroke of luck may yet occur: the 21er Haus could be reinforced by another Krischanitz building, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg has bought the Berlin Temporäre Kunsthalle, and it is rumoured that she is already negotiating with the city for a neighbouring location in the Schweizer Garten.
Rail plans multi-million winter crisis package
The railway has devised a crisis plan to prevent train cancellations in the winter.
The number of employees is to be doubled.
It costs millions.
In the fight against winter-related train cancellations and delays, Deutsche Bahn is spending an additional 70 million euros this year, according to a newspaper report.
The "Bild" newspaper reported in advance, citing an internal crisis plan, that investments totalling around 300 million euros are planned for 2015.
In this way, a better availability of vehicles and rail network should be achieved even in extreme weather conditions.
Among other things, it is planned to double the number of internal and external employees for removing snow from railway installations and platforms to 16,000.
The aim is to clear platforms of snow and ice within four to five hours of the start of operation and 90 percent of the turnouts required for operation.
Two months ago, after a top meeting with the government and industry, the head of the railway, Rüdiger Grube, had warned of train cancellations and delays this winter as well.
Last winter, the railway experienced considerable problems in passenger transport, as it lacked reserves in difficult weather conditions, among other things.
Numerous new regional trains have been waiting for years for approval from the Federal Railway Authority.
There is also a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
For years, Deutsche Bahn has had to have axles of ICE trains inspected much more frequently in the workshop after an ICE train in Cologne's main station broke its axle.
Deutsche Bank to pay multi-million dollar fine in US
Following the turmoil surrounding CEO Josef Ackermann, new trouble is coming from the USA: Deutsche Bank has to pay a fine of millions.
As if the problems at home were not enough for Deutsche Bank, the industry giant is now catching up with its past in the US: in a settlement, the Frankfurt-based institute is paying 145 million dollars (106 million euros) to settle disputes over the failure of five large cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
It's about selling mortgage securities.
The NCUA, the financial market regulator, has accused a number of large banks of tricking the cooperative banks into buying the financial products with false promises; they have downplayed the risks.
Such securities plummeted in value during the financial crisis, dragging banks down.
"We are satisfied that we were able to resolve the issue without the parties having to go to court," said a Deutsche Bank spokesman in New York.
The bank did not admit guilt in the settlement.
That includes Citigroup, which agreed to pay $20.5 million.
NCUA chair Debbie Matz welcomed the concessions from the two money houses.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for US cooperative banks and steps in when they fail to protect customer deposits.
The NCUA is trying to get compensation for the multi-billion dollar damage caused.
The current settlements are the first of their kind.
The regulator had also reached out to other big banks, suing JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs over the summer.
The mortgage securities in question are so-called mortgage-backed securities.
These are based on home loans.
When the US housing bubble burst in 2007, a host of financial firms were doomed.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the US investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Although events have been going on for a number of years, a strong wind is currently blowing against the banks in the USA.
Investors and regulators have brought innumerable lawsuits seeking redress or penalties for wrongdoing.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has triggered the biggest wave of lawsuits.
It accuses 18 major international banks of defrauding two US state-owned mortgage lenders, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, of around $200 billion in mortgage business.
Deutsche Bank is also facing a lawsuit from the FHFA over several deals totaling $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The regulator wants Frankfurt residents to be liable for "substantial losses," though it did not give an exact sum.
Deutsche Bank had rejected the claims as baseless and said it would defend itself.
Warren Buffett joins IBM with $10 billion
Finance guru Buffett is investing heavily in IT company IBM.
He has bought more than $10 billion worth of shares since March.
Until now, the great American investor Warren Buffett had always declared that he would not invest in IT and computer companies, because it was difficult to predict their long-term performance.
However, he has now read IBM's annual reports and changed his mind about investing in the industry.
He should have understood much earlier that IBM primarily provides services and procures computer systems for the IT departments of other companies.
An investment from Warren Buffett is considered a knighthood in the financial world.
As a result, the IT veteran IBM can now call itself "Sir IBM."
Buffett revealed on US business channel CNBC that he has bought $10.7 billion worth of IBM shares since March.
His investment holding, Berkshire Hathaway, has become one of IBM's largest shareholders with a 5.5 percent stake.
Buffett said that not even IBM knew about the commitment until now.
He praised the management, which even in the economic crisis had managed to make a tidy profit.
"They did a great job," Buffett said of the strategy.
IBM has long relied on lucrative IT services such as the operation of data centers.
The more than 100-year-old computer pioneer also offers software and consulting as well as powerful corporate computers.
Buffett had previously shunned technology companies.
He says he only invests in companies whose business he understands.
Instead, Buffett reached out to, say, a cargo railroad, a lubricant manufacturer, or mechanical engineers.
His holding company Berkshire Hathaway owns shares in a number of large corporations such as Coca-Cola and Munich Re, formerly Munich Re, in addition to around 80 of its own subsidiaries.
The 81-year-old had taken over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and wisely invested in making it one of the most valuable companies in the world.
Yet his lifestyle is modest.
He is therefore a cult figure for countless investors around the world.
His almost unerring sense of money-making has earned him the nickname "The Oracle of Omaha."
IBM shares rose 1 percent in premarket trading after the Buffett investment was announced.
"Big Blue," as IBM is also known, is worth more than 220 billion dollars on the stock market, making it one of the most valuable technology companies in the world, along with Apple and Microsoft.
But Buffett said he did not want to join Microsoft.
Founder Bill Gates is said to be a close friend.
The threat is palpable
After the revelation of the "Zwickau cell," Turkish media cast doubt on the German rule of law.
One newspaper even talks of a "bloody ideology" that is now reviving.
The murders of eight small businessmen of Turkish origin and one Greek businessman between 2000 and 2006 had a far-right background.
To this news is reacted in Turkey and within the German-Turkish population in Germany with fear and concern.
For many German-Turks, this is the return of a spectre long thought dead: since the arson attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no comparable violence against Turks with a far-right background.
That there is xenophobia in Germany was nevertheless never in question.
However, the uncovered far-right extremist network reveals dimensions whose dimensions are far from foreseeable.
"Is the bloody ideology reviving?" ran the headline in the Internet edition of the Turkish newspaper Haberturk.
The newspaper "Sabah," on the other hand, stresses that one of the perpetrators is said to have been a member of the Constitutional Protection Committee and expresses concern that the German authorities may also be involved in the radical right-wing swamp.
The Turkish community in Germany reacted prudently: at the weekend, it commemorated the victims of racist violence with a vigil in front of the Brandenburg Gate.
Only two weeks earlier, the Turkish community in Berlin, together with German and Turkish politicians, had commemorated the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement.
The togetherness was staged in cheerful colours - as a story of success.
The reports of some Turkish media seem like a slap in the face: "Germany's present for the fiftieth anniversary" is the title of an article in the Turkish internet platform "Haber X," which reports on the background of the series of murders.
Even the German edition of "Hürriyet" does not miss the opportunity to make this mental connection.
"It's starting to stink," is the title of Ahmet Külahci's column.
In it, he emphasises that people have been murdered who have paid taxes and whose work has made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany.
Extremely critically in German-Turkish Internet forums the procedure of the police and their later search success is discussed.
The authors wonder why the German authorities did not come up with the idea much earlier to look for suspects in extreme right-wing circles.
Some are willing, at least rhetorically, to take drastic measures: "If we continue to be sloppy here, the migrants have no choice but to defend themselves and arm themselves."
'That's probably the best way to protect yourself. '
"Inner peace in Germany depends very much on the goodness of the enlightenment and the appropriateness of the punishment of the entire network," writes "Selen."
The attacks in Mölln and Solingen in the nineties made clear what it means when inner peace in Germany is in danger.
The photo of the fire ruins of Solingen is deeply embedded in German and Turkish memory.
Because no other event showed the Turks living here more clearly that there is a tangible threat, and the Germans that mistrust and distance can lead to right-wing violence.
The attacks, however, heightened the sense of "us" on the Turkish side.
Do not repeat the mistakes of the past
The Turkish press criticised the failure of German policy after the attacks: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the arson attack in Solingen, he sent a telegram of condolence to the Turkish President, but at the funeral ceremony in Cologne, he was represented by his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel listed in his speech how many contributions the local Turks made.
It is as if a person's worth is calculated by the amount of tax he pays.
The current coverage of the Turkish media once again shows how deep the mistrust of many German Turks in the local rule of law has been ever since.
Alongside the efforts to comprehensively investigate and re-evaluate far-right terrorism in Germany, frank words are needed this time.
The scandal bank of Lake Zurich
Europe's most adventurous bank is not based in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
UBS almost went bankrupt in the financial crisis and has been sliding from one crisis to the next ever since.
Now a German is to judge it.
Axel Weber certainly did not think so.
After his spectacular departure from the head of the Bundesbank, it was announced in July that he would take up an almost equally spectacular new job in 2013: Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Swiss major bank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative career step.
Axel Weber publicly rejoiced, praised Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its newfound solidity, and dropped friendly remarks about future colleagues.
"UBS has made the turnaround."
"I am looking forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
By September, however, it was clear that everything was going to be very different.
A trader at UBS in London had bypassed all of the bank's hedging systems and gambled away around 1.7 billion euros.
UBS CEO Oswald Grübel, a banker renowned not only in Switzerland, had to go.
The Chairman of the Board of Directors of UBS has since also been regarded as weak - and everyone is asking: When will Axel Weber finally arrive?
It has already been announced that Weber will be able to advise the Bank from February 2012 onwards.
And he will take over as chairman of the board as early as May - not just in 2013, the bank said on Tuesday.
It's going to be tough for Axel Weber.
He is not a banker, but an economics professor and central banker, and would certainly have needed some familiarization.
At a stroke, he then assumes responsibility for the strategy of a bank that has just once again proved that it has long since earned the title of "Europe's biggest scandal bank."
On the one hand, UBS is huge - until recently it was the largest asset manager in the world - and on the other, it has been sliding from one scandal to the next for years.
Nothing, it seems, is spared the once-proud Swiss bank.
It started in the financial crisis.
Until 2007, UBS had an excellent reputation.
She had combined the image of a secretive and solid, but also sophisticated Swiss asset manager with ambitious goals: she wanted to become a major player in investment banking as well.
In 2007, for example, UBS managed $1.6 trillion more money from wealthy clients than any other bank in the world.
On the other hand, as an investment bank, it had advanced into the league of the world's largest banks.
It made an impression.
Hans Geiger, a former banker and later long-time banking professor in Zurich, says: "I always presented UBS to my students as a model of a good bank."
"From today's point of view, one wonders: How could I have been so wrong?"
He was terribly wrong.
It was first revealed in 2007 that something was seriously wrong at UBS.
In the middle of the year, CEO Peter Wuffli, who had previously been regarded as a highly intellectual and equally ingenious banker, surprisingly resigned.
A few months later, you could see why he had left.
The bank's investment arm had gambled on subprime securities and had to write off billions.
In order to shoulder this burden, UBS announced a capital increase of no less than 13 billion Swiss francs.
In return, it actually found investors, albeit some of whom, until a short while ago, some would have racked their noses at: an opaque Asian sovereign wealth fund from Singapore and an Arab sovereign wealth fund so secretive that one did not even know its name.
But that was just the first blow.
Things got worse in April 2008.
The bank had to announce new losses of billions. Marcel Ospel, Chairman of the Board of Directors, who in 2006 was still the second best paid member of the Board of Directors in Switzerland, resigned.
In October 2008, the disaster ensued: UBS was on the verge of collapse due to its bad investments in the financial crisis and had to be bailed out by the state.
The National Bank bought UBS for tens of billions of problematic securities, and the Swiss Confederation gave six billion Swiss francs for a convertible bond, through which it could become a co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was shocked - because it noticed how dramatic it is for a small country to host such large banks.
After all, UBS's balance sheet total in 2007 was more than five times Switzerland's economic output (see chart).
"Once again, we couldn't save UBS," says Geiger, a banking analyst.
The first disaster was followed by the second.
Only a few months later, UBS capitulated in a tax dispute with America, agreeing to release the data of wealthy clients who may have evaded taxes with the help of the bank.
It also agreed to pay $780 million in restitution for unwarranted profits from those deals, along with a penalty.
In doing so, UBS more or less openly confessed to having assisted in tax evasion.
At the same time, it lost something that had always been its capital in the competition for rich customers: the aura of secrecy.
After the scandal, Swiss banking secrecy was no longer the same.
This was followed by the resignation of the CEO and Chairman of the Board of Directors.
And the exodus of customer money.
Within a few months, the bank had lost credibility in both key areas of its business: investment banking due to false speculation and asset management due to tax evasion.
And just as things quietened down, just when it was thought that UBS would be able to do it again, here follows this unfortunate trader story: a single trader gambles away 1.7 billion euros before the bank notices that something is wrong.
And it is becoming apparent that risk management in investment banking is still not working.
"The Adoboli case has shown that risk control has changed too little," said Martin Janssen, an economist and finance professor at the University of Zurich's banking institute.
Even the CFO of a large German bank is certain: "The problem for UBS is that it does not have a grip on risk control."
Yet it was precisely the idea of prudence with which Swiss bankers had long ago embarked to become custodians of the world's great fortunes: not too great risks, but security for money - even if the world were to collapse beyond the Alpine republic.
The safes of the Swiss banks had become a symbol of unshakeable reliability, just as Lindt and Sprüngli had become symbols of particularly fine chocolate.
UBS's Zurich headquarters fit the stereotype of the dignified Swiss private bank - it's just a bit bigger.
The location is classic.
The bank is headquartered on Züricher Bahnhofstraße, which leads directly from the main station to Lake Zurich, which is framed by the snow-capped peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are magnificent, the shop rents are among the highest in Europe.
Jewellers such as Tiffany's can be found here between traditional Swiss shops such as Confiserie Sprüngli.
Swiss banks have resided here for centuries: from the National Bank to the palace of Credit Suisse to elite private banks such as Julius Baer.
You enter the UBS reception hall through a heavy revolving door.
Inside, the walls are covered in marble, in front of them are thick leather chairs, next to the bank logo a large sign indicating the "safe."
UBS knows what its customers are looking for: security.
However, both major Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, eventually supplanted this idea of a Swiss bank - or betrayed it, according to the head of a small Swiss private bank.
He prefers not to read his name in the newspaper because, like all Swiss bankers, he does business with the two big banks.
UBS has become far too big, he says - especially in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons have also spread.
The Swiss would have nothing more to say there.
"And if they do, they have long since adapted to the customs of the Anglo-Saxons."
Indeed, it was Anglo-Saxon investment banking that transformed UBS, giving it first high profits, and then the debacle: no European financial institution has lost as much money in the subprime jungle as the Swiss big bank.
On October 15, 2008, the catastrophe became visible.
"That Wednesday, the governing coalition of the small country of seven million decided on the largest bailout in its nation's history," the author Lukas Hässig writes in his book "The UBS Crash."
The politicians approved up to 68 billion Swiss francs, or around 45 billion euros, to rescue the big bank, which is facing bankruptcy.
How could this have happened?
If you talk to Swiss bankers, they see the problem mainly in the size of UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three major Swiss banks merged to form a formidable group.
The result was a bank that was already too big for little Switzerland at the time of the merger - and continued to grow.
It helped that the two different forerunners of UBS complemented each other: a rich but sleepy bank with a focus on asset management in Zurich and a poorer but already more internationalised bank.
Suddenly, the internationalized investment bankers got cheap money to turn a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with this rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, Chief Executive Officer of UBS from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then Chairman of the Board of Directors.
"I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team," says banking researcher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the highly intellectual, humble man who understands a lot about models and statistics, and Ospel, the belly man who has worked his way up from banking to the very top."
But in the end Ospel relied on Wuffli.
And Wuffli probably made a crucial mistake in the end: "He thought his models were reality," Geiger says.
'It's a tragic case. '
Tragic, perhaps.
What is clear is that exuberance came before the fall.
UBS employees clearly remember the executive meetings at which CEO Wuffli repeatedly uttered the same slogan: "Get rid of Goldman Sachs."
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
She topped the league tables, the league tables that documented the success of the banks of the time.
That's where UBS wanted to go, to the very top.
She had already succeeded in a few steps.
It was at the top of the foreign exchange and share market.
However, management consultants who were appointed highlighted a weakness: in the international interest rate business, in the banking language of fixed income, there was a huge gap with the largest banks.
UBS has loopholes in American mortgage products, he said.
To close this gap, UBS embarked on an adventure that almost cost it its existence.
Hungry for growth, both the bank itself and a hedge fund set up before it invested in American subprime assets.
It became a huge machine, packaging and passing on securities on American mortgage loans - but also retaining risks.
Even when other banks were already looking to exit.
"Even in the summer of 2007, when the American real estate market was on fire, UBS bought there," says banking expert Geiger.
So great the euphoria, so deep the fall.
One manager after another had to go when the clean-up efforts turned out to be more difficult than expected.
Items at UBS have become an ejection point and remain shaky to this day.
Whoever runs the big bank now has an almost impossible job.
He needs to find a strategy for a bank that has lost all the obvious business models.
Banking researcher Geiger already has an idea: stop investment banking, concentrate on asset management, return to Swiss roots.
The Bank does not want to go quite that far (yet).
But investment banking is to shrink sharply, that much is already clear.
Next Thursday, the new head of the bank, Sergio Ermotti, will present his future strategy to the world.
The 51-year-old Italo-Swiss was only meant to be a temporary solution when the bank unexpectedly parted ways with predecessor Grübel.
In the meantime, he has prevailed: he is to lead the business of UBS on a permanent basis, the Zurich-based bank announced on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to bring the investment bank back to where it was in the mid-1990s.
He is cutting 3,500 jobs.
But that will not be enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
How does she want to make money?
These are the questions Axel Weber must be asking himself right now.
Publicly, he has so far said only that he and his wife will first look for an apartment in Zurich.
Next year.
Fears of recession in Europe weigh on U.S. stock market
The threat of recession in Europe has taken the courage out of US investors at the start of the week.
The changes of government in Athens and Rome remained without clout.
Curtailed industrial production on the continent nipped hopes of stabilizing the debt crisis in the bud.
The general relief at the changes of government in Rome and Athens could not prevail.
The euro fell against the dollar.
The Italian and Greek glass was considered half-full last week, not half-empty - but now the problems are coming to the fore again, said Mark Luschini of Janney Montgomery Scott.
Above all, financial assets were on the sales slips.
The Dow Jones industrial average was down 0.6 percent at 12,078 points at close of trading.
In the course of trading, the market barometer oscillated between 12,027 and 12,170 points.
The broader S & P 500 index closed at 1251 points, down 1 percent.
The Nasdaq composite index lost 0.8 percent to end trading at 2,657 points.
In Frankfurt, the Dax was down 1.2 percent at 5985 points.
Industry in the 17 euro countries has significantly reduced its production and is preparing for the end of the recovery.
Businesses produced two percent less in September than the previous month, according to Eurostat, the statistics office.
That made U.S. investors skeptical: "We're not an island, we're dependent," said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
Europe will not be able to get out of recession so quickly, and there are also further signs of weakness in the banks.
Investment legend Warren Buffett only confirmed this caution: it is not yet clear whether Europe is strong enough to do everything it can to end the crisis, he said in a CNBC interview.
That is why, in his view, it is too early to invest in European government bonds or banks.
Instead, Buffett jettisoned a decades-old principle and entered the US technology industry.
His investment of more than $10 billion in IBM bolstered the company's share price and bucked the trend in trading, initially trading just under one per cent higher.
The paper closed virtually unchanged at $187.35.
Buffett says he paid an average of $170 apiece and now holds 5.5 percent.
The share price of his investment firm Berkshire Hathaway lost 1.3 per cent.
Shares of Bank of America fell sharply, down 2.6 percent, outpacing the market.
The house will take almost all of the rest of its stake in China Construction Bank, raising $6.6 billion.
In particular, the bank wants to use the net profit from the business to cushion its capital ratio and thus comply with tougher regulatory requirements.
Aircraft maker Boeing gained, limiting losses in the Dow.
The stock gained 1.5 per cent after the group secured the biggest order in its history.
Airline Emirates ordered 50 long-haul 777 aircraft on Sunday, valuing the order at $18 billion.
Including options on 20 more planes, the total is as much as $26 billion.
About 710 million shares changed hands on the New York Stock Exchange.
719 values increased, 2281 decreased and 79 remained unchanged.
On the Nasdaq, 630 shares closed up, 1913 down and 82 unchanged on sales of 1.38 billion shares.
Smart Crows Spread in Cities
In many places, seed crows are regarded as "problem birds": however, the highly intelligent animals can no longer be driven out of cities, experts claim.
Some like them, others want to get rid of them very quickly: Crows have been part of the cityscape for centuries, but in many municipalities residents complain about the dirt and noise of the animals.
A remedy for the "problem birds" is not yet in sight.
Seed crows are no longer possible to get out of the cities, experts said at the first crow symposium in Leer, East Frisia.
There, experts from all over Germany discussed possible ways out.
You are looking for alternatives in the cities
Conservationists also attributed the problems in cities to the rural exodus of specially protected seed crows: Chemical use in agriculture is increasingly destroying traditional habitats.
Hunting, increasing cultivation and the felling of typical breeding trees made life difficult for the birds.
Crows are under conservation.
There are large colonies with more than 600 breeding pairs in Soest in Westphalia, in the northwest in Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen as well as in Leer.
There, in 2005, a controversial project for the mass killing of crows in the county made negative headlines.
Critics had described trapping the animals in bird traps and killing them with clubs as particularly brutal.
"Normal expulsion, degradation, is useless," stated the town and landscape planner Werner Klöver from Leer.
Spraying away nests with water or felling trees often has undesirable consequences, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
"The animals move away, large colonies split up and disperse in other places."
Grief is only conceivable as an exception at hospitals, nursing homes or schools.
'We have to live with them, we can't get them away. '
Without the surrounding area the problem in the cities cannot be solved, said mayor Wolfgang Kellner from Leer.
It is conceivable that a combination of mutilating the animals from sensitive living areas and attraction offers could be used to resettle them in other places.
On the other hand, psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens called for a completely different way of dealing with animals: "After all, we are best able to tolerate a pimple on the face with self-confidence."
Jürgens co-founded the Ascheberg Crow Trail in Schleswig-Holstein, where signs provide information about the lives of the highly intelligent seed crows.
The project has already been accepted by tourists.
Jürgens also had his own opinion on the criticism of the noise of the birds: "There is a lot of communication, they have a lot to say to each other."
The intelligence and dexterity of the animals are legendary: Seed crows not only use aids to get a treat, but also make their own tools as aids.
Behavioural researchers at the University of Cambridge recently tested how far the birds' intelligence reaches on four rooks.
In an experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to use stones to bring down a scaffold in order to reach a moth larva.
Without much training, they purposefully recognized the size and shape of a stone in order to cause the platform to collapse.
In a second attempt, the smart crows then had to solve a trickier problem.
In a vertically positioned cylinder, the researchers placed a small bucket with a moth larva.
The birds could not reach their prey with the beak.
However, the researchers had placed pieces of wire in front of them.
From this, all four animals formed a hook, with the help of which they then fished the bucket on the handle out of the tube.
Three of the four Seed Crows even managed to do so straight away.
Cristiano Ronaldo shoots Portugal to Euro 2012 glory
The hopes of the Bosnians and the Turks for a coup failed to materialize.
Favourites Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and also Ireland are in the Euro 2012 squad.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have all made the play-offs for the 2012 European Championship in Poland and Ukraine.
Led by the twice successful superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8th, 53rd) Portugal beat Bosnia-Herzegovina 6: 2 (2: 1) and made the fifth European Championship participation in a row perfect after the 0: 0 from the first leg.
In the play-off second leg with underdogs Montenegro, the Czechs won 1: 0 (0: 0), after the first leg (2: 0) had already been a clear thing.
Croatia also did not let anything burn during the 0: 0 against Turkey, Ireland got a loose 1: 1 (1: 0) against Estonia.
Nani (24th), Helder Postiga (72nd, 82nd) and Miguel Veloso (80th) also scored for Portugal.
Former Wolfsburg striker Zvjezdan Misimovic (41st) and captain Emir Spahic (65th) scored twice for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic saw the yellow-red card (54th).
Bosnia had already lost to Portugal in the play-offs for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.
Portugal got off to a flying start at the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon.
Ronaldo whipped in a free-kick from around 30 yards for an early lead.
A good quarter of an hour later Nani showed his long-range qualities and scored from 25 yards to make it 2-0.
The Bosnians, who failed to score in the first half hour, had their first clear chance through goalkeeper Edin Dzeko.
The former Wolfsburg player from English league leaders Manchester City put a header on the underside of the crossbar, but the ball did not cross the goal line (33rd).
Jiracek hits for Czech Republic
Afterwards, the focus was on referee Wolfgang Stark from Ergolding.
After an attack against Helder Postiga in the Bosnian penalty area Stark decided on Swallow and showed the Portuguese the yellow card (36th).
On the opposite side, Stark made a controversial save after a move from Fabio Coentrao, which Misimovic converted safely.
But after the break, the 2004 runner-up made things clear with four goals.
Petr Jiracek put an end to any doubts for the Czech Republic in the 81st minute.
This is the fifth time in a row that the 1976 European champion has gone to the European Championship.
The team of coach Michal Bilek with Bundesliga legionnaires Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1. FC Nuremberg) was also lucky and had to survive a second of shock in the early stages.
Goalkeeper Petr Cech prevented a possible own goal by Tomas Sivok with a last-minute reflex save.
Montenegro had their best chance when the duo of Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic shot narrowly past Cech's goal from the edge of the penalty area in the 40th minute.
After the break the crossbar had to be saved for the already beaten world class goalkeeper of the Czechs, again the striker of FC Seoul had pulled away (50th).
The goal just before the end made it all clear.
Turkey, meanwhile, missed out on the football miracle of Zagreb.
Four days after drawing 0-3 in Istanbul, the Turks failed to get beyond a 0-0 in Zagreb.
While national coach Guus Hiddink almost certainly has to vacate his place on the bench of the World Cup third team of 2002, the Croatians can be pleased about their fourth participation in a European Championship final.
In front of 31,000 spectators in the Maksimir Stadium, the Turks almost got off to a dream start.
Selcuk Inan only hit the post with a long-range shot in the seventh minute and attacker Kazim Kazim was unable to sink the rebound into the goal.
But after that moment of shock, Croatia took more and more control.
Even after the break, the Croatians did not let anything get in the way.
Mario Mandzukic of VfL Wolfsburg, who replaced Dortmund's Ivan Perisic in the 62nd minute, was joined by Bundesliga regulars Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt).
Trapattoni heads to the Euros
In Dublin, the Irish celebrated their first European Championship appearance since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward gave coach Giovanni Trapattoni's team the lead in the 32nd minute after the 4-0 win in the first leg.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57th) equalised for the visitors.
Ireland pressed from the start but had to wait until the 23rd minute before Robbie Keane of Los Angeles Galaxy had the first good chance.
Only at the last moment did the Estonian back team prevent the possible lead goal.
But in the 32nd minute it happened.
Ward was on hand to push the ball over the line for a 1-0 lead after a botched defence by netminder Pavel Londak.

SAP to double number of employees in China
Europe's largest software manufacturer SAP is investing billions in China over the next few years and wants to almost double the number of its employees in the country.
About two billion dollars (about 1.5 billion euros) are expected to flow by 2015, the Dax group announced on Tuesday.
"We will create additional research and development facilities and hire staff accordingly," co-chief executive Bill McDermott announced at a customer exhibition in Beijing.
The workforce is expected to grow from around 2500 to 4500.
The number of branches of the world market leader in enterprise software will double from five to ten or eleven.
So far, SAP has a presence in Beijing, Shanghai, Guanzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
Approximately 4000 of the more than 176,000 SAP customers worldwide are located in the boom country.
The growth plans in China are also an important component of the Dax Group's 2015 strategy.
SAP aims to increase sales to 20 billion euros by 2015.
Last year, the Walldorf-based company generated revenues of around 12.5 billion euros.
The software provider, which employs 55,000 people around the world, is currently operating at an all-time high.
SAP has been active in China for 20 years.
"Now we want to expand our activities," McDermott said.
"Our goal is to promote sustainable growth in China, supported by comprehensive education."
Mass slaughter on a personal level
With sensitivity and generosity, Peter Englund's new book "Beauty and Horror: A History of the First World War, Nineteen Fates" begins with a long list of protagonists that takes you to heart.
Here is a tip on how to proceed: carefully cut out this page and make it your bookmark.
You will get to know these people very well in England's novel, and these protagonists will function as your GPS, as a beacon in those few moments when, like England's men and women, you are lost in the fog of war and bereft of illusions.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize in Literature.
He has written an unusual book, which he describes, not inaccurately, as "a work of anti-history."
It contains few big names, important treaties, or famous battles. There are few ambassadors, frenzied reporters, or discussions about tactics and equipment.
It's not so much a book about what happened, he explains, as "a book about what it was like." It's about "feelings, impressions, experiences and moods."
"Beauty and Terror" brings together the wartime experiences of 20 more or less inconspicuous men and women on both sides of the war, from schoolgirls and botanists to mountaineers, doctors, ambulance drivers and office workers.
Some of these people become heroes.
Some become prisoners of war, lose limbs, go mad or die.
Each of these lives flickers like votive candles in a church, some come on top, while others go out.
England's book differs from the usual history books.
It also corrects the notion that the First World War was just the devastating war of positions on the Western Front.
"Beauty and Terror" travels with an expert's view over other theatres of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
On the soldiers in this book fall beehives, one celebrates Christmas under the pyramids in Egypt, tsetse flies are an insoluble problem.
This is a moving book almost from the beginning.
War is flooding these people's lives like a natural disaster, like Hurricane Katrina smelling of cordial.
Imagine yourself as a woman who is at home with her children and hears gunfire in the distance. Do you stay or flee?
Who's coming?
Hardly anyone understands what is happening or why this war is being waged at all.
"Missing facts," Englund notes, "have been filled with conjectures, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares, and rumors."
"Beauty and the Beast" follows individuals like Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German sailor.
Their stories were mainly taken from memoirs, letters and other previously published material.
Their biographies can be frightening or poignant, but they are most vivid in England's collection of small moments, lost in detail.
Many of them are about lack and helpfulness.
In the story of a German schoolgirl, he tells: "Replacement, replacement everywhere."
"Replacement coffee, wrong aluminium, wrong eraser, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
He talks more about the substitute food in Germany.
He describes "meat made from pressed rice and baked in mutton fat (and finally served with a false bone made of wood), tobacco made from dried roots and dried potato skins, shoes soled with wood."
There were, as he notes, "837 registered food substitutes allowed in the production of sausages, 511 registered coffee substitutes."
Some stories are about honor and bravery.
An American recognizes his own ferocity and says of the war: "One feels that, despite everything, this is what was intended for men rather than sitting in the armchair, with the evening paper or the bestseller and a cigarette and a whiskey in hand, and pretending that such a facade signifies civilization and that there is no barbarism behind one's starched and stuffed shirt chest."
Conversely, a British soldier realises that he is likely to die and no one will notice or care.
"If you distance yourself from the thought of sacrificing yourself, you want to think that this is happening in front of an audience," he writes.
Instead, it is as dreadful as "a condemned man who was secretly hanged."
Other observations are about the old Europe falling apart and about new types of terror.
"The conflict has increasingly become an economic rivalry," Englund writes, "a war between factories."
He captures the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the bestiary of the fledgling century": "the articulate and ideologically convinced mass murderer in a bespoke suit who slaughters while sitting behind a desk."
People behave in unforeseen ways and there is frivolous behaviour as well as heroism.
Englund discusses the soldiers who actively tried to contract a sexually transmitted disease from a prostitute in order to escape frontline service.
"The grotesque expression of this can be found in the trade in gonococcal pus, as soldiers bought and smeared on their genitals in the hope of getting to the hospital," he writes.
'Those who were really desperate rubbed him in the eyes, which left them blind for the rest of their lives, 'he said.
In this translation from Swedish by Peter Graves, England's poetry becomes supple yet unobtrusive and perfectly adapts to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes, he captures the way the war "unleashed uncontrollable forces in a unique way: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred."
People are beginning to wonder why their leaders are making them fight.
The best books about the First World War were usually more falsified than extensive history books, such as Paul Fussell's "Great War and Modern Memory" or novels such as Erich Maria Remarque's "Nothing New in the West."
England's band joins an unconventional hall of fame.
His book has the most devastating ending I've ever read in a non-fiction book.
I don't give it away anymore.
But it is as if with his book he has snatched this page with the main characters from under our noses and set it on fire with a match.
After an early misstep, a meticulously planned assault
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them wearing helmets.
The decision was made for the night from Monday to Tuesday, because there are hardly any people in Zucotti Park at that time.
The operation was kept secret and only a few high-ranking officials were informed; everyone else initially thought they were taking part in an exercise.
Police Chief Raymond W. Kelly was among them, and his presence underscored the fact that the operation was fraught with challenges.
The incidents of recent weeks, such as the use of pepper spray against protesters, which violated the department's rules and gave the squatters an enormous increase in public sympathy, could not be repeated.
And so the police operation to remove the protesters from Zuccotti Park was carried out after two weeks of planning and training.
Officials had prepared them by watching how occupations were handled in other cities.
A disaster drill had taken place overlooking Zuccotti on Randalls Island.
Officials stepped up so-called mayhem training - counter-terrorism measures that include moving large numbers of police officers quickly - to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training session took place Monday night on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The order to move into the park came "at the last minute," said someone familiar with the orders, calling it an "exercise."
"The few police officers I know who were involved didn't know it was Zuccotti Park," said one, who wished to remain anonymous.
'The only people who knew it was Zuccotti Park were the department's senior officials. '
One reason for the secrecy was a lesson the city had learned.
Officers tried to clear the park on October 14 but backed down when hundreds of protesters gathered after learning of the plans.
Officers from various police units were involved in Tuesday's operation, including task forces from across the city - hundreds of mobile officers normally deployed in high-crime neighborhoods.
Mr Kelly said many people walk in and out of the park during the day, almost like commuters, so 1am is a good time to get in.
"It was appropriate to do so when the smallest number of people are in the park," he said.
Ambulances with lamps and loudspeakers stood by the exit at Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive near the Manhattan Bridge.
The lights and pre-recorded messages blaring from the loudspeakers seemed to intimidate many protesters.
When public officials entered the park in their light blue windbreakers, many protesters simply gathered their belongings and left.
Police said no tents would be touched until 1: 45 a.m. to give protesters time to pack their belongings.
Other teams of officers were seen gathering in the area to intervene should arrests become necessary in the park.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Paul J. Browne, a spokesman for the police chief, said it was for their own safety.
But many journalists claim that they were prevented from observing the police actions in the park, and they said the officers "treatment was very harsh.
Mr Browne said television vans could have taken photos on Church Street on the west side of the park.
As the police moved westward through the jumble of protesters "personal belongings, including suitcases, artificial grass and bags of clothes, city cleaners followed them, picking up what had been left behind.
Some protesters who refused to leave were dragged outside, and pictures of them appeared on the Internet a short time later.
A core of protesters took up positions near the camp's kitchen area in the center of the park.
Some erected barriers and the police continued their methodical arrests.
About 10 people in the epicentre of the camp tied themselves together by their arms.
And two people chained themselves to trees, Mr. Kelly said.
Civil protection officers were called in to cut them off.
No arrests were made at the park until about 3: 30 a.m., Mr. Kelly said.
The eviction was completed after 75 minutes, according to police.
Mr Browne said 142 people were arrested at the park.
Most of the arrests were for "disorderly conduct and resisting arrest," he said.
The most prominent official on the scene was Joseph J. Esposito, the department's chief, the department's most senior uniformed officer.
Phil T. Pulaski, department chief of detectives, was also there.
Despite his presence, Mr Kelly "did not lead the operation," Mr Browne said.
In case they needed access, a second group of officers waited on the east side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Streets.
Barricades were erected on Cortlandt Street, one block north of the park, and on Pine Street, one block south.
From these locations, police could be seen widening the perimeter around Zuccotti Park.
At one point, several officers, many of them carrying shields, were seen herding people outside.
About 28 people were in the northern perimeter.
Some of the most violent actions of the night took place in the south of the park.
Around 5 a.m., a protester jumped onto the roof of a police vehicle south of Pine Street and other demonstrators let the air out of the tire of a police bus.
At one point, the crowd threw a piece of plywood.
In the end, an official and a protester were hospitalized.
Caregivers' union to file lawsuit against city over layoffs
The union, which represents hundreds of school supervisors who lost their jobs last month, plans to sue the city on Wednesday, saying the layoffs are unnecessary and discriminatory because of their disproportionate impact on schools that teach poor students.
The lawsuit is probably the last option left open to the union, District 37, in its efforts to reverse the layoffs.
Six hundred and seventy-two school aides, supervision coordinators, and other employees who were among the city's lowest-paid employees and lost their jobs on October 7 in a move union leaders have described as political revenge for denying the city access to a health fund run by the labor groups last year to close the budget gap.
This accusation has been categorically denied by the authorities.
At a City Council hearing last month, Dennis M. Walcott, the schools director, said the layoffs were part of the budget passed in June.
A City Council member shot back, saying there was nothing in the budget specifying that school aid workers would be laid off.
City Council officials said they had and warned the Department of Education about a lawsuit, and there will be a news conference Wednesday at which the lawsuit will be formally announced in Manhattan Supreme Court.
The lawsuit will list Mr. Walcott and the city's Department of Education as defendants, and will count eight laid-off workers as plaintiffs, all of whom are black or Latino women, like most of the workers who lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the city's Department of Justice, said the city was not aware of the lawsuit and could not comment on its individual claims.
According to a draft lawsuit obtained by The New York Times, the union has focused on the number of layoffs at schools in the city's poor neighborhoods to support a lawsuit alleging unequal treatment, claiming that poor schools have lost more workers because they are chronically underfunded.
She points out that while there have been no layoffs on Staten Island and few layoffs at Upper East Side or TriBeCa schools, 17 school workers in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, have lost their jobs, and 46 workers in Districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx have been laid off.
Noting the loss of five of eight school aides employed at Public School 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the lawsuit says, "This is not a neighborhood of well-heeled parents who can organize donations to absorb budget cuts."
P.S.: The 36th District's budget was cut by 3.26 percent this year, and money was lost when the city changed its method of calculating extra funding for each poor school enrollment.
The union also complains that high school leaders were misled by the language in a memo authorizing the dismissal of the supervision coordinators.
The memo used the English word "excess" to describe the action, even though "excess" in the US usually describes a teacher's move from a school's payroll to a pool of available workers paid by the central agency.
"Sixty-six care coordinators were dismissed, not transferred," the draft lawsuit says.
Mission over, Congress ready to agree on Libya
Ultimately, it looks like Republicans and Democrats in Washington are already coming to an agreement on the uprisings in Libya.
All that was needed was the success of the revolt, the arrest and assassination of longtime dictator Muammar Qaddafi, and an end to American interference.
On Thursday, the Senate International Relations Committee passed a resolution headed by Chairman John Kerry (Massachusetts), along with Senator John McCain (Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Connecticut), praising Libya for its successful rebellion and U.S. troops for their "courage."
"This resolution honors the courageous people of Libya who have begun to rebuild their country," Kerry said.
'It's an affirmation of bipartisan support for their democratic efforts. '
The language may sound innocent, but so far nothing has been easy in the Libya debate.
This summer, lawmakers from both parties and the White House clashed over the wording of a series of resolutions approving or disapproving of the role of the U.S. military in NATO's Libya mission.
In June, Kerry and McCain tabled a resolution authorizing the restricted use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
The bill was rejected in the Senate by a broad margin of both parties, and there was no vote.
But that bill failed in the Senate the same day, and the chamber also overruled a resolution to cut funding for American operations in Libya.
As a result, the US mission was plunged into a kind of legislative purgatory, with a Congress angry enough to criticize Obama's handling of the mission, but not angry enough to pull the rug from under its feet once and for all.
Then the indecision of Congress was overtaken by events.
Tripoli fell to Libyan rebels in August and Gaddafi was killed on October 20.
The NATO mission officially ended on October 31.
Now the Senate may be ready to act.
The resolution by the Committee on International Relations "congratulates the Libyan people for their tremendous courage and perseverance in their self-liberation" and "commends the men and women of the U.S. military and their coalition partners who support the military operations to protect the people of Libya for their extraordinary courage and professionalism."
The resolution also reaffirms "the national interests of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya."
Will the new measures receive the full support of the Foreign Relations Board or will they divide legislators, as the June law did?
The latest version faces opposition from Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indianapolis), the committee's top Republican.
Lugar's spokesman said Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new law.
According to Capitol Hill, it is up to the Senate to vote this week on a constitutional amendment that calls for a balanced budget, a top priority in nearly every congressional term for Republicans and some Democrats.
The measures, led by Republican Bob Goodlatte of Virginia, will be the first constitutional amendment to the budget or any other area currently being voted on in the Senate or Congress.
Other lawmakers have so far tried unsuccessfully to bring their amendments to a vote, though they have tried often enough.
Goodlatte's amendment is just one of 68 constitutional amendments submitted to Congress that cover a wide range of issues.
Some are duplicate - the same bill has been presented to both Congress and the Senate - others differ only slightly.
There are at least 15 versions of the balanced budget amendment in the Senate alone, and another dozen that would "control federal spending."
Some of the laws are identical, but they give their sponsors - especially freshmen Republicans who want to burnish their résumés - the opportunity to brag that they "authored" such a measure.
The Budget Control Act, which passed in August, requires both the Senate and Congress to vote on an amendment to the budget balance.
In March, 58 senators voted for a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment.
Beyond the budget, some members want to limit the number of provisions that members of Congress can put forward, while Republican José E. Serrano of New York wants to lift the two-term limit for presidents.
Republican Jesse L. Jackson (Illinois) has proposed a series of changes that would guarantee, among other things, the right to good education and health care.
An amendment banning same-sex marriage is a recurring theme, as is an amendment banning the burning of flags.
Some lawmakers also want to allow the repeal of federal laws if two-thirds of states reject them.
As eagerly as Members are proposing amendments, they are moving much faster than in previous years.
In the 111th Congress, lawmakers tabled 77 such amendments; in the 110th Congress, 66.
The pace pales in comparison to the early 1990s, when members regularly proposed more than 150 amendments every two years, according to figures provided by the Senate Library.
But they were not much more successful than today's.
The last amendment to be added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992, but was actually proposed to Congress as early as 1789.
"Hit but not defeated," Giffords says in first televised interview since attack
Ten months after a gunman shot her at close range during an election rally in Tucson, Arizona Republican Gabrielle Gifffords appeared on national television Monday night, singing alone to the Broadway play "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and saying that the desire to recover is greater than the desire to return to Congress.
Appearing on ABC's "20 / 20" with Diane Sawyer, she struggled for words and needed help walking.
The programme showed the severe slow recovery from the damage caused by the bullet, which severed her skull, pierced the left side of her brain and crossed her head from front to back.
Three months ago, she made a surprise return to Congress to vote triumphantly on the debt brake.
In her first television interview since the January attack that killed six people and wounded 13, Gifford smiled, laughed and sang - and described her recovery as "difficult."
When Sawyer asked her how she felt, Gifford, 41, replied, "Quite good."
The interview with Gifford and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of an hour-long "20 / 20" special taped just before the release of the couple's new book, "Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope."
The special has been tracking Giffords' recovery since the January 8 attack.
In videos Kelly recorded in the first few weeks, she is seen in a hospital bed with her head shaved and a long scarf draped over her forehead.
She can only lift one or two fingers if her husband encourages her to do so.
Months later, Giffords sits in a wheelchair while therapists show her how to perform simple movements.
A nod of the head.
A shrug of the lips.
And then, her first words: "What."
After a few days, Giffords whispers another word: "toast." She wants her breakfast changed.
Videos played on the ABC show that music played an important role in Giffords' recovery: The congresswoman can be seen singing along with therapists to Cyndi Lauper's "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" and Tom Petty's "Free Fallin '."
In the interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who spends two hours a day in therapy, said she can't remember the day of the attack.
Her husband said he was reading a newspaper article about the attack to Giffords on March 12 when she interrupted him and asked for the first time about the six people killed in the attack.
Suspected shooter Jared Lee Loughner is being held in a Missouri prison and is being forcibly medicated while he awaits trial.
"A lot of people have died," Giffords told Sawyer.
"Hard, hard, hard."
As his wife recovered, Kelly told Sawyer, she said, "I was hit."
"So, I'd say," Gabby, you haven't been defeated "?" said Kelly.
You just got hit.
And you're going to go through that and you're going to recover and you're going to come back stronger than ever.
Troops feel pity rather than respect
The event was a Wall Street gala that raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, frustration and loss.
On cue, a hundred soldiers, sailors, pilots and marines gathered around him.
The crowd in black tuxedos stood up and applauded.
"The soldiers were seen as heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized the spring fundraiser.
A senior military officer at the gala, watched by, among others, the chief of staff and then-chairman, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops differently.
"They were introduced like orphans," the officer wrote in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organisers meant well.
I know that.
But it wasn't respect, it wasn't really, it was compassion.
The starkly contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationship between the military and the mostly aloof, sometimes admiring American public.
The troops are showered with praise for their sacrifices.
But the praise comes at a price, service members say.
Increasingly, the public is behaving as if they are sorry for the people in uniform.
"We were by no means victims," said Brig. Gen. Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and will soon be leaving for Afghanistan.
'But it seems the only way to support is to squeeze ourselves into the role of unhappy souls. '
The issue is extremely sensitive for military leaders who do not want to appear ungrateful or at odds with the public they serve.
They also recognized that the anger directed at returning troops in the final years of the Vietnam War was far worse.
As a result, conversations about compassion take place quietly and privately between war veterans.
After his two sons returned from fighting with the Marines, retired Colonel Mark Cancian warned them that people outside the military world could see their service from two different perspectives.
Some would regard them with a sense of awe, having defeated rebels and travelled to exotic places.
Others would wonder if an "angry, violent veteran is hiding beneath the surface," said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and took up a senior government post in Washington upon his return.
While looking for work, he said, he sensed that some of the interviewees were subtly asking if he was able to withstand the pressure of a demanding job in Washington right after returning from combat.
"When you talk about your ministry, you have to counter the negative impressions," Cancian told his sons.
The military's lack of ease is rooted in part in Americans "lack of interest in war.
Battlefield achievements are rarely singled out for praise by a country that has little military experience and sees little use in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"We as a nation no longer value military heroism the way it was absolutely common during World War II," said retired Lt. Gen. David Barno, who commanded U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, much of the praise from politicians and the public focuses on the suffering of a service member.
Troops are recognised for the number of attacks they have endured, the number of friends they have lost or the severity of their injuries.
Military faces growing pressure to crack down on rape
A key hearing this week will decide whether 28 men and women will be tried in military court for failing to intervene in a rape case.
If this does not happen, hundreds of plaintiffs will be ready for the next hearing.
Corporal Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and 11 weeks pregnant when she was raped by a fellow soldier at night.
It was October 2008, and she was returning to her barracks in Miramar, north of San Diego, from dinner with a friend, when she encountered a male colleague carrying a 12-pack of beer.
He asked her if he could accompany her to her room for a drink.
"My alarm bells went off," Lyman said.
But the Texan brushed aside her concerns.
I thought: "Oh what, he's 19.
He's from Texas, "she said.
'I wish I'd listened to my gut. '
Minutes after they went to Lyman's room, the man stepped behind her, pushed her down and raped her, she claims.
This week, on November 18, Lyman and 27 other current and former military personnel anxiously await a trial with a historic hearing in Arlington, Va., to decide whether to allow a lawsuit they filed against former Defense Secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, to go to trial.
The lawsuit alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld failed to address widespread rape within the military and in violation of soldiers' constitutional rights.
Filed in February by Susan Burke, an attorney from Washington, D.C., the lawsuit initially included 17 plaintiffs, but grew to 28 in the following months: 25 women and three men, all of whom allege that they were raped or sexually assaulted by fellow soldiers, and that the military failed to investigate, convict or provide adequate jurisdiction after the alleged attacks.
Burke says she is pursuing the top military leadership because that's where the problem starts.
"The military is hierarchical," she says.
"Who are the individuals who are in a position to eradicate the culture retaliation of those? The leadership."
Burke also says she has contacted nearly 400 other survivors since February, many of whom may be part of future lawsuits.
Their strategy: Instead of all the plaintiffs putting their eggs in one basket, so to speak, they will, if necessary, file many more lawsuits to keep the pressure on.
The defense team for the Department of Defense, led by Attorney General Neil MacBride, has filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit.
The court papers, which are available to Newsweek, detail the defense strategy, primarily that the military cannot be sued by current or former soldiers for injuries suffered in the armed forces.
Under a 1950 Supreme Court law known as the Feres Doctrine, the government is not liable for injuries inflicted on active-duty soldiers.
"The alleged damage occurred during the plaintiffs' military service," the document says.
The Defense Department declined to comment for this story.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
If women are still not allowed to serve in combat, the distinction lies solely in the name: modern wars rarely have clear fronts.
Teams of female soldiers are playing increasingly important roles in both Iraq and Afghanistan, particularly in interacting with local women in war zones.
The result: between these two wars, 150 female soldiers died, two-thirds of them in combat.
It's time for the military to be modernized, Burke says.
And she is not alone in her struggle: three other lawsuits besides hers are pending.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans' Legal Services Clinic is preparing a lawsuit against the four major military academies for allegedly fostering a misogynistic atmosphere.
Separately, the nonprofit Vietnam Veterans of America is filing a lawsuit against the military, focusing on the "personality disorder" diagnosis that rape victims received in order to be discharged from service - a common practice, according to activists like Anu Bhagwati of the Service Women's Action Network, a human rights group.
Her group filed a lawsuit against the Veterans Administration in December, accusing it of discriminatory practices in its handling of benefit claims for people who say they have been sexually abused while on duty.
Nine bills have been submitted to Congress independently by a mix of senators and representatives from both parties, offering a number of clues.
In 2010, 3,158 sexual assaults were reported, according to the Defense Department's Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office.
But most abuses go unreported at all, and the Pentagon's own estimate puts the number at about 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 cases that occur each year.
The report, released in March, also examines prosecution rates: In 2010, 20 percent of recorded cases in the military went to trial, only half as many as in civil law.
The plaintiffs in Burke's case describe their attacks as just the first in a series of traumas.
In Lyman's case, she reported the alleged rape to military police less than an hour after the assault.
That night, she says, she was asked 11 times to tell the details of her rape to a slew of police officers, doctors and commanders.
She had a rape kit and her attacker's blood, which came from a cut on his arm, was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was heard by a judge, during which she was asked about the sex she had with her boyfriend before the assault.
Six people testified as character witnesses on behalf of the alleged perpetrator, who was ultimately acquitted.
"I remember the day the verdict was read out," Lyman said.
'I thought the contractions were going to set in, I ran out of the courtroom screaming, 'he said.
"They took me to the psychiatric ward, and I remember when I came out, I said to my commander," This wasn't his procedure, this was my procedure. ""
Lyman was asked to see a military psychiatrist, who eventually diagnosed a personality disorder and declared her unfit for service.
She was dishonorably dismissed in January 2010, so she receives no support.
Whether the lawsuit, filed by Lyman and the other plaintiffs, will proceed is pure speculation, said John Turley, a law professor at George Washington University Law School.
Still, he notes, "I think they should move forward."
What stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine, which has been criticized since it was first challenged.
I have been a lifelong critic of the Feres Doctrine.
The military is a decade behind, because they do not have the same incentive and deterrent that comes with liability.
He adds: 'The odds are against them... but it's important for them to try.'
These things will only change if good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing does not go their way, Burke, the plaintiffs' attorney, will begin with her hundreds of other plaintiffs for future cases.
"We will continue to fight the military on this issue until there is reform," she says.
Or until we die, whatever happens first.
Walls have eyes: How researchers are watching you on Facebook
Before he became the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was just one of many blokes posting their anti-immigration views online.
On Monday Breivik, who has confessed to being involved in a July rampage in Norway in which 77 people were killed, had his first public court hearing.
Though Breivik may have acted alone, he is far from alone in cyberspace: he spent much time in front of his computer before his attack, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists who support far-right groups on social networks.
After this summer's tragedy, researchers wanted to find out more about these people.
But how do you find them?
It's easy - you just have to log in to Facebook.
"We found that it wasn't hard to get to them," says Jamie Bartlett, the lead author of a recent report on digital populism in Europe by the British think tank DEMOS.
Facebook's stash of personal data is so encyclopedic, Bartlett says, that researchers simply need to use the site's advertising tool to pinpoint their desired demographic data with scientific accuracy - as marketers have been doing for years.
Bartlett's team found half a million fans of far-right groups across Europe and then targeted them with ads, but instead of linking to a new band or diet product, the ads invited users to take part in a survey asking about their education level, attitudes towards violence and their own future.
Thanks to Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to survey more than 10,000 followers of 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries - without having to leave their offices even once.
"It's a fairly new research method," Bartlett says.
Some of the results are hardly surprising. Online supporters of far-right groups are mostly young, male, and resent immigration.
But, in a kind of surprising twist, "those who combine their online activism with offline activism are more sensible, democratic, and less violent than those who remain behind their computer screens."
DEMO's work is just one example of how Facebook is becoming a hot new tool in the hands of scientists.
Idea factories, medical researchers, and political scientists use the site to study everything from health issues to social trends like "likes," text messages, and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding an average of three pieces of content a day, Facebook's "data supernova" is generating a research boom that has boosted the number of scientific papers bearing the site's name in the title by nearly 800% over the past five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is that it lets you study people you don't normally reach on the street with your clipboard.
'If you used to try to interview people in the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them, 'he said.
"They had to inform the party first and they would never have allowed them in," Bartlett says.
'With Facebook, it's all gone - you go straight to them. '
Others say the site offers a way to identify and solve social health problems.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues found that students who discussed their binge drinking on Facebook were significantly more prone to problem drinking than students who remained silent on the subject.
Moreno suggests that peers, such as housing counselors, monitor the site and help a student if they post too many status updates.
"You can't solve a problem if you don't recognize it," Dimitri Christakis, Moreno's co-author and director of Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Children's Research Institute in Seattle, told The Washington Post.
'We found a way to identify vulnerable children who wouldn't have been found otherwise. '
Facebook is also constantly tapping into the data of its own population.
The site's data team compiled statistics on relationship status and Valentine's Day, turnout in the 2010 midterm elections, and a National Happiness Index (primarily using data that only Facebook has access to - digital freedom masters have long known that the site should make its vast trove of data available to others for research.)
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they want to or not. In order to play Scrabble with a friend thousands of miles away, the site is allowed to share their personal information.
But what if Facebook users become part of a survey they don't even know about?
While researchers have strict guidelines on how they collect their data offline, anything is allowed online.
"I don't think many users have even thought about the fact that a researcher could study their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, referring to a 2006 study that examined student public pages on Facebook.
'As far as she's concerned, it was all about her and her friends. '
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline, there is no guarantee that a research participant is completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know how much of the information in a user profile and posts is true.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do off Facebook are two completely different things," says Selwyn.
So, despite his years as a technology researcher, Selwyn thinks that a clipboard and a pen are still the best research tools anyone can use.
"There's no substitute for going out into the real world and talking to real people," he says.
"Social research has to take care of the social - and a lot of social life still takes place offline."
'Cold and inhumane ': Anders Behring Breivik makes first public appearance in court
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed to two shootings that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself as a "resistance fighter" in his first court appearance in Oslo.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and a Knights Templar of Norway," he told a courtroom of more than 500 people.
'I object to the court because you have received your mandate from organisations that support hate ideologies and because it supports multiculturalism, 'he said.
'I acknowledge the law but I don't plead guilty. '
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during that monologue because he "did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform on which to express his views."
For the same reason, he refused Breivik, who brought a pre-written speech with him, permission to address the relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered that the police keep Breivik in custody for 12 more weeks, and that he has no access to the media for four weeks. He said that the authorities will closely monitor all visits and all correspondence over eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the hearing.
Some came hoping to look Breivik in the eye, others wanted confirmation that he was behind bars.
All participated with the aim of closing everything down.
"I thought he looked cold and inhuman," a survivor of Utoya told Norwegian broadcaster NRK.
'It was uncomfortable, but for me it goes a little further after I've seen and heard the suspect. '
Wearing a dark suit and blue tie, Breivik appeared calm and professional throughout the hearing, looking journalists and survivors in the eye as he entered and left the building.
Despite Breivik's bizarre suggestion that he was part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge concluded that he was not insane and said there was no evidence that he had accomplices.
Some may like the fact that the July 22 attacks appeared to be the work of a single extremist, not a group of radicals.
But does that automatically ease the grief and confusion that an entire nation still feels?
"I wish he looked like a monster, but he doesn't," said one victim's relative.
'It'd be so much easier if he did. '
7 lessons from the interview with the late Steve Jobs, which was shown in a theater this week
After the death of Steve Jobs on October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford, highlighting the technological genius as a great modern inventor.
But perhaps what Apple fans find most revealing in the recently rediscovered Jobs interview, which was dusted off this week ahead of special screenings in major markets, is how much this creative mind understood business processes and workflows.
He was certainly a designer, a dreamer, and a self-proclaimed hippie, but he was also a meticulous organizer who worked diligently on diagrams - a man who believed that many CEOs suffer from "a disease of thinking that a really great idea makes up 90 percent of the work... [but] there is an enormous amount of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product."
In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the TV series "Triumph of Professional Idiots," about the dawn of the personal computer. And he sat with Jobs for more than an hour, during which they had one of the rare in-depth conversations.
By then, it had been more than 10 years since Jobs had been forced out of Apple, and he was already working hard on his new computer company, NeXT, and looking forward to the widespread adoption of the Internet.
While a small portion of Cringley's interview was used in technical idiots, he says the interview's copies were missing on delivery.
It was only after Jobs' death that a full VHS copy was discovered in the director's garage.
This slightly revised footage forms the basis for the 68-minute film "Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview," which hits theaters this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone known to loathe in-depth interviews, Jobs appears surprisingly zealous here in explaining his technological philosophies and business strategies.
And incredibly thoughtful.
During the course of the interview, there are four long pauses between question and answer - 10 to 15 seconds of reflection in which Jobs clearly weighs his thoughts and strives for accuracy.
There are also moments when Jobs's perfectionism comes to the fore, when he seems impatient to respond to Cringely's questions and nudges him to respond more quickly to themes or subplots of greater importance.
Taken before the era of Pixar, iPod, or iPhone, The Lost Interview somehow seems eerily prescient when Jobs assesses what he thinks other companies are doing right or wrong and presents his own vision of the future of the computer.
It's one thing to read posthumous tributes to Jobs's career, but to see Jobs here as the eager dreamer on the verge of greatness is something very different, original and inspiring.
He has a vision of how things could be and should be.
Shortly after he had done all this here, he set off and did it.
A quick look at seven notable sequences from the Lost Interview:
How he learned to run a business:
"Throughout the years in business, I always ask," Why do you do things? "And the answer you always get is," Oh, that's just how it's done. "
Nobody knows why he does what he does. Nobody in the business really thinks about things.
That's what I found.
Jobs is continuing his efforts to streamline Apple's accounting.
Baffled by the way costs were recorded - most often starting with "standard costs," which were calculated purely on guesswork, and then adjusted with "deviation" - he developed an automated factory that ensured that business costs could be determined to the smallest detail.
How the Pope was made a fool of:
Jobs talks about the "blue box" he built with Steve Wozniak, a device that could be used to sneak into the phone company and make long-distance calls for free.
Much has been written about the device, but Jobs's enthusiasm when he describes the blue box as an act of self-empowerment is infectious.
He describes how he and Wozniak would test the box by using a paid phone, making a call, and then connecting from one AT & T network to another while looping through as many satellites as possible.
"We sent stuff half a dozen times around the globe, and when you hollered into the phone, it came out a minute later in the phone next door," Jobs says, giggling.
"We were young and we learned that we can build something ourselves that can control trillions of dollars of infrastructure around the world."
We both, we didn't know much, but we were able to build this little thing that can control a gigantic thing, that was an incredible lesson and I don't think there would be Apple without it.
Jobs goes on to recount a glorious prank that he and Wozniak almost pulled off when they called in the middle of the night via the Vatican Blue Box and wanted to talk to the Pope while imitating Henry Kissinger as best they could.
As several members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to speak to the American diplomat, the two had to laugh before the pope himself got on the phone.
How he fell in love with technology (and called Bill Hewlett unprepared):
At the age of 12, when he was looking for spare parts to build a frequency counter, he looked for Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called him.
Shortly after their 20-minute phone call, Jobs got a part-time job at Hewlett-Packard for the summer.
"It had a remarkable impact on me. It was the only company I had seen at that age and it shaped my views on what a company was and how well it treated its employees."
Jobs later became one of the HP employees who visited the company's research labs in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desktop computer ever made."
It was the size of a suitcase, it had a small screen with a brown tube and I fell in love with it.
I would climb up at HP as a teenager and hang on to that machine and write programs for it.
How to improve innovation:
Several times in the interview Jobs talks about spontaneously inventing new products.
Early in his career, when he was installing some boards, he was asked by a customer to assemble the whole computer.
He worked with a payment period of only 30 days and had to think through both the assembly and delivery of the finished equipment.
Later at Apple he remembers the problems he had developing a computer mouse:
"I remember the arguments... They shouted at me that it would take five years [to build a mouse that would cost $300] and I got up, went out and found a manufacturer."
Ninety days later we had a mouse that we could build for $15, which was incredibly believable.
On big companies that are slowing down:
Long before he revived Apple, Jobs foresaw the ways in which so many industrial giants stumbled with their visions and lost control of their shares.
"Let's say you work at IBM or Xerox, so make a better copier or printer, so what?"
They have a monopoly on shares, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, so [it's those people] who end up running the companies and the product that pushes people out of decision-making.
The product genius that led to this monopoly is being eradicated by people who have no concept of good products vs. bad products - craftsmanship necessary.
That's what happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry.
It could have been ten times bigger if it had been Microsoft in the 1990s...
They took defeat from victory.
About innovation as an art form:
"There's a lot of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product... when you develop that great idea, it changes and grows."
You learn a lot about its subtleties.
You have to vote, certain things you can't do, but electrons, glass, robots, factories.
You have to remember 5000 things, these concepts, and bring them all together...
At the end of the day, it comes down to taste, it comes down to trying to deal with the best stuff that people have created and then trying to bring those things together into what you're doing.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal.
We are always shameless in stealing great ideas.
Part of what made Macintosh great was that the people who work there were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, who just happen to be the best computer scientists in the world.
If it wasn't for the computer industry, they would be doing fantastic things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas dine with health-care law opponents as court takes case
On the day the Supreme Court gathered behind closed doors to discuss the politically divisive issue of whether to hear a challenge to President Obama's health care law, two of its justices, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, attended a dinner sponsored by the law firm representing the case in court.
The incident took place last Thursday when all nine judges met for a meeting to consider the petitions.
One of the cases under consideration was a lawsuit filed by 26 states against the sweeping health care reform passed by Congress last year, a law that has become a buzzword among conservative activists across the US.
The justices agreed to the hearing. In fact, a 5 1 / 2-hour substantive discussion is expected in March, the outcome of which is likely to fuel the 2012 presidential campaign, which will be in full swing by the time the court's decision is announced.
The lawyer who will stand trial and argue that the law should be overturned is likely to be Paul Clement, once Attorney General under George W. Bush's administration.
Clement's law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that supported the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, a long-established group dedicated to defending conservative legal principles.
Another company that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations, the National Federation of Independent Business, which is challenging the law.
Another sponsor was pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., which has a huge financial stake in the outcome of the lawsuit.
The dinner took place at a Washington hotel a few hours after the court had deliberated on the case.
Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, a staunch opponent of health care reform, was among those who served.
The dinner guests? Scalia and Thomas.
This is nothing new: the two judges have been attending Federalist Society events for years.
And that does not violate moral rules.
In fact, justices exempt themselves from the code of conduct that governs the actions of lower federal judges.
If they were, they would probably fall under Principle 4c of the Code, which states: "A judge may attend fundraisers and other organizations, and the judge may not be a speaker, guest of honor or, according to the program, a guest at such events."
Nevertheless, the extreme proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two of the law firms associated with the case, as well as to a company with a massive financial interest in it, was enough to alarm ethics and government activists.
"This stunning breach of morality and contradiction of the code belies the claims of some justices that the court abides by the same rules that apply to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause, a civil rights movement in the US.
"The justices won and lost during a fundraiser with attorneys with pending cases in court," he said.
Her appearance and support of a fundraiser for this event undermines any claim to impartiality and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas show little regard for critics who say they too easily confuse court matters with agenda-driven groups, such as the Federalist Society.
And Thomas' wife, Ginni, is a well-known conservative activist.
By contrast, conservatives contend that it is Justice Elena Kagan, not Scalia and Thomas, who has a moral problem.
Kagan was attorney general under the Obama administration when the first legal challenges to the law came to court.
Her critics urged Kagan to recuse herself from hearing the case because of bias, saying she is too committed to defending the law to be impartial.
Kagan is making no effort to do so.
Boeing lands record $18 trillion order
Emirates has ordered 50 twin-aisle Boeing 777 aircraft with an option for 20 more.
Boeing is also selling six Boeing Dreamliners to Oman Air, a deal worth more than $1 trillion.
It is really rare news that a company gets an order for 50 of its products.
But it's big business when the company is Boeing Co., an aircraft manufacturer, and the list price for those 50 planes is a record $18 trillion.
Equally unusual is Boeing's client: the Middle East, a growing gold mine for future aircraft orders.
In a forecast released Monday, the Chicago-based company estimates that Middle Eastern carriers will need 2,520 planes worth $450 trillion over the next 20 years.
Boeing announced over the weekend its largest ever order for commercial aircraft, measured by the value of the order: 50 two-aisle Boeing 777 jets.
The hammer order came from Dubai-based airline Emirates.
The airline also has an option to buy 20 more planes, Boeing announced at the Dubai Air Show in 2011, bringing the total list price to $26 trillion.
On Monday, Boeing Oman Air ordered six Boeing 787-8s, the so-called Dreamliner, which vastly improves fuel economy and passenger comfort.
The list price for six of these planes is more than $1 trillion.
"This is absolutely positive for Boeing," said Neal Dihora, an analyst at Morningstar.
"The quality of these special customers is very high."
Many Middle Eastern airlines are owned by oil-producing countries.
So not only do they have the money to pay for the planes, but a rise in oil prices, which usually hurts airlines because it is one of their biggest costs, is not so damaging because the country earns from a higher oil price.
That's important because they are less inclined than other airlines to cancel or postpone aircraft orders when oil prices rise, Dihora said.
"They have a natural hedge," he said.
Emirates' order confirms Boeing's leadership in the wide-body market and helps to keep Airbus rival SAS in check as it attacks A350 supremacy.
Boeing's victory at the air show comes four months after Airbus announced it would postpone the launch of its largest A350, which competes directly with the 777-300ER.
It postponed the launch to gain more confidence after customers demanded a higher payload and range.
Boeing shares rose 1.5% to $67.94.
Sister of Mexican President Seems to Lose Michoacan Election
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that drug traffickers have backed rival Fausto Vallejo of the PRI in the race for governor.
The sister of President Felipe Calderon appears to have lost her bid for governor of Muchoacan during the violent state elections, claiming on Monday that drug traffickers influenced the race in favor of one of her opponents.
According to preliminary results, Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) has won the race for governor of the western state.
"The intervention of organized crime throughout the electoral process, and especially yesterday, is alarming, not only for Michoacan, but for the whole country," said Luisa Maria Calderon in a radio interview the day after Sunday's election.
"They threatened our candidates, our polling staff... they occupied polling booths, set up roadblocks... and ordered people to vote [for the PRI]," he said.
The PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until losing the presidency in 2000.
But they are seeking a return, and victory in Michoacan is an important step in that effort.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo appears to have narrowly beaten Claderon, who had been leading in the polls before Election Day.
Calderon, a candidate from her brother's conservative Partido Acción Nacional PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the candidate of the leftist Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD), currently the incumbent governor, came in third, a heavy defeat for the divided and hapless leftist leadership in the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to acknowledge the preliminary results.
Vallejo, a former mayor of the capital of Morelia, denies links to drug traffickers and urges the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacan has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and amphetamines.
It is the homeland of President Calderon and he chose Michoacan to launch a military-led offensive against drug traffickers in December 2006.
The violence continues.
A PAN mayor was killed a week before the election during an election rally for Luisa Maria Calderon, and many candidates have pulled out of local elections in fear.
For the PRI, victory strengthens the party, no matter how repugnant the elections in Michoacan appear.
The man who is likely to represent the PRI in the presidential race is Enrique Pena Nieto, who congratulated Vallejo from Washington and said, "I think this victory gives us the courage to look into next year."
ADB urges Asia to help save eurozone
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is calling on India and China to support the rescue of the eurozone in its severe debt crisis in order to prevent a long-term downward trend that will slow the growth of Asia's economy.
Rajat Nag, managing director of the Manila-based ADB, said that the world's two fastest-growing economies must do "everything in their power" to accelerate the currency bloc's recovery either through the International Monetary Fund or through direct reciprocal agreements.
He warned against the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China) looking "dispassionately" at the difficulties in Europe and said that the financial support of European leaders and European resources from Asia helps prevent a long-term collapse of the global economy.
'We're all in the same boat. '
"So anyone who can help Europe out of this crisis is helpful," he told the Financial Times in an interview on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
'Asia may be protected to some degree, but it's not immune. '
"So if China and India can help, then by all means."
Europe's monetary union has been mired in a severe debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy's interest rates have risen dangerously, and the prime ministers of both Italy and Greece have resigned.
The emerging severe debt crisis in Europe is fueling fears that the global economy could plunge into recession, and has led to calls for emerging-market leaders to band together to support the eurozone.
Mr Nag predicted that any support for Asia would be channelled through the IMF, but said that mutual arrangements - such as buying bonds from the EU rescue fund, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) - would give European partners in Asia greater bargaining power.
Anand Sharma, India's trade minister, said that "India will do everything in its power" to help the eurozone, as its own economy now suffers from falling exports and the drying up of foreign capital flows.
"Nobody wants the eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent," he said.
"We are facing major challenges and we need to maintain a high level of growth."
'It's not an option, it's a mission because where else can we find work for our millions of young men and women. '
Others argue that developing economies like India have no reason to help rich Europeans when they themselves face major economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the US, said it would be politically very difficult to sell aid to India's 1.2 billion people, more than 800 million of whom live on $2 a day or less.
"At some point they will find out that the Greeks are retiring at 50 and going on holiday on the beach, and then you have a problem," he said.
Lee Howell, managing director of the World Economic Forum, similarly asked why India's reserves should be used to keep the large and well-paid public-sector workers in Greece, with jobs in poorly managed, loss-making institutions such as the railways.
Mr Nag said the eurozone crises would have "significant knock-on effects" across Asia.
The ADB's forecast of 7.5 per cent economic growth in Asia in 2011 / 12 now faces "the risk of downgrading" due to the threat from Europe.
He said vulnerable emerging markets needed to draw up "contingency plans" to protect themselves from a downturn and significant capital outflows.
Urgent warnings from Pentagon about possible defense cuts
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta fired up Congress on Monday when he warned that automatic budget cuts would weaken national security unnoticed, setting off a financial chain reaction from the halls of the Pentagon to the theaters of war in Afghanistan and civilian assembly lines.
The Pentagon is already contemplating $450 trillion in cuts over the next decade, but now fears that further cuts of $600 trillion or more will be needed if Congress cannot reach a spending deal.
"The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the department," Panetta wrote in a letter to Republican Senators John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina.
He said a failure by Congress to reach a budget deal, leading to what he called sequestration, would result in 23% across-the-board cuts and a halt to many new projects.
"Such a large cut, carried out in such a reckless manner, would render most of our ship and construction projects unfeasible - you can't buy three-quarters of a ship or a building - and seriously harm other modernization efforts," Panetta wrote to senators.
"We would also be forced to involuntarily part with a large proportion of our civilian staff and, since the reduction would be implemented so quickly, we would almost certainly have to leave civilians on leave in order to achieve the goal."
"These changes would destroy the faith of those who maintain our military and seriously damage our preparedness," he said.
The cuts were ultimately going to hit combat troops, "Panetta said.
"While the war time contingents in the counterterrorism fight are not directly affected by the seizure, the serious interference with the basic budget would adversely affect the war effort," Panetta warned.
'Hiring has been cut, which would lead to delays in hiring and hiring supervisors who support the war, 'he said.
"Staff salaries would be cut, leading to late payments to wartime merchants, and legal and political support would be disrupted."
The two senators responded to Panetta 10 days ago, asking for more details about the potential impact of the automatic cuts on the Defense Department.
"The consequences of seizing the Defense Department would precipitate a rapid decline of the United States as the world's leading military power."
"We are vehemently opposed to this draconian action," the senators said in a joint statement Monday afternoon as they released Panetta's letter.
'This is an outcome we can't live with and it's certainly not one that should be imposed on us. '
'The seizure is a threat to the national security interests of the United States and should not be allowed to happen, 'he said.
It remains to be seen whether Panetta's letter and the senators "new warnings will increase pressure for a compromise in the budget or increase calls to exempt the Pentagon from cuts.
Panetta has been increasingly outspoken about the potential cuts, even though he had many years of budget experience in Congress and the White House before coming to the helm of the Pentagon, and knows he faces tough choices.
At a news conference last week, the defense secretary painted a bleak picture of what might be in store - a military with a shell but no core.
"It is a ship without sailors."
'It's a brigade without ammunition. '
"It is an air force squadron without sufficiently trained pilots."
"It's a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers to accomplish the mission," Panetta said in his opening remarks at the Pentagon.
"It is a force that lacks morale and alertness, and that is incapable of taking on potential adversaries."
's actually making you angry. '
In an appendix to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta provided new details of how reductions "create significant operational risks: delays in times of crisis, conflict and disaster, serious limitations to our global operational and operational capability, leading to unacceptable risk in future war operations."
And Panetta said some of the largest defense projects could fall victim to the cancellation, including those that have already been tested and are in the early planning stages.
The list also includes the F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a planned new bomber, the next generation of ballistic submarines, the new Littoral Combat Ship, and the new ground combat vehicle that the Army and Navy will need to replace the Humvee.
Stopping further development and testing of the F35 would save up to $80 trillion over the next 10 years, but advocates say it is an important next step in rearmament so that potential threats from China and other adversaries can be averted.
How to unmask a lie
A glance at the current headlines shows how dubious and widespread deception and lies are in daily life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is dealing with allegations of sexual harassment from several women, with both sides accusing each other of lying.
Penn State's leadership has been accused of perjury for allegedly withholding reports that a retired football coach sexually abused boys.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was overheard on an open microphone telling American President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
Lies destroy careers and shake countries.
New York congressman and Internet exhibitionist Anthony Weidner made a fool of himself by circulating denials that were quickly refuted by irrefutable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards is accused of campaign finance violations related to the cover-up of an extramarital affair.
And then, of course, no one who witnessed it forgets the media circus that President Bill Clinton created when he lied about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky during his second term in the Oval Office.
Stories of cheating at school and on college exams are common.
There have been instances where teachers have given their students the answers to the exam so that they would do well in their own performance tests.
Mentors who should teach the opposite send a message that lying and cheating are okay.
How much deception do we experience?
Studies show that we lie between 10 and 200 times a day.
But many of these lies are false.
Another study shows that strangers lie to each other three times during the first 10 minutes of a meeting.
Recognizing lies or "uncovering lies" is one that is important for every person to learn, both for personal and professional reasons.
Far from a parlor game, such as charades, in which the goal is to shout "Have you!," unmasking a deception is a serious area of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades at prestigious universities that have undertaken far-reaching research projects, particularly in psychology and physiology.
One result of the research is that most of the old myths about lying have been debunked.
Lies look you in the eye.
They stutter, stammer, blush and fidget not always.
However, we must not conclude from this that these liars are difficult to detect and unmask.
A trained lie-detector can penetrate to the truth by learning about the structure of the assertion, the subtle facial expressions, about question-setting and timing.
I have spent several years studying the scientific results of the vast and ever-growing field of unmasking, and it is clear that unmasking an illusion is a modern skill that is easy to learn and helps us navigate our complex world, especially when hiring or interviewing people or negotiating or managing is one of our professional responsibilities.
Good liars are very good at judging other people, arousing their interest and controlling their own emotions, and they intuitively feel how others perceive them.
Thanks to research, we know that extroverts are more likely to lie than introverts, that men are more likely to tell "self-oriented" lies than women, whose lies are more "oriented" - usually to protect others "feelings - and that married people are less likely to lie to their partners than unmarried people (but the lies they tell are mostly" fat lies ").
We also know that when one person is exposed as an evildoer, others feel less guilty of lying to that person.
How do you tell if someone is lying?
First, by observing the normal behavior of that person.
This is called "baselining," the starting position.
It provides a point of reference for later evaluation of changes.
Observe the posture, the laughter, the vocal quality of their subjects.
They should know better when someone is normally kicking his foot all the time, so that they do not wrongly accuse him of kicking his foot during a meeting.
Then watch out for clusters of conspicuous verbal and non-verbal behaviors.
Think of these clusters as alarm bells ringing, not proof of exposure.
People who deceive may freeze when they try to remember their story, perhaps point their feet toward the door, or lean toward the exit, change their position in a significant way, or show a "relaxation after the interview," that deep, relaxing exhalation, and the change in posture when all the hard questions are over.
Questioners often wrongly signal that a job interview is over, only to look for that relaxation after the job interview.
Also, pay attention to the language of your subject.
Scott Peterson's slip-up is famous for using the past tense when he claimed his slain wife was still alive, sparking a national search for her.
Deceptive people can also use distancing language: "I did not have a sexual relationship with this woman... Miss Lewinsky" or when repeating a tricky question in its entirety.
The most common verbal signs are subtle.
Some people use "qualifying language" when answering a tricky question: "Well... to tell you the truth... as far as I know... to the best of my knowledge."
This makes the answer perceptive rather than factual, often sounding alarm bells.
There is no magic bullet to unmask lies, but you can learn skills to unmask them.
Thanks to these skills, everyone is less likely to fall victim to fraudsters, both in their private and professional lives.
Controversial oil pipeline plan to be revised after threat from delayed US approval
Days after the Obama administration threatened to delay approval of a proposed oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico, infuriating labor unions while reassuring environmentalists, the company building the pipeline is seeking to reschedule the project so it can return to normal.
TransCanada said Monday night that it will reroute the planned pipeline from the environmentally sensitive Sandhills area of Nebraska.
The company announced the decision at a news conference at the Nebraska House of Representatives.
Alex Pourbax of TransCanada said the company remains confident that the pipeline will eventually be approved, albeit with a different course of action.
This followed a State Department announcement last week that it would postpone a decision on federal approval for the project until the new route, which avoids the Sandhills area of Nebraska and the Ogallala Aquifer, a major underwater supply, is reviewed.
"This is a real step forward," Republican Lee Terry, a Nebraska Republican, told Fox News.
The new environmental review ordered by the State Department may delay a decision until 2013, after next year's elections, though officials deny that politicians were involved in the decision.
Obama said in a written statement last week that the decision was a State Department task and pledged his support.
The 1,700-mile pipeline would connect Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would pump 700,000 barrels of oil a day from Alberta to refineries in Texas.
To do so, the pipeline would have to cross six states.
Environmentalists hate it, but labor markets love it, estimating that the pipeline will create 20,000 jobs.
But Nebraska lawmakers who oppose the plan are weighing the legislation to force a move away from the Sandhills and Ogallala aquifers, a major source of drinking water and irrigation.
The State Department's latest environmental impact study found that the project would have little impact on the environment, but the energy industry source said that the department's chief auditor has requested a separate probe of the review process, which focuses on two issues.
One is whether a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was an adviser to Hillary Clinton in 2008, has a conflict of interest.
The other is whether a company commissioned to conduct the original study was an inappropriate choice because it is affiliated with TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle sued for allegedly forcing a toddler to vomit out of fear
A New York family claims that disco diva Patti LaBelle had a seizure in the lobby of their Manhattan building that terrified her young daughter so much that she vomited with fear.
The "Lady Marmalade" singer's tirade scared 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so much that she suffered from "personality changes, sleep disturbance" and "heightened fear of strangers," her family said in Manhattan Supreme Court.
It was on November 10 last year that stage worker Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, a kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve went on a family outing.
While Kevin Monk fetched the car, Roseanna Monk walked into the lobby of her Riverside Boulevard building with her luggage and Genevieve in her arms.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped near the door and dropped her daughter off for a moment.
"Someone appeared behind me and said," Do you know what your daughter is doing? "I said," Yes, "and went to pick her up," she said.
LaBelle angrily admonished the pregnant woman.
"She said in an aggressive tone," You shouldn't drop your daughter near the door, "" Roseanna Monk said.
"I told her," I don't care what you say or think. ""
She got angry and started swearing - she used the F-word and the A-word and became very loud...
She had a bottle of water in her hand and started dumping water from the bottle on me.
She said Genevieve had become hysterical.
"I said to this woman," Look what you've done to my daughter, "" the child's mother said.
LaBelle lunged at the mother, who was still carrying Genevieve in her arms, and had to be restrained by her companion and pulled to a waiting car, Roseanna Monk said.
The baby was screaming so much that she vomited, she said.
The LaBelle family later wrote to apologize, but received no response.
LaBelle's attorney and representative did not respond to calls seeking comment.
The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages, but the family's lawyer, Sam Davis, said he does not charge a fee and the family plans to donate the money they receive to the Children's Cancer Aid.
"We want Patti LaBelle to take responsibility for her behavior," Davis said.
'This kind of behaviour is absolutely unacceptable, especially when it's shown to a kindergarten teacher carrying an 18-month-old baby in her arms. '
Climate adversity slowed the economy
In the first year that Mario López Valdez has been in power, unemployment and undeclared work have risen in Sinaloa, while foreign investment has declined and the economy has stagnated.
2011 will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa. It is the first year that Mario López Valdez, who describes himself as the instigator of change and raised high hopes for economic growth, is in power. However, due to the climatic adversity, there can be no talk of growth; on the contrary, the main economic indicators have deteriorated.
The low temperatures in February not only caused millions of dollars in losses in agriculture, but also placed tight constraints on the growth of the state economy and caused an overall decline in economic activity of 3.6 percent in the first quarter. This is mainly due to the historic 31.16 percent decline in agricultural development, which slowed down other economic sectors.
According to a report on the effects of the frost issued by the Consejo Mexicano para el Desarrollo Rural Sustentable, 582,000 hectares of agricultural land were damaged, 78.03 percent of which was completely destroyed and the remaining 21.07 percent partially. Vegetable, maize and chickpea cultivation were particularly affected.
The decline in economic activity until November has led to a steady increase in unemployment in the Mexican state. Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía observed a rapid increase in unemployment in the first quarter of the year, with 55,053 inhabitants of Sinaloa out of work from January to March, representing 4.53 percent of the working population. In the second quarter, the unemployment rate rose to 5.28 percent and from July to September to 6.19 percent, resulting in 74,000 unemployed in Sinaloa, which is 18,969 more people than in the first quarter.
Less liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa this year is due to several factors. Economist Gerardo López Cervantes, Dean of the Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences at the University of Autónoma (UAS), comments that the policies of public institutions indirectly explain the growing unemployment.
"What we are seeing at the moment is an increase in unemployment, which has to do with several factors, including liquidity losses in the market as a result of the cuts in funding by the legislation passed in Congress to combat money laundering, because it is not easy for those who illicitly accumulate dollars to let them work for themselves, invest in them or use them for anything else," he said.
Migration halted
López Cervantes pointed out that growing unemployment is also a demographic factor.
"The number of people leaving the country in search of work abroad, especially in the United States, has decreased, partly because of immigration problems and partly because it is also difficult to find work there. These people stay here and look for work, which increases unemployment," he says.
Undeclared work
The analysis of the Sinaloa labor market is even more serious when one considers the high proportion of undeclared work, which, according to INEGI, comprises 60.38 percent of the country's workers who work without paying into social security funds.
Unemployment and undeclared work are compounded by low wages, the lowest in Mexico, according to the statistics of the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (Mexican Social Security Institute) and the Secretaría del Trabajo y Previsión Social (Government Agency for Employment and Social Welfare in Mexico).
The average monthly income of Sinaloa workers as of September was 5352 pesos, much less than the national average of 7375 pesos.
Decline in FDI
In addition to the decline in economic activity and growing unemployment, 2011 will see the sharpest decline in foreign direct investment (FDI) in the last decade. According to the Secretaría de Economía, the FDI amounted to 630 597 dollars from January to June, a decrease of 87.74 percent compared to 5 143 312 dollars in the same period last year.
For its part, the Secretaría de Desarrollo Económico del Gobierno (Government Agency for Economic Development) has recorded a total investment of 17 280 000 pesos in 2011, mainly from companies in the tertiary sector.

In view of the economic crisis, the state government applied to the National Congress in July for a loan of 3 000 000 000 pesos to be invested in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities in order to reactivate the economy, and the State Congress approved an amount of 200 600 000 pesos, but by November no positive effects of the debt on any of the economic sectors in the country could be observed.

For business representatives, the first year of Mario López Valdés "reign revealed his inability to govern.
Miguel Loredo López, President of the Cámara Nacional de la Industria de la Transformación (State Chamber of Manufacturing Industry in Mexico), argued that no efforts were made in 2011 to harmonize the views of different sectors, including the state government.
"Economic activity in Sinaloa has been really poor this year, hard work is needed to recover the territory lost this year, and in 2012 we will have to make a double effort. Everyone's efforts, and in particular the progress of the already well-coordinated government team, have not been sufficiently coordinated," he said.
Slow economic growth
Loredo López said that events such as the frost at the beginning of the year hampered and slowed the country's economic development.
"The low economic flow is the result of several events, including the frost. One of the most important impacts is a slowing economy that is not moving sufficiently to generate an economic dynamic that could generate an acceptable flow of processes, products and services, so we will finish the year well below our expectations," he said.
Redefining vocation
Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Confederación Patronal de la República Mexicana (Confederation of Mexican Entrepreneurs) in Sinaloa, said that the state should be encouraged to engage in more dynamic productive activities.
"In general, we have observed that work has been done. We believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term program to redefine the economic vocation and line of the country, because it is important to activate all material and human resources of Sinaloa," he said.
There is a lot to do
The President of Coparmex stressed the importance of developing a future perspective that directs the government's efforts in a better direction.
"In general, I would say that the government has achieved good results in a number of areas. Economic development has progressed, but it is important to develop a long-term programme," he said.
He emphasized that the current state power has made progress in the government.
"There are areas where it can be said that the government has acted more broadly, and what I can say is that work has been done and that the government is aware that there is still a lot of work ahead of it," he said.
Arrest over 8 kilograms of marijuana
A Navolato resident was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days in prison for possession of eight kilograms of marijuana.
The state attorney general's office said the drug dealer was Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, who was convicted of a public health offense - in this case, possession of marijuana for sale.
According to the AP / SIN / CLN / 687 / 2010 / M-I file, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested on June 7, 2010, by Mexican military personnel guarding the Cipriano Valdez street opposite Sentinel No. 80 in the town of El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug dealer was driving a white van in which he kept a black bag in a box in the car and a small backpack in the passenger seat, in which the military found eight kilograms and 23 grams of marijuana.
For this reason, the confiscated goods were handed over to the district judge, and the prisoner remains in the detention center.
Debt for construction work
According to Miguel Ángel López Miranda, the social housing for migrants foreseen in the Hábitat, Rescate de Espacios Públicos and 3x1 programmes is in danger of not being completed due to a lack of funds or of being delayed.
The head of the Municipal Social Development Authority stated that although the construction programs are already advanced, they are now in danger because the state government has not paid the funds due to it, which exceed 11 million pesos for the three programs.
He said that the total investment in these three programs amounted to almost 50 million pesos, of which 25 percent fell on the state. So far, only the Federación and the municipality have contributed funds to the construction work, which is why a delay in the completion of the works is expected.
"They have to contribute 12 million, and even though the year is coming to an end, they have not given us a penny, even though they should have paid us part of it back in July," he said. "In order not to be late, we have already started construction, and they are well advanced, but we need the money."
He pointed out that under the government of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the state had not fulfilled its obligations, which is why, at the beginning of his reign, the municipality had to take out a loan of 7 million, equal to the amount that the central government should have raised.
"This was already the case in the last legislature, because the state did not have sufficient economic resources. The programs continued and this year we had to raise the funds that the state had not raised to participate in these programs," he said.
Although the state authorities are obliged to disburse these funds, he commented that the Minister of Administration and Finance, requested that the administrative work be speeded up and the outstanding share paid out as soon as possible.
'They've got almost 12 million to contribute and, even though the year is coming to an end, they haven't given us a penny. '
The court approves the transition to digital television in Mexico in 2015
The conversion of analogue to digital signals has been one of the most important changes worldwide in recent years.
The Mexican Supreme Court (SCJN) rejected the constitutional challenges filed by the Senate and the House of Representatives against the presidential decree, which requires the switch from analog to digital signals to be brought forward from 2021 to 2015, due to the lack of eight votes needed to challenge the law.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Supreme Court, Juan Silva Meza, believed that President Felipe Calderón had not exceeded his powers when he issued the decree with the details of the switchover to digital terrestrial television.
With this resolution, the constitutional dispute initiated by the Senate was rejected, as it did not receive the qualified majority of eight votes required for the Court to decide on the constitutionality or non-constitutionality. Thus, the law remains in force.
In the project for the lawsuit, prepared by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, it was proposed to declare the decree unconstitutional, since the regulations concerning radio and television are the responsibility of the Comisión Federal de Telecomunicaciones (Cofetel) (Federal Commission for Telecommunications in Mexico), so the decree would contradict the hierarchical principles and the legal reservations.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted in favour of the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies filed constitutional complaints against the decree. After the adoption of the complaints, Minister Sánchez Cordero no longer applied the decree and ceased all activities to set up the digital transmission.
The Council of Ministers also rejected the complaint lodged by the Chamber of Deputies without entering into the debate on the project, which was also the responsibility of Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his speech, the Prime Minister stated that he did not agree with the arguments of the project in the sense that the state government should not regulate with general rules the measures that the public administration should take.
"Nor do I believe that doing so would affect the independence of the regulator." She also recalled that, for constitutional reasons, the planning of strategic policy areas, such as telecommunications, is the responsibility of the central government, which is in charge of state affairs.
The replacement of analog signals by digital is one of the most important changes that has taken place in recent years around the world, and it results in better use of the radioelectric spectrum, an increased quality of the signal and more channels.
Delaying the changeover, she said, was delaying the benefits of digitization, which was a decision in the public interest that was not only technical, "because it included economic, social, political and security aspects."
These matters, she emphasized, "required the action of the entire system, according to the principle of economic management by the state, they included a set of features that the Constitution placed in the hands of the central government."
She recalled that many countries around the world had already made the digital switchover through the government, even though they had highly specialized facilities.
It cannot be concluded that by issuing the contested decree, the government is interfering with the powers of Congress, because the laws passed by the legislature will be complied with, "she asserted.
The possibility of counting ballots individually in Michoacán is being considered
According to PREP, the difference between first and second place in the election for governor is just under 27 percent, with 879 votes out of a total of 6,074 not yet counted.
The possibility of a single count of ballots is a reality in this year's elections in Michoacán, because according to the data issued by the Program for the Preliminaries of the Electoral Results (PREP), the difference between first and second place in the gubernatorial elections is almost 27 percent, with 879 votes out of a total of 6,074 that have not yet been counted.
With this in mind, the President of the General Electoral Institute of Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that just last 9 November, the electoral office adopted a set of rules harmonizing local rules with state electoral reforms.
It is recalled that Michoacán did not adapt its political constitution, electoral law or electoral justice law to the reforms adopted by the Congress, so that they did not enter into force in this election round. Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel avoided their publication in the State Gazette within the time limits set for them, arguing that he did not object to them.
On 9 November, the Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) ruled on the constitutional challenge lodged by the local legislature, ruling that the State Ombudsman's vote on the constitutional reforms was "invalid and unlawful," as he did not have the right to "decide or veto" it.
María de los Ángeles Llanderal, in an interview on the possibility of individual counting of votes, said that, thanks to the adoption of the directives by the Consejo General del IEM, it is now possible for the local electoral authority to count all or part of the ballots.
Thus, under the following conditions, the votes contained in one or more electoral packages may be partially counted. The results in the minutes do not coincide; the minutes of the counting and calculation of votes are not available on the file or are not in the possession of the chairman of the election committee, or there are obvious errors or alterations in the minutes.
In addition, if there is a difference between the presumed winner and the runner-up, which is equal to or less than one percent, the total number of fully completed ballot papers may be counted, provided that at the beginning of the meeting there is an express request from the party or coalition chairman, who is the second of the candidates mentioned.
The vote count may also take place in its entirety if, after the ordinary calculation has been completed, it is determined that the difference between the presumed winner and the candidate in second place is equal to or less than one percent, provided that there is an express request from a representative of the party whose candidate has come second. In this case, the electoral packages that have been subjected to a partial count would be excluded.
It is worth noting that the elections in Morelia are in the same situation, where, according to PREP, the difference between first and second place is just 0.16%, even though the votes of 129 out of a total of 923 electoral protocols have not yet been counted.
His Last Will
His ashes will be scattered over the Zapalinamé Mountains, the family confirmed.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés trickled down to Saltillo, his birthplace, this Sunday evening. On Monday, the funeral service and a funeral mass were held.
According to family members, the last wish of the lieutenant colonel was for his ashes to be scattered over the Zapalinamé Mountains.
After paying their respects, the family of Bacio Cortés returned to the capital of Coahuila, together with the others killed in the accident, on a Mexican Air Force plane. Those closest to the Colonel attended the ceremony in Campo Marte.
At noon, the lieutenant colonel's ashes landed at the funeral home on Boulevard Nazario Ortiz Garza, where family and friends were gathered.
At 5: 30 p.m., his remains were examined at the Institute of Technology of Saltillo by his former high school classmates and his American football team, of which Felipe Bacio was a member during his high school preparations.
"He wanted to return to Saltillo and for his ashes to be scattered over the Zapalinamé Mountains, as he always said to his family and friends," Sandra Bacio Cortés, sister of the pilot, said.
From her point of view, the lieutenant colonel had fulfilled all his dreams, and she believes that he stood in the fullness of his life. "He was a successful man, extraordinary as a father and a son, a loving brother, and he always stood up for his family."
Felipe Bacio Cortés left Saltillo at a very young age to join the Zapopán Air Force School in Jalisco.
Some could not believe it, because they thought he would get dizzy even on a truck. Nevertheless, he always strived to realize his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembers him as a good person. "He had hardly arrived in Saltillo, and the whole family wanted to greet him, as on the occasion when he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo."
The young man remembers that even at the age of seven he went to Zapopán for his family's graduation, so he knows that his uncle died doing what he liked best: flying an airplane.
A final goodbye
Lieutenant Colonel Felipe Bacio Cortés of the Mexican Air Force, led by Governor Jorge Torres López, was honored by the people and the government, the Mexican Army of the Sixth Military District, the Mexican Air Force, principals and students of the Technological Institute of Saltillo, where he studied in 1985 and excelled in both studies and sports.
Bacio Cortés died a few days ago when the helicopter he was flying, in which also the Secretary of State José Francisco Blake Mora and six other people from the same authority were sitting, crashed.
At 6: 05 p.m., the cremated remains of Bacio Cortés, a citizen of Saltillo, arrived in the forecourt of the barracks to be handed over by the undertaker to members of the Mexican Air Force, led by Major Jaime Martinez, where he was awaited by his family members, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, his mother, siblings and other relatives, students and teachers.
The abandoned bodies were found on a property on Cadereyta Road
A few hours before the discovery, military officials presented to the media eleven people who had been arrested in the same town in connection with organized crime.
Three men were found shot in different body parts and one shot in the head in an abandoned property in the town of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The event took place at kilometer 1.5 of the Cadereyta-Santiago highway at the level of the municipality of El Castillo.
Several passers-by saw the door of the country house surrounded by a beige-brown wall.
When they looked into the house, they found the bodies of three people about three metres further inside, which they immediately reported to the competent authorities.
One was wearing a yellow T-shirt and dark trousers, with no shoes; another, wearing a white top, lay next to him.
The body of another person wearing a red T-shirt and blue trousers lay barely a metre away.
All three were lying on their stomachs.
According to information obtained at the scene, the three people must have been murdered elsewhere as no cartridge casings were found.
On the wall of the farmhouse there are inscriptions written by one organised criminal gang to another, and several bullets were found in the wall and door.
11 people arrested in Cadereyta
The Secretaría de la Defensa Nacional (Secretariat of State for National Defense) introduced 11 people, including a minor, who were part of a criminal gang operating mainly in the town of Cadereyta, and who are linked to kidnappings, murder, halconeo (manhunt) and secret burials.
According to the information made public, eight people were arrested and one prisoner freed in the Los Alveros settlement on 11 November.
Three properties and a cell phone were seized and those arrested confirmed to be members of the criminal group "Los Zetas."
At 6 a.m. on November 12, military personnel on a patrol in the village of Rancho Viejo in Cadereyta found a car without license plates with two occupants.
During the inspection of the vehicle, the military found a long gun, a charger and 18 cartridges.
Later, at 2 p.m. on 13 November, one of their accomplices was arrested in the community of La Frauda, who tried to flee when he saw the military.
They are blamed for clandestine burials in the towns of General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
On Wednesday, formation of the new Italian government
The Prime Minister-designate, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to present the new government designed to deal with the crisis that has brought Italy to the brink of economic collapse.
The Prime Minister-designate, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to present the new government designed to deal with the crisis that has brought Italy to the brink of economic collapse.
A statement from the presidential palace announced that Monti, who was appointed on Sunday, would meet with President Giorgio Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm the formation of a government.
He is expected to present a cabinet composed mostly of technocrats, though it is not yet clear when the new prime minister will take office.
Monti said he would present to the president the results of talks with the political parties to form a government.
"I would like to reaffirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to cope with these difficult times," the former Commissioner told reporters.
Monti did not explicitly confirm the formation of the government, but his comments indicate that the obstacles have been overcome.
"The framework is now well defined," he added.
Monti has managed to form a government in less than three days, much less time than normal, while Italy is battling a political and financial crisis that has pushed the cost of its debt to intolerable levels.
The new government, led by former Commissioner Monti, must pass a tough austerity package demanded by euro leaders in order to regain confidence in Italy.
The rush pressure on Monti has been exacerbated by the volatile market, which has left Italian government bonds with a 10-year interest rate of 7%, the same level as when Greece and Ireland were forced to seek a European bailout.
Emma Marcegaglia, president of the Italian industry association Confindustria, told the press after a meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government to the full."
We believe that this government is the last chance for Italy to emerge from this emergency.
Monti's chances of success have been greatly boosted by the support of Silvio Berlusconi's PDL party, which was forced to resign on Saturday in the wake of the crisis.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts are destined to produce good results," said Angelino Alfano, secretary of the centre-right party.
The support of the PDL, Italy's largest party, is essential because, until now, many of its members have spoken out against the majority technocrat government that Monti is forming.
Support from Parliament
Monti's new government needs strong parliamentary support to implement the likely unpopular austerity measures.
Resistance to his efforts, or delaying reforms, could lead to another devastating attack on financial markets.
The Italian Federation of Foreign Banks is also pressing ahead, saying that Monti's failure would be a disaster.
Monti began his debates on Monday with political parties, trade unions and business associations, as well as with youth and women's organisations.
The session is due to conclude on Tuesday evening.
Monti was appointed this Sunday by Napolitano, who has set in motion an extremely rapid change of government in response to the crisis.
After a brief sigh of relief at the end of last week, when it was announced that Berlusconi would step down, uncertainty over the new prime minister's success has pushed the cost of Italian government bonds back to critical levels.
A bailout of Italy, with a national debt of €1.8 trillion, would be too much for the current EU bailout.
Monti said his government would have to wait until the next elections, expected to be held in 2013, despite predictions that politicians would only give him time to implement the reforms rather than bring forward the elections.
Monti has said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the main parties insist that it should be made up only of technicians, an indication of their concerns about the process imposed by financial market pressure.
Political sources point out that mutual distrust and disagreements between the parties complicate the involvement of political figures.
Spaniards have more playing opportunities than the Ticos
Of the 22 players recalled from Spain, ten have more than 50 international games under their belt.
From Costa Rica's side, only one of the 22 called-up players has played 50 games.
A huge difference for Costa Rica when the 22 players from both countries lined up for the friendly, which takes place today at 3.05pm at the national stadium of San José, are compared.
While the World and European Champions, number one in the FIFA monthly ranking, can look back on a considerable number of Class A matches, the tricolour team has only defender Michael Umana as the only one with over 50 international games.
He reached that number last Friday with the game against Panama (0-2) at Rommel Fernández.
The Spanish players, who play in the Liga de las Estrellas (star league) and influential clubs of the Premier League of England, have every year the opportunity to participate in numerous home games (league and cup championships) as well as high-level European cups such as the Champions League.
In addition, there is the experience with the Spanish fury in complicated elimination games at the Eurocup and the World Cup.
Tico footballers, on the other hand, have few international matches under the Concacaf, which is at the bottom of FIFA's rankings.
We will see how the Spanish team pulls out all the stops: the goalkeeper Iker Casillas, who last Saturday against England (defeat 0-1 in London) reached a tie with the former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta with 126 international games.
Casillas will play against the Three Lions today and Spain have a new record of 127 international matches.
Xavi Hernandez, a player at Barcelona football club, has 106.
Casillas and Xavi even received UEFA recognition last week, along with others from the Iberian team who had reached the magic number 100: the cited Zubizarreta with 126 and Schalke's centre forward Raúl González with 102.
Carles Puyol is also nearing a hundred with 97 games to play.
He is followed by Xabi Alonso with 91, Fernando Torres with 90, David Villa and Sergio Ramos both with 81, Andrés Iniesta with 62, Cesc Fábregas with 61 and David Silva with 53.
From the Ticos side and close to Michael Umana are the left-sided striker Júnior Díaz with 48 games and the striker Bryan Ruiz with 45.
Since then, only five have played more than 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernandez with 36 and José Luis Lopez with 35.
The one with the fewest games.
Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31) have played fewer than 30 games for Spain.
Roy Miller (26), Winston Parks (26), Gabriel Badilla (25) and Roy Myrie (23) played fewer than 30 games for the national team.
The rest are not even close to the 20 mark.
While Nacho Moreno has only four games and Jordi Alba two, Costa Rica's Víctor Bolívar has only one and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson have yet to make their debuts.
Spain's all-time leading goalscorer is David Villa with 50 goals, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
Bryan Ruiz scored the most goals for Costa Rica with nine, two more than Carlos Hernandez and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
The quintet included Costa Rica in their tour to celebrate its 20th anniversary
"Playing in Costa Rica is a dream come true"
In an exclusive interview with Viva, Pearl Jam bassist Jeff Ament says the band is ready to give one of their best concerts at the National Stadium next Sunday.
They were expected for more than 20 years, but the band assures that a dream will come true for them when they play in Costa Rica.
This was assured by the bassist and co-founder of the group, Jeff Ament, who gave an exclusive interview to Viva from Brazil last week.
The band is in the South American leg of their 20th anniversary tour, and on Sunday, the 20th, they will make their only stop in Central America.
On this day they will perform at the National Stadium from 7.30 pm together with the band The X from Los Angeles and Las Robertas from Costa Rica.
You can read an excerpt from the conversation, the full transcript of which can be found in the online edition of La Nación.
For your Costa Rican fans, a dream comes true when Pearl Jam plays in Costa Rica: Are you aware of what this means for your fans?
Playing in Costa Rica is a dream come true for us.
This is only the second time we have played in South and Central America, and so far it has been great.
I have only been to Costa Rica once for a holiday. It is such a beautiful country that we will definitely stay there for a few more days.
It's exciting for us to bring our music there.
I ask you this because the fans of the band are totally devoted, they experience the days before the concert most intensely.
What do you say to your most enthusiastic fans?
Thank you for standing by us all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica. Thank you for waiting so long and we are sorry for taking so long to get here.
Some people even think that your concert will be the biggest show of the year.
Doesn't that put a bit of pressure on your visit?
Some of the greatest shows we've put on in the last 21 years have taken place in the last two weeks.
We played some huge shows in Sao Paulo and we hope that they made us fit for this concert in Costa Rica.
Really, we want to play there.
We love this country, we love surfing and we love the jungle. Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you get to know Costa Rica and its waves for surfing?
Many of our friends are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo where the waves are just unimaginable.
My friends have always gone to Costa Rica and Nicaragua to surf. Along with Mexico, these are great places to surf. That's how, through people who love surfing, we learned about it.
With a view to the tour you offered huge shows with many songs.
What are your plans for the event in Costa Rica?
Since we have never played there before, we set no limits.
We will try to give the best possible show with many different songs. We want to play a few songs from each album and offer our fans a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat your repertoire.
Why?
I think that's partly because we have nine records and we can play over 120 songs. Everyone likes a different song, so it's not an easy decision which one we're going to play.
If we add two or three songs to the repertoire that we haven't played for a while, we can keep our concentration better and they surprise us because they remind us of the reasons why we liked these songs. Otherwise, they might be forgotten.
That makes the show more interesting for us and I think that's why it's interesting for the audience.
With this tour you celebrate your twenty-year history.
Looking back, do you find it hard to believe in your success?
Yeah, totally.
First of all, I don't think any of us ever imagined playing in a great rock band for more than 20 years. It's like a dream.
We continue to count on this blessing and think it's great to be able to make music together even now.
We like each other and are passionate about making music.
We are lucky to be able to go to places in the world that we have always wanted to visit.
Things couldn't be better.
What did it mean for you to have actively participated in the birth of grunge?
It has always been an honour to be part of this group of great bands.
We are good friends with the people from Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising and abundantly unusual for a movement to arise from a group of friends.
Every now and then a band emerges from a city, but it is unusual for five or ten groups to come from the same city at the same time.
We are proud and honored to be part of the Seattle Group.
Sometimes we still play together.
Last year we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and in Canada with Mudhoney and we saw Soundgarden on their tour. We are happy to still be friends with all of them and we are honored to be part of this emerging Seattle sound.
It is also very unusual that a band like yours has stayed together with the same musicians for so long.
Yes, four of us have been playing together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which in itself is a lot more time than a lot of bands survive.
First of all, I think we are all lucky to be alive, and we take care of each other.
We are all close friends, which is why musical paths have opened up, giving everyone the freedom to experiment.
One trusts the other and his music. We couldn't be better off.
Your relationship with fame has not always been easy. On the other hand, thanks to your success, you have always been able to do what you wanted.
How do you find a balance?
The way we've grown has made it easier for us to find a balance.
We make sure not to tour too much because it is too easy to fall for this game with huge crowds who love your music.
As long as you remember that people came for the music, it reminds you that you have to respect the music and what it brought to life without being obsessed with being a famous rock star. We never cared about that anyway.
What memories do you have of your other project Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote some very good songs and in the beginning it was great.
For three years we were a band that had never released a record until the death of Andy (Andrew Woods).
We were disappointed to have taken so long. We're still good friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who built the band with us. When I hear a song or see photos, I think about what an incredible person Andy was and how he made me laugh. It was always a pleasure to go to work, laugh together and talk about music and football and many other topics.
He was an extraordinary person and we will miss him.
The local band Las Robertas are responsible for the opening of the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know their work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose the band for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos of several groups and we liked this band the most, so we are curious to see what Las Robertas can offer live, which will be exciting.
Why do you always change the lyrics of Yellow Ledbetter when you play live?
That's a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), I have no idea.
He sings it, and I think he sings the first thing that comes to his mind.
Who were you influenced by as a bass player?

Among the first to come to mind are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many that I could talk all afternoon about the bassists I like.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep grunge alive, even though it's no longer a fad?
I don't think we all feel very connected to the word grunge.
When I think about it, I think of the bands I mentioned before, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the others that came up at the same time. If they're still important today, I think that's great because it's worth listening to this music and bands like Mudhoney are making better music now than ever before.
In the beginning her music was darker, now it is more positive.
Why?
That's interesting, because I think there are a few songs on the new album that might seem a bit frivolous, but there are also other songs like The End or Just Breathe that are classified as very dark songs, although there is something positive about them.
They both brought tears to my eyes when I heard Ed play them. They are very dark songs.
I think when you get older and something traumatic has happened in your life - for example when you lose a family member or a friend - it affects your art and your music and these two songs embody that for me.
But I also believe that you can be a happy person and still make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori returned to hospital for medical checks
Former President Alberto Fujimori was admitted to a public hospital on Tuesday to examine the loss of muscle in his legs, his family doctor said.
Fujimori, 72, who is serving 25 years in prison for human rights violations during his rule (1990-2000), has several illnesses, including tongue cancer, which has been operated on four times and is under control.
Alejandro Aguinaga, a congressman and his personal physician, told television that Fujimori would be examined for three days at the Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Neoplásicas in Peru to determine the cause of his pain and muscle loss in the lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that in his opinion Fujimori could be pardoned on humanitarian grounds. Nevertheless, he did not wish to do so because he considers him innocent.
He has undergone four surgeries for tongue cancer and lost 18 kilos, as well as other ailments such as severe erosive gastritis, a cyst in the pancreas, kidney stones, high blood pressure and circulatory problems in the legs, the doctor said.
Fujimori has been held in the Dirección Nacional de Operaciones Especiales de la policía since September 2007.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the murder of 25 people by the death squad of the Peruvian army, which operated clandestinely during his reign.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official delegation led by Uruguayan President José Mujica and consisting of several ministers and businessmen will begin their visit to Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two countries and discuss political issues in the region.
Mujica will meet with his Mexican counterpart Felipe Calderón next Wednesday, which the Uruguayan president says will be the culmination of his packed schedule of meetings with politicians, businessmen and a meeting with the collective of Uruguayans living in Mexico.
The meeting between the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara "lends itself to the exchange of information on all policy areas between the two countries," the South American country's presidential office announced on its website.
According to local media, Mujica sought Calderón's support over the incident with France when French Prime Minister Nicolas Sarkozy put the South American country on a list of tax havens at the G20 summit in the French city of Cannes.
In his discourse, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries that still operate as tax havens, a declaration rejected by Uruguay and prompted a request from its ambassador to the European country.
Mexico has chaired the G20, a group of the world's most powerful emerging and developed economies, since November. Since January this year, an agreement has been in place with the South American country on the exchange of tax information to avoid double taxation.
In recent years, the Uruguayan government has tried to speed up the finalization of tax information exchange agreements in order to be removed from the "grey list" of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which includes countries that have not adopted all international standards for tax cooperation.
On a commercial level, a free trade agreement between Mexico and Uruguay has been in place since 2004, which has contributed to an increasing exchange of goods between the two countries.
The mustachioed plumber enters the third dimension with "Super Mario 3D Land"
For 25 years, Super Mario has fought tirelessly to rescue Princess Peach from the clutches of the evil Bowser, but never in three dimensions: in Super Mario 3D Land, he fights for the girl's love in stereo technology.
The game, which hits store counters around the world this month, has been tailored from the start to the characteristics of the Nintende 3DS portable console, which can play in three dimensions without the need for special glasses.
"Mario is the figure who has to explain how stereoscopy works without glasses," said Omar Álvarez, who is in charge of the Nintendo press in Spain, at the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Álvarez explained that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first video game from Nintendo that has been developed for this console from the beginning," because until now successful games like "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of existing titles.
The Nintendo spokesman stressed that although it is three-dimensional, "Super Mario 3D Land" is an "affordable" video game that allows for fast, fluid play.
Álvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contained two games in one: the first part is "easy" to capture the less savvy users.
After that, the experts can take a "second turn" on the different levels of the game, which are getting more and more difficult.
In addition, users can choose in real time between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action. However, in order to overcome the obstacles without falling victim to the "optical effects," it is always necessary to play in three dimensions.
Super Mario's foray into the three-dimensional world also means the character's return to a portable console, which has not been the case since 2005.
With this video game, Nintendo winks at the fans of the saga and repeats the recipe for success of recent editions: the mustachioed plumber must overcome perilous platforms to free Princess Peach.
However, the player comes across novelties in the movements, the environment, the disguises and the enemies - and a "playable" Luigi.
Colom guarantees Portillo's extradition to the United States
The President of Guatemala, Álvaro Colom, announced this Tuesday that he would authorize the extradition of former Governor Alfonso Portillo to face charges in the United States of conspiring to launder USD 70 million.
That is how the trial ends on the US request for Portillo's extradition so that he can be tried there.
In a press conference, Colom confirmed that his decision was based on the independence of the judiciary and the government, taking into account that a decision-making court had already ordered the extradition.
He stressed that during his government he had not interfered in court decisions and had granted all extradition requests of which he had been informed.
In addition to Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín is extradited for murder and grievous bodily harm, Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
Colom's action is an act of government that takes place when all judicial and constitutional instances for the sentencing of the former President of the State (2000-2004) have been exhausted.
According to the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court of Guatemala, Portillo must be extradited once his legal situation in Guatemale has been clarified and his human rights guaranteed.
Portillo was acquitted of embezzling 120 million quetzales in the Ministry of Defense during his reign, a trial that preceded extradition, but the minister objected and revived the case.
Trinijove has helped 6,000 young people at risk of social exclusion
The organisation was set up to prevent the marginalisation of young people without vocational training.
The first 25 years of life of the Trinijove social assistance organisation have yielded important results: in this quarter of a century, 6,000 young people at risk of social exclusion have been helped to find a way out of their difficult situation.
In addition, there are over a hundred jobs created for this social group.
Yesterday, on the occasion of the anniversary, more than 300 people attended an event in the former Fabra i Coats factory premises to take stock of the situation.
Trinijove was founded in 1986 in the district of Trinitat Vella with the aim of helping young people with low levels of education, unemployed, with drug problems, who were at risk of marginalization.
Yesterday's celebration in Sant Andreu was attended by many persons in charge of institutions and institutions that have collaborated with the Association in these 25 years.
The participation of political representatives of different persuasions at election time proved the impartiality of the work done by Trinijove.
In addition to the President of the Generalitat (Parliament of the Autonomous Region of Catalonia), Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, the celebrations were attended by the former Socialist Minister of Education, Ernest Maragall, and the former mayor and current left-green councillor Ricard Goma.
The Great Hall of Fabra i Coats was also visited by the current Catalan Minister of Social Affairs and Family Affairs, Josep Lluís Cleries, and Jaume Lanaspa, Director General of the Social Work Department of La Caixa Savings Bank.
Mas emphasized that Trinijove was created in very difficult times and that today's times are no less complicated, but added that the work done so far "is a good foundation."
For the President of the Generalitat, Trinijove is a model who knows how to fight against difficult circumstances and gives hope to people in difficulty.
"The economic crisis is nothing new for the club and the work it is doing," he said.
Squatted house where giant parties were held has been evacuated
The homeowners had occupied 11 of the 13 apartments in the building at 51 Balmes Street (Barcelona).
The 12 squatters left the building yesterday afternoon without having resisted.
Everything indicates that the nightmares of the neighbors of House 51 on Balmes Street have come to an end.
Twelve people voluntarily left the building they had illegally occupied yesterday lunchtime, where they had organised huge parties that had driven the neighbourhood to despair, and the eviction was ordered by a judge without police intervention.
After the eviction, the door lock was changed to avoid a similar situation.
"From now on, access will be controlled," the property manager confirmed.
The squatters, who had occupied 11 of the 13 apartments in the building - the rest were inhabited - took all the electrical equipment and part of the water supply with them, painted the walls and left all kinds of garbage, especially cans of alcoholic beverages.
Huge parties were held on the three lower floors, lasting up to two days, driving the tenants to despair.
Next to the building is a nightclub, Balmes 51, which also suffered damage.
Its owner, Maria Pantinat, told Europa Press that her business had fallen by 80% since the squatting began.
The owner of the discotheque pointed out that the squatters were making unfair competition, because they sold the drinks for three euros, while in the discotheque they cost 10 euros.
In addition, the owner of the leisure centre had been reported by the neighbours for disturbing the peace, while, according to her, the noise did not come from the visitors to the disco, but from the squatters and, in particular, from the guests of the parties that were organised there, which, according to the disgruntled neighbours, have been getting longer and longer in recent weeks.
The person in charge of the nightclub explained that the harassment was so great that she agreed with the owner of the building that she would not have to pay rent for the last nine months.
The Guardia Urbana (Metropolitan Police) also confirmed that it had received more complaints from neighbours in recent weeks.
The leader of the PP (Partido Popular - Popular Party) in the Barcelona City Council, Alberto Fernández Díaz, demanded last week that the building be evacuated immediately and that the problems of civic coexistence and the downfall of the neighbourhood be dealt with.
He explained that before the summer, only one floor of the building had been occupied, but that in recent months the squatters had penetrated all the floors of the building and almost all the apartments. In some cases, there had even been thefts.
In this sense, he added that "it is necessary to put an end to impunity and crack down on the anti-social acts in the building."
Yesterday, another building in the Nou Barris neighbourhood was evacuated by Catalan police.
At 3: 30 p.m., the police approached 35 Montral Street after receiving a call from a neighbor who had observed four people trying to enter the building.
The four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountain?
Apart from the disputes over fees, the architects agree to the tender.
The municipal tender for the 16 gates reopens the debate on the importance of Collserola in Barcelona.
In the mid-1980s, at the height of the now defunct Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this administration published its diatribe on the promotion of Collserola.
The brochure described the mountain as a huge park in Barcelona city.
It has even been compared in numbers to New York's Central Park.
With the sinking of the CMB in 1987, the park became in the eyes of many the upper limit of Barcelona, because the capital of Catalonia is one of the few that does not extend in a north-south direction, but up (mountains) and down (sea).
The classification of Collserola as a nature park plays with this idea.
The model was no longer Central Park, but Yellowstone with wild boars in the role of the yoga bear.
That was the situation when, in September, the city issued a huge call for tenders, consisting of 16 competitions, for additional access gates to Collserola.
There is no doubt that a gate refers to the concept of a park.
Either that or someone intends to put gates up in the countryside.
The question arises: Collserola, park or mountain?
The call for tenders is the topic on the lips of all Barcelona architects, not only from an organisational point of view, but also with a view to reflecting on the city.
It is almost a recurrent theme that two members of this long-established caste, who meet in an elevator, can fall back on.
And it is this fact that provides the material for one of the rare similarities between what three Barcelona architects think about it and some university professors who have applied for the project.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: The tender is appropriate.
For Roldán, after the attack on the coast, "it is necessary" to talk about the "front in the mountains," as far as the discourse of Ildefons Cerda, about the green apples, has not been carried out.
"One should start from the principle that Barcelona's largest park is the beach.
Partly because it is easily accessible.
Collserola is more complex, "declares the architect, for whom the title" Gates of Collserola "entails a" lexical trap ": it must not be imagined" as an entrance to a park, but as a delimitation of areas in which action is needed. "
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with urban planning experience, sees the proposal as an "intellectual challenge" that carries "some dangers."
Dangers arising from the "uncertainty that the design of a public space entails nowadays" after the experiences of the 1980s, which had their "swan song" in the forum area.
The first fear is to restrict oneself to what may be cultivated.
"Limiting something always means determining the next step," i.e. exceeding it.
"New urban planning instruments need to be considered, because the current ones [referring to the General Metropolitano Plan (PGM)] can lead to a real catastrophe."
Modol, who is closer to the question, says simply that the side of Collserola that goes in the direction of Vallesana "can be understood as a park that does not go in the direction of Barcelona," for purely topographical reasons.
Modol recalls that there is already a study by the Patronat de Collserola that "should not fall on deaf ears," although he is grateful to the Municipality for giving his committee the opportunity to participate in this project "from the very beginning."
He also notes that the proximity of the mountains to the city is the guideline that allows architects to take part in the debate, although he expresses "doubts" about whether this technical profile should guide the multidisciplinary teams that have been set up ("just the thing," he says) "We architects should be just a tool."
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question in the title of this article is complex, as the terms of the tender lack a global view of Collserola: "There were 16 cross-section competitions," he says, "on the mountain-sea axis. But there is no longitudinal perspective that looks at the area as a whole."
That, at least in his case, has led to him taking part in the 16 competitions.
Otherwise, the program and definition of a project for a gate would collide with that of the architect of the gate next to it.
In his opinion, the city should absolutely guarantee that the strip directly above the Ronda de Dalt is equipped along its entire length in such a way that a smooth transition between the city and green areas is created.
Casino forgives Jonás Larrazábal, who is released
After 72 days of silence, the commissioner of Casino Red released the brother of the mayor of Monterrey from the case against him for alleged extortion.
After 72 days of imprisonment, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal is released after the commissioner of Casino Red forgives him in the Second Criminal Court of the District, which is conducting the extortion case against the brother of the mayor of Monterrey.
After the attack on Casino Royale, Sergio Gil García, the owner of Casino Red, published a series of photos and videos showing Manuel Jonás allegedly forcing him to pay a sum of money to get the municipality to authorise the clandestine operation of the betting house.
Following the lawsuit, the Procuratorate opened criminal proceedings against the brother of the panicked mayor, who was arrested for 30 days on September 2nd.
After four hours with the official of the Ministerio Público 3 en Delitos Patrimoniales, he was taken to Casa de Arraigo 1 in the Barrio Antiguo of the capital.
He remained there 49 days after a second arrest warrant was issued, after the official of the Ministerio Público rejected the charges of bribery and organized crime.
On 19 October, he was transferred to the Cadereyta Detention Centre for allegedly bribing the owners of Casino Red with one and a half million pesos. However, he only spent a few hours on the medium security wing because of death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to participate in the trial as an inmate of the municipal prison of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On 25 October, the secretary of the Second Criminal Court of the District, Jorge Yánez, issued a warrant for his arrest, stating that, after almost two months of investigation, there was sufficient evidence to convict Jonás of paying 1.5 million pesos to the betting house's representatives in exchange for opening it.
This Monday, the commissioner of Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, asked Judge José Luis Pecina, the mayor's brother, to release him in the next few hours.
During the court hearing, Ramiro Arias, the official of the Ministerio Público assigned to the court, asked García Gómez whether he had repaired the damage and which one of the owners of the betting house had forgiven him, but the lawyer withheld the name.
In accordance with Case 197 / 2011, Jonás Larrazábal is acquitted and no appeal can be lodged against the trial and no compensation is sought.
Larrazabal Breton was released immediately following a hearing with the betting house's procurator fiscal at around 3.50pm.
The court secretary, Jorge Yánez, went to the municipal prison of San Nicolás de los Garza to inform Jonás that he had been acquitted and that his case would be closed.
He also informed him of the judge's order for his immediate release.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome gives details of the plane crash that killed government secretary Francisco Blake and seven other people.
The Secretaría de Comunicaciones y Transportes - SCT (Secretariat of Communications and Transportation in Mexico) informed that the results of the investigation into the accident, in which the Secretary of State Francisco Blake Mora and seven other people died, indicate that the helicopter with all its intact structure crashed directly onto the ground, without the pilot being able to initiate an emergency landing.
At a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transport, mentioned that the pilot had confirmed before take-off that the weather conditions were suitable for the flight.
"The fact that the propeller blades came into contact with trees at a height of 25 metres, with the helicopter losing its fuselage, seems to indicate that the helicopter had made several ground contacts."
He also explained that the helicopter was built for 19 passengers, which is why it met all the requirements for transporting personnel.
He also said no helicopter parts were found in the area where the plane came down.
"No aircraft parts were found in other places during the search, the impact affected the entire structure.
The helicopter was built for 19 passengers, which is why it fulfilled all requirements for transporting passengers.
The area has a slope of 7 to 30 degrees.
At the moment, the priority is to get the results of the investigation as soon as possible, but it could take several months, perhaps even a year.
For his part, Gilberto López Meyer, General Manager of Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliares (Secretariat for Aircraft and Emergency Services in Mexico), confirmed that the helicopter from the Estado Mayor Presidencial had been flying at cruising speed on impact and that the plane had fallen onto a soft slope.
'This information reinforces the assumption that it was a normal flight operation at the time of impact, 'he said.
At a press conference, the head of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, listed six relevant points that should be taken into account in the investigation:
Visual flight:
In accordance with aviation standards, it was a flight according to the rules of visual flight. This means that the crew must have had sufficient visibility during the flight and on the ground.
Weather conditions:
The AICM recorded suitable weather conditions at take-off. During the onward flight towards the border area between Mexico City and Mexico State, some low-hanging clouds were gathering.
Selected flight routes:
It is possible that the crew chose a lower area with better visibility towards the Cuernavaca Valley because of the clouds.
Impact site:
The co-ordinates of the impact and the last radar recording of the helicopter match. Possibly, there was neither a loss of control over the aircraft nor a deviation from the flight path before the impact.
Scattering the remains of the aircraft in a limited area:
The information available to date indicates that the helicopter had crashed from both a straight and a lateral direction.
The pattern of the scattered remains of the aircraft suggests that the helicopter, with its intact structure, had hit the ground.
No evidence of fire or explosion:
The remains of the plane do not indicate fire or explosion at the scene of the accident.
The latest results of the investigation indicate several soil contacts.
During the on-site investigations, aircraft parts were found at an altitude of 9,200 feet above sea level. The terrain is sloping and has a slope of seven to thirty degrees.
The photos show the sequence in which the helicopter is likely to have broken up.
Some information suggests the helicopter may have had multiple ground contacts.
After a painstaking search in an area that went beyond the cordoned-off area at the scene of the accident, no scattered aircraft parts could be found, reinforcing the assumption that the intact aircraft structure had crashed to the ground.
MSS Announces a Research Protocol to Find the Obesity Gene
She is leading a research project to find the obesity gene in children and adolescents, which is being supported by specialists at the IPN.
The Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (IMSS) announced that it is conducting a research project to discover the gene for childhood and adolescent obesity, entitled "Genetics of childhood and adolescent obesity," aimed at identifying the genetic markers associated with obesity.
Miguel Cruz López, Head of the Unidad de Investigación Médica en Bioquímica (Department of Medical Research, Focus on Biochemistry) at the Hospital de Especialidades del Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI, explained that an interdisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers has been set up.
This team is supported by specialists and postgraduate students at the Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública (INSP) and at the Centro de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados (Cinvestav) del Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN).
The population is invited to participate in the study. Interested parties can come to the sports fields of the IMSS in the Valley of Mexico, where tests with children and adolescents are carried out every Saturday from 8 am.
He stressed that the investigation began at the sports field of Cuauhtémoc (in the west of the state of Mexico) and will continue since 8 October at the sports field of Nezahualcóyolt (in the east of the state of Mexico).
Once the target of 500 to 600 subjects is reached, the study will be continued at the Independencia sports field (in the south of the capital district) and completed at the Morelos sports field (in the north of the capital district).
He said the aim of the study was to understand the factors and role of genetics in the development of obesity and to identify risk factors for prevention of chronic degenerative diseases in Mexican children and adolescents.
On the occasion of the World Diabetes Day, he said that the aim was for three thousand children and adolescents between the ages of six and 14 to complete nutrition questionnaires with the consent and supervision of their parents.
They are also asked questions about their physical activity and family history of illness in order to control risk factors that could lead to diabetes or kidney failure.
He also explained that on the Saturdays mentioned above, the subjects were measured (weight, height, waist circumference), their blood pressure was controlled and blood values such as glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors (an attempt to identify genes related to childhood obesity) were determined.
Cruz López said the study was carried out in response to health workers' concerns about alarming weight gain among young people.
"The health surveys from 1999 and 2006 showed that in just under six years, the proportion of obese boys increased by 77 per cent and that of girls with obesity by 47 per cent. Obesity also increased dramatically," emphasised the specialist from the IMSS.
He said the search for genetic markers was justified because the genetic history of the Mexican population was different from that of other peoples.
He stated that, on average, a Mexican is 65 percent Indian-American, 30 percent European, and 5 percent African, which is reflected in the genes associated with diabetes and obesity.
More generally, he explained that the genetics of obesity are expressed in the inability to burn the excess energy (calories) we consume, so that it is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher said the direct benefit for the study participants would be a comprehensive study of the children to determine whether they were overweight or obese.
It would even investigate the occurrence of dark skin folds in the neck and inner arm (acanthosis), which indicate the likelihood of metabolic disorders and diabetes in the early stages.
All information would be treated confidentially and communicated to parents in writing by doctors, who would explain all measurement results to parents and propose lifestyle changes that are appropriate to prevent disease.
Cruz López explained that there are three basic factors that are responsible for overweight, obesity, and other chronic diseases: lack of exercise, that is, lack of daily exercise, spending most of the day in front of the TV, and using transportation instead of walking short distances.
The high calorie intake, i.e. an increased consumption of sugary drinks and carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) together with a high fat and protein intake, as well as the genetics to be analyzed in this research project.
Asphalt from UNAM prevents potholes
Rafael Herrera, a researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry at the Mexican University of UNAM, is developing asphalt modified with polymers to make the mixture more resistant to weather conditions and temperature fluctuations.
If the signs emanating from the road surface were observed, it would not be necessary to repair nearly 200,000 potholes when the rainy season breaks out in the Metropolitan Zone of Mexico Valley, said Rafael Herrera Nájera, a researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) at UNAM University, warning that if the asphalt surface is properly laid and maintained, the number of potholes will be significantly reduced or even completely avoided.
In his lecture "Potholes from a technical point of view," which he gave on the occasion of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory for which he is responsible is developing asphalt modified with polymers to produce a mixture similar to asphalt, but with greater mechanical resistance at both high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera said that this type of modified asphalt should be used in areas with extremely hot climates, such as some cities in the north of the country, to improve the performance of the road surface and thus prevent the occurrence of potholes.
He explained that asphalt - the heaviest part of petroleum - is a hydrocarbon compound, one of which has a high molecular weight - the so-called asphalt - and the other a low one - the so-called malthenes. Together, they give the road surface its characteristic viscous elastic behaviour.
Viscoelastic behaviour of asphalt means that it behaves like a liquid at high temperatures of almost 180 ° C, at 120 ° C it is very viscous and at 50 ° C it is almost solid, while at very low temperatures it becomes brittle.
"This means that the resistance of the asphalt on the roads is not uniform, but changes in one day depending on weather conditions and temperature fluctuations," explained the chemical engineer.
The FQ researcher noted that the majority of the streets of Mexico City have a flexible pavement made up of six layers of material, the last three of which contain asphalt.
Between the top layers lies a wear layer of asphalt, which consists of small stones bathed in asphalt and then solidified.
Every single stone of this wear layer has been bathed in asphalt.
When the vehicles move on it and forces are generated, this layer enables a good distribution of forces in the road surface.
"If it were modified asphalt, the forces would be distributed even better," said the chemical engineer.
"Above the wear layer," he explained, "a final layer is laid, the so-called base layer, which consists of tiny stones, i.e. sand that has also been bathed in asphalt.
Since this layer is in contact with the vehicle tyres, it requires a greater mechanical force than the wear layer and it must produce friction.
In addition to receiving and distributing the most forces from this road surface, the base layer also needs an appropriate thickness and the material of which it is composed needs to be maintained.
Weather conditions, especially humidity and temperature fluctuations, are other important factors to take into account, especially water, "he said," because it significantly affects the behaviour of the wear layer.
When the terrain becomes damp, water penetrates the layer and is difficult to escape, causing softening of all layers of the road surface and consequently the occurrence of potholes.
"When a pothole occurs," he said, "the top layer is removed first, and the wear layer is affected only afterwards, but the damage is not immediate; it is a process that should be maintained by appropriate maintenance programs at the first signs."
The member of the Sistema Nacional de Investigadores (National Research System of Mexico) explained that the vehicle load is another important cause of the occurrence of potholes. Therefore, the thickness of each layer of the road surface must always be proportional to the vehicle load and it must be ensured that this regulation is respected in order to avoid frequent potholes.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that there was still a lot of research to be done, for example on asphalt emulsions, which are already on the market in other countries, and which could be used to repair potholes easily and without using high temperatures.
What was missing from the candidate del Valle to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that led to Melina Ramírez Serna not being crowned Miss Colombia.
El Valle receives his 14th title.
Once again, Valle del Cauca came up empty when it came to awarding the crown to Miss Colombia.
This time, Melina Ramírez Serna had to be content to stand on the winner's podium, displaying a silver crown and the ribbon that identifies her as the new Miss Colombia.
With the result obtained that night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico took the crown and the cedar, the Departamento comes to 14 titles and Melina joins the legion of women from Valle del Cauca who had almost held the crown. Among the proclaimed misses are: Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
The big question many are asking themselves today is: what was missing?
For the result is the demise of a great favorite, who had shown at every show that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia. Not for nothing had she been elected Queen of the Police and Mejor Rostro Jolie of Vogue, titles that beauty queens Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro had also received, and who took home the crown of Miss Colombia.
The first factor considered crucial to the jury's decision to name her First Miss is that she was not convinced by the answer to the question "Which book has influenced you the most and why?" put to her by Martín Murillo Gómez of the Carreta Literaria Leamos.
The young woman from Valle del Cauca replied to the questioner:
"I read a lot, I pretty much believe in literature, I think it's a way of civilizing myself, at the end of the day I think the book that shaped my childhood the most is' The Little Prince ', a pretty deep book.
At the moment I am reading 'Guilt and Atonement'. It is a book of universal culture that we should all read. I am reading a book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a beautiful book called 'Passions'.
It was an answer that met with little response, firstly because of the concept of 'civilising', and secondly because it did not explain in concrete terms how each book she mentioned had influenced her.
But at the end of the ceremony Melina declared that she felt calm and happy with the result: "The universe is wise, what needs to happen is happening.
And for all people: please read a little bit 'The Little Prince'. It is a great book.
Among other things, it is said that the darling of El Valle has burnt out.
A journalist from Bogota suggested that the fact that she was the favourite to win all the applause and all the prizes beforehand (Easter gastronomy competition, public vote for the best hand-made costume and Reina Madre) had "made the other candidates jealous, which stressed the Queen, who was therefore unable to shine on stage."
And that was evident during her first appearance in a swimsuit on the beach at the Hilton hotel and her two lifts at the coronation ceremony.
Although she performed confidently in both, she lacked the strength and verve that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico displayed.
Ariel Osorio, journalist for the programme "Como en casa" on the RCN channel, said that the fact that Melina was crowned Miss "shows that the candidate who wins the most prizes during the competition will not end up being Queen after all."
Valle also avoided the press at the end - a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury of her interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Contest.
There will be a reason why, two days before the international jury was to be assembled, Lucy Doughty declared that they were looking for a woman who was engaged in the social affairs of her country.
"Beauty alone is not enough for a Miss Colombia. You have to look beyond the physical and focus on the social sensation, on the fact that she had worked on projects before entering the competition," she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle sinned with her derriere and fibrosis defects, which were found in her stomach area, but this is contradictory, as the jury chose her as a candidate for 'natural beauty' with a healthy body, good eating habits and responsible physical work.
The Queens "coach, Jorge Hernán Orozco, admits that Melina didn't have the best body, that there were better ones," but her problem with fibrosis in the abdomen, which was to be honest barely noticeable to me, pushed her score on the last day. "
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos of Cromos magazine believes that the mistake of the woman from Valle del Cauca was the surgical procedure she underwent.
'The surgeries are ok but I didn't know how to get them done properly.
Her body has never been her strong point and this is where she's had to pay the price. '
Because of this prize, which is awarded for the first time by the National Beauty Contest, a cruel prediction arose after the appearance in the swimsuit, which was to come true on the night. It was whispered that Raymundo had given Melina a consolation prize so as not to let her enjoy the crown.
Whether that is true or not, the fact is that Melina is entering her final year as a sovereign, not a queen, but a princess - a post which suggests she will have some way to go in extending her royal connections.
However, she will go down in history as one of the queens who missed out on the crown despite her stunning performance for Cartagena.
Such was the work of the doctor who identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A Cali ophoscopist went down in history as the man who identified "Alfonso Cano."
The work of these officials plays a key role.
Last 4 November, a ophoscopist from the Investigative Unit of the Prosecutor's Office (CTI) of Cali arrived as the man who confirmed the identity of the leader of the FARC (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia): "Alfonso Cano" by comparing fingerprints.
Of the seven ophoscopists in the department of the CTI, this week Eliazar González, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been involved in criminal investigations for 21 years, had on-call duty.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in communities in Chocó, where he often had to go into the jungle for five days to reach the place where the bodies he was supposed to identify were.
In 2000 he moved to Valle and after completing the necessary courses he specialised in ophoscopy, which is the examination of the skin exposed to friction, i.e. the palms of the hands and feet.
During the week of the operation against the so-called Alfonso Cano, Eliazar was advised to pack clothes for at least three days.
Something big was waiting for him.
He flew by helicopter from Palmira to Cauca on Friday night.
He knew that he had to identify two corpses and that there was a suspicion that one could be that of the man who had led the oldest guerrilla in the world, so he had to take the ten-finger print of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name) with him.
However, when he reached the site of the corpse with the examiner, he was unable to identify it because of his physical appearance, which did not resemble the images he had seen in the mass media.
He had no beard, was dressed like a local farmer, wore no glasses and was much thinner.
But fingerprints don't lie.
Armed with a magnifying glass, ink, a trowel and a flashlight, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the corpse to those on the imprint sheet.
He was right: It was "Alfonso Cano."
That same night, this man from Puerto Tejada was in charge of informing the Minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinzón, that he was in fact the head of the FARC.
Searching for clues
For a dactyloscope from the Sijín in Cali, the appreciation given by the president Juan Manuel Santos Eliazar González at a press conference about the operation against "Cano" was very important.
Many people do not know our work.
Dactyloscopy is an exact science with no margin for error that can be a key factor in solving a crime.
Lophoscopists do not only identify corpses, they also support investigations into murders and robberies and confirm the identity of the persons arrested.
At the time of their arrest, many offenders present false identification documents or they do not have one.
We take their fingerprints and search the database.
The researcher told us that in case of a theft he had to tear a piece of wall out of a house, because the thief had propped himself up with his hand right there when he pulled out a safe full of jewelry and money.
"Walls are difficult because their surfaces are unsuitable for taking fingerprints, but in this case we were able to take the imprint of the whole hand and identify the offender who had participated in several thefts," he recalled.
The fingerprints can also be used to exonerate or charge murder suspects.
Recently, a dead man was found surrounded by liquor bottles.
The investigation suggested that a family member could be a suspect, and in fact a fingerprint on the bottle matched.
Although this does not guarantee that the murderer is involved, it is nevertheless linked to the place where the crime was committed.
A CTI dactyloscopist explained that "the fingerprints are taken from the object with chemical or physical reagents."
When they appear, a trowel or ribbon is used to take them with you.
Afterwards the prints are sent to Asif, which is the criminal database, or to the civil registry office.
"The problem is that there are still many undocumented Colombians," said the CTI expert.
He said that not everything is as it is portrayed in the TV series SCI.
Just as not everything that glitters is gold, not everything you touch is a fingerprint.
But it can still be used if you make a comparison.
The "Outraged" challenge the authorities in New York
Hundreds of protesters crowded into tents in Zuccotti Square.
Much of it complied with the eviction order and moved to a nearby park.
Members of the Ocupy Wall Street movement challenged New York City authorities on Tuesday as they sought a judge's order to re-enter Manhattan Square after being evicted at dawn and trying to occupy another square in the Big Apple.
Hundreds of demonstrators crowded in front of Zuccotti Square, where they tried to gain access with a court order allowing the "indignant" to camp there again. Meanwhile, another part of the movement complied with the eviction order and occupied a park further north in the city, where nine people were arrested.
"Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp in the square, we will gather in another place and continue the battle by legal means to return to Zuccotti, with sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations," said Mark Bray, a spokesman for the "Ocupy Wall Street" movement.
Bray explained that the "indignant" response to the eviction of their encampment, ordered directly by Michael Bloomberg, the mayor of New York, came to court, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order banning the forcible eviction of the site and allowing protesters to camp.
In addition, the "Outraged" occupied a new park at the intersection of centrally located Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, near the entrance to the Holland Tunnel linking New York and New Jersey, which is owned by Trinity Church.
They were able to occupy the site for at least an hour, but then the police arrived and arrested some of the demonstrators, although Bray cannot give exact figures. He assured the Efe news agency that he had seen several journalists in handcuffs among them.
The organization said hundreds of people had gathered at the site, where a delegation of religious leaders had also arrived to show their support for the movement's members and to mediate with the police.
Meanwhile, Zuccotti Square (a privately owned site) remains closed pending a court hearing scheduled for this Tuesday to examine the legality of the early-morning eviction.
Some of the protesters driven from the square carried and distributed photocopies of the court order, and even gave them to some policemen guarding the square, resulting in "some small clashes," according to Bray, who reported that some policemen had beaten protesters.
The judge's order forbids authorities from evicting Occupy Wall Street members, as well as from applying "laws passed after the occupation and prohibiting demonstrators from returning to the park with their tents and other belongings they had previously used."
Mayor Bloomberg made it clear to the press that this court order had canceled the re-opening of the square to the public and the demonstrators, pointing out to the demonstrators that the city laws did not allow them to re-set up tents and sleeping bags at the site.
The mayor personally defended the pre-dawn eviction of Zuccotti Square, in which nearly 200 people were arrested, which was decided because the demonstrators "violated the law."
Bloomberg said he had given the order to evacuate the square because it had "turned into a place where people didn't come to demonstrate, but to break the law and in some cases to harm others," because "some businesses had received threats" and residents were "afraid for their quality of life."
"The dawn eviction was disgusting and shows that Bloomberg is fundamentally interested in protecting financial interests, not protecting the interests of North American workers," added the movement's spokesman, who accused the mayor of "not respecting freedom of the press."
The leaders of "Occupy Wall Street" announced that they are considering organizing "major actions" for Thursday, together with community organizations and unions, to commemorate the two months that the protests have been going on since September 17.
Pamela Anderson is the Virgin Mary in the TV Christmas show
She will appear alongside Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities in the TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on Dec.
The Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement," lifeguard in "Baywatch," rabbit in "Playboy," the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a Canadian TV Christmas broadcast.
The private TV channel CTV announced today that Anderson, along with "crooner" (ballad singer) Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities, will appear on the TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1 and breathe life into a very special Virgin Mary.
CTV broadcast images today of the television program in which Anderson - who also appears on the Internet for the distribution of a self-made porn in which she appears with her former husband, drummer Tommy Lee of "Mötley Crüe" - appears as the Virgin Mary with a doll in her lap that is supposed to represent Jesus.
In the scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian origin who recently worked as a host on Charlie Sheen's show "My Violent Torpedo of Truth," appears as the baby Jesus.
The Christmas programme of CTV not only focuses on Anderson and Peters, but also on the Canadian singer Bublé, who married the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato at the end of March in Buenos Aires, and who is not far from this controversy.
At one of his recent concerts in New York, Bublé referred to North American Kim Kardashian as a "whore."
Japan is reborn after the earthquake
GDP grows by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends the spiral of free fall from the beginning of March
Since last March, the Japanese economy had been paralyzed, still recovering from the devastating earthquake that led to a nuclear crisis, and the worst disaster that Japan had experienced since World War II.
Initial estimates from the Tokyo government put the damage at $300,000, a blow that appears to be easing despite the difficult global economic situation.
After three consecutive quarters of declines, the data on the gross domestic product from July to September served finally to close this chapter: GDP grew by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% compared to the rate projected for the year.
The second-quarter figure - Japan's fiscal year begins in March 2012 - also represents the fastest growth since the January-March 2010 period.
The recovery can partly be explained by the sale of machinery to rebuild areas devastated by the earthquake and subsequent tsunami.
Indeed, companies increased their investment by 1.1%, compared with the 0.9% decline recorded for capital expenditures from January to March, the first decline after six months of inexorable increases.
Nonetheless, the real turnaround in Japan's economy is not based solely on Keynesian impulses to use the crisis to build or rebuild infrastructure.
Japan has woken up, in particular, to the evolution of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japan's GDP.
This variable increased by 1%, driven by increased spending on vehicles, travel and leisure activities.
The stigma of the yen
Tokyo has entrusted itself to the domestic market after the yen - the Japanese currency - became one of the "safe haven" currencies of investors fleeing the eurozone debt crisis and gloomy forecasts for the United States, a privilege that weighs like a tombstone on export companies "accounts.
With a stronger currency, products abroad are more expensive, a serious problem for a country whose economy relies on the health of major technology producers.
Toyota and Sony, for example, attributed their weak July-September results to the yen's listing.
While the markets continue to lay siege to peripheral EU countries, the government of Yoshihiko Noda remains vigilant.
"We need to be mindful of the ongoing risks, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of the yen," said Motohisa Furukawa, undersecretary of state for economic policy, yesterday.
The outlook is really not very encouraging.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said most member states showed clearer signs of slowing economic growth in September.
The indicator, which anticipates the turning points of the global economy, revealed that the brakes had been applied to the largest economic potentials.
It fell four tenths to 100.4 points, compared with the 100.8 in August.
The eurozone is even below that average, which stands at 100, having fallen by eight-tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens raises doubts again
Papadimos Says Austerity Measures Will Be Passed, but Conservatives Won't Sign Written Agreement
With the risk premiums of the peripheral countries soaring and uncertainty spreading, Greece continues to get lost in the labyrinth that leads out of the great European debt crisis.
The impression that the "consensus" of the new Greek transitional government is more a reaction to pressure from Brussels than a genuine conviction of the political forces is slowly being borne out by the facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, indicated yesterday that there were no alternatives to structural reforms and that the hundred days set by his appointment may be too short to implement them, the leader of the conservative Nueva Democracia party, Antonis Samaras, assured that he would support the new austerity measures and would in no way withdraw his demand for new elections to be held on the scheduled date of 19 February.
"The main task of this government is to implement the decisions taken at the summit on 26 October," Papadimos said yesterday, opening a parliamentary debate that will culminate tomorrow with a vote of confidence in the new government.
A package of 24 programmes to promote employment, reform the disciplinary system for civil servants and new measures against tax evasion are the first initiatives.
Nonetheless, Samaras's statement does not dispel doubts about his stance: "We have committed ourselves to supporting the transitional government, but to nothing else."
The conservative leader went a step too far in his challenge to the EU and the IMF, the body that must unlock the 8,000 million that Athens desperately needs, and made clear that he would not endorse a commitment to meet austerity measures.
But the European Commission, still irritated by the fallout from the poker game with Papandreu's referendum, reiterated yesterday that its demand was unwavering: economic aid would not be signed if the new government and the leaders of Greece's main parties "did not sign a clear written agreement as soon as possible."
The spokesman of the Ministry of Economy, Amadeu Altafaj, said that the Troika inspectors would return to Athens "very soon" to discuss with the new government "what is needed to pay the sixth section" of 8000 million euros, although no final date has yet been set.
The Greek tangle still has threads for a while.
Queen Sofia: "These are instruments of progress and hope"
The Queen stressed Spain's' dominant 'position on this type of funding
Spain "has achieved a dominant position in the world as regards the role of micro-finance."
Queen Sofia of Spain recalled yesterday that in the last two decades, Spain has become the second donor in the world to this instrument of international cooperation, whose "essence" is based on the fact that it is "an instrument for social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all humanity, based on trust in people."
The Queen yesterday inaugurated the Fifth World Summit on Microcredit in Valladolid. She was convinced that there was "no doubt" that this type of business would be "absolutely essential" to achieve the Millennium Goals set by the United Nations by 2015 and "in particular the goal of increasing the number of people living on incomes below one dollar a day, that is below the" poverty line. "
Spain is "continuing to work" on extending the network of beneficiaries "to the furthest corners of the world and is carrying out this task responsibly," said Queen Sofia, who hopes that the initiatives and contributions from the summit, which will last until Thursday, will guarantee "the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest, and especially for women," as the main beneficiaries of these loans.
"We have had many successes" and "face many challenges."
The Microcredit Summit is not only a forum for debate, but also a platform to launch "two fundamental objectives."
The Queen said the aim was that 175 million poor families would have access to these financial services by the end of 2015, and that ten million of these households would cross the poverty line.
The concept of micro-credit in Spain and the rest of the world goes back to the path initiated "years ago" by Muhammad Yunus, which Queen Sofia considers an "act of justice and recognition."
She described the father of the scheme as an "admirable idealist dedicated to the fight against poverty" whose work she had known for 15 years when the Queen travelled to Bangladesh to see the loan strategy on the ground.
This experience was followed a year later by the First World Summit in Washington and further meetings in Ivory Coast in 1999 and Canada in 2006. "We have seen continuous development in all of them," said the Queen, whose commitment to this project yesterday earned her the title of "Head of Family" in Valladolid and "Advocate of the Poor."
Finally, Queen Sofia concluded her speech by encouraging those present to take part in the debate and to seek solutions in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical Commandment"
Spanish Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez said that solidarity is "an ethical imperative" for the entire democratic state.
In this sense, she stressed that it would be a mistake to link development aid to periods of economic boom, because it was a "permanent commitment."
Jiménez believed that micro-credit was a "serious and rigorous policy for the eradication of poverty," and that now, "more than ever," the governments of the industrialised countries must work according to solidarity criteria and not allow solidarity to fall victim to the crisis.
For Spain, micro-credits are one of the "most important forms of development aid."
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, applauded "the success" of giving "hope" to "marginalized" people "who are always standing before closed doors," and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed those present to a city that "opens its doors infected by the spirit of solidarity."
The CDU proposes to elect the EU President by universal suffrage
The first day of the Christian Democrat Congress (CDU) in Leipzig on Monday 14 November went off without any real difficulties for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and leader of the Christian Democratic Party.
The future of Europe was not originally envisaged in the programme, but prevailed in the autumn, especially to satisfy those activists who consider government policy on Greeks today and perhaps Italy tomorrow to be too lax.
The Presidency proposal of the European Commission, proposed by the Bureau, was adopted almost unanimously.
Of the 1001 delegates, only nine voted against and ten abstained.
The standing ovation, which lasted several minutes and was initially given to Angela Merkel and a few hours later to Wolfgang Schäuble due to their decrees of intervention, left no room for doubt on the part of the three pro-European finance ministers.
The Chancellor's main slogan - as well as the motion - is that the answer to the crisis is "more Europe, not less."
Not only because Europe means peace, but also because "nine million jobs are directly dependent on the euro."
For the Chancellor, "the time has come for a breakthrough in Europe."
This could be reflected in a modification of the Lisbon Treaty concerning the budgetary policies of the countries in the eurozone, strengthening European Union control; but it could also result in the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of universal suffrage "to give Europe a face."
However, this is in any case one of the proposals adopted by the Congress, which was clearly inspired by Wolfgang Schäuble.
To be sure, it is unlikely that the 47 will agree quickly on this revolution: Great Britain is opposed to it, and the leaders of the CDU think they know that Nicolas Sarkozy is of the same opinion.
However, the milestone has been reached.
Likewise, the delegates overwhelmingly rejected the proposal of weighting each country on the ECB's executive board according to the weighting of individual economies, which would obviously strengthen Germany's position.
The Chancellor, anxious to calm the climate within her party, has thus strengthened the references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but has stopped trying to win her congress at the expense of the "small" or struggling European countries, which would immediately criticize arrogant Germany.
To the extent that the European motion dedicates a paragraph to the importance of "Franco-German friendship," Angela Merkel does not call France into question.
At least not directly.
This is a reminder that Leipzig was at the centre of a bloody battle two centuries ago.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What does sickness benefit fraud represent?
After the family allowances, the UMP and the government are now tackling sickness claims.
Nicolas Sarkozy will arrive in Bordeaux on Tuesday 15 November to visit a family allowance fund and make a speech on the subject of the fight against social fraud and economic dependence on the state, which has been recurring since 2007.
To accompany this attack, which is driven by a desire to put the economy to the test, but which is no less a harbinger of an axis of the right-wing presidential campaign, the majority wants to focus on worker sick leave.
Firstly, with budgetary targets: the government intends to introduce a fourth day of sick leave before private sector workers are considered.
In plain English, this means that a sick employee would lose four days "pay without permission from the specific company, i.e. at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure which, according to the daily newspaper Les Echos, threatens to provoke anger, but which would help to raise EUR 280 million.
And that would be accompanied by another measure of a more symbolic nature: giving civil servants an unremunerated sick leave (so far, unlike the three days off in the private sector, there is no waiting period for them).
While these issues are under discussion, the majority are also rekindling the issue of fraud, this time targeting the abuses associated with absence from work.
"Controls will be much more important, and they will also have to be reimbursed if requested," warned Xavier Betrand in front of the RTL microphone on Sunday 13 November.
As in other cases, the impact of this notification seems somewhat disproportionate to the reality of fraud in the field of sickness notifications.
Indeed, this has been the subject of constant observation since 2002, as well as political offensives that have borne the most fruit.
The French are no more sick than people elsewhere in Europe.
Let us, however, first look at the national figures.
According to the National Health Insurance Fund CNAM, more than 237 million euros in daily severance payments were paid in 2006.
According to the Institute for Economic Research and Documentation of the Health Sector, daily severance payments amounted to 11.3 billion euros in 2008, representing 5% of health expenditure.
This figure includes 46% for maternity leave and accidents at work and 54% for sick leave, or EUR 6.2 billion.
And so 2.5% health spending.
In 2010, according to a study by the Alma Consulting Group, the French were granted an average of only 14.5 sick days, compared to 17.8 days in 2009.
A mean that obscures certain differences: another, published in 2007 by Monster.com, a career planning site, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French workers surveyed said they had not taken a single sick day.
Another study, this time by health insurance, shows that 37% of sickness notifications in 2010 were of shorter duration than 8 days; 22% between 8 and 14 days; 15% between 15 days and a month; 15% between one and three months and 11% above.
Compared to their European neighbors, French workers are no longer incapacitated.
A long-term study conducted in 2010 by two researchers from the French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) showed that between 1994 and 2001, the global absenteeism rate (due to illness or otherwise) oscillated between 10% and 11% in France, compared with 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
Fraud in sickness notifications represents a tiny proportion of undeclared work.
As far as fraud is concerned, the level of fraud is weak.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 means that there are systematic checks on sickness notifications exceeding 45 days.
In 2008, the CNAM (Public School of Technical and Engineering Education) found, among 1.5 million controls, that 13% of the 285,000 short-term sickness notifications, that is, in 37,050 cases, were "unjustified or too long."
Among the systematically monitored cases of sickness lasting more than 45 days, under 1.2 million 11% of "unadjusted or unjustified" cases were counted, i.e. 132,000.
In total, this amounts to 169,000 "unjustified" cases for several million workers who have claimed sick leave.
A figure which represents only a weak measure compared, for example, with that of undeclared work.
According to UMP Member Dominique Tian, author of a factual report on this issue published in July, this represents between EUR 9 billion and EUR 15 billion in lost tax revenue per year, i.e. more than the total cost of daily allowances, and therefore considerably more than defrauding the latter.
Papademos: Greece should introduce a new adjustment plan
Greece needed a new adjustment program to shore up its economy, he said.
This was announced to Parliament by Prime Minister Lucas Papademos on Monday 14 November, adding that the one hundred days given to his government by the Union were not enough to complete the task.
"In order to continue the efforts to strengthen the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new budget adjustment programme," the head of government said in his first public speech at the opening of the parliamentary vote of confidence debate on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the Euro Summit on 27 October is the "main task" of the new government, as the participation of the country within the Eurozone is "at stake," he added.
Accordingly, M. Papademos has planned to reduce the country's public deficit by "around 9%" of the gross domestic product by the end of the year, after 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The Right Rejects the New Austerity Measures
Antonis Samaras, the leader of the right-wing, had agreed on Monday to the measures already approved in an attempt to escape the debt crisis, but said his party would not agree to any additional austerity measures.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures," he said at a meeting of his New Democracy party.
He had pledged to reduce the budget deficit and debt, as well as to fight waste, but was hostile to any policies that would impede economic recovery.
Olli Rehn, EU Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who had prevented the IMF and the EU from releasing the necessary €8 billion loan without a written guarantee from all parties on their support for the planned measures, had replied to Antonio Samaras that his word was enough and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
Euthanasia and assisted suicide must be legalised, says expert panel
Canadians are living in denial of death, according to a report by the Royal Society of Canada
The panel said governments, health care institutions and doctors were working together on pain-relieving treatment to provide the best pain-relievers, even beyond cancer cases.
Canadian society lives in an attitude of denial towards death.
Only 9% of Canadians actually agree to talk to their doctor about conditions under which they would like to die, and make dispositions for that purpose.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, which involved six experts linked in various fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
This body recommends that the government amend the penal code to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia where that choice arises, namely for patients who are considered capable of making such a decision.
As a prelude, the experts cite a recently published survey by the independent company EIU, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the globe.
Although Canada ranked 10th, the study notes that "medical death care in Canada has created a culture in which people are afraid to touch on the subject of death."
Medical care or not: 77% of Canadians do not have access to painkillers, according to experts appointed by the Royal Society of Canada.
And despite the majority of Canadians wanting to die at home, 68.6% of them end up dying in hospital.
Looking at the country as a whole, Quebec has the highest rate of hospitalized deaths, at 86%.
On the thorny issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions that run counter to the position of the federal government, which has already stated that it does not wish to make any changes to the penal code on euthanasia and assisted suicide.
However, according to the experts, who have also inspected all those countries whose approach has legalised or decriminalised euthanasia and assisted suicide, there is no evidence that such decriminalisation would lead to abuses in its application, i.e. the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicide by incompetent or non-consenting persons.
On the contrary, there are many more cases of such transgressions in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalised, as Jocelyn Downie, a co-signatory of the report, confirmed in a teleconference yesterday.
'Euthanasia is practised in Canada, where it's clearly illegal. '
"Accompanied suicide is also practised in Canada, although clearly illegal here," says Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians support euthanasia
Let us remember that, according to an Angus Reid survey carried out in 2010, 85% of Canadians were already in favour of euthanasia, believing that it would allow people at the end of their lives to alleviate their suffering.
And 66% believe that legalising euthanasia does not send the message that the lives of the elderly or disabled are of less value.
With regard to those who have already committed assisted suicide, 41% of respondents believe that they should not be prosecuted.
The report's authors say the situation is less clear when it comes to maintaining or stopping treatment for patients.
In the same way, they suggest in their list of recommendations that it should be stated in the Criminal Code that the withdrawal of funds for which there had been a valid refusal should not be regarded as criminal.
The panel also calls for health professionals to be trained to respect end-of-life termination without fear of prosecution.
The panel said that governments, health care institutions, and physicians worked together on pain-relieving treatment to provide the best pain-relievers, even beyond cancer cases.
Lastly, with regard to pain relief or life-ending measures, which are already widely used in Canadian health care institutions, the panel calls for them at least to be considered, since these, like euthanasia, were not intended to reduce physical pain and related to the same procedures.
Reservations of other experts
Some health law experts have already expressed reservations about the conclusions of the expert report by the Royal Society of Canada.
RA Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, described the stance of the experts who signed the report as "extreme," among other things, as it set no limits to euthanasia practice for the terminally ill.
"This opens the door to a situation in which anyone who is tired of life and over 18 years of age can ask another person to assist him in his suicide," said RA Deschamps, who read a summary of the report yesterday.
RA Deschamps also stresses that the authors of the report seem to place individual responsibility above all other values involved in the social fabric of society.
But now, he says, there are "guidelines and obligations in a society."
Margaret Somerville, a health law specialist, also expressed "strong opposition" to the report's conclusions, which she called a "pro-euthanasia manifesto."
Margaret Somerville, who is herself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, questions in particular the reports on the absence of abuses in certain countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalised, such as the Netherlands and Oregon.
King of Jordan calls on President Assad to step down
Damascus denounces a "plot"
Syria is increasingly isolated
The partisans of Bashar al-Assad demonstrated yesterday in front of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Diplomatic pressure intensified yesterday on Bashar al-Assad's Syria, which, thanks to Russia's support, has rejected a "plot" against the country.
Two days before the exclusion of Syria by the Arab League, the European Union tightened its sanctions against Damascus, even though Turkey and Jordan, Syria's neighbors, had taken a stand in favor of President Assad's departure.
King Abdullah II of Jordan was yesterday the sitting Arab Prime Minister who called on President Bashar al-Assad "to relinquish power in Syria," where some forty civilians and members of the government have already been killed.
"If Bashar had the interests of his country at heart, he would resign, but he should also create the necessary conditions for a new era of Syrian political life," the King of Jordan, Syria's neighbour, said in an interview with the BBC.
For his part, Turkish diplomatic chief Ahmet Davutoglu had complained that the Turkish attempts at mediation, which had been directed at the Syrian regime since the beginning of the year, had not been successful.
"Those in the Middle East who are not at peace with their people and who cannot satisfy them must go," he said, alluding to Syria, the neighbouring country with which Turkey has a steadily harsher stance.
The United States, for its part, welcomed the "strengthening of the consensus against Assad and the machinations of the Syrian regime" following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League and countries like Turkey have taken an increasingly strident tone in the face of repression in Syria," said Mark Toner, a State Department spokesman.
During that time, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the government died in the Dar'a region of southern Syria, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (OSDH) said.
Two other civilians were killed in "exchanges of gunfire and heavy bombings around Jobar" in the besieged city of Homs, according to the NGO.
However, at a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallim said the country was "heading towards the end of the crisis."
He also reacted forcefully to the Arab League's decision to suspend Damascus, which he described as a "dangerous step."
Syria "will not back down," he added, asserting that "the plots hatched against Syria will fail."
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is now examining a "protection mechanism for civilians" and wants 500 members of Arab human rights organisations, the media and military observers to be sent to the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé had also called for the deployment of UN observers to protect civilians from the regime's repression, which he said was encapsulating its "paranoia."
An unscheduled new meeting of the League is scheduled for tomorrow in Rabat to discuss the implementation of the crisis exit plan adopted on 2 November, but in particular the controversial and likely withdrawal of military troops from the besieged cities and the liberation of detained demonstrators.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov yesterday described the Arab League's decision as "incorrect" in order to avoid endorsing possible sanctions against Damascus, even though China had already warned Syria to implement its exit plan.

Monti urges markets to be patient and Italy to make sacrifices
Mario Monti, Italy's future leader, has demanded a little more time from the markets to form his staff and implement a program that calls for "sacrifices" to regain the creditworthiness lost during the final months of Berlusconi's government.
The former EU Commissioner held talks with the political parties yesterday ahead of today's meeting of trade unions and employers.
It was his job to convene a cabinet composed relatively strictly of outside technocrats.
"Monti spoke of an important programme with a number of victims," said Francesco Nucara, a member of parliament from one of the many smaller parliamentary groups participating in the talks, after meeting the President-in-Office of the Council.
For his part, Gianfranco Fini, president of the Chamber of Deputies, had said he would wait for Mario Monti to submit a vote of confidence to parliament by Friday to ensure that the new government had sufficient support.
The agreements will culminate in Mr Monti's presentation of a deletion list that will undoubtedly range from a dozen ministers to the head of state, Giorgio Napolitano.
Mr Monti said yesterday's nervousness in the stock and bond markets was taking its time.
"In a democracy, there are certain deadlines" to prepare a government and a government program, he said, noting that it is "certain that the markets will be dubious and understanding."
His appointment by the president was initially welcomed by markets, but the unrest had intensified after that, especially after an unexpected fall in industrial production in the eurozone in September.
The incumbent prime minister is said to be forming a staff composed mainly of technocrats, although he has stressed that he would like to include "politicians."
The new government should last only until 2013, the date of the next parliamentary elections, he estimated.
Gianfranco Fini, president of the Chamber of Deputies, said the new government should receive a vote of confidence from parliament by Friday.
Since taking up his post, Mr Monti has committed himself to working urgently towards the objective of making Italy a "new protagonist" in Europe.
A spokesman for EU Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that "even with the new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy will not change."
In particular, the EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its goal of balancing the budget in 2013 despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, has requested new tough measures.
Emma Marcegaglia, head of Italy's leaders, who will meet with Monti on Tuesday, also insisted that economic recovery was needed "because a country that has no growth whatsoever cannot respect deficit indicators."
Known for his competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), M. Monti represents a "change of era" for Italy after 17 years of "Berlusconi"; the "professor" symbolizes the "challenge of trustworthiness" and a "different Italy," according to the editorial authors.
The great unknown here is the longevity of his staff.
President Napolitano would like to avoid early elections, as Italy now has to pay for 200 billion euros of government bonds by April 2012.
Russian Scientist Helps Iran's Nuclear Program
A Russian scientist, Vyacheslav Danilenko, has helped Iran develop a nuclear-capable warhead, an American NGO specialising in nuclear risks confirmed on Monday.
The ISIS Institute for Science and International Security based its findings on the recent report of the International Atomic Safety Agency (AIEA) and other documents issued by the agency to identify the scientist.
The AIEA said last week it had expressed "serious concern" about a "possible military dimension" to Iran's nuclear programme.
According to a detailed study of the AIEA documents by ISIS, Danilenko, born in 1934, had apparently worked for more than three decades in a Soviet military nuclear center in Chelyabinsk (Urals) since the beginning of the 1960s and was involved in the production of synthetic diamonds produced by explosions.
In 1989 or 1991, he is said to have left the centre to set up a company in Kiev that produces "nano-diamonds."
The economic difficulties of his company led him to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
Prior to his return to Russia, he was said to have worked on an Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002.
In its most recent report, the AIEA noted "strong indications that Iran's development of" a nuclear explosive system "had been supported by the work of a foreign expert who was not only extremely knowledgeable in this technology, but also, as one official told the agency, had worked indispensably on this technology throughout his professional career directly on the military nuclear energy program of his country of origin."
Anti-Islamic crimes and offences have increased by 50%
Crime and offenses against Muslims increased by 50% from 2009 to 2010, while other racially or religiously motivated violent crimes either declined slightly or increased only slightly over the same period, according to FBI statistics released Monday.
According to these data, the total number of violent crimes committed against Muslims rose from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, or 49%, while there was a 13% increase in violent crimes against Catholics, a 4% decrease in crimes against Jews, and a 14% increase in anti-religious crimes and crimes on a global scale.
The total number of "hate crimes" rose slightly to 6,628 cases, including 47.3% motivated by racial differences and 20% by religious differences, the FBI said.
"After a slowdown in 2009, it is disturbing to see these crimes and crimes on the rise again," said the human rights organization Human Rights First. "The increase in anti-Islamic violence is particularly significant," the organization added in a communiqué.
"Human Rights First has long stressed that violence directed against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crime, should be considered a serious violation of human rights," added Paul Legendre, one of the organization's leaders.
"The American government can and should do more to combat these attacks," he added, noting that this could be done by improving the police's attitude to "hate crimes."
The "hate crime" in American federal law is a legacy from the era of the struggle for civil rights.
This legislation was passed after the death of Martin Luther King to punish acts of violence directed against race, color, religion, or ancestry, and now also includes crimes of sexual affiliation.
Twitter is transforming the platform and increasingly resembling Facebook
Microblogging site Twitter on Monday introduced changes to the presentation of its platform to allow its users, in particular, to monitor the activities of those who follow their posts, making the service once again similar to Facebook's.
The new "Activity" tab and another "Name" allow you to better follow the activities of other "Twitterers," Internet users whose messages ("Tweets") you follow and who follow your messages.
This allows you to find out if they allow you to track your messages, subscribe to new posts, favor certain messages, etc.
This new Twitter menu had been tested "in August with a small percentage of users" before it went public on Monday, Twitter spokeswoman Carolyn Penner told AFP.
Twitter has been known for its uninstinctive functioning, armed with somewhat esotherical language (RT for referencing another person's post), but it is also known as the bonheur des initiés, s'ouvre ainsi a un public plus large avec un maniement plus comparable a celui des réseaux grand public Facebook and Google +.
On the network, users debated this innovation with the help of certain "tweets" on the Internet.
"This is useless, intrusive and too much like Facebook," writes @ jemb123.
"Activity will help me better track certain elements of my Flux Twitter," @ dannykronstrom posted.
Austria
Inscription of a "Golden Budget Rule" in the Constitution
The government of the large Social Democratic / Christian Democratic coalition in power in Austria decided on Tuesday to include a "golden rule" in the constitution in order to reduce public deficits and also to avoid a possible downgrade by rating agencies in Austria's top credit rating (AAA).
It was the Social Democrat Chancellor Werner Faymann himself who announced this decision at the end of the Council of Ministers, despite the fact that Austria's public debt is 74.6%, well above the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty, but well below the level of debt of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's solvency had not suddenly fallen from AAA to AA +, we would have had to pay an additional three billion euros in interest every year," argued Michael Spindelegger, Vice Chancellor and Christian Democrat Foreign Minister.
Austria is also complying with a request made at the Brussels summit of eurozone member states on 26 October: at that time, the heads of state and government had demanded that the reduction of public deficits be included in the constitution by the end of 2012, as well as a return to the equilibrium of public accounts, or through the adoption of an equivalent law.
The measure taken by the Austrian Government in this regard is similar to the "German model," since Germany was the first European country to introduce such a "rule" in the Constitution.
Until 2017, the structural budget deficit should decrease by 0.75% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) each year; from 2017, the structural budget deficit of the state should not exceed 0.35% of GDP, whereas regional states and municipalities should have balanced budgets.
The objective is to eradicate budgetary debt below the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Agreement within the 2020 / 21 horizon.
Strong yen
Noda threatens new intervention in currency markets
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that Japanese authorities would intervene again in currency markets if the yen continued to rise.
"If we see excessive volatility" in the yen's exchange rate, "we will intervene as we did last time," Mr. Noda said on the Senate floor.
On Tuesday, the yen surged again close to the historic levels that forced the Japanese authorities to intervene on October 31.
On that day, Tokyo had massively sold yen against dollar to lower the value of Japan's currency, which is heading for a new record high against the dollar since 1945.
However, the yen has regularly risen above that level, buoyed by purchases by investors who see the yen as a "safe haven" in these uncertain times of global economic downturn and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar fell below 77 yen on Tuesday, and the euro slipped below the symbolic 105 yen barrier near the levels that triggered the latest intervention.
Before the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was trading around 120 yen and the euro more than 160 yen.
This barrage of Japanese currency hurts the archipelago's exports, by making the cost of "Made in Japan" products more expensive and reducing the income value derived from Japanese firms by converting it into local currency.
"Japan is struggling to rebuild after the March 11 earthquake and tsunami that devastated the Tohoku region (northeast)," Mr. Noda said, fearing that the yen's rise could kill off the fragile recovery.
The world's third-largest economy has regained traction for the first time this year with growth of 1.5% in the third quarter compared to the previous quarter, thanks to soaring exports and consumption by households "sealed" by the disaster.
However, the prime minister estimates that the yen's rise does not reflect "the economic foundations of Japan."
For his part, Finance Minister Jun Azumi has called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its Monetary Policy Committee on Tuesday, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
However, Hirohide Yamaguchi, deputy governor of the institute, said the BoJ had already taken "appropriate action," announcing that no further monetary easing was expected on Wednesday.
At its last meeting at the end of October, the central bank had increased its government bond purchases by 5,000 billion yen (47 billion euros) to cover the 55,000 billion yen (519 billion euros) it had spent on various purchases of financial securities to flood the liquidity market.
Eurozone:
Interest rates soar, stock markets retreat
The risk of contagion from the debt crisis is constantly undermining European indicators.
Despite the inauguration of the new heads of government in Greece and Italy and the best growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of the weakened countries continue to rise steadily.
Stock markets, which are still concerned about the stability of the eurozone, are drifting a little further into negative territory this Tuesday, 15 November.
In Paris, the CAC lost 1.4% at 10 a.m. and fell to 3,064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt was down 0.4%, while London was down 0.1%.
"Global stock markets are continuing to shed some of their recent gains on the back of new tensions over sovereign bond yields in the troubled eurozone.
"Investors are nervous and only too aware of the risk of contagion," Terry Pratt, an institutional broker at IG Markets, was quoted as saying by Reuters.
The Tokyo stock exchange, which is suffering from renewed fears among market participants about capacity in Europe that the debt crisis is continuing, closed down 0.7%.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has its eyes on Europe, and trade is moving along a limited corridor of variation until investors have evidence that the situation has stabilized," estimates Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This resurgence of concern about the future of the eurozone is hurting the single currency, which continues its bear market rally on Tuesday.
The euro is at its lowest level in a month and a half.
By 10 a.m., the European currency was worth $1.3570, down 0.4%.
According to the stockbrokers, it declined after Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democratic Union (CDU), which met in Congress on Monday, approved a proposal that would allow troubled countries to exit the eurozone without leaving the European Union.
The Italian and Spanish rates are well below the 6% threshold.
Loan rates in Italy and Spain remain at very worrying levels.
This Tuesday morning, the yield on Italian 10-year bonds reached 6.85%, while that on Spanish bonds matured to 6.2%.
These tensions in interest rates in southern countries, but also in France, continue to feed investors' fears.
Incoming Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti demanded more time from the markets to restore the debt-crippled situation in Italy.
For his part, the new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos had confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken at the October 27 eurozone summit was "the main task" of his government.
Spain is in turmoil as the country holds parliamentary elections on Sunday.
The spread between German and Spanish 10-year bonds has once again reached an all-time high.
Anticipating eurozone growth figures
Statistically, France recorded economic growth supported by household consumption of 0.4% in the third quarter, slightly better than the 0.3% expected.
However, the Federal Statistical Office (INSEE) revised the bearish figures for the second quarter, with a minus of 0.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
In truth, it is the fourth quarter that worries economists the most.
Germany, for its part, grew by 0.5% over the same period.
A first projection of the entire eurozone is expected at 11 a.m., with the EU Commission warning of the risk of a renewed recession.
Energy policy:
Facts should prevail over dogma
If there is one issue that cannot be dealt with on the basis of short-term considerations or emotions, it is certainly energy policy.
Availability and cost of electricity have a direct impact on purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It is reasonable to use an election meeting as an opportunity to reflect on this issue and on the position of nuclear energy.
The debate will only bear fruit if it explores all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the options proposed.
The French should base their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
Although there are 7 billion people on this planet, demographic evolution is driving a doubling of electricity demand by the year 2050, if an enormous proportion of the world's population is not to be deprived of a vital element.
At the same time, it is necessary to alleviate the scarcity of fossil resources in order to continue to produce electricity consistently, without forgetting the imperative need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, an issue that has disappeared from the ecological debate, in order to combat climatic irregularities.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.
As a result, Germany remains isolated in its decision to renounce nuclear power.
This is not the case in Belgium, which is subjecting its decision to the need to find a replacement source that can be substituted, or in Switzerland, which is only planning to build the latest generation of nuclear power stations.
The United Kingdom, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name but a few, continue to pursue their projects with determination.
The United States, for its part, decided after Fukushima to add another unit to its park by restarting the Three Mile Island plant, which was shut down after the nuclear accident.
Even if the German model, which focuses on renewable energy sources, is sometimes presented as an example, reality contradicts the discourse.
The election in Berlin will take the form of an increase in the price of electricity, an increase in energy dependence, particularly on Russia, due to increased reliance on imported gas, and an increase in CO2 emissions from gas and coal-fired power stations.
All these adverse effects will begin to be felt within a few months.
The case of Denmark is cause for reflection.
Denmark, on the one hand, is the European leader in wind energy, from which it derives 30% of its electricity, and, on the other, it is one of the largest users of coal and gas, alternating with wind energy; as a result, its CO2 emissions and electricity prices are both 65% and 50% higher than the corresponding European average.
Thanks to the consistency of our energy policy, our neighbours pay a 40% higher electricity bill than our French households.
As the price of energy in the globalised economy is a key factor in competitiveness and a source of stability for industry on national soil, French companies have an advantage thanks to the cheapest electricity in Europe.
Any significant reduction in nuclear power would therefore lead to a sharp increase in the price of energy, which would make the noble statements about the re-industrialisation of our country and the defence of purchasing power an illusion.
Surveys have shown that this is a price the vast majority of French people are no more willing to pay than they are to resist the principle of this energy source.
Let us remember that our country's energy policy has made it possible to create an industry with 125, 00 direct and 410, 000 induced jobs.
Due to its strong export character, it brings a plethora of specialised small and medium-sized enterprises to international markets, making them the creators of countless jobs.
If France were to decide to phase out nuclear power, a large proportion of these SMEs would fall victim to it, and the annual export of capital goods and nuclear energy of EUR 6 billion would shrink more and more.
What electrician would commission an EPR designed to operate for sixty years if the demise of its producer was inevitable?
In order to solve the energy equation, it must be acknowledged that there is no miracle cure for the generation of electricity, any more than there is a devil's work.
The low-carbon solutions developed by Areva for the use of nuclear power and renewable energy testify to the complementarity of energy sources.
Maintaining the highest possible level of safety is an absolute imperative for nuclear power.
In France, we have a safety authority that carries out uncompromising and transparent checks on existing plants, such as the Flamanville plant.
Their work teams, who have made a name for themselves for their professionalism, are just too obsessed with the idea of security.
In the space of 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three major accidents.
Only one, at Three Mile Island, occurred under normal operating conditions, with no human or environmental consequences.
At Chernobyl, the tragedy was brought about by reactor construction and infinite human error.
At Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident was caused by two natural disasters of unprecedented proportions, which caused the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn its lessons from this accident, as it did after the two previous ones.
As a result of this approach, as well as cooperation between the safety authorities of the French and German operators and designers of nuclear power plants, the EPR represents a blueprint that enables it to withstand such phenomena.
Since it is considered desirable among the electrical engineers to build a nuclear power plant, a halt to construction at Flamanville would be a fabulous gift to the competitors of Areva and EDF, giving them the green light to usurp the leading position in the inevitable development of nuclear power.
It is unavoidable and legitimate to seek the best energy bouquet for our country, but it would be irresponsible to allow emotions, dogmas and party manoeuvres to dominate a debate that also determines the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
Nicolas Sarkozy's immigration policy has been criticised from many angles - overburdening the police, judiciary and administrative bodies because of a policy of subordination to numbers, compatibility of this policy with the status of a "country of human rights," as France had called itself.
Recently, the harassment of foreign students by the authorities had dominated the newsreels, with the Minister of the Interior casually proclaiming (see Libération of 23 May) that France "does not need talents, bricklayers or waiters from abroad."
But this policy has rarely been analysed from an economic point of view.
There is, in fact, a broad consensus between right and left on this issue.
On the right, the tone was set by Jacques Chirac, who declared in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed, including over 2 million immigrant workers, should not be a problem for a country," and on the left by Michel Rocard, who said in 1990 that France "cannot absorb all the poverty of the world."
The only difference is the degree of generosity
Fear of the invasion of national soil by hordes of Polish plumbers was shared by both right and left in 2005.
Both camps saw immigrants as a burden on the economy and French society.
The only difference is the degree of generosity one is willing to admit to immigrants.
In his programme, Francois Hollande limits himself to banalities that suggest that we can solve our "migration problems."
This notion of immigration as a burden, as a problem, may have an electoral impact, but it is economically costly.
As the economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron remind us in a recent book summarizing the latest findings on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is broad consensus among specialists about the positive impact of the flood of immigrants on economic growth, wages, and jobs in the countries of immigration.
Restricting immigration would undermine growth and damage the labour market.
Fears about migrants "influence are based on the notion that they threaten to substitute domestic workers, especially the low-skilled, by putting pressure on their wages.
Experience shows, however, that immigrants are in fact much more complementary than domestic wage-earners, as they focus on occupations in sectors that are underutilized in terms of jobs.
The low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract domestic wage laborers, the more skilled among the immigrants work in dynamic sectors where training is not aligned with the labour supply.
Positive wage effect
Just as a surgeon would have difficulty working in a country where there is a shortage of anaesthetists, so this complementarity between natives and migrants has a positive effect on wages and the domestic labour market.
Giovanni Peri calculated in this way that a 1% increase in the flood of immigrants would result in a long-term increase in real wages of between 0.6% and 0.9%.
And this ignores the fact that the diversity that immigrants bring is conducive to the creation of ideas and economic growth (high proportion of naturalized immigrants among American Nobel laureates; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay, and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants also make a net contribution to social security systems, averaging around 1% of the total budget in European countries.
The World Labour Organisation estimates, for example, that a person who emigrates to Germany at the age of 30 brings a net contribution (income minus expenditure) of around 150,000 euros to the public budget on average over his or her lifetime.
Nicolas Sarkozy, when he took office, wished to make up for the missing intersections "with his teeth."
But these teeth, designed to deter immigrants, had exactly the opposite effect.
Europe invented democracy, now it is up to us to think European democracy through
Democracy is a precious commodity; it is also a sensitive commodity.
The European continent should be able to remember for itself who, after their invention in Athens more than two thousand years ago, endured the tragedies of the First World War, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the Gulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal and the colonel in Greece for the whole of the 20th century.
Some might have thought that it was enough to exercise the right to vote, and to do so in the most direct way possible, to see democracy triumph over its enemies once and for all.
It has been known since Napoleon "the little one" that it was a feature of the state of mind.
Universal suffrage, which is a necessary condition of democracy, is not a sufficient condition for this and may just as well become an "instrument of oppression," as the republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot put it at the time.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, organisation, separation and control of powers, education, enlightenment, economic and social community spirit, justice.
The crisis in Europe that we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but it is also, and first and foremost, a political and democratic crisis.
The change of heart of the Greek True / False referendum would have been doubly illuminating in this respect: on the one hand, the need for a vigorous return of politics, but on the other hand also the disturbing feeling of its impossibility, its inappropriateness.
This ambivalence should be considered outdated.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle have shifted, and Republican soldiers, or at least most of them, are no longer heading in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain by pushing for the success of the national referendum, which was organised according to necessities and in the wrong order.
A free pass for the European autocrat or a blindfolded leap into the void of nationalist retreat: a great choice for the citizen!
No, we want a chopping block, but a collective task, fully justified, clear and steady, an election and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal - we do not know, by the way, where the list ends - because there is only one crisis, and that is in Europe.
It is the whole of Europe that is bowing to the dictates of the markets and credit rating agencies, suffering from its impotence and lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that is humiliated on the international stage.
There is concern about transfers of sovereignty to Europe - and it is the whole of Europe that is gradually losing its sovereignty, and thus each and every one of its member nations.
The urgency is to put popular sovereignty back in charge of the European project.
For it is up to the whole whether Europeans can reduce the burden of their debt, free themselves from the markets and pave the way for a future through investment.
The exit from the crisis requires decisions at European level, which cannot be taken without total democratic legitimacy, without certainly leading us to ruin.
After a long period of fighting against this proposal by Jacques Delors and the Socialists, everyone is now urging European economic leaders to do so.
Agreed.
But to imagine this without political integration and stronger democracy - as the citizens want - would be another folly and another impasse.
We must embark on a new stage in the construction of Europe.
In order to create a republic in France, it was necessary to "create" republicans.
The revolution of interests alone could not suffice here.
This teaching remains valid.
We need to build a more integrated Europe economically.
This can only be achieved by creating a more democratic Europe politically, a truly European popular sovereignty.
We need Europeans in order to build Europe.
'Contactless' smart cards become commonplace
The world trade fair for smart cards opens its doors on Tuesday in Villepinte near Paris in an optimistic attitude.
According to Eurosmart, 2011 should actually end with an 11% increase in global sales of microprocessor chips (EC cards, SIM card phones), with more than 6 billion units sold.
The most important segment is contactless technology, which enables payments to be made on public transport or to pay for purchases simply by holding the card to a reader.
Compared to 320 million sold a year earlier, 460 million contactless smart cards should be sold worldwide this year!
Its market share is expected to grow even further in 2012 (580 million units expected), representing over 10% of the global smart card market (6.925 million cards).
Europe is gaining ground on contactless payments, having long lagged behind the Asia-Pacific region.
Some 26 million Visa cards already have this functionality, and 75,000 payment terminals accept it.
In France, the beginnings are rather modest: only 400,000 contactless visa cards have been distributed.
But the supermarkets are running out of steam.
As a result, Carrefour has issued 2.5 million contactless MasterCards this year.
In order to move to faster speeds, it is now necessary for banks to equip their customers with these cards.
"Two major French financial institutions have committed themselves to systematically distributing contactless chip cards to their customers in the future," announces Gérard Nébouy, CEO of Visa Europe France.
Banks test payment by mobile phone
However, this is only the first step towards the means of payment of the future: the mobile phone.
A negligible percentage of devices have been equipped with the NFC (Near Field Communication) technology required to carry out these transactions.
'They've fallen behind. '
'But at least they should be on a real upward trajectory next year, 'he said.
"We expect to sell 80 to 120 million units worldwide in 2012," explains Marc Bertin, Chairman of Eurosmart.
But the banks are taking the initiative.
Yesterday, Crédit Agricole announced the start of a test run in Caen, which will run from December to next June.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and employees will be equipped with a capsule that allows contactless payment.
BPCE operates a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And Société Générale also said yesterday that it was preparing to launch an offer that would allow its customers to pay by contactless mobile phone.
Terrorist front goes from the Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about relations between al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The long suspected links between the terrorist group al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram appear to be confirmed.
On Sunday, Algerian Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel himself confirmed that Algiers had now "gained certainty."
"The way in which both organisations operate and the relationship between the intelligence services indicate clear cooperation," he said, without going into further detail.
Paris seems to be making a similar analysis.
The investigation into the kidnapping of two Frenchmen in Niger last January has brought to light a number of issues, he said.
The following day, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory, who were kidnapped by Aqmi supporters in a restaurant in Niamey, were allegedly killed at the same time as several of their captors in an operation carried out by the French special forces.
French and Nigerian investigators say they have found several phone chips belonging to the terrorists in the rubble at the scene.
Terrorist axis
The analysis of the telephone calls made leads to several interlocutors stationed in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), the investigators are particularly interested in the numbers of two interlocutors: one number leads to a Nigerian who had spent a long time in Maiduguri, a town in northern Nigeria, the cradle of Boko Haram; the other leads to a man considered to be close to the Aqmi and the sect.
"This is progress, but there is no doubt that clearer evidence is needed before we can talk about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Harem."
'But it's conceivable. '
"It has been known for years that the sect receives financial and intellectual support from outside and that it is increasingly active," said Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, these "support services" have become increasingly evident, as have the speeches and operations of Boko Harem, which now point to the use of suicide bombers and increasingly sophisticated explosives bearing the same hallmarks as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, starting with Washington, has since put pressure on Abuja to take account of the problems caused by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have, in fact, for a long time regarded the group as a community of Illuminati to whom special attention does not need to be paid.
Rapid success
Boko Haram, founded in 2002 in Maiduguri near a mosque, a school, and the fundamentalist Iman Mohammed Yusuf - which in Haoussa means "Western education is a disgrace" - is pursuing the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this impoverished region, the merger is experiencing rapid success.
It is politicizing itself and claiming strict adherence to Sharia law, while its affiliated activists are engaged in the fight against the godless central government.
Activists have targeted churches, bars and government offices.
In 2009, Boko Haram militants have been particularly active in stepping up attacks on police stations.
The reaction from Abuja, however, is, as usual, indifferentiated.
The army surrounds the city and 800 people are killed.
Mohammed Yusuf, who was taken prisoner, is killed in prison.
As a result, the sect is becoming increasingly radical, abandoning its strongholds in the north.
Last Christmas, it claimed responsibility for one attack in Jos, which claimed 80 lives, and another in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram was blamed for a suicide bombing at its secure police headquarters in Abuja - the first of its kind.
In August, the local headquarters of the United Nations becomes a prime international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which is to run from Mauritania to Nigeria and Somalia, has since alarmed all security experts.
While the Aqmi has occupied Mali and Niger, the Somalis of al-Shabaab operate in Kenya, Boko Haram appears to be a new threat in the center of the continent.
Last week, during a meeting with President Goodluck Jonathan in Nigeria, Alain Juppé warned of Boko Haram and said he was ready to "share all the information."
The world of the Republican presidential candidates
Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry are vying for the White House on China, Iraq and aid to Israel.
Can a crisis-stricken America lead a complex world with simple, not to say simple, ideas?
Listening to the Republican presidential candidates, voters could almost get that impression.
For the past few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and their comrades-in-arms have been repeating their thunderous statements, as well as their statements on foreign policy, traditional Republican focal points.
There are slogans - often unsubstantiated - about China, Iran, and aid to Israel.
Mitt Romney, the frontrunner for the "Grand Old Party" nomination, threatened to take the Chinese to the WTO and accuse them of "currency manipulation," a leading issue in an America deeply irritated by the exodus of entire industries to Asia.
Stupid if this is to imply launching a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, a former ambassador to China under Obama and the only candidate who seems to have a mature vision of foreign policy, has almost cut off his air with emotion.
He had called for a tangible but constructive exchange of views with Beijing (also Obama's current stance).
But Huntsman has not been heard, as he has stagnated in the polls.
Reagan's likeness
Romney had also vowed military strikes on Iran if sanctions aimed at halting its nuclear program fail.
"If elected, I will stop Iran," he had said.
'If Obama gets re-elected, they'll get the bomb. '
He has also promised Israel increased military aid and accused Obama of failing to fulfill obligations to that partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second-highest-placed candidate, for his part, is showing a shameful lack of judgment.
He recently called for countering China's military threat because Beijing is "trying to develop a nuclear power" - seemingly ignoring the fact that China has had military nuclear weapons since 1964!
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and calls for military strikes against Iran, has said he is ready to deploy the American army in Mexico to fight drug cartels.
The use of torture against suspected terrorists, prohibited by Obama in 2009, was also endorsed by Cain, Perry and the candidate Michele Bachmann.
It's a far cry from John McCain, the 2008 Republican nominee, a foreign policy heavyweight.
The current presidential contenders counter that Reagan also had simple ideas and, despite all that, won the Cold War.
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and had to pour water into his wine when it came to the subject of anti-terror.
They rightly insist on the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, the premature withdrawal of his "boys" from Iraq, his indecision in Libya, which also earned him a reputation for weakness.
This hostility, however, is not quite so casual.
People are more likely to appreciate the positive national security record under Obama, which eliminated Bin Laden.
Since Iraq, it has been wary of military interventions that lead to paralysis.
And Obama surprises more appropriately by arguing that America needs to be rebuilt economically to revive its leadership.
Nord Stream, New Gateway to Russian Gas in Europe
The Nord Stream gas pipeline, which runs on the seabed of the Baltic Sea and connects Western Europe directly with Russia, has been put into operation.
It is expected to deliver gas to the equivalent of 30 million homes.
The Russian gas giant Gazprom wanted to celebrate this event with splendour and glory.
More than 500 invited guests, including four heads of state and government, attended the inauguration of the new Nord Stream gas pipeline linking Russia and Germany directly below sea level on the Baltic Sea coast last Tuesday, accompanied by an orchestra and a gourmet buffet.
German Chancellor Angelika Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon, and his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte symbolically turned the steering wheel of the valve that carries Russian gas to the Western European grid.
The new gas pipeline is intended to deliver 27.5 billion cubic metres of additional Russian gas per year to Western Europe through a first 1,224 km pipeline linking the St. Petersburg region with Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
A second pipeline, allowing a total supply of 55 billion cubic meters of gas - equivalent to France's total consumption - is scheduled for completion by the end of 2012.
And one already hints at the possibility of building a third line on the same route.
For Gazprom, the timely and timely completion of this enormous structure is a victory.
The project was highly controversial in Poland and the Baltic States.
The Nord Stream pipeline will enable direct gas delivery to Germany, avoiding any overland route through third countries (Poland or Ukraine).
For this reason, these two countries are losing some of their power: they are now finding it harder to put pressure on Russia by threatening to close access to Western European markets.
Warsaw, the most engaged in the debate, has not shied away from comparing the Nord Stream pipeline to a "new German-Soviet pact" linked to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
This means that the issue is politically extremely sensitive.
Western Europe has gained even greater security of supply by supporting this Russian project.
However, this is at the expense of debilitating European energy, as the project has opened up a gap between Western and Eastern Europeans.
In barely five years, Russia has managed to push through its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich, Western countries that consume heavily and run out of gas.
"This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that connects us organically," François Fillon confirmed at the inauguration of the gas pipeline, pointing out the degree to which the major gas contracts are also important from a political and economic point of view.
All this explains the broad smiles of Gazprom managers, many of whom are present in Lubmin, when it comes to gas pipelines.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also an outstanding technology.
The underwater pipeline is made of steel with a concrete sheath to protect it from ship anchors.
It rests on the seabed, at a depth of about 200 m.
During their construction, minefields dating back to the Second World War had to be avoided.
"As a precaution, hundreds of mines had to be removed or destroyed," said Jens Müller, spokesman for Nord Stream.
In addition, increased measures had to be taken to protect the fauna and flora.
The pipe is a long metal snake, heavy like 242 Eiffel Towers, which is not interrupted by anything along its entire length: neither valves nor maintenance stations.
A control platform was envisaged off the coast of Sweden, but those responsible for the project refrained from doing so, as the Swedes were not keen to see a Russian state-owned company settle permanently on their shores.
"In the event of an accident, we close the gas passage in less than a minute," Jens Müller specified.
In the event of a leak, the gas in the pipeline escapes into the air.
However, this case is considered unlikely by the designers, as the welds were estimated to have a leak resistance of one leak per 100,000 years.
State monitoring of the gas pipeline is ensured both by an underwater robot controlled from a seagoing vessel for external observation purposes and by a device circulating inside the gas pipeline.
It has the shape of a cigar, measures one metre in diameter, is inserted into the inside of the pipe and is moved by the gas pressure.
After three full days of moving through the pipe at a speed of 3 meters per second, the device delivers the most accurate information on possible metal deformations upon arrival.
The gas pipeline was designed to operate for fifty years without even having to undergo the slightest repair.
Gas circulation is simply ensured by pressure.
This is 200 bar at the access point, 100 bar at the exit point.
Five companies have joined forces to realize this project.
However, the management remains in the hands of Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares.
The German companies E. ON and BASF (15.5% each) are also affiliated here, as are the Dutch Gasunie and the French GDF Suez group (9% each).
These five companies have formed a consortium called Nord Stream, which is responsible for the construction and operation of the gas pipeline.
It is based in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then leased the entire capacity of its gas transport to that company on a renewable twenty-year contract.
"Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, no matter how large the quantity of gas actually transported," Jens Müller specified.
30% of the financing of the gas pipeline construction was secured by shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
The total labour costs for both pipelines should amount to EUR 7.4 billion.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment amounted to 240 million.
However, the minority shareholders are confident that they will recoup their expenses, as Gazprom alone bears the risk of liability.
The gas pipeline emerges from the Baltic Sea on a sandy, pine-forested coastline near Lubmin.
The 4.5 metre high valves form the gas exit gate.
Sensors measure the pressure, temperature and other parameters of the incoming gas before it is transmitted to the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal has been supplied with one million cubic metres of Russian gas per passing hour.
At full capacity, this would be 3 million cubic meters per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine, a brand notebook.
Created by an Italian company some fifteen years ago, Moleskine now wants to give writing a new style.
It has a flair for adventure, hours spent writing by candlelight.
Moleskine's notebook is easily recognisable, with its black, rectangular cover, its elastic band, its eggshell-colored pages that have aged over time.
However, the Moleskine notebook as it is known today was created in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, which has its headquarters in Milan, decided at that time to bring a distinguished design notebook on the market.
Maria Sebregondi, the company's technical advisor at the time, is in charge of the market launch of the new product.
The notebook was inspired by an ancient production technique called mole skin, which refers to a cotton lacquer used, for example, to cover upholstery benches.
This type of notebook was in great demand among writers and travelers.
"Moleskine has revived an old and almost forgotten object that was considered an icon of avant-garde artists until the 20th century," explains Maria Sebregondi, now brand manager at Modo Modo.
Success comes.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% and established themselves with sales of 12.7 million units.
This is a far cry from the usual production in the early years, when only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine crosses the Italian border and is exported to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to create a phantom image of the buyer, as the notebook excites businessmen as well as students and professionals.
Moleskine has the image of cosmopolitan, cultured and open-minded customers.
The small Italian company, which initially had 12 employees, now employs more than 100 people and has had two offices since 2008; one in Milan, the other in New York.
The company distributes its notebooks in bookstores, on internet portals such as Fnac, in small boutiques in the city centres and knows how to assert its identity.
"We have followed the spirit of the times and its new need for writing, despite the rise of e-mails," said Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural trait is accompanied by the development of Moleskine: recently, the brand launched an exposition called "Detour," in which architects and artists exhibited their own notebooks.
In August, the company also launched a leopard print cover at the Locarno Film Festival.
Benefiting from its success and this cultural zeitgeist, Moleskine has been able to diversify its products: bags, diaries, fountain pens, computer cases... The brand offers the full range of articles.
A success that brings jealousy to the plan: In autumn 2006, Modo Modo was bought by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, which is now Syntegra Capital, and thus opened a new chapter in the history of the company Moleskine.
Why does the unemployment rate for disabled workers remain at such a high level?
About 19% of disabled people are looking for a job.
Today marks the start of the 15th Work Week for the Disabled.
Despite a purposeful public policy introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate for disabled people is always twice as high as the average: 19% against 9% of the total population.
Discouraging?
"No," emphasises Éric Blanchet, director-general of the Adapt association, which organises "Work Week for the Disabled." "
"The progress made over fifteen years is considerable."
'At the time, the unemployment rate wasn't double, it was three times that. '
'Nevertheless, there's still an enormous amount of work to be done. '
It must be said, however, that many obstacles remain for the disabled unemployed before they get a job.
It is more common among the elderly: 37% are over 50 years old (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualifications: 80% of them do not have A-levels and there are only 10,000 disabled among the 2.3 million students with higher education qualifications.
Finally, long-term unemployment is also very widespread: 53% for the disabled compared with 38% on average.
In short, there are so many criteria that make it difficult to get back into work and that "lie at the heart of the problem," says Christian Grapin, chief executive of Tremplin, an association set up in 1992 to help companies recruit disabled workers.
So much for the factual brakes.
What remains is the unspoken, the attitudes of mind, which are certainly evolving, but slowly.
A study carried out in April by the association IMS-Entreprendre for the magazine La Cité stated that the managers surveyed had "a low level of knowledge about the disabled," which was "over-represented" by "persons in wheelchairs, mentally or intellectually inferior."
The result is that private companies with more than 20 employees still have a long way to go to reach the employment target of 6% of disabled workers, which was enshrined in a 1987 law.
These latter figures, which date back to 2008, indicate a ratio of 2.6%.
"We are now at around 3%," says Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiph, the organisation charged with collecting contributions from companies that flout the law.
The proof is that between 2007 and 2011, the number of "fee-paying" establishments decreased, as did the amount paid, from 59,000 to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 law, which increased premiums, put a lot of pressure on companies," said Pierre Blanc. "
"But this improvement also reflects a real realization, especially among the large groups of companies."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of establishments with between 20 and 49 employees employ disabled workers, while companies with between 100 and 199 employees employ 82%.
Hazard: 'What a lucky'
Even before they faced the "Blue Tuesday evenings" (8: 45 p.m.), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens had not concealed the pleasure that the friendly game brought them.
It would be too far-fetched to say that there was collusion between them, but the picture speaks symbolically.
Sitting side by side in the stands at the Stade de France, George Leekens and Eden Hazard could well have made peace.
Five months on from the spirited gesture of his attacking player against Turkey, the Belgium national coach has won nothing but praise for his side.
'I'm very pleased with Eden, his progress and the fact that he's Belgian. '
"I want to look ahead," the Liller native assures.
As for the contrast between his portrayal of club and national team, "It's a unit that justifies everything."
'I'm in Lille all year round, which is not the case in Belgium. '
"It's time for me to start."
Hazard will arrive in Saint-Denis ahead of Friday night's match against Romania in order to 'finally shine'.
However, without neglecting the note of "pleasure."
He has been with the French national team since the age of seven and led their victorious campaigns between 1998 and 2000.
"I have always been supported," he said.
Inevitably, this contributes to further enhancing the "unique" character of this encounter.
"Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) will be there," he said.
'We've just run into each other. '
"To be able to play against them is great luck!"
Leekens, for his part, sounded "proud."
"The pride of hosting a gala match."
"Pride" also to confirm - in its capacity as "neighbour" - that France "has once again become a team at a very high level," little more than a year after the trauma of Knysna.
"Laurent Blanc has done a damn good job," he said enthusiastically.
Although Belgium will be absent from the next European Championship, the technician sees himself very well sharing the plane with the Blue (the French national team)... namely towards Brazil in 2014.
"We little Belgians come out big," he said.
'We're planning one thing, the players are ambitious, they're hungry. '
"You will notice that in the upcoming games." Including the game against France.
Portugal very confident
Paulo Bento's Portugal team looks forward to the return match against Bosnia (22: 00) in Lisbon this Tuesday with great optimism.
In the first leg, both teams lacked objectivity.
'At the end of those 90 minutes we'll be a happy team and, above all, a happy country. '
Paulo Bento already sees himself in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is not the slightest doubt that "La Selecçao," his national team, for which he has been in charge since September 2010, will qualify for the 2012 European Championship.
For Portugal, that means only 90 minutes of bliss.
But there is a match to be played and an opponent to be eliminated, and that is Bosnia.
In view of the game (0-0) on Friday in the hell of Zenica, it seems obvious that the die has not yet been cast.
Portugal dominated the game for more than an hour but were unable to make the all-important mark that would have taken the pressure off them.
'It's a good result but there is some risk because we didn't score an away goal. '
At home, however, at their bright Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced they will prevail in front of a crowd that is likely to be just as keen on the game, even if the match was, of course, announced as "very close," said the upbeat but lucid Bento.
"We expect a very close match but we are totally convinced we can get the better of them," said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
'We still have a 50 per cent chance of being at Euro 2012, 'said Carlos Queiroz's successor.
Friday's draw in Bosnia forces the Portuguese to score and win.
A draw may be enough for the Bosnians, who also need a goal.
"This is a good result, but there is a certain risk because we didn't score an away goal," Bento laments.
"We will be up against a team with high technical qualities and players with a lot of individual qualities," he added.
As at Zenica, the Portuguese plan to exert maximum pressure on the Bosnians from the start to "give them no time to think." "
A good idea, provided that it is put into practice this time.
