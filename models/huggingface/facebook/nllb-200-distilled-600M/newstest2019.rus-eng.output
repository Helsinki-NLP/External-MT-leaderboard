Number of recruits from Ukraine preparing to send to Donbass
The official representative of the People's Militia of the self-proclaimed Luhansk People's Republic (LPR) Andrei Morochko said that in the winter of 2018-2019, Ukraine will send at least 3 thousand recruits to the Donbass.
According to him, Kiev plans to "somehow complete the units".
"The unwillingness of Ukrainian citizens to serve in the ranks of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, mass dismissals led to low completeness of units", Morochko told RIA Novosti.
He also did not rule out that the actual numbers of Ukrainians recruited into the army could be increased if necessary.
In 2014-2017, Kiev began the so-called anti-terrorist operation (ATO), which was later changed to the operation of the United Forces (OIC).
It was assumed that this measure would lead to an increase in the role of Ukrainian security forces in settling the situation.
In late August 2018, the situation in Donbass worsened due to the assassination of the head of the DPR Alexander Zakharchenko.
The DPR authorities have described the incident as a terrorist attack.
During the investigation of the criminal case, several people involved in the explosion were arrested.
According to preliminary information, they confirmed that the diversion was organized by the Ukrainian special services.
US authorities forced Musk to step down as Tesla chairman
American businessman Elon Musk will step down as chairman of the board of directors of Tesla, the company he founded, at the request of the US authorities.
The businessman will also pay $20 million to settle the claims of the Federal Securities and Exchange Commission .
According to CNBC, the pre-trial agreement with the agency allows Musk to remain in the top position at Tesla.
He is also required to pay $20 million and leave the board of directors within 45 days of the agreement and for at least three years.
Two independent directors will be appointed in his place.
It is noted that the agreement has yet to be approved by the court.
On September 28, it was reported that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission accused Musk of misleading shareholders by stating that he had sufficient funds to buy out the company's stock and sued the businessman.
It's about a businessman's Twitter post that he said he wanted to buy Tesla shares for $420 a share, but he never did.
After the tweet, the company's stock has risen by almost 11%.
The head of the British Foreign Office compared the EU to the Soviet Union and a prison
British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt compared the European Union to the Soviet Union and accused Brussels of capturing the member countries of the community.
The diplomat made the following statement at the ruling Conservative Party congress in Birmingham on Sunday, September 30.
According to the Daily Mail, Hunt thus commented on the difficulties in the Brexit negotiation process.
What happened to the belief in the European dream and its ideals?
The EU was created to protect freedom, and the Soviet Union wouldn't let anyone leave it.
The lesson of history is clear: if you turn the EU from a community into a prison, the desire to leave it will not diminish, but will only grow, and we will not be the only prisoner who wants to escape from captivity", the minister said.
He also added that attempts to punish Britain for its decision to leave the European Union would only exacerbate the crisis, notes Gazeta.ru.
In mid-September, British Prime Minister Theresa May said Brexit talks had stalled.
She commented on the results of the informal summit of the European Union in Salzburg.
The decision on Brexit was taken in 2016 following a referendum.
The UK's exit is expected to take place before April 2019, but negotiations with Brussels on this issue are complicated by a host of factors.
In particular, there is still no clear agreement on how the parties will interact after London leaves the community.
Besides, the question of the Irish border remains open.
The South Korean president who got the mushroom from the DPRK got two dogs as a gift
South Korean President Moon Jae-in received two puppies as a gift from North Korean leader Kim Jong-un after visiting Pyongyang.
This is reported by Reuters, citing a representative of the South Korean president's administration.
"A pair of phunsans were offered as a gift during the summit.
On Thursday, they were received", the ministry said.
The North Korean side gave the dogs about a year of food "as an aid to their adaptation".
The gift was made in honor of the inter-Korean summit, which took place from September 18 to 20 in Pyongyang.
The hunting breed of phunsan is of North Korean origin and takes its name from one of the districts of the DPRK.
Moon loves animals, and he already has two dogs that former North Korean leader Kim Jong-il gave him.
Dogs aren't the only gift.
Kim Jong-un also handed over two tons of delicious Matsutaca mushrooms to his colleague.
He ordered the mushrooms to be distributed to families separated during the Korean War who had not yet reunited with their loved ones from the DPRK.
Altai village council leader stopped hunger strike to protect the interests of residents
The deputy announced on his Facebook page that he had stopped starving for several reasons.
The village council chief said the situation had stalled, the district administration was not responding to his demands, and he needed to do his job.
In addition, the prosecutor's office began to check the situation, and the heat supply organization of the STPK promised to begin work on preparing the system for the winter heating period of the Siberian village next week.
The residents of the village also made and took away the governor of the Altai region a mass collective appeal, "concerned with the catastrophic situation that has taken place".
Boronin himself said that he felt normal, his duties as head during the hunger strike were fully fulfilled.
Boronin explained that the settlements of Siberian and Rogulichny have centralized systems of heat supply, which means that the authorities for preparing them for winter should be carried out by the administration of the First May district.
However, no one has yet started this work.
The village council chief also protested against the lack of proper control and support from the Altai region government and against the financial policy of the company "Gazprommezhregiongaz Novosibirsk".
Besides the proper preparation of the settlements for the winter, Boronin demanded "immediately to organize a fully independent community farm with the appropriate staff units".
Moscow's new buildings with the cheapest apartments
In the first half of 2018, about three thousand units of housing in Moscow's new buildings were purchased with an area of 30 square meters and a cost of up to four million rubles.
More than half of these transactions were made by two housing companies, according to the Urbanus portal (available to Lenti.ru).
The leaders in the volume of sales of housing in the budget up to four million rubles were the "Nekrasovka" Housing Company, located behind the MKAD, in the area of Kozelniki (UVAO), and the apartment complex "Barbaris" in the area of Biberevo (SVАО).
Two residential units in New Moscow - "Southern Bunino" and "Klenové aleje" - were also notable in the structure of deals with budget housing.
Urbanus analysts note that the share of deals with apartments up to four million rubles in these new buildings reaches 60 percent of all sales and provides half of the total revenue.
"The impact of apartments with a budget of less than four million rubles on the commercial success of the "Central" district in "New Vatutinks" and the "Filats Lug" Housing Corporation should be recognized", - says the study on two more Housing Committees of New Moscow.
They account for about 35 percent of the total revenue.
Earlier, the ranking of the most expensive apartment in Moscow was presented by the real estate agency Bon Ton.
According to the company, the lowest prices for primary housing (149,9 thousand rubles per meter) in September 2018 were recorded in the YVАО.

Telegram users complained about a failure in the work of the new version
iPhone users complained about problems with Telegram messenger after the update, which was released on September 28.
The user 's phone number can be identified by their user ID
The complaints relate to gadgets running the current iOS 12 operating system.
According to their owners, after the update, the app shows a white screen or closes immediately.
The messenger's representatives responded to the breach.
They say the problem may be related to the migration of information to a new application written in Swift.
Telegram has temporarily suspended the automatic update of the app until the bugs are fixed.
On April 13, the Tagan court of Moscow granted a request from Roskomnadzor to block Telegram messenger in Russia.
Three days later, the operators began to execute the decision.
The reason was the refusal of the messenger administration to provide the FSB with the keys to decrypt the correspondence needed to obtain the data about the terrorists.
In August, Telegram changed its privacy policy and agreed to disclose the IP address and mobile phone number of a suspected terrorist user upon receipt of a relevant court order.
Telegram audience after the blockade in Russia decreased by 1.2 million

Bob Hartley: I'm glad for the guys who went out to realize the numerical advantage in the game against the Minsk Dynamo.
The head coach of "Avangard" Bob Hartley summed up the regular season championship match against Minsk Dynamo (2:1).
Victory is very important to us.
After the match in St. Petersburg, we held a meeting and agreed that we should leave this game behind and prepare for Minsk.
We knew Dynamo had a good win before our meeting, so we were preparing very seriously.
It was important to get rid of the majority, and I'm glad for the guys who went out to realize the numerical advantage.
We've been playing well lately in most of them, but we haven't been able to score.
Finally, the red light behind the gate lit.
We knew Minsk would be busy, and we tried, and it worked.
The game was a decisive one, and we scored the winning goal in a very uneven format.
We did a good third period today, even though we missed the first goal of the game and it was clear that it would be difficult to keep going.
But we played very well in defense, we didn't give a lot of chances to the opponent, we didn't let them catch us on the shift, Dynamo didn't have any offense with a numerical advantage, so everything ended well for us, "the Hartley press service quotes Omsk club.

Elon Musk is forced to leave the post of Tesla's board chairman
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and Tesla founder Elon Musk have settled their dispute over the fraud case.
This is reported by CNBC News.
According to the cable, as part of the agreement, Musk will have to step down as Tesla's chairman.
At the same time, the commission allowed Musk to retain the post of Tesla's chief executive.
The Tesla founder will also have to pay a $20 million fine.
Tesla's gonna be charged the same amount.
The money will be distributed among the affected investors.
In addition, the company must appoint two independent directors.
Elon Musk is an American businessman who is on the Forbes magazine's list of the 50 richest people on the planet.
He is the head of SpaceX, Neuralink, and Tesla's electric car developer, as well as co-founder of Paypal.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has previously sued Tesla CEO Elon Musk over his tweet about a possible takeover.
Last month, Musk announced plans to make Tesla a private company and buy back all shares on the stock exchange at a fixed price of $420.
The $420 share price was set "because of the significance of this number in marijuana culture", Bloomberg reported earlier, citing Commission Security Co-Director Stephen Peikin.
However, Elon Musk later abandoned his plans to buy back the shares.
Commenting on the US Securities and Exchange Commission's lawsuit against him, the businessman said he considered the fraud charges unfounded, adding that he was very disappointed and saddened by the allegations.
"Honesty is the most important value in my life, and the facts will prove that I have not violated it in any way", the businessman told CNBC in an interview.
In August, a group of Tesla shareholders filed a class action lawsuit against Musk, complaining of financial losses.
The plaintiffs claimed that the businessman's posts caused them losses.
In particular, one shareholder said the businessman's tweets were misleading, causing Tesla stock sellers to buy paper at artificially overpriced prices to cover their positions.
Other plaintiffs also noted that Elon Musk's careless statements led to sharp fluctuations in the course.
In September, Musk accused the head of Citron Research of stock market fraud.
Meanwhile, if Musk couldn't settle his dispute with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, he would face firing from the company and even jail.
This was stated by former commission chairman Harvey Pitt on CNBC.
Musk is "a good guy who can't run a car company".

The RPC compared the possible renaming of the UPC with the actions of the fascists
Metropolitan Volokolamsky Ilarion, head of the Moscow Patriarchate's Department of External Church Relations, compared the possible renaming of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church to the Russian Church in Ukraine with the actions of the fascists in Germany.
Metropolitan of Volokolam, Hilarion - on the causes of the conflict with the Patriarchate of Constantinople, the possible church split and its political subtext
He said that now that "the conflict between Russia and Ukraine is in a critical stage", renaming the church is like "fixing a yellow six-pointed star to the Jews" in Nazi Germany.
"It means marking the church as an enemy organization, and it is for this purpose that this bill was created", the representative of the RPC said on the broadcast of the "Russia 24" television channel.
The Metropolitan also stressed that the UOC is not a Russian church, but a Ukrainian one, since "believers of this church consider themselves Ukrainians, they are patriots of their country".

Grand Prix in Sochi: an anshlag, a Russian car and the return of Kvyat
In the next ten years, Russia may have its own racing car.
This was stated by Russian Vice Prime Minister Dmitry Kozak, summing up his meeting with Russian car manufacturers on the eve of the start of the Russian Grand Prix in Sochi.
The vice-president of the government also shared his opinion on Daniel Kvyat's return to Toro Rosso and appreciated the attendance of the Russian Formula 1 stage.
The result of our meeting with car manufacturers should be the creation of the Russian Formula 1 car in the near future, which has no analogues in the world, - said Dmitry Kozak.
We need to encourage our automakers to do that.
It was a 2024 plan, but I don't think it's possible in this time frame.
I think the real time frame is within the next ten years".
From 2012 to 2014, the team "Marussia" competed in Formula 1 under Russian license.
According to the vice-premier, there are already investors who are willing to invest in the creation of a national team in the world championship of auto racing in the class "Formula-1".
I know that there are car sports enthusiasts in Russia, wealthy businessmen who are willing to invest, willing to invest in the creation of the Russian Formula 1 team", he noted.
"We're willing to support them morally.
Let's hope we have a team like that.
I suspect that the idea of creating a team came about because Sochi had such an infrastructure".
Sochi Autodrome is expecting an anthology tomorrow.
According to Dmitry Cossack, the organizers managed to sell all 50 thousand tickets.
Look, even at the qualifying stands were practically filled", the deputy prime minister noted.
I can tell you that revenue this year is up 72% from last year.
That's a good, positive result.
We are also preparing a plan of action to improve the efficiency of Sochi Autodrome infrastructure throughout the year.
It will be an additional tourist product that will add to Sochi's appeal.
Dmitry Kozak also missed the main theme of the day for Russian enthusiasts of motorsport - Daniel Kvyat's return to Toro Rosso.
We all congratulate Daniel and wish him success in the next season", the deputy prime minister told Izvestia.
He's a very promising racer.
Next year, for the first time in history, two major Russian pilots will be able to take part in the Formula 1 peloton.
Although the future of Sergey Sirotikin in the "Royal Races" remains unknown.
His contract with Williams expires at the end of the season, and the results are not impressive yet: he took 18th place in the qualifying for the Russian Grand Prix.
Let's hope that next season our main pilots will be more than this year", said Dmitry Kozak.

His words are reported by Rostovgazeta.ru.
Why are we so hypocritical and only happy with success?

On September 30, 1928, exactly 90 years ago, British bacteriologist Alexander Fleming announced his unprecedented discovery.
The discovery of penicillin marked the beginning of the modern antibiotic era, brought Fleming worldwide fame and made him a Nobel laureate.
By the way, penicillin extraction from the mold mushrooms wasn't Fleming's first discovery.
A few years earlier, he had a cold and had planted mucus from his own nose in a Petri dish (a glass lid used to test bacteria) and found that the bacteria had been destroyed a few days later.
They were almost as accidentally exposed to penicillin.
Fleming's name was added to the list of the 100 most outstanding figures in human history.
Many scientists believe that his discovery changed the course of history.
Penicillin was used to treat most of the ancient diseases that were previously considered incurable - tuberculosis, syphilis, gangrene.
When Fleming arrived in the French capital in 1945, shortly after receiving the Nobel Prize, Paris newspapers wrote: "He did more than a dozen divisions for the defeat of fascism and the liberation of France".
Experts estimate that Fleming's discovery of the world's first antibiotic saved the lives of more than 200 million people.
Alexander Fleming died in his London home in 1955 of a heart attack.
He was cremated, and a week later his ashes were buried in the famous St. Paul's Cathedral in London.
Where, by the way, my wife and I were being watched by a Russian-speaking tour guide.
And a few years later, the statue of Alexander Fleming was in full swing in the most unexpected place in the Spanish capital.
There, near the main arena for the Plaza de Toros de Las Ventas corridor, the most famous Spanish matadors erected a monument to the man whose efforts they believed saved the lives of hundreds of outstanding corridor masters.

Google will pay Apple $9 billion for default search status
Google will pay $9 billion to remain the default search engine in Apple Safari.
According to Business Insider, next year's payments will grow to $12 billion.
Last year, Google paid $3 billion for this option.
The annual fee is calculated based on how many Google search queries were made from Siri's voice assistant and Safari's browser on iOS devices.
Analysts say it's not a good idea for Google to default to its search engine status, as Apple is one of the biggest sources of traffic for the search engine.
In early August, Apple became the first US company to reach $1 trillion in sales.
Earlier published reports suggest that the corporation's net profit in the third quarter grew 32% compared to the same period in 2017, reaching $11.5 billion.

Trump talked about his "love" of Kim Jong-un
The US and North Korean leaders have almost fallen in love with each other, Donald Trump joked.
US President Donald Trump has made a good joke about his successes on the front in resolving the North Korean crisis.
Starting with mutual threats of destruction, the leaders of the two countries have now so straightened their relationship that they are almost in love with each other, the American president noted.
The White House's host recalled that he accepted the North Korean issue from the previous administration as the main foreign policy challenge.
Trump said that Barack Obama's team had so much engagement with North Korea that they couldn't even reach the country's leadership - they just didn't answer the phone.
The United States and North Korea were on the brink of war, and today the North Korean leader is writing "beautiful letters" to the White House, Trump noted.
Trump admitted that he was "cruel" with Kim Jong-un at the beginning of his term, which was mutual.
But now their relationship has improved so much that the leaders "fall in love".
Trump also asked that his words not be taken literally and warned that the American media would interpret them as incompetence.
Trump noted that recently Pyongyang has stopped nuclear and missile tests, and is closing down military sites.
It's all the work of his administration, the president is sure.
Last Tuesday, Donald Trump politely called Kim Jong-un off the UN General Assembly.
Trump thanked the North Korean leader for his courage and for taking steps to de-escalate tensions.
Trump also said the sanctions against North Korea would remain in place until the Korean Peninsula was completely denuclearized.

The positive outcome of the meeting was the cessation of the North Korean nuclear and missile tests, as well as the return to the United States of the remains of American soldiers in the country.
At the same time, other practical steps toward denuclearizing North Korea are still being taken.
The media reported that after the Singapore summit, the US had already sent several disarmament scenarios to the DPRK, but Pyongyang rejected them, calling them "gangster scenarios".

Nicey called for "expulsion of the Moscow language as a Ukrainian product"
Ukrainian children's writer and mother tongue cleanliness fighter Larissa Niczoy called for the expulsion of "Russian-speaking Moscow product and Moscow language" from Ukraine.
To do this, she offers Ukrainian products - "cultural wave, cultural pressure".
She shared her thoughts on the "purpose of eradicating the Russian language in Ukraine" with the Ukrainian edition of "Observer".
According to her, the relevant Ukrainian product is now being prepared - it is already there and continues to develop further.
Over time, Ukrainians will "recover" from this "Moscow language", she is convinced.
For example, in neighboring Poland, she said, Russian was used extensively on television and radio, but it was virtually forgotten in public.
At the same time, according to Niçoy, Ukrainians do not use aggressive methods in this process: the actions of the authorities banning the use of the Russian language, in her opinion, are only "expansion of borders for Ukrainian speech at the legislative level".
Niçoy shared her experience of supporting the "Ukrainian-speaking regime" in a children's camp in the Carpathians, where she was invited to work.
In December 2016, she threatened to sue the Watsons bookstore chain, the cashier of one of which communicated with her in Russian.
Not achieving her goal, Nico threw a curse at the girl.
She calls the use of Russian words by Ukrainians "linguistic schizophrenia", urging Ukrainians to abandon Russian letters even in writing surnames.
Recently, Nitsou said that the name "Rus" was stolen from Ukrainians, so Russia should be called Moscow.
The writer's anger was not even escaped by the Security Service of Ukraine: when she came there and heard the employees talking to each other in Russian, she made a scandal and left, knocking on the door.
We had a manly conversation at the break, and it paid off.
Defender of the "Ural" Denis Kulakov - about victory over Arsenal (2:1) in the match of the ninth round of the Russian championship.
"Dennis, what do you think got you to win?"
"I think we wanted to win more", the official website of Ural quotes Kulakov as saying.
"A tough game came out, we had a serious men's conversation in the break, and it paid off: we scored two goals and didn't miss.
"You missed a few games because of an injury you got earlier this month.
How did you feel today?"
"If you've been up for 90 minutes, then you're fine!
Actually, I was feeling good.
Maybe a little bit of strength at the end so nothing happens.
Well, the doctor and physiotherapist Vladimir Anatoly Gashnev brought me to this game, which is why I thank them so much!
"How about the atmosphere on the team?"
"It's no secret that after a win, it's easier to recover and the team is in a good mood.
We've got a white stripe now, even though it was black at first.
We have to keep going and keep the fans happy".
"Did you miss the game for not going out on the field?"
"There is such a thing as a little missed, because really, an unpleasant situation came out.
But I'll say it again, thanks to the physical therapist and the doctors for putting you on your feet.
Most importantly, we won and we cheered the fans.
And the rest is secondary".

In Macedonia, there were violations of the referendum
Four incidents involving violations of electoral law were recorded in the Republic of Macedonia in a referendum on the intergovernmental agreement with Greece on renaming.
This was reported on Sunday by the press secretary of the Ministry of Internal Affairs Tony Angelovsky.
Since the election, four incidents have been recorded, which have been eliminated, he said.
At the polling station at the Lazo Angelowski elementary school in Skopje, 22-year-old K.J. violated public order and calm, insulted citizens and attacked police officers.
He was arrested and taken to the police station.
According to the Foreign Ministry, all the offenders were immediately taken to the police stations.
The ministry said that all violations are being investigated.
"The Ministry will act in accordance with the law so that citizens can safely exercise their constitutional right to express their will.
We urge citizens to abide by the law and refrain from any violations of public order and peace and any violations of the voting secrecy", the interior ministry spokesman said.
During the referendum on Sunday, citizens are asked to answer one question: "Do you support EU and NATO membership by accepting an agreement between the Republic of Macedonia and the Hellenic Republic?"
The referendum is intended to resolve a 27-year dispute between Macedonia and Greece over the name of the former Yugoslav republic, which coincides with the name of the northern Greek region.
The heads of the Foreign Ministry of Macedonia and Greece on June 17 during a solemn ceremony on the shores of the lake Prespa, which runs the border between the two countries, signed an agreement on the new official name of the former Yugoslav republic.
It provides for the use of the name "Republic of North Macedonia".

This is what Syrian Foreign Ministry chief Walid Muallem said in an interview with RT broadcast on Sunday.

The Syrian Foreign Ministry also stressed that the S-300 is a defensive, not an offensive system, and it is designed to protect the Syrian sky.
Pashinyan hopes to hold early elections to the parliament in 2018
Elections to the parliament of Armenia can be held in 2018, Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan said.
"Not until the end of the year", the head of government said when asked by journalists about the timing of the event.
Mr. Pashinyan also did not rule out that "he will again take people to the streets" for the holding of extraordinary elections if the discussion of this issue with parliamentary forces does not succeed.
But I'm willing to negotiate with parliamentary forces.
I hope they are also willing to engage in constructive dialogue", the Prime Minister of Armenia quoted.
Nikol Pashinyan added that early elections are "a demand of the people", as well as part of the government's programme, which the parliament voted for.
He said the "long-term vision of the government" was also necessary to attract investment and develop the economy.
At the UN General Assembly in New York, Mr. Pashinyan promised to begin "negotiations with representatives of all parliamentary and non-parliamentary forces to discuss the timing and conditions of early elections" after returning to Yerevan.
In the current parliament, about half of the deputies represent the opposition party, the Republican Party of Armenia (RPA).
An early vote is impossible without the dissolution of Parliament, and there is no legitimate basis for it yet.

Kosachev: At the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly , the topic of Russia was almost absent in a negative way
The head of the Federation Council's committee on international affairs Konstantin Kosachev considers the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly a success for Russia and does not exclude that it can become a turning point in the perception of Russia as an integral participant in solving global world problems.
"The uniqueness of the current 73rd session, in my opinion, is that the rhetoric we have been accustomed to in recent years with regard to Russia has now been much more subdued", the senator said in an interview published on Sunday by the Russian newspaper.
He explained that in previous years, the Russian Federation was sometimes "identified as one of the three main threats to humanity, along with Ebola, climate change or terrorism, Russia was in this line, at least in the exposition of a group of Western countries, which expressed themselves quite unanimously on this matter".
At the 73rd session, Kosachev stressed, "the Russian theme was virtually absent in a negative way".
"If you look closely at the speech of the President of the United States, the President of France, the speech of the Foreign Minister of Germany, I do not take Ukraine, Georgia, or the British, at least the choir was not quite accurate", the politician noted, noting that Russia "was no longer a wall to which tennis ball strikes are trained".
The head of the SCOP does not rule out that this indicates a trend that, in his opinion, "will distinguish the current session [of the UN General Assembly], although in full this trend may manifest itself in a year, two, three".
"I do not exclude that this session in some sense could be a turning point", Kosachev admitted, explaining that "there are too many examples of how Russia's involvement in international affairs can move forward".
He cited the situation in Syria, around Iran and North Korea as an example.
"Unfortunately, this is not Ukraine yet, but I have no doubt that Russia's vision of the Ukrainian crisis will also be in demand", the parliamentarian added.
This is because, he believes, there is "an adequate, healthy perception of Russia as not just a possible - an integral participant in solving the global problems of today".
"I don't want to be wrong, but I have a feeling that we are going to a point where the movement will no longer be backward, but forward", he added.
Another "interesting and important feeling" in this context, Kosachev called "the demand for the Russian vision of how the modern world should develop".
"I attended many meetings of the head of the Russian delegation [at the session of the General Assembly] of Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, I held my own meetings, and I saw with great pleasure that if a year or two or five years ago the Russian opinion, the Russian vision of what is happening in the world, in general, nobody was interested, now the situation is different", - said the chairman of the Soviet committee.
He said that "the so-called new liberal order that the West embodies is not able to answer the questions of how to solve the world's problems because of the obvious lack of ideas in the global space, the lack of ideas about how to solve the problems of the Middle East, the problems of terrorism, the problem of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, the problem of migration".
"And here the demand for the Russian vision is becoming more and more obvious", Kosachev said, stressing that he considered "the current session to be a good one for the Russian delegation, a good one for Russia".

And we congratulate Hamilton.
His distance from Fettell is up 50 points.
Bottas looks at the side with anger, I guess.
Damascus has declared its right to use military force in Idlib
Damascus hopes that the Syrian province of Idlib will not have to use military force, said the Syrian Arab Republic's Foreign Ministry head Walid Muallem.
And he said Syria has the right to do so.
The minister added that Turkey has the opportunity to quickly solve the problem of the withdrawal of militants from the Idlib demilitarized zone of the Russia-baned organization Jebhat al-Nusra, reports RIA Novosti.
The foreign minister also stressed that Damascus would have to resort to a military solution to the problems of territories east of the Euphrates in case the Kurds sought separatism.
At the same time, according to Muallem, negotiations with the Kurdish SDF forces were good until they were interrupted by the US.
On September 17, Putin and Turkish President Recep Erdogan agreed to create a demilitarized zone along the line of contact between the armed opposition and government forces in the Syrian province of Idlib by October 15.
Terry led the Chelsea youth team.
Earlier, it was reported that the 37-year-old defender was negotiating a transfer to Spartak in Moscow.
As reported by RT, with reference to the Mirror, former England captain John Terry has been the head coach of the youth team of Chelsea.
According to the source, a well-known player who has been a part of the London club for a long time will lead the team for at least 23 years.
It's been reported that Terry will replace Jody Morris, who left Derby County, as head coach.
In September, Terry was close to moving to Spartak, but he eventually abandoned the idea after talking to his family.
First Vice-Speaker of the Verkhovna Rada Irina Gerachenko apologized to the convicted in Russia for "spying" Ukrainian journalist Roman Sushchenko for not being able to release him from prison.
She said this in a video address to a political prisoner recorded on the eve of the second anniversary of the illegal arrest of Sushchenko by the FSB.
According to her, these days, an action is taking place under the walls of the Russian embassy in Paris, where participants have declared a hunger strike demanding the release of the Kremlin prisoners.
Every day, French journalists, politicians, cultural figures, including people who know you well, starve to death to support Oleg Sentsov, other political prisoners of the Kremlin, and of course you.
There is not a single international meeting, no negotiations, no interview where the President of Ukraine, the Ukrainian authorities, all of us, would not demand to put pressure on the Kremlin, to put pressure on Putin with one demand - the release of Oleg, the release of Roman, the release of all the political prisoners of the Kremlin and those who are illegally held in the occupied territories of Donbass and Crimea", - said Gerashchenko.
She also expressed confidence that the trials will harden every Ukrainian, making us "more fierce, tougher in defending Ukraine's national interests, in defending every Ukrainian, in understanding what is good and what is evil".
Recall that the correspondent of Ukrinform in France, Roman Sushchenko, was detained by Russian security forces on September 30, 2016 at Moscow airport.
On October 7, he was charged with espionage by the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine's Intelligence Directorate.
On June 4, 2018, the Moscow city court sentenced Sushchenko to 12 years in a strict regime colony, and the Supreme Court of Russia declared this verdict lawful.
Russian prisoners have granted the Ukrainian's last request before he was sent to the colony.
NASA reported an asteroid the size of Big Ben approaching Earth.
The U.S. space agency NASA reports that a large asteroid called SP1 is approaching Earth, and its length can reach 160 meters.
According to the Daily Express, the object could be longer than the height of the famous Big Ben or the London Observatory.
There's no exact size data yet.
The speed at which SP1 moves is about 60 thousand km/h. The shortest distance between the asteroid and Earth will be October 3.
Then it will pass our planet at a distance of 0.03926 astronomical units, or 5.87 million kilometers.
The asteroid was first spotted on September 19.
NASA has assigned it to near-Earth objects.
Earlier, on September 27, the Japanese aerospace agency released the first ever video from the surface of the asteroid Ryuga.
Two Japanese rovers (planet-homers) launched from the Hayabusa-2 probe managed to obtain unique frames.
The football lawn of the stadium of the 2018 World Cup was attributed to Buste
Damage to the football lawn at the stadium in Rostov-on-Don was linked to the concert of Russian rapper Vasily Vakulenko, or Basti.
The photo was posted on hd7tv's Instagram account.

"I want to know the names of those players and representatives of Rostov who say that my performance can cause damage, hinder the activities and development of the football club, as well as affect the performance of its players", Basta wrote in response to the criticism.
"Rostov-Arena" is one of the stadiums of the 2018 World Cup.
It was a five-match tournament.

"I couldn't even hold a spoon"
Wakhtang Kikabiдзе on the fight against cancer
Now, many artists are telling us about how they managed to cope with cancer.
Unfortunately, the disease is not a thing of the past, and popular stories of cancer victories give hope to many patients.
The famous actor, Vahtang Kikabiдзе, admitted that he was alive only because of his wife.
Years ago, he was diagnosed with a terrible condition that sounded like a sentence.
"I felt like I was hit in the head with a hammer.
I fell down.
I lost my focus.
They put him in the hospital.
He couldn't hold a spoon, he couldn't stand, he fell all the time.
We started testing, it turned out bad, the arteries don't get blood.
They brought me to Moscow, they said I had a big, rotten cyst in my head, they had an emergency surgery.
And during the operation, doctors saw a tumor behind the cyst", - said Kikabiдзе in the program "Once".
The tumor turned out to be malignant.
37 years ago, the people of Tbilisi even came to say goodbye to the idol on the doorstep of his house.
But the actor's wife wouldn't let him be buried alive, she believed she could cope with the disease and stayed in bed for more than a year.
If it wasn't for Irina, I wouldn't be alive right now.
Whenever I had a critical situation, she was there like a rock", he admitted.
The actor has managed to cope with the disease, now he lives happily in his home in the center of Tbilisi.
And from time to time, he denies the rumors of his illness and his untimely death that have been circulating on the Internet.
The creators of the "Moratворец" website have included Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Cijartó in the "Purgatory" section.
The reason was "a temptation to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine".
In addition, the foreign minister of the neighboring country was charged with "direct threats of invasion of Ukraine" and "supporting separatist sentiments in Ukraine", as well as participation in "organizing a provocation aimed at mass violation of Ukrainian legislation by Ukrainian citizens".
Note that before Siyarto in the "Purgatory" were caught the governor of the Kiev-Pecher Lavra Paul and the prefect of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchs) Onufry.
The reason was their opposition to the receipt of Tomos by the Ukrainian local church.
Earlier, commenting on the issuance of Hungarian passports to Ukrainian citizens in the Transcarpathian region, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko demanded respect for Ukraine's sovereign rights.
The authorities have named the amount of the "golden parachute" of the Voronezh deputy governor
The one-time payment of 23 salaries to the deputy governor of Voronezh region Yuri Agibalov was made on the basis of the regional law "On state positions".
The actual amount of the "golden parachute" of the ex-officio official was several times less than the amount reported in the media.
This was explained by the regional government's press service.
According to the law, the salary for the position of Agibalov is 11 189 rubles.
Thus, the press service emphasized, the amount of the one-time payment was 223,892 rubles after deduction of income tax, not 1 million rubles, which the media wrote about.
The official was receiving an old-age pension from July 2018.
His experience in public office is more than nine years.
He will be appointed to this pension and a one-time payment immediately after his dismissal from office, the RIA Novosti agency in the government of the region explained.
At the same time, the payment of the pension to Agibalov was suspended when he was appointed to the state job, and the amount of his salary did not change compared to the previous period.
The governor-general of the region Alexander Gusev, who won the election, took office on September 15.
Agibalov was released from his post due to the expiration of the term of office of the acting head of the region.
Similarly, other officials who held public positions in the region ended their mandates.
On September 29, the Telegram-channel "Nezygar" published documents that suggested that Agibalov, who had left the post of vice-governor, was paid a leave of absence allowance of 23 salaries, and two days later he again received the same position without the pronoun "vryo".
State Duma deputy called to tell schoolchildren about the harm of masturbation
Onishchenko is the first vice chairman of the Education and Science Committee.
Based on his experience, he noted in an interview that teenagers are being provoked to masturbate by the harmful information they find on the Internet.
The education institutions and the family are the ones who need to fight this, the deputy added.
Gennady Onishchenko, a deputy of the Russian State Duma (in an interview with the radio station "Moscow speaks":
In general child sexual education, this needs to be done by explaining the harm, because there is a certain risk to the sexual health of both boys and girls.
The problem is objective, it's that the children mature early enough, and then there are big scissors between their sexual maturity and their ability to formally enter intersex contact.
According to Onishchenko, "the lack of dignity", "the problems of sexual age" and the lack of a culture of adequate child education are hindering the solution of the problem.
The doctor is sure that many teenagers experience onism.
The deputy believes that teaching the lesson about the harm of onanism is best done in schools in "hyper-urbanised" regions.
"If we start this conversation in our Muslim republic, we will not be understood, to put it mildly", the professor said.
Gennady Onishchenko is an academician of the Russian Academy of Sciences, a member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, a doctor of medical sciences, a professor.
An award-winning doctor of Russia and Kyrgyzstan, member of the Presidium of the All-Russian Public Organization "Nation Health League".

ADG is the second most popular in Germany
The anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany is hitting another record, and Angela Merkel's ratings are falling.
It seems that the people of Germany are getting tired of Angela Merkel's immigration policies, which have made the country a desirable destination for millions of refugees from the Middle East.
The latest social surveys show that the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany party is growing in popularity and that Merkel and Zeehofer are weakening their positions.
This week, the ADG broke another record, climbing to second place in the popular sympathy rankings.
The right-wing conservatives, with 17 percent of the popularity, managed to bypass the Social Democrats, who have about 16 percent.
The one-percent gap can be attributed to statistical error, but it is also worth noting that the 2013 ADG, which was formed by a small group of eurosceptic economists, has become a major political force.
The overall lead continues to hold the ruling bloc of the HSS/HDS, which holds about 30 percent.
However, there is a trend towards losing points here - back in April, support for Angela Merkel's bloc was four percentage points higher.
The personal ranking of the German chancellor, who is head of the German government for the fourth consecutive term, is also falling.
Today, 48 percent of Germans support Angela Merkel, down 7 percent from last year.
The Social Democrats are followed by the "greens" (15%), the left (11%) and the liberals (10%).
The evolution of the Alternatives
The Alternative for Germany party was founded in September 2012 on the basis of the Alternative Choice 2013 group, which included members of the Christian Democratic Union.
The group initially opposed the government's course, but initially dealt only with economic issues, including the problems of the euro and EU cooperation.
The group opposed Germany's "sponsorship" of weak EU economies, not excluding the possibility of a return to the German mark and the country's complete exit from the European Union.
Against the background of the deepening immigration crisis, the political platform of the ADG has expanded.
In 2013, the group formed into a full-fledged party that took over the niche of eurosceptics and began to harshly criticize the government for its failure to implement immigration policies.
In the last parliamentary elections in 2017, the AdG managed to break into the Bundestag for the first time, gaining 94 parliamentary seats (out of 709).
Two alternatives to Germany will win seats in the European Parliament.
A video was posted with a journalist calling Ukrainian citizens "a nation of fools"
The host of a political talk show on Ukrainian TV, author of two books, Ostap Drozdov, admitted in a live broadcast that he considered his compatriots "a nation of fools".
They trust the TV and they don't read much.
As Drozdov noted, it is difficult to live and work in such a country.
"We've been taught to read and accept texts since childhood", the journalist said.
Local nationalists immediately criticized Drozov's words, accusing him of lack of patriotism and greed.
As previously reported, the Independent State Committee for Television and Radio Broadcasting began to fight literature that has the slightest hints of criticism of the Kiev authorities, banning the import of up to 201 editions.

Canadians built a car for the event of an apocalypse - The magazine
Anyone can buy this car.
Roshel Defence Solutions has announced that it is accepting applications for its new armored vehicle.
The armoured carrier of the Roshel Apocalypse Senator APC
The apocalypse is not just a game, movie, book publishing business.
Now the automotive industry is taking on a new niche.
So, Canadian Roshel Defence Solutions has unveiled its apocalypse armored vehicle Senator APC.
In their spare time, the engineers of this company are building armored police cars.
The Roshel Senator APC is designed for 12 passengers who are not particularly comfortable but are placed in complete safety in a fully welded armored capsule.
This bunker, or else you wouldn't call it a structure, because its level of armour is standard B7, and it's mounted on the chassis of a powerful Ford Super Duty pickup truck.
Its bottom, also armored, is capable of protecting the capsule from shelling by grenades and anti-personnel mines.
The Roshel Apopolis Armour Salon Senator APC
To prevent the passengers from being hit by an explosion from a car bomb that explodes near the car, the cabin is equipped with special cushioning chairs.
In addition, the capsule has an autonomous ventilation and fire suppression system.
For safe inspection, the Roshel Senator APC is equipped with a system of round-trip cameras with night vision, as well as a rooftop armored observation tower.
There's no weapons in the car.
Front of the Roshel Senator APC Apocalypse armored car
To prevent the weight of the armored car from affecting its mobility, the Roshel Senator APC is equipped with a 330-liter turbocharged 6.7-liter turbo diesel engine, all of which is transmitted to the four wheels of the armored vehicle via a 6-speed automatic transmission.
There's no chance of getting caught up in the apocalypse armor of Roshel Senator APC.
The Roshel Senator APC will be seen at a special exhibition in Washington, D.C., in October.
Called the time of death of the universe
The universe is still about 140 billion years old, which is ten times the age of the observable world, which is about 13.8 billion years.
The research of an international team of scientists is on display at the arXiv.org library of electronic prints and is being published in the journal Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan, reports the Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun.
To this conclusion, the researchers used the Subaru's Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) to observe about ten million galaxies.
By tracing the distribution of dark matter and dark energy, which accounts for more than 95 percent of the energy mass of the observable world, scientists, working within the framework of the standard cosmological model ΛCDM (Λ Cold Dark Matter), estimated the expansion rate of the universe, which was a little slower than previously thought.
Subaru's press release notes that observations have allowed for a detailed three-dimensional map of the distribution of matter in the universe, and the European Planck Space Telescope's data account has clarified the limitations imposed on the ΛCDM parameters.
In July, scientists modeled the possible destruction of the universe.
Three years earlier, their colleagues had presented new arguments that the observed world would cease to exist in 22 billion years as a result of the Big Bang.
Another attempt to unite the pension referendum initiators failed
The possibility of knowing the opinion of the people about pension reform is postponed indefinitely
The meeting of the federal initiative group for a referendum against raising the retirement age was held in Moscow on Saturday.
It was attended by representatives of 13 subgroups, which registered different formulas of questions (in total, the Central Election Commission registered five formulas).
They decided to ask the CEC to register a single initiative group and ask the Russians: "Are you for the age set by the legislation on pension provision as of July 1, 2018, when citizens of Russia are eligible for a retirement pension not to be increased?"
This formulation was registered by the Volga subgroup, whose representatives did not attend the meeting, but considered it the simplest and legally acceptable.
Most of the participants of the meeting were supporters of the member of "Justice Russia" Ilya Sviridov (six subgroups) and the KPRF (four subgroups).
Three independent subgroups - from Nizhny Novgorod, Voronezh and Orenburg - joined them.
Earlier, Sviridov told Vedomostam that invitations were sent to all the initiators, and the representatives of about 40 subgroups expressed their consent to come.
But for example, Marina Semenova, head of the Volga subgroup (which was supported by 15 other subgroups), told Vedomosty that she did not receive invitations and did not plan to come: "We did not understand who was a friend and who was an enemy".
Blues singer Otis Rush is dead

Zinatula Bilaletdinov: Admiral has created a lot of problems for us
Zinedine Zidane Bilyaletdinov, head coach of Ak Barsa, summed up the regular season championship match against Admiral (4:2).
"It was a tough game, a tough one.
The enemy fought well, and caused us great trouble.
I'm glad we played well today in the majority.
I told you, the clouds will come, and we'll work on it.
And that we won is also very important".
"Why did you decide to give Dan Zaripov a break in this particular series?"
"We have our own program that he works on.
That's why we made this decision", the club's press service quotes Bilyaletdinov as saying.
Elon Musk will leave the post of Tesla's chairman of the board

The businessman will retain the position of chief executive officer of the company, AFP reports, citing the data of the regulator.
Tesla will also have to pay a $20 million fine.
Earlier, the regulator filed a lawsuit against Elon Musk, which officials believed had misled Tesla investors because the businessman had allowed the company to buy all its shares at a high price of $420 a share.
In the Lok-Ahmat match, Turbin's mistakes were like a rush of plenty.
Former All-Union judge Vladimir Levitin commented on the work of referee Eugene Turbin in the 9th round match of the Russian championship "Lokomotiv" - "Ahmat" and solved the disputed episodes of the game.
- How do you assess the referee Eugene Turbin in the game "Locomotive" - "Ahmat"?
- I believe that this referee has confirmed his disadvantage to the Russian Premier League.
I'm surprised that the Spartak Dynamo's fifth-round opponents, neither Turbin himself nor the DSI executives, have drawn any serious conclusions about his low qualifications.
The result did not slow down in the ninth round: mistakes in his actions, private misses of rude tactics spilled like a horn of plenty.
For example, in the 50th minute of the train, Eder's defender Rodolfo falls with his hands in his penalty area.
Eight meters from the gate, but Turbin doesn't penalise.
How do you rate the episode with Idov, who was in the 82nd minute when it appeared the ball hit his hand?
- I believe there was a deliberate defensive play on his penalty area.
Turbin was near the scene, and he can see the episode and his first assistant on the right.
This moment was supposed to be seen by the reserve judge Sergei Karasev.
However, all three fell asleep, and the penalty was not imposed.
So the score in the match is distorted, and sports justice is violated.
It was the very case when the concept of refereeing displaced and buried the sporting spirit of the game.
- Turbin didn't dare to remove guest defender Oleg Ivanov, who broke the rules in the fight with Kryhovyak, and when the judge showed him a yellow card, he demonstrated applause.
What do you think of this episode?
Did you have to show me the second "bitter"?
Turbin and the first yellow card didn't show up for business.
The second one would be illogical.
- Oleg Ivanov said after the match about double standards of judging that some teams are penalized for violations like the episode with Idov, and some are not.
What do you think of the footballer's words?
- Well, that's what double standards mean.
There was a penalty.
He wasn't given.
So the referee doesn't give the second penalty to the opposing goal.
Here's the principle that's used.
And the second point of double standards is that the referee watches who plays.
I was playing Locomotive on Saturday and Ahmata has serious complaints about Turbin's work because the team was being bullied.
Matt Damon played the rapist judge Kavanaugh on the SNL show.
American actor Matt Damon played the U.S. Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who is accused of rape.
Damon appeared in the first episode of the new season of Saturday Night Live on NBC.
During the small sketch, the actor played Kavanaugh in the Senate hearings on charges of rape.
The U.S. Supreme Court nominee had earlier drawn attention to his emotional and detailed narrative during a conversation with Senator Amy Klobuchar.
Kavanaugh has repeatedly admitted to his love of beer, but has stated that he has never drunk to death.
Also, in an attempt to justify himself on the rape charge, Kavanagh claimed to have been a virgin during those years.
That's also where Damon beat him.
I just drank a lot and didn't think about sex at all.
I was the proudest, drunkest virgin anyone ever saw.
Everyone knows that", said the judge in the Matt Damon case.
Kavanaugh was elected U.S. Supreme Court justice.
Barbra Streisand found her cloned dogs to have strange behaviors .
American singer Barbara Streisand has stated that clones of her dead dog behave quite differently from the original pet.
"They're not alike.
In fact, [clones] look like her, but you can't clone a soul", the 76-year-old singer said.
In late 2017, Streisand ordered two clones of her 14-year-old cotton de-tulear dog named Samantha, who had to be put to sleep due to health problems.
In July 2018, it was reported that Chihuahua dogs nicknamed Miracle Milly, who were named the world's smallest dog, were cloned for the 49th time.
Experts are cloning a six-year-old animal to try to understand why it is so tiny.
The US has thought about a sea blockade of Russia because of oil and gas supplies
The United States could embark on a naval blockade of Russia to gain an edge on the global energy market.
The U.S. government is so eager to succeed in the global hydrocarbon market that it is ready to resort to the naval blockade of Russia, which remains one of the world's leading energy suppliers.
The possibility of a sea blockade was announced by the head of the US Interior Ministry, Ryan Zinke.
Contrary to world practice, the U.S. Department of the Interior does not perform police functions but civilian functions, including implementing policies in the field of natural resources.
Zinka's statement was therefore within the purview of the department he headed, although it was not without political colour.
Speaking at an industrial event in Pittsburgh, Zinka said that the U.S. Navy controls the sea routes in the Middle East region and can block them if necessary.
Zinka said the need could be linked to Washington's desire to prevent Russian supplies to the global energy market.
Zinka recalled that Russia still receives a lion's share of its revenues from supplies to the global oil and gas market.
Zinka believes that the desire to distribute energy supplies in the Middle East as well as in Eastern Europe was the main motivation for Moscow's activation in this region.
The minister made it clear that the United States still hopes to secure a leadership position in the global energy market by becoming the largest supplier of oil and gas.
To do this, Washington will have to push back Russia and Iran, and a sea blockade of trade routes is a reasonable measure, Zinke said.
Kalmytski received good reviews from the festival
Our compatriot, the actor of Gogol-Center, Yevgeny Sangadziev and his film "Harmony" ("Harmony") have been awarded a special mention by the jury of the sixth "Movement" debut festival, which took place in Omsk.
The festival's nameplate says "it's a signal for the big industrial players of the audience cinema to react immediately".
As you know, the young Kalmyc director's picture was presented in the short film program "Movement. The Beginning", which featured eight films.
The main prize in this competition program was awarded to the painting "Yana - it's Anya on the contrary" - the directorial debut of actress Yana Gladky.
The National Film Festival's focus is on young cinema, but not on the age of the filmmakers, but on their spirit, willingness and ability to take risks.
And the graduate of the P. Chongkushov and RATI-GITIS Elistine School of Arts, Evgeny Sangadziev, meets all these requirements.
He is young, talented, creative and in his work he seeks new non-standard forms of self-expression.

Supersonic passenger aircraft in Russia to be put into series production
The mass production of supersonic passenger aircraft in Russia will begin after 2030.
This was announced by the director general of the Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute named after Zhukovsky Kirill Sipalo.
According to him, the research center is working on the supersonic topic both within international consortia and in cooperation with the Ministry of Industry and Trade.
"We feel it will take us two or three years to get a technology demonstrator, and another 10-15 years to get a serial car that allows us to transport through our homeland", he added.
He said that now the Russian experts are faced with the question of how to make the technology economical and safe at the same time.
In early September, the aircraft equipment developer of PJSC "Tupolev" announced that the pre-project work on the supersonic passenger aircraft had been completed, and the aircraft was expected to be able to reach a speed of 1900 km/h at an altitude of 11 km.
This was reported by the deputy general director of the enterprise Valery Solosozobov.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko thanked Russian President Vladimir Putin for making Ukraine more European.
He told CNN about it.
He said he could only confirm the words of a Washington Post columnist that Putin's aggression against Ukraine resulted in the unification of Ukrainians.
"In 2013, the transatlantic integration of Ukraine, NATO membership was supported by 16% of Ukrainians.
Now it's more than 54%.
Who did this?
I'm not going to say.
In 2013, the European integration of Ukraine, the EU membership supported 33% of Ukrainians.
Now 74%.
Who did this?
Putin", said Poroshenko.
So thank you, Mr. Putin, for making my country much more European and much more willing to defend European values and transatlantic values.
And we are absolutely sure that we will not return to the Russian Empire", the President of Ukraine stressed.
As the FACTS reported, in late September 2018, President Petro Poroshenko was in the United States and attended the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly.
He also visited the grave of a great friend of Ukraine, U.S. Senator (1987-2018) John McCain.

There's a club in Russia I'm following.
Former captain of Chelsea and England's national team John Terry - why he attended the match of the ninth round of the Russian championship "Spartak" - "Rostov" (0:1).
"I have a club in Russia that I follow.
I've been watching him quite recently and I was curious to see him from the outside.
I can't say I'm a fan, as my heart belongs to Chelsea, but I have a sympathy for Spartacus and I want to apologize again for the decision", Terry quotes Chelsea fans' website.
Recall that "Rostov" with 18 points rose to third place in the tournament table, and "Spartak" placed in fifth place, having 15 points in the asset.
In the next round, the red-and-white will play "Yenis" on the road on October 7, and the Valery Karpin team will take on "Orenburg" a day earlier.
They sold the violin for a price .
When a man brought a violin to the LBC Boutique and Loan in Somerville, Massachusetts, a lobbyist offered only $50 for an old, unrepresentative instrument.
But the experienced store manager, Dylan McDermitt, suspected that it was an old and expensive tool, and he consulted an expert.
It turns out that the violin was made in 1759 by the famous Italian violinist Fernando Galliano and is valued at $250,000.
One violin is valued at $16,180,000.
The investigation revealed that the violin had recently been stolen from a resident of the town, and the instrument was returned to its rightful owner.
It's not clear how the violin got to the man who knocked it down, but there's no record of any previous lawsuits.
The manager says that now all those who bring a violin to the lobby will be asked to play it to make sure it really belongs to the client.
In the ninth round of the RPL, we are facing an exciting match: "Spartak" will host "Rostov" at its stadium in Tushin under the leadership of Valery Karpin - a man, as is known, not at all a stranger to the "people's team".
The match is particularly exciting because the clubs now have the same number of points - 15 points, and they share 3rd and 4th places in the tournament table, falling behind the far-left Zenit and being one point behind Krasnodar, who will play Dynamo tomorrow.
The red-and-white have a tough streak: the club is once again surrounded by idiotic scandals, in the Europa League, Massimo Carrera's team unexpectedly attracted Rapid, and recently gave up the home of Ahmat.
After a fair draw with CSKA, Spartacus won the Black Sea Cup with a minimal score, and it is too early to say whether the most popular club in Russia is close to emerging from the crisis.
Rostov has not won three matches in a row, but it has not lost five matches.
Let's see if Carpin can extend his undefeated streak with a game that's so important to him.
The previous meeting of the Karpin "Rostov" with the "Spartak" ended in favor of the capital team.
It starts at 7:00.
Indonesia is shaken by aftershocks after a powerful tsunami
In Indonesia, where a few days ago there was an earthquake that triggered a three-meter tsunami, meteorologists are observing more than 170 aftershocks.
The magnitude was 7.4, mainly affecting Sulawesi Island, reports Russia 24 television.
The death toll was more than 420 and more than five hundred were injured.
The authorities warned the population of the tsunami threat in advance, but later cancelled it.
The thing is, the instruments didn't detect the wave approaching.
The fate of dozens of residents who were preparing to celebrate a national holiday in one of the coastal towns of Palú, which was most damaged by the disaster, is still unknown.
London has been blamed for Moscow .
Russia is trying to rewrite the results of the Cold War, said British Defense Minister Gavin Williamson.
But England will defend its values, he stressed during a speech at the ruling Conservative Party convention in Birmingham.
The threat is growing, Iran and North Korea are becoming more dangerous, the enemies are operating in gray areas with cyber attacks and fake news, the minister added.
But the largest of these is Russia, which is increasing its military presence in Ukraine and the Arctic region.
Such statements by Western politicians have been repeatedly denied by Moscow, reports TASS.
At the same time, British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said that Russia would have to pay a high price if it did not abide by international rules and use chemical weapons.
Hunt mentioned the story of the poisoning in the English city of Salisbury in March of this year of former GRU colonel Sergei Skripal, convicted of spying for Britain, and his daughter Julia.
The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is holding a referendum on EU and NATO membership, subject to a change in the country's name.
The referendum is designed to resolve a 27-year dispute with neighboring Greece over the country's name, which coincides with the name of the neighboring Greek province.
One of the first to vote was Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, a staunch supporter of renaming the republic to North Macedonia.
The preparations for the referendum and today's vote are being monitored by international organizations.
The head of the Observatory Mission of the Bureau of Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, Jan Petersen, told Euronews how the observers are organized:
About 100 teams have traveled across the country to observe the entire process today, from the opening of the polling stations to their closure, then counting the votes and drawing up the protocols.
For a month, 10 of our teams worked in the country, monitoring the preparation for voting, the work of the media, compliance with the election campaign finance law and the referendum.
Fay Dulgerie: "About 500 foreign observers are closely monitoring the vote.
Observer groups record in detail what is happening and communicate with the members of the election commissions to then report it in the final report".
The translator compared the mentality of the Russians and the Germans
The mentality of the Russian and German peoples is different, but the few differences between them do not play a big role in mutual understanding.
This was reported by professional translator-synchronist, Barbel Saxé, on September 30, International Translator's Day.
She has been translating from Russian and English for over 30 years.
"Germans like to plan things calmly, and Russians, as the saying goes, "have a long way to go, but they're fast".
But I think that for the mutual understanding between the peoples and for the work of the translator, this does not play a significant role", the expert told RIA Novosti.
According to the translator, to understand that two countries cannot do without each other, "it is enough to know history".
And in the future, Saxé said, there's no point in Germany ignoring Russia.
Russia is a natural part of Europe, there's no point in trying to ignore it.
We need Russian gas, oil, there are many things that determine our common destiny", she said.
The day before, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said that the country was trying to "bind up" and maintain relations with Russia.
According to her, the project of the "North stream-2" gas pipeline, which is being built from the Russian coast to Germany along the bottom of the Baltic Sea, is particularly important for Berlin's mania.

Putin appointed new head of the president's foreign policy office
Vladimir Putin has released Alexander Manjosin from his position as head of the president's foreign policy office.
Igor Neverov was appointed to this post.
Mr. Manjosin has been running the president's foreign policy office since 2004.
As one of the reasons for his departure, a source close to the Kremlin, "Ъ", called personal circumstances, noting that there were no significant complaints to the head of management about the quality of work.
Igor Neverov was previously head of the Second European Department of Foreign Affairs.
In 2009-2014, he was the Russian ambassador to Sweden.
Russians donated a ruble to a low-wage MP
In Yekaterinburg, the charity "Man" fund has raised funds for the state Duma deputy Vera Ghani, who complained about low wages.
You can track the campaign on the organization's website.
"The Human Foundation expresses hope that we can save the servant of the people.
We ask all indifferent people to give us a chance to live and have a happy future!
All the money raised will be handed over to the poor person.
God save you!" - says the foundation.
The charity wants to raise 380 thousand rubles for the deputy, which is equal to a month's salary.
Reports of the assistance are published on the fund's "VKontakte" page, where the organizers post screenshots of the money transfers.
The most frequent donations are one ruble and 50 cents.
At the time of publication, the Russians donated 1633 rubles to Vera Ganza.
The collection was opened on September 28 after Ghani complained of low income.
According to her, the average salary of a deputy is 380 thousand rubles, of which nothing remains, so you have to spend money from a credit card.
Ganja insisted that the parliamentarians were not compensated for representative expenses.
After that, the State Duma said it would consider paying representative expenses to deputies.
The Golden Shrub of the San Sebastian Festival received the film "Between the Two Seas"
Spanish director Isaaki Lakuesta's "Between the Two Seas" (Entre dos aguas) is the best film at the 66th San Sebastian International Film Festival.
The ribbon was awarded the festival's main prize - "Golden Shrub".
Norwegian actress Pia Tielta won the Silver Shrub Award for Best Actress for her film Blind Spot.
The best actor was named Argentinian Dario Grandinetti for the film "Rojo".
The same film's director, Benjamin Naisthat, was awarded the title of best director.
The comedy "Evening School" has been a box office hit in America.
The comedy "Evening School", which debuted in American theaters last Friday, earned $28 million in its first weekend.
This resulted in an uncomplicated film starring Kevin Hart and Tiffany Haddish to top the US box office on September 28-30.
The film, which has so far been released in only 20 countries, has grossed $5.5 million worldwide, including $2 million from British audiences.
In the fight for the first line, Malcolm Lee's work, which is remarkable, quite noticeably outpaced another Western rental novelty - the Smolfoot cartoon, the curious story of a charming yeti meeting a representative of the human race, whose existence the main character never believed.
The project, directed by Carrie Kirkpatrick and Jason Reisig, raised $23 million in its opening weekend, generally meeting the expectations of experts who predicted the film would make $20-25 million a weekend.
As for Smolfot's total revenue, it is currently $38.6 million (with its debut in 50 countries): the most active was Mexico, which added $3.6 million to the film's budget.
The three strongest this time were the children's story "The Secret of the House with a Clock" by horror master Eli Roth, which finally proved that the director can make a quality film for a 12+ audience.
In its second week at the box office, the John Bellairs film adaptation of the charming Jack Black and Kate Blanchett grossed $12.5 million, bringing total worldwide gross to $53.8 million.
Despite the top-3 exit, the "+" thriller with Blake Lively and Anna Kendrick "Simple Request" continues to surprise: in 17 days in the American auction, Paul Fig's painting, which initially didn't expect any unrealistic financial accomplishments from the word "all", has raised $43 million (including $6.6 million for October 28-30) and currently has as much as $62.9 million in total revenue.
The last top five this week was the horror "Cursed Monk", which raised $5.4 million in the reporting period.
Spin-off "The Curse" has a total of $330 million in theaters in the U.S. and has been the most successful film in the franchise since recently, including two parts of "The Curse" and two tapes about the creepy Annabelle doll.
Just behind the horror of Corinne Hardy, following the weekend's results, was another star of the genre, the Hallfest debutant, one of the top young horror stars of the year.
In its first weekend, the famous montage (and recent director) Gregory Plotkin, who had previously worked on a number of major horror projects, including Happy Death Day, which Hallfest is very similar to, earned $5.1 million in the United States.
Given the modest budget of the film, the result is extremely positive.
The seventh-place finish was "Madly Rich Asians" ($4.15 million), which seems unlikely to drop out of the top 10 of the US box office: the romantic comedy, which has been on the screen for seven weeks, is the sixth highest-grossing film of all time with a score of 165.7 million.
That 's the amount the picture has earned on the domestic market - the total revenue of the tape is 218,8 million .
As for the last three lucky ones in the top 10 for the U.S. on September 28-30, they're Predator, White Boy Rick and...
And we'll add that next weekend, the long-awaited "Vena" will be assembled in the United States with Tom Hardy, who, no doubt, will lead the box office in the United States without any problems by the end of the first weekend of October.
Among the other premieres of next week, the musical melodrama "A Star Is Born", the winner of the Venice Film Festival by Bradley Cooper, and the crime drama "Your Hate" are all worth mentioning.

But I'm still going to take the fall.
Because they must have missed something in the preparation.
It was a different team than last game".
"This is disgusting cowardice"
Viewers are outraged by Agustin's choice for the show "The Voice"
Viewers of the "Voice 60+" show accuse their mentor, Leonid Agutin, of "unformed cowardice and a cowardly subterfuge".
When he first heard his father's voice, Nikolai Agutin, in the blind auditions, many hoped that he would remain neutral and not turn to the performer.
But his feelings prevailed, and he chose a relative to join his team.
Many people thought it was a joke, but they forgave the coach for being unobjective in the first round.
But the joke was long overdue, and the star's father unjustly took the place of more worthy performers.
And now the audience is not ready to forgive Agustin for such injustice.
Yesterday, we, the audience, were outraged by the outrageous and frank dragging of our close relatives to the final stairs.
I even doubted that Agutin would have the strength and conscience to keep her dad from getting to the top", said Irina Petrovskaya and Xenia Larina in the TV show Man.
Meanwhile, for his father's sake, Leonid Agutin "sold" great performers who actually sang, while Nikolai Petrovich whispered a touching song about his mother, explaining it by what the audience would like to see in his father's show.
But it turns out that's not the case, the audience wants an objective evaluation and to see really talented performers in the final, and now Agutin has discredited the show.
"I sympathize with the members of the Voice of Agustin team - they were doomed".
"Last time Agustin showed how much he loved Dad, and today he was supposed to show himself a professional".
"The contest has lost its meaning".
"To remove two talented people from the project and leave their father in the project who doesn't sing and whispers, how can you call a mentor after that?"
"He likes how dad sings, so give him a concert in the Kremlin for your money and see how many people come to this concert".
This is the Voice show, not the Cool Relatives show.
"It was unprofessional on Agustin's part".
"Then you'll have to offer to do your own show to your dad, not a show that's being paid for by Channel 1".
"It was a real chance for someone, and he took someone's place.
And I don't understand why a voiceless dad should be more mindful of me than any other participant with real vocal data.
Why did the worker from Surgut with his great voice and pace get mixed up and Father Agutin got to the finish?
And then we all complain about the same faces on stage and screen for decades!
"Because you can't get through the hoax!"
"What were you waiting for?
This is Russia!
A circle of swamps and a circle of bumblebees.
And the family budget will be fine!
The absurdity of the theater continues!"
Users also recalled that in one of the seasons of the traditional "Voice" on blind auditions came the son of the Gradsky.
Then it never occurred to me to take my son on my own team.
He said, "Come on, get out of here, it's all clear".
Agustin couldn't make it as a pro.

In Russia will begin to fine for violations in the field of share construction
From tomorrow in Russia will begin to fine for violations in the field of share construction, reports the channel "Russia 24".
The company and the officials are facing penalties if they do not submit the data on the building to the Unified Housing Information System in time.
The innovation will be a boon to those who have decided to buy a new apartment but are afraid of bankruptcy.
This was discussed at a conference in St. Petersburg for representatives of the construction industry.
Because of the amendments to the building stock law, developers will have to borrow from a bank.
And many experts have already talked about the potential high price of apartments.
But as it turns out, not everyone agrees.

The scientist told about the possible scientific program of the Russian moon expedition
Head of the Institute of Space Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences, member-correspondent Anatoly Petruковиch told RIA Novosti about a possible program of scientific research for Russian astronauts on the Moon.
He said the scientific community is working on the directions of such work.
"There is no consolidated opinion yet", the scientist stressed.
He noted that one option was to place a low-frequency radio telescope on the far side of the moon, which would avoid interference from the Earth.
"This is the only place where such a telescope can be deployed to study space radiation sources", Petrukovich added.
He also believes the moon could be used to test robotics, use local resources for construction.
In addition, astronauts should be drawn to the search for primitive organic matter on Earth's satellite, the scientist says.
It could help determine how life arises on the planets.
Earlier, the head of Roscosmos said that in an optimistic version, Russia could make a manned flight to the moon by 2030.
Offended customer dumped a basket of feces at 7-Eleven .
Damian Simms, a 41-year-old resident of St. Petersburg, Florida, was "toothless" at the manager of a 24-hour 7-Eleven store when he fired him for inappropriate behavior in May.
And he decided to take revenge on his enemy in an original way.
At midnight, he went into the store and threw the contents of the basket on the floor and on the shelf.
The basket contained feces and urine that Simms "borrowed" from a nearby mobile toilet.
The police who arrived at the scene arrested the avenger.
He was put in jail and released on a $300 bail.
He was charged with trespassing and criminal trespassing, and was barred from entering the store and approaching the manager.
Although Simms's crime may seem more ridiculous than serious, the verdict may be quite harsh, as he has already repeatedly broken the law: he has committed grand theft, robbery, illegal possession of a weapon, driving while intoxicated, and animal cruelty.

The most formidable enemy submarine for the US Navy will be the Russian submarine "Kazan" of the project "Yasen-M", writes The National Interest.
The submarine was launched in March 2017, but the Navy will receive it in 2019.
According to the publication, even the predecessor of the "Kazan" submarine "Severodvinsk" received high evaluation from the American military.
We're facing a tough potential opponent.
Just look at the North Wind", said Rear Admiral Dave Johnson.
The paper also notes that the United States maintains an advantage over Russia in this sector.
The multi-purpose nuclear submarines "Kazan", "Novosibirsk", "Krasnoyarsk" and "Arhangelsk" are being built under the improved project "Yasen-M" (885M).
They have a displacement of 13 800 tons, a dive depth of 520 m, a crew of 64 people, autonomy of 100 days, and a speed of 31 knots.
The submarines are armed with mines, 533 mm torpedoes, and the "Onix" and "Calibr" cruise missiles.
In August, the U.S. Sixth Fleet said that the U.S. submarine force remains "the most powerful and fearful on the planet".
German politicians ignored opening the mosque because of Erdogan
The Prime Minister of the federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia, Armin Laschet, and the mayor of Kellen Henrietta Recker, ignored the opening ceremony of the new city mosque.
This is what Deutsche Welle is saying.
The event was attended by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Lashet met with Erdogan at the airport in Cologne, but declined to go to the mosque, explaining that the event could turn into a "highly politicized event".
Recker said she received an informal invitation on the eve of the opening, Friday, September 28.
According to her spokesman, such a proposal should be considered too late and too unimportant.
Speaking in the square in front of the mosque, Erdogan summed up his two-day visit to Germany.
The president called them successful, and he said he met with German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and Chancellor Angela Merkel, with whom he discussed, among other things, the fight against racism and Islamophobia.
The new mosque in Cologne has become one of the largest in Europe, and can accommodate about 1,1 thousand believers at the same time.
The construction cost 30 million euros, financed by the Turkish side.
You can become a water skier, a speleologist or a mountaineer in Ivanov.
The training will be conducted by the Salvatore youth club in the regional centre.
However, the club's activities are not limited to these three interesting professions - the participants of numerous courses and seminars will also be able to learn sailing, disaster medicine, parachute training and basic psychology.
Moreover, the students learn not only theoretical knowledge, but also practical learning.

The teeth are out.
I played a good game with the Special Forces, dropping two saves.
You can see the boys have a lot of psychological burdens.
They're in a hurry to finish the attack, so they're not gonna make it.
After that time, you have to move on.

- You know, I really enjoyed the game.
Emotional, nothing too much as we asked.
He climbed the gate and created moments like in the episode with Vitali Kravcov, when he didn't score in the empty gates.

I think we'll get him to play games later.

This was announced by the US Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke.

Zinka also noted that a similar situation exists with Iran.
The minister said there are two options for the solution: military and economic.
He would prefer not to use it first, so we need to put pressure on and displace Iran's energy resources.

I couldn't do anything, and it hurt so much.
Sergei Sirotikin: There was nothing I could do, and it was very painful.
Russian Williams pilot Sergei Sirotikin commented on the results of the Russian Grand Prix.
"I don't really want to talk about what's in my head.
I got off to a good start, and in the second turn, I was caught between two cars that hit me right away.
I lost all the positions I got in the starting lineup, right now.
Turned out to be in a very bad position.
Trapped in traffic.
We were hoping that after the rest of us hit the pit stop, we'd get into the "clean air" and get the pace back, but the rubber was gone.
Plus, he fought his partner, and he had contact with him.
I understand he's a little off.
We were in this situation on the most impassioned track of the season, and there was nothing I could do, and it was really painful, to be honest.
I don't want to talk about it anymore", RIA Novosti quotes Orotkin as saying.
We will remind you that Sirotkin finished 18th in the race at the Russian Grand Prix, the winner was British Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton.
Tarpishov called it absurd to remove Glushakov and Yashchenko from the base of "Spartak"
Russian Tennis Federation (RTF) President Shamil Tarpichev commented on the removal of Moscow "Spartak" footballers Denis Glushakov and Andrei Yeshchenko from training with the main lineup after a criticism of the team's head coach Massimo Carrera, reports "Sport weekend".
Carrera's actions were absolutely absurd.
It's not a worldly fool to pay attention to such things.
I don't agree with Carrera's actions at all.
It only makes the team more fragile.
First, they're poems, you can read and understand them any way you want.
I wouldn't have reacted to that if I were Carrera.
Everyone has their own opinion.
Second, everybody wants to be buried.
If Gushakov and Yashchenko are playing like, it doesn't mean they have something against the coach.
I think the Italian lacks the flexibility to handle the situation.
And that doesn't serve the normal team climate.
Spartacus doesn't have a game today, so there's no need to blow this situation up.
Maybe we should have laughed at it together.
Spartak has a lot of things wrong with the lineup, and there's a lot of uncertainty after being inducted into the youth team.
The team's relationship does not seem to add optimism before this match", Tarpichev said.
The two teams will play on September 30 and start at 19:00 Moscow time.
Earlier, John Terry, who turned down the Spartans, was the head coach of Chelsea's youth team.
Sirius students discussed with scientists about natural technologies
Students of the Sirius educational center in Sochi, participants of the School of Agrobyology and Plant Genetics, attended a lecture by scientists of the national research center "Kurchatovsky Institute".
The researchers' speech was held as part of the Global International Forum of Convergent and Nature-like Technologies, organized in Sochi on the orders of Russian President Vladimir Putin, the educational center's website reports on September 29.
The lecture was opened by the documentary film "Kurchatov's Codes", during which the president of the Kurchatov Institute, member-correspondent of the Russian Academy of Sciences Mikhail Kovalchuk spoke about global challenges as a driving force of civilization development.
The lecture is published on the website of Sirius.
Students learned that modern technology requires a tremendous amount of energy.
Alternative energy is not yet capable of producing such a volume.
According to the organizers of the forum, the natural technologies that young scientists are working on today will help solve this problem.
In addition, Kovalchuk raised the issue of responsibility for the development of natural technologies, and also spoke about the risks that inevitably arise when creating such technologies.
"The advent of this kind of technology is a unique thing, a tremendous blessing.
It's the explosive growth of medical technology, it's the improvement of quality of life and infrastructure.
But there's a second side.
The development of nature-like technologies is actually a technological reproduction of living nature systems.
There's a twist, a deliberate interference in human life.
There's always a risk.
A car came along, people were dying under the wheels.
But they still use cars.
The dual nature of technology at once.
I'm creating new medical technology, and I can create weapons of mass destruction", REN TV quoted the scientist as saying.
After viewing the film and discussing the latest scientific breakthroughs, students were able to ask questions to the participants.
The candidate of physical and mathematical sciences, the head of the Kurchatov complex of NBIX-natural technologies of the NIC "Kurchatov Institute" Yulia Dyakov and the head of the Kurchatov complex of NBIX-technologies Вячеслав Demin were the speakers.
The Sirius educational center in Sochi was established by the "Talent and Success" educational foundation on the basis of the Olympic infrastructure on the initiative of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
The purpose of the educational center is to identify, develop and further support gifted children.
Earlier in September, it was reported that the winners of the all-Russian online Olympiad on information security "Cybercall" will be sent to Syrius for training.
Air traffic controller saved a plane with passengers during an earthquake in Indonesia
In Indonesia, they say goodbye to air traffic controller António Gunawan Agung, who saved hundreds of Batik Air passengers at the cost of their lives.

When the magnitude of the oscillation reached 7.4, the tower began to collapse.
The 21-year-old conductor had to jump four floors.
He suffered severe injuries to his internal organs in the fall, and doctors were unable to rescue him.
Russian submarine "Kazan" frightened the United States
The biggest threat to the US Navy is the Russian submarine "Kazan".
This was announced by US Rear Admiral Dave Johnson, reports Rosbalt, citing The National Interest.

Just look at "Severodvinsk", he said, pointing to the model-precursor of "Kazan".

Macedonia: referendum not held due to low attendance
The referendum was called to approve the agreement between the authorities in Athens and Skopje on renaming the Balkan country to "Northern Macedonia".
Greece objected to the Macedonians using the name of their historic province.
The renaming promised the former Yugoslav republic the opening of the way to NATO and later to the EU.
But, as the E.F.E. agency reports, only 34 percent of Sunday's public hearings "did not reach" the 50 percent constitutional threshold.
However, since the referendum was only of a consultative nature, the authorities in Skopje may decide not to refuse the renaming.
Speaking shortly after the closure of the polling stations, Macedonia's prime minister Zoran Zaev, a supporter of changing the name of the republic, said that if more "yes" were to be cast, Macedonia would change the name, despite the unreached quorum.

Kemerovchan has upset the herd of sheep at the cemetery
On September 30, a witness posted a message on Kemerovsky's social media page that horned animals were roaming around one of the local cemeteries.
The animals were a considerable herd, passing through the fences and spitting out grass.
Some local residents said that there was no harm in having a small-horned cattle in the cemetery, and that their appetite could even help cleanse the area of weeds and weeds, but some residents did not like the animals' behavior:
"These are graves, not pasture.
No work for the sheep.
Of course, you can't say that sheep are blasphemous, but it's not the case".
Either way, one of the witnesses noted that the animal-like problem in the cemetery is already known, and the necessary measures will be taken soon.
How do you push and pull?
There's no such thing as a "push".
It's the right thing to do.
The word "pressure" in the sense of "to pull, to influence, to influence" exists only phonetically because we hear the sound of [a] instead of [o] in the word "to prolong".
We use that word, assuming it's derived from the word "pressure".
But "pressure" and "longing" are not only etymologically close, but they're actually in a way opposite.
You can see for yourself.
To get (church-book, obsolete) means "to be enough, to be enough, to be enough for someone or something, to satisfy".
Pleasure, pleasure are related words.
It used to mean "depending on nothing, having self-control" - "being self-sufficient".
Old Slavic "dull" is related to the words "command" and "will".
Pushing, pushing, pushing, pushing, pushing, pushing, pushing, pushing, pushing, pushing, pushing, pushing, pushing, pushing, pushing, pushing, pushing, pushing, pushing, pushing, pushing, pushing, pushing, pushing, pushing, pushing, pushing, pushing, pushing, pushing, pushing, pushing, pushing, pushing, pushing, pushing, pushing, pushing, pushing, pushing, pushing, pushing, pushing, pushing, pushing, pushing, pushing, pushing, pushing, pushing, pushing, pushing, pushing, pushing, pushing, pushing, pushing, pushing, pushing, pushing, pushing, pushing, pushing, pushing, pushing, and pushing are all different things to you know.
These words have truly frightening "relatives": daos - "wolf" (sheep that squeezes), deyja - "die" and dvaidī - "pressure".
The similar phonetic appearance of the words "pressure" and "longing", as well as the inevitable obsolescence of the latter, caused them to become contaminated.
So we have this very "d[a]влеть", which is used in letters by "a", which, in a good way, is wrong and impossible in terms of the processes of the origin and development of these words.
So, it's all right to bring it in.
But it's an old word, in its proper sense, no longer used.
If you want to note that any circumstances/people are having a negative effect on you from above, use the word "push".
You can also use a pressure-setting design, but remember, this is a stationery.

Refugees and migrants should not be considered as others, and migration itself is the mother of this society.
Numerous migrant communities and anti-racism organizations have sent an open letter to the minister demanding his resignation.
Russia has been protecting itself from terrorists with the help of the operation in Syria.
During the three years of Russian military operation in Syria, about 100 thousand terrorists were killed, of which 85 thousand were destroyed by the Russian Air and Space Forces.
This was reported by the former head of the Russian Air Force, the head of the Federation Council's Committee on Defense and Security, Viktor Bondarev, in connection with the third anniversary of the start of the Russian military operation in Syria.
He noted the high accuracy of the use of airborne weapons: the air-space forces have been and continue to strike precisely at terrorist targets.
According to Bondarev, tens of thousands of terrorist facilities have been destroyed in Syria in the last three years - including ammunition depots, fortifications and headquarters.
Russian airstrikes have broken through the jihadist defences - a decisive contribution to the advancement of the Syrian government forces, reports Interfax.
At the same time, according to Bondarev, the operation of our military in Syria has allowed to protect Russia itself from terrorists, many of whom had Russian passports.
At the beginning of the operation in Syria, more than two-thirds of the territory of the Arab Republic was under the control of terrorist groups, including the Islamic State (IS, banned in Russia) and Jabhat-en-Nusra (banned in Russia).
According to the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces, about four thousand militants from the Russian population and about five thousand citizens of post-Soviet countries fought on the side of the Islamic State, TASS reports.
And it's only registered persons, excluding those who have not been identified, Bondarev said.
Most of them were trained and ready to take up arms at any time, and Russian passports gave them the right to enter our country freely.
Thus, Bondarev noted, Russia is fighting international terrorism in Syria on distant fronts - otherwise this evil would "flood to us".

Syria accused the US of supporting terrorism
Syrian Foreign Ministry chief Walid Muallem accused the US and its partners of war crimes in Syria and supporting terrorism.
The [Western] coalition completely destroyed the Syrian city of Raqqa, it destroyed infrastructure and public services in the areas it was targeting, it committed mass killings of civilians, including children and women.
These killings are war crimes under international law", he said.
Muallem said the United States and its partners were "directly supporting terrorists" because the goals of the militants and the Western coalition in Syria coincided and meant "sowing chaos, death and destruction along the way".
The Foreign Minister also noted that the fight against terrorists in Syria is almost complete, and the country has become more secure and stable.
Muallem added that Damascus also intends to clear Syria of illegal foreign presence, and priority in restoring the country will be given to Syrian partners.
In September, the head of the Russian Center for Reconciliation of the Warring Parties in the republic, Lieutenant General Vladimir Savchenko, said that two American F-15 aircraft had hit the Syrian province of Deir ez-Zor with banned phosphorus munitions.
The United States has denied all the charges.
President of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko believes that while respecting the sovereignty of other states, Ukraine has the right to demand the same respect for its own sovereignty.
The head of state made this statement during his visit to the Kharkiv region, commenting on the issuance of his passports by Hungary in Transcarpathia.
By protecting Ukrainian citizens, I am protecting the sovereignty of our state.
Just as we respect the sovereignty of other states, we demand the same respect for Ukraine", Poroshenko stressed.
According to Poroshenko, he will protect Ukrainian citizens, wherever they are - in the east or west of the country.
At the same time, the head of state supported the Foreign Ministry's position in the passport scandal with Hungary, which is intended to expel the consul of this country from the coast.
"I completely share every letter that the Foreign Ministry says", the President noted.
As reported by "FACTS", on September 19, a video appeared on the network, which recorded the moment of issuing Ukrainian citizens in the consulate of Hungary in the Hungarian coast passports.
They were also taking an oath of allegiance to Hungary.
Ukraine's foreign minister, Pavel Klimkin, said the Hungarian consul, who appears on the video handing out Ukrainians Hungarian passports, must leave Ukraine either by Budapest's decision or be expelled by Kiev.
It was also reported that the prosecutor's office of the Transcarpathian region had opened a criminal case over the issue of passports from Hungary.
The incident is classified as a "state treason".
Putin has been secretly in Siberia
It is known that Vladimir Putin spent the last two days in Dushanbe, where he took part in the work of the CIS Council of States, as well as held a number of bilateral meetings with the presidents of neighboring countries.
Flightradar's data on flights of the Russian "No. 1" aircraft shows that around 6 p.m. on 28 September, the Il-96−300 flew out of Dushanbe airport and took a course to the northeast.
The plane's transponder was turned off near Lake Balkhash.
The flight direction suggests the plane may have been heading to the Khakassia.
According to the Baikal24 news agency, the president met with the head of the region, Victor Zimin, in Abakan on the night of September 29.
According to unofficial information, Putin flew to the republic for the weekend, but sources on the website believe the real reason is "the second round problem".
The second round of regional head elections is due to take place in the region next Sunday.
It was composed of Valentin Konovalov (KPRF) and the current head of the republic, Victor Zimin ("United Russia").
However, on September 21, Zimin withdrew his candidacy.
In the upcoming tour along with Konovalov should take part in Andrei Filyagin ("Justice Russia").
The Hakanese media suggest that Putin may accept the resignation of the head of the Hakanese Republic and appoint a new acting head of the republic, as well as make a decision regarding the fate of Zimin.
Putin visited Khakassia in January of this year.
Along with Tuva, this republic is one of the president's favorite places to relax.
More than 10 million Syrians have been displaced since the beginning of the seven-year conflict.
About five million people have fled to other countries, primarily to neighboring Turkey, Lebanon, and Jordan.
Now, according to Damascus, the war is coming to an end, and the country is ready to voluntarily return the refugees.
Syria's Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem said in a speech at the UN: "The situation on the ground has become more stable and secure now thanks to the successes achieved in the fight against terrorism.
The government is continuing to rebuild the areas destroyed by terrorists, restoring them to normal life.
All conditions are in place for the voluntary return of Syrian refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic sanctions that have complicated people's lives and deprived them of livelihoods.
The Syrian authorities also called on the international community to help with the return of the refugees and to allocate funds for this.
Meanwhile, the United States and European Union countries refuse to provide aid to Syria, saying that a political solution to the conflict must first be found.
Volkswagen pleaded guilty to the diesel charge in January 2017.
In December last year, Oliver Schmidt, one of the company's American division managers, was sentenced to seven years in prison.

In February, the company said that the commitments were already met for 83 percent of the vehicles, so the program would be completed ahead of schedule.
Volkswagen is trying to make up for the loss and restore customer confidence.
For example, the company recently changed its management, and a major restructuring and fundamental changes in the management system were announced.
Moreover, Volkswagen promises to buy even new cars if German cities ban diesel on their streets, a right that the authorities obtained in February this year.

Metropolitan Hilarion compared Kiev's decision to rename the UOC with the actions of the fascists
The head of the Synodal Department of External Church Relations of the Russian Orthodox Church, Metropolitan Ilarion, compared the renaming of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate to the Russian Church in Ukraine with the actions of the fascists against Jews.
"It's like putting a yellow pointed star on a Jew in fascist Germany, it's like marking the Church as an enemy organization, and that's why this bill was created", the Metropolitan said on the broadcast of Russia-24 (interfax).
He believes that this step will have the most serious consequences right now, when the Russian-Ukrainian conflict is in an acute stage.
Kiev hopes to gain full control of the UOC and "put it outside the law", the priest believes.
"This is a Ukrainian church, and the faithful of this church consider themselves Ukrainians, they are patriots of their country", he added.
It was previously known that the deputies of the Verkhovna Rada are working on implementing the laws of No. 4128 (on changing the subordination of religious communities), No. 4511 (on the special status of religious organizations) and No. 5309 (on changing the name of religious organizations).
The latter suggests renaming the UOC of the Moscow Patriarchate.
Deputy of the Pochaevsk Lavra called for protection of Orthodoxy and Ukrainian shrines
Metropolitan Vladimir, a deputy to the Holy Uspennish Pochaev Laws, called for the defense of the Orthodox faith and Ukrainian shrines.
The text of his address to the faithful of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC) was published on the abbey's website on Saturday.
At different times in history, our forefathers and their relatives in faith and spirit had to confess their faith and defend their sanctuaries.
Given the situation, the information we have and the threats of corruption that are spreading, it is clear that we will have to survive", the Metropolitan said.
He asked for support - prayerful, moral.
The warden also stressed that "you will probably need to be physically present".
The priest added: "Lenin's grandchildren - in spirit, threatened with execution, so we will defend our sanctuary".
Whoever is not indifferent to the fate of the Pochaevsky Lavra - the Orthodox Ukrainian and World Shrine, must be ready to defend it, the appeal says.
The Metropolitan urged not to go to the wrongdoers.
The UOC has a canonical status, as defined by the 1990 Tomos of the Mother Church.
Now someone wants to depose the news patriarch and a friend of the Roman Catholic Pope, Bartholomew.
The new style with its consequences is not acceptable to us Orthodox.
And we are happy with the status of our church", the laurel's head said.
He recalled that the UOC has been canonically independent and completely independent in its management since October 1990.
There is no administrative and financial accounting for the Moscow Patriarchate.
In fact, Tomos already has our church.
What other Tomos do we need?" - Metropolitan Vladimir Pochaevsky noted, urging believers and all citizens to ask themselves if other confessions have Tomos, are they independent of the Vatican?
The believers, to some extent, figured out which temple to go to.
However, some people want to sow enmity and discord again.
Some are jealous of the dome that shines on temples they want to destroy", the priest said.
The Pochaevsk Lavra is the largest temple complex and monastery in Western Ukraine.
The Lavra is located on the top of the Pochaevsky mountain, 70 kilometers from Ternopol.
The first historical records of it date back to the beginning of the XIII century.
The capital club was evacuated after the bombing.

You stick to every word, live in a normal, ordinary family", wrote @nataliamama37.
Some people have advised Buzova to go to a psychologist or at least read books on the subject.
"Could I read psychology?
What can be done to avoid becoming a victim?" wrote @liashukgalina.

Your man will not speak loud words all over the country and then just not do them", - supported Buzova @arina_prostyle.
"You're a queen and you need a king, and the man who traded you for paper is just not worthy of you.
Keep your nose up and move on", @kreszentia_f wrote.

"The game was good, interesting, although it went to goal", Vorobyov's official website of "Automobilist" quotes.
"We tried to play it very simple.
I really liked the first period.
Missed a few good moments.
In the second period, the opponent gave us a little push, we held out.
But the removal fed us a little.
The guys were playing great, doing the coaching.
I think if we keep playing the right way, we'll win.
No goals, zero points, no wins, but the content of the game was right.
Luck will come if we keep playing in this direction".
"Do you think the Automobile has improved compared to the meeting in Nizhny Novgorod?"
"There was no foreign player then.
In the preseason, the teams were solving other problems, a lot of young guys were playing.
I think it was a completely different game, a different hockey.
The Automobile is a good, kind team.
The tournament table shows the team's playing right.
Good hockey, nice atmosphere in the arena and in the city.
All you can do is wish them luck.
The team is moving in the right direction.
There are many good players, there are leaders.
Good defense, good goalkeeper.
It was hard, we were getting ready.
We knew the team was going undefeated, we wanted to break it, but we didn't".

The data bank contains information about the executive proceedings initiated by the Kalmyk prosecutors against all debtors, - explains the assistant of the head of the Russian Federal Security Service in Kazakhstan Delgir Bodgaeva.
"When debts are incurred, the system draws information about the number and date of initiation of the executive proceedings; the name of the body that issued the executive sheet or other act; its number, amount and type of debt; the address of the court attendants' department; the F.I.O. of the court attendant-executor; the contact telephone.

US is catering to opiate production in Afghanistan
The sharp escalation of the situation in Afghanistan was widely discussed in Tehran on September 26.
There were multilateral consultations with the participation of Iran, India, China, Afghanistan and Russia, which were represented by Security Council Secretary Nikolai Patrushev.
In fact, in Afghanistan, the militants have waged a real terrorist war against the state and civilian population.
This year was a record number of bloody attacks, which killed thousands of ordinary Afghans", Patrushev noted.
The trouble in Afghanistan didn't start yesterday.
After the September 11, 2001 attacks, the terrorist group "Al-Qaeda" (banned in the Russian Federation) was declared the main enemy of the United States, based in Afghanistan.
It wasn't a month since America and its NATO allies launched Operation Unconquered Freedom.
It's been 17 years.
Thousands of American troops still on Afghan soil.
And the peaceful life is even more ghostly than it was then.
American troops are behind the fence of dozens of their bases.
They can buy the fighters for money, just so they don't get touched.
The Afghan government controls a smaller portion of the country's territory - 40 percent, Patrushev said.
50% - the Taliban movement (banned in the Russian Federation).
Another 10% is behind the ISIS terrorists (banned in Russia).
But they grow fast there.
The goal is to create a barbaric pseudo-caliphate in Central Asia, which is exactly what they failed to do in Iraq and Syria.
America seems to be fine with it.
And it's also worth noting that in the 17 years of American presence, the production of opiates in Afghanistan has increased at least 40 times.
The huge growth of opium-seeded areas and billions in profits.
The Macedonians are preparing to vote in a referendum on EU and NATO membership on the condition that the country's name is changed.
The agreement to rename the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to the Republic of North Macedonia was reached on June 17 as a result of long negotiations with neighboring Greece, which refused to recognize its northern neighbor's right to be called Macedonia, considering in this name an attempt on the same-named Greek province and Greek history.
Lyupko Petkovsky, political scientist: "Through this agreement Macedonia or North Macedonia gains the right to a better future, the hope of social change.
And Greece will have a right to its past.
There's no such thing as a perfect deal.
They are the result of difficult compromises that cannot make everyone happy".
The ruling Social Democrats, led by Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, are calling for the country's name change.
The conservative opposition and the country's president, George Ivanov, are against it.
According to journalist Tsvetin Chilymanov, Macedonia has no sense in joining the EU - it is enough to have a partnership with it: "Many of those who don't like the agreement believe that the current socialist government led by Zaev is forced from the outside to change the name of the country.
But that decision will have negative consequences.
First of all, the loss of sovereignty.
There are obviously countries that would not like Macedonia to remain one of the sovereign countries in the Balkans".
Fae Dulgerie, Euronews: "The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is facing the biggest challenge in its history.
The country is at a crossroads.
The choice made by the citizens of Macedonia will determine the future not only of the Balkans but of Europe as a whole".
