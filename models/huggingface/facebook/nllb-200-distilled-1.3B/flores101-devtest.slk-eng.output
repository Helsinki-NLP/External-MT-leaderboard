Not only does this confirm the already widely held theory that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, but it also provides details about what fossils generally could not have been, including color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say the animal's fur was brownish brown on the top, pale or carotenoid on the bottom.
The find also provides a detailed look at the evolution of birds' feathers.
Since dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed skeleton called a rachis, but do have other features of feathers - spines and rays - scientists have concluded that rachis probably evolved later than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight but rather for temperature control or courtship.
Although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the scientists say the specimen is the feathers of an adult, not the flippers of a calf.

The phenomenon the team expected would be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon exerts an attractive force on the earth, causing tides and currents, so the Milky Way exerts an attractive force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have concluded that the effect of one dark matter on another dark matter is the same as that of ordinary matter.
This theory says that most of the dark matter around the galaxy is around the galaxy in some kind of a glow and is made up of a lot of small particles.

"Their thermal behavior is not as stable as that of large caves on Earth, which often maintain a relatively constant temperature, but it is consistent with the fact that they are deep holes in the ground", said Glen Cushing of the United States Geological Survey's (USGS) astrogeology team, also at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has traditionally been low-tech, with voters going to a separate area and putting a pre-printed sheet of paper in an envelope with their candidate's name on it.
When the officials verify the identity of the voter, the voter will drop the envelope into the ballot box and sign the voter roll.
The French electoral law has a rather strict codification of procedure.
Since 1988, the ballot boxes have had to be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes inside at the start of the vote and that no envelopes are added except those bound by duly verified and counted voters.
Candidates can send representatives to witness the process, and in the evening, volunteers count the votes under strict supervision in accordance with special procedures.

The Crown Prosecution Service, which is generally responsible for prosecuting crimes, has indicated to reporters that it will not comment on the case until charges are brought, at least.
The document is said to be related to a border delimitation dispute that is claimed by Palestine based on the status of the borders before the 1967 Six-Day War.
Other topics reportedly discussed include the future state of Jerusalem, which is held sacred by both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel has a requirement for a permanent military presence in the valley for a period of ten years after signing the agreement, while Palestine agrees to maintain such a presence for only five years.
The shooters in the additional pest test were to be closely monitored by foresters as the test was monitored and its effectiveness assessed.
In a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited under the Sporting Shooters Association hunting programme.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting park director for conservation and heritage at NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received comprehensive safety and training instructions.
Martelly inaugurated a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) yesterday consisting of nine members.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in the last four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the pre-agreed resignation of the Provisional Electoral Council as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The Commission was Martelly's response to the large-scale anti-regime protests that began in October.
Sometimes violent protests have been triggered by the failure to hold elections, some since 2011.
Some 60 cases of faulty iPod overheating have been reported, resulting in a total of six fires and four minor burns.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) of Japan reported that it was aware of 27 accidents involving equipment.
Last week, the government agency METI announced that Apple had informed it of 34 additional cases of overheating that the company had labeled "minor".
The Ministry responded by calling Apple's delay in reporting "truly regrettable".
The earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 07:19 local time (on Friday at 21:19 Greenwich Mean Time).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Agency said no damage had been reported in the country.
According to the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center, there is no indication that a tsunami is coming.
A former Philippine police officer held Hong Kong tourists hostage after he abducted a bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza was shooting at tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six are confirmed dead.
Along with the Filipino photographers, six hostages, including children and elderly people, were released early.
Then the photographers took over the place of an elderly lady who needed to go to the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began his medical career.
He trained as a midwife and in 1959 began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to study premature birth in his spare time.
His research showed that administering the hormone would speed up the maturation of the fetal lungs.
Xinhua reported that government investigators found two flight recorders, the so-called black boxes, on Wednesday.
The allies also paid homage to the Moon.
Tommy Dreamer said, "The Moon was the first queen of extreme. She was my first manager. She died overnight two months ago, which was pretty original like her. She was a strong woman".
Dustin Goldust Runnels commented: "The moon was as crazy as I was... maybe even more... I love her and I'll miss her... I hope she's doing well up there".
Of the 1,400 people who took part in a poll before the 2010 federal election, the number of people who oppose Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard, during the campaign leading up to the 2010 federal election, communicated her belief that Australia should become a republic after the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of those surveyed agree that Queen Elizabeth II should be the last Australian monarch.
At the extremes of the survey, 29 percent of those polled believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent of those polled think that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was due to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and also the triple relays at the Commonwealth Games, but his complaints raised doubts about his fitness.
He couldn't take the medication he needed to overcome the pain because it's prohibited at the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a professor of mathematics and computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25.
Several people had confirmed the invention by early February using different hardware and software, with this being announced on Tuesday.
Comets could have been the source of water supplies to Earth, along with organic matter that could make proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the earth formed because comets collided with the earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called gossip "political bullshit and nonsense".
He is expected to run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says enables planes to fly shorter distances, saving millions of gallons of fuel and reducing carbon emissions each year.
It uses satellite technology, as opposed to older ground-based radar technology, which enables air traffic controllers to more accurately locate the aircraft and provide pilots with more accurate information.
There is no other mode of transport available, no overground trains stop at Wembley and no parking facilities or park-and-ride facilities.
Concerns about lack of traffic increased the likelihood that the match would have to be played behind closed doors without fans.
On Thursday, the journal Science published a study reporting the appearance of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Scientists at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden report that a new animal species has been able to evolve in just two generations, although it was believed that the process would take much longer, by crossing the endemic Darwinite Geospiza fortes with the migratory cactus Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into many different shapes, such as rolled into tiny shapes.
It can be stretched into a thin wire that can be spun and twisted, and it can be beat and twisted into boards.
It can be made very thin and can be glued to another metal, and it can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate handmade pictures in books called illuminated manuscripts.
It's called a pH chemical, and the indicator can be made using red cabbage juice.
The color of cabbage juice varies according to the acidity or alkalinity of the chemical.
The pH level is determined by the number of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have been stripped of electrons (because hydrogen atoms are made up of one proton and one electron).
Mix two dry tablets together and then make a ball of them with clean wet hands.
The moisture in your hands will start to react with the outer layers, causing a strange sensation and creating a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flush toilets in almost every home connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of a sewage system have been found in houses in the Greek Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini.
In ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, toilets were common, and in Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women lived together in mixed society.
You use satellite to talk to someone who's thousands of miles away.
A satellite in space receives a call, which is then reflected back down to Earth almost immediately.
Scientists in space use telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and visual field.
To launch a satellite or telescope into space, you need a giant rocket, over 100 feet [30 m] high.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways, and the most important thing that the wheel has brought us is much easier and faster transportation.
This has resulted in trains, automobiles, and many other forms of transportation.
Below them are other medium-sized feline predators that feed on medium-sized prey  from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free-roaming domestic cats) that eat much larger numbers of small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of niche, specific areas or tasks that each of the beasts has to handle, which prevents competition from each other.
Lions are the most social of feline predators, living in large groups called packs.
The flock consists of one to three adult male relatives and up to thirty females and young.
Females are usually closely related to each other, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion packs behave similarly to wolf packs or dogs, which behave in a surprisingly similar way to lions (but not to other feline predators).
A well-trained athlete, a tiger can climb (though not well), swim, jump long distances, and pull five times as hard as a powerful man.
The tiger is in the same group as lions, leopards, and jaguars, and these four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of a tiger is not like that of a lion with a mighty voice, but rather a few hoarse shouted words.
The ocelots enjoy eating small animals, occasionally catching monkeys, snakes, rodents, or birds, but the vast majority of the animals they hunt are much smaller.
Scientists believe that ocelots track down and find animals that can be eaten (grain) by the smell and smell of the places they have been.
They are very good at seeing in the dark with their night vision and are also very stealthy, and they hunt their prey by blending in with the environment and then jumping on it.
When a small group of animals (a small population) breaks away from the main population from which they came (as when they move across a mountain or a river, or when they move to a new island so that they cannot easily return), they often find themselves in an environment that is different from their original one.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a strong competitor than what they needed before.
The original population hasn't changed at all, still needing the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it begins to look less and less like members of other populations.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, these two populations will look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
This process is called speciation, which simply means the development of new species.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe in and take in carbon dioxide that humans exhale (i.e., exhale).
Plants make food from the sun by photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We use plants to build our homes, we use them to make clothes, most of what we consume comes from plants, and animals couldn't survive without plants.
Mosasaurus was the tallest predator of its time, so he was afraid of nothing but other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were set with over 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an extra set of climates, which meant there was no escape for anything that crossed its path.
We don't know for sure, but he may have had a fork-shaped tongue, and he may have fed on turtles, big fish, other mosasaurs, and he may even have been a cannibal.
It also thought of everything that went into the water, even a giant dinosaur like Tyrannosaurus rex couldn't match it.
While many of their foods would be familiar to us, the Romans also had their share of strange or unusual foods at feasts, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a species of rodent called the plch.
Another difference was that poor men and women ate sitting on benches, while rich men preferred communal banquets, where they ate while slouching on their side.
Ancient Roman food certainly could not have contained ingredients that would not reach Europe until centuries later from the Americas or Asia.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered the home of the deity.
Sacrifices were made to the gods, and priests sought to satisfy the needs of the gods through ceremonies and celebrations.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner sanctuary, which only the priests could enter.
Sometimes temples included specially built pyramid-shaped towers called zikkurats.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
A house wasn't that important in the warm Middle Eastern climate.
An ordinary Hebrew family spent most of their lives under the open sky.
Women cooked in the yard, shops were just shelves open to the street, and houses were built with stone.
There were no extensive forests in the land of Canaan, so timber was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated, and in Norse sagas, Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and as he traveled further west, he found a new land and named it Greenland.
Regardless of his discovery, Eskimos were already living there at the time.
Although Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland are "Scandinavian countries, there are many differences among the people, kings, customs, and history.
If you've seen the movie The Templar Treasure Hunt, you might think that the back of the Declaration of Independence had a treasure map drawn on it.
Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
The back of the Declaration of Independence was inscribed with the words Original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776.
While no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that in its early days it was a large parchment document (75 by 62 inches [75.57 x 62.23 cm]) rolled up for storage.
It is therefore likely that the recording was merely used to mark the document.
The Normandy landings and the ensuing battles liberated the north of France, but the south was still occupied.
It was ruled by the Vichy French, who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and cooperated with them instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, an invasion known as Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and turned on Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a large group of people who live and work cooperatively as a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, which means civil, and this word is related to the Latin civis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or city state, and this also defines the size of society in some way.
The city-states are the forerunners of nations, and civilization brings with it the transmission of knowledge across generations, the continuation of the cultural footprint and the uniform expansion.
Smaller cultures often perish without leaving relevant historical evidence and therefore cannot be recognized as true civilizations.
During the American Revolution, thirteen states formed a weak central government under the Articles of Confederation, with Congress as its sole component.
Congress had no power to tax, and since there was no national executive or judicial branch, Congress relied on state agencies to enforce all its laws, but they often did not cooperate.
Nor did it have any authority to rewrite the laws of taxation and tariffs between states.
The Articles required the unanimous consent of all states before they could be changed, and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the national football team of Germany, is the second most successful team in the world and were champions of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, ice hockey, and F1 motorcycle racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international events and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the seventh largest island in the world!
Because of the group of islands that Japan has, Japan is often considered a island from a geographical point of view.
Taiwan's origins date back to the 15th century, when European sailors sailing around wrote down the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or the Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company establishes a base in southwestern Taiwan, begins to transform native grain cultivation practices, and employs Chinese laborers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) gained control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, and in 1885 they declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Shimonoseki Treaty, which ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three basic structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what the buildings originally looked like.
Thirty percent of Machu Picchu was restored by 1975 and the restoration continues to this day.
For example, the world's most common format for photographs is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analogue era.
It's still in production today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio is inherited from digital camera image sensors.
In fact, it's a 35mm format, surprisingly 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format, which is divided by twelve to obtain the simplest ratio of integers, is therefore said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. APS group formats) are equal to or close to this cross-sectional ratio.
The very often used but also ridiculed simple rule of thirds creates momentum while maintaining a degree of order in the picture.
He claims that the most efficient location for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into vertical and horizontal thirds (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, came under scrutiny.
For more than a millennium, Christianity has united European nations despite differences in language and customs.
Its omnipresent power affected everyone from the king to the common man.
One of the basic principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that church funds should be used for these very purposes.
The church had been the central authority in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether its principles were being followed.
Shortly after hostilities broke out, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective because it succeeded in disrupting vital military and civilian supplies, despite the fact that the blockade violated generally accepted international law codified in several international treaties over the past two centuries.
Britain conditioned international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire parts of the ocean, which posed a danger even to neutral ships.
With only minimal response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920's, pacifism and isolationism were the dominant attitude of most citizens and nations.
When the world saw the horrors and atrocities of World War I, the nations were anxious to avoid a repeat of such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job with the Edison Company in New York.
He came to the U.S. with four cents, a book of poetry and a letter from his manager from his previous job, Charles Batchelor, who recommended him to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of representing different time periods; each historical period of China, or each dynasty that held power, was a dynasty that was written down in a distinctive way.
There was also a period of instability between each dynasty, with the most famous of these periods being the Three Kingdoms Period, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, a fierce war was fought between many nobles vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, and thousands of people died fighting for the top position in the great palace of Xi'an.
Many social and political phenomena are explored, such as the use of the metric system, the shift from self-government to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people, not to a single ruler.
Even after the revolution, jobs were open to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same is true for the military, because instead of ranking by class, they've moved to caliber.
The French Revolution inspired many other oppressed workers in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond earthly life, and he often went to meditate in a cave that became known as Hira, on Mount Noor (the light).
The cave itself, which has survived a long time, provides a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Lying atop one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to get in, even if you know where it is.
There is nothing to see but a clear, beautiful sky and a multitude of surrounding mountains.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World still standing.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., is one of many large pyramid structures built in honor of the late Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, also known as the Giza Necropolis, is located in Egypt's Valley of the Dead and is home to several pyramids (the largest being the Great Pyramid), smaller tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Cheops, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Cheops' wives and family members.
The upper reference mark looks like a V and the lower reference mark looks like a pin or a square without a bottom.
Up means you should start at the top and press on the string, while down means you should start at the frog (where you hold the string in your hand) and pull on the string.
The top of the bow usually produces a softer sound, while the bottom of the bow is firmer and more durable.
You can write down your own notes, but remember that the printed notes are there for musical purposes, so you should usually keep them.
On October 6, 1789, a mob of rioters drove frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11 - year - old Marie-Thérèse and 4 - year - old Louis-Charles), and the king's sister, Madame Elisabeth, from Versailles back to Paris.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage, accompanied by an angry mob of screaming people who threatened the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep the windows of the cabin wide open.
At one point, someone in the crowd waved to the frightened queen at the head of the royal guard that had been beheaded at Versailles.
The war costs of American imperialism during the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime in the United States to pay for most of the expenses and the interest on the bonds on behalf of the Philippine government was funneled through the banking houses on Wall Street.
Clearly, the huge profits made from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people were the basic income of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, we must understand the context in which the order was born.
The period when these events occurred is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, an era of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 C.E.).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, the end of which is generally dated to about 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that in practice encompasses a wide range of concepts from the development of new technologies or the technological imperative to its narrow meaning that human destiny is governed by the logic of scientific laws and their manifestations in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself goes along a path that goes far beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology affects societies that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, it could be argued that motor vehicles inevitably lead to the development of roads.
However, a national road network for only a few cars is not economically viable, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Car ownership also leads to higher rates of road accidents, which leads to the invention of new medical techniques to heal injured bodies.
An important element of romanticism was cultural determinism, drawn from authors such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time, geography-related customs and culture emerged that were in harmony with society and were better than arbitrarily set laws.
Just as Paris is now considered the fashion capital, so was Constantinople in feudal Europe.
Its glory as an epicenter of luxury began sometime around 400 AD and lasted until about 1100 AD.
Its status declined during the 12th century, largely because the Crusaders returned with gifts of silk and spices, which were valued more highly than what was offered in Byzantine markets.
It was at this time that the title of the Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
Initially, clothing was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, because of slow communication channels, Western styles may have lagged by as much as 25 to 30 years.
In the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style, and one of the greatest achievements of that time, brought with it by the Crusades, was buttons, which were used to fasten clothes.
Self-sufficient farming is farming carried out with a view to producing the quantity of food needed exclusively for the subsistence of the farmer and his family.
Self-sufficient farming is a simple, often organic system that uses own-supply seed  originating from the ecoregion  in combination with sowing or other relatively simple techniques to maximise yield.
Historically, most farmers were self-sufficient farmers, as is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel neglected by social standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be characterised by age, ethnicity, social class, geographical location and/or gender of members.
The characteristics that define a distinct subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of these factors.
Members of a subculture often express their membership through the expressive and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, manners, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization draws on several unfortunate cases of children who were neglected, unhappy, or deliberately abused and not socialized by adults as they grew up.
Some of these children have been restrained by humans (usually their own parents); in some cases, the parents abandoned the child because they could not cope with his serious intellectual or physical disability.
Wild children may have suffered severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or fled.
Others were said to have been raised by animals; some were said to have lived in the wild on their own.
When a feral child is raised only by animals other than human beings, his behavior (within physical limits) is almost identical to that of a particular animal, such as fear or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, the strategy called 'scaffolding' goes one step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method but rather a tool to help people who are learning new experiences, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The caressing can be virtual or real, in other words, the teacher is also a form of caressing, but so is the little office clip in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolding is internalised in the software, designed primarily to challenge and explain too difficult procedures to a student who cannot handle them on his own.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, from neglect, abuse, to blackmail.
No child should grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring, and learning, but it is.
We see the foster care system as a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system is designed to provide a safe home, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.
Foster care is to provide the children with all the necessities that were missing in the household from which they were previously taken.
The Internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The unique characteristics of the Internet lead to further possibilities in the theory of use and satisfaction.
For example, it is assumed that learning and socialization are important motivators for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
In researching audience responses to websites, Eighmey and McCord (1998) identified personal engagement and lasting relationships as motivating aspects.
The use of video recording has led to significant discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions and facial expressions, which last only a few milliseconds.
More specifically, it is claimed that correct interpretation of micromanifestations can help determine whether a person is lying.
Oliver Sacks in his book The President's Speech showed that people who cannot understand speech because of brain damage can accurately judge the sincerity of speech.
It even suggests that such abilities in interpreting human behavior may be shared by animals, such as domestic dogs.
Research in the 20th century showed that there are two groups of genetic variation: hidden and visible.
Mutation adds new genetic variations, and selection in turn removes them from the group of variations that are expressed.
Segregation and recombination blend the variations between these two groups with each generation.
In the savannah, a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans finds it difficult to satisfy its need for amino acids from available plant sources.
If you do not, the consequences will be serious: stunting, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The most readily available plant sources were probably proteins found in leaves and legumes, but these are hard for primates like us to digest unless cooked.
In contrast, animal food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digested but also provides a high amount of protein, containing all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, it should come as no surprise that our ancestors dealt with their protein problem in the same way that chimpanzees do in the savannah today.
Sleep interruption is a process of intentionally waking during normal sleep and falling asleep shortly afterwards (10-60 minutes).
You can do this simply by using a relatively quiet alarm clock that will bring you to consciousness without completely waking you.
However, if you put off the alarm clock during sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room, forcing you to get up and turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluids before bedtime (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic), which will make you get up and go to the toilet.
The degree of inner peace a person has is indirectly related to the tension in a person's body and spirit.
The less stress, the more positive life force every person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Anyone can achieve enlightenment, the only obstacle being our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it spread through the Mahayana path of love and many techniques from Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is basically very simple and includes kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of all-embracing love.
In kundalini yoga, kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga poses, aerobic exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The basis of Tibetan meditation is Divine Yoga, whereby the visualization of various deities clears energy channels, activates chakras and creates the consciousness of enlightenment.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the United States.
Two years after the war ended, former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
It was to last another 40 years, and it was really fought through proxy armies on the battlefields from Africa to Asia, to Afghanistan, to Cuba and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defensive wall had been broken and its only hope was to retreat and rearrange along the Romanian outpost.
But these plans were rendered obsolete almost overnight when more than 800,000 Soviet Red Army troops violated the Treaty of Riga, the Polish-Soviet Treaty of Non-Aggression, and other international treaties, bilateral and multilateral, and entered the eastern regions of Poland, forming the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts.
The use of ships for freight transport is by far the most efficient way of transporting large numbers of people and goods across the oceans.
The traditional role of the Navy was to ensure that your country maintained the ability to move people and goods, while also preventing your enemy from moving people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, when the Americans tried to move troops and supplies across the Atlantic to help Britain.
And at the same time, the German Navy was trying to stop these movements, mostly with submarines.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain, as would the rest of Europe.
Goats appear to have been first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to breed them for easy access to milk, fur, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that roamed hills or other pastures, often being herded by goatherds, often children or teenagers, similar to the common shepherd, and these methods of herding are still used today.
In England, railways were built as early as the 16th century.
Although the carriages were made of only parallel wooden planks, they allowed the draught horses to reach higher speeds and to pull larger loads than on the rougher roads of the day.
The railway was introduced relatively early to hold the rails in place, but it was later found that the rails would be more efficient if they had an iron band on top.
This became common practice, but the iron caused the wooden wheels of the carriages to wear out more.
Wooden wheels were eventually replaced by iron wheels.
The first known means of transportation was walking, and humans began walking upright two million years ago, when Homo erectus evolved.
Their ancestors, the Australopithecines, did not normally walk upright.
Two-legged specialization is found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start acting more environmentally conscious, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce some of the suffering in the future.
As in many cases, it's something like symptomatic treatment, but if we don't want a temporary solution, we should get to the root of the problem and we should eliminate it.
Clearly, the world has changed greatly as a result of mankind's scientific and technological advances, and overpopulation and extravagant lifestyles are making matters worse.
After passing Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Speaker of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's printer.
During the course of one night, 150 to 200 copies were made, now known as Dunlap's Side Sheets.
The first public reading of the document was delivered by John Nixon on July 8 in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, and he had it read to his troops in New York on July 9.
The 25 Dunlap side pages are the oldest surviving copies of the document.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is alive today, and we call them birds.
A lot of people don't see them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
But there are a lot of things about birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have scaled feet and claws, lay eggs and walk on two hind legs like Tyrannosaurus rex.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on manipulating information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1. These numbers are referred to in computer jargon as binary digits or bits.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent, since symptoms such as vomiting are too common to be diagnosed immediately.
The quickest sign of internal poisoning is the presence of an open container of medication or toxic household cleaning chemicals.
Look for first aid instructions on the label for this particular poison.
The term insect is used by entomologists for this group of insects in a formal sense.
The name comes from the ancient knowledge of the bed bug, an insect highly adapted to parasitize on humans.
Both the conch and the beetle are nimble, adapted to live in the nest or placed on their host.
In the United States, there are about 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it one of the leading neurological diseases in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research shows that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their child.
These couples may decide to make a so-called adoption plan for their child.
In adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can take over the child's care.
The main goal of science is to use scientific methods to understand how the world works, and these methods actually drive most of the scientific research.
But it's not just about experimentation, and an experiment is a test used to rule out one or more possible hypotheses.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on the classical texts, especially the Latin Bible.
All of Aristotle's scientific knowledge, including that of psychology, was accepted.
The West gradually found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots as knowledge of Greek declined.
Many observed physiological and behavioral rhythms are often critically dependent on the presence of internal cycles and their formation by the biological clock.
In most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals, regular rhythms are documented that are not just a response to external repeating signals.
The biological clock is an independent oscillator that will continue in a random cycle even in the absence of stimuli from the external environment.
The experiment conducted by Hershey and Chase was one of the main indicators that DNA is genetic material.
To implant their DNA into the bacteria, Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses.
They did two experiments with either DNA in the phase being labelled with radioactive phosphorus or the phase protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on their type, the significance of the part of the genetic material affected, and whether the cells are affected by germ cells.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while other mutations can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery, including plants and animals.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching and visiting parks and studying ecosystem information.
Examples include tours, photography, and sightseeing of the orangutan in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small rural towns for work and pass by others working where they left off.
In this shuttle transport, everyone is somehow connected to and supports the private car-based transport system.
Science now suggests that this massive carbon economy has replaced the stable state of the biosphere that supported human evolution for the next two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses the transport system.
In developed lands, you rarely hear similar complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transport systems generate so many complaints, why do they fail every day? Are it just transport engineers who are incompetent? Or is there something more fundamental?
Traffic flow is the result of observing the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and monitoring their interactions.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave reasonably consistently and therefore traffic flows often behave consistently, which can be approximately mathematically illustrated.
For a more accurate representation of the traffic flow, the relationships between these three main characteristics were defined: (1) intensity, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design and operation of ground communications.
Insects were the first animals to take off into the air, and their ability to fly helped them to escape enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings backward along the body.
This gives them a greater choice of small places to hide from predators.
Currently, there is only one insect that can't fold its wings and those are dragonflies and damselflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many people believed otherwise; that the solar system revolved around the earth, including the sun (and even other stars).
It seems reasonable, because the Earth doesn't seem to be moving, right?
The Amazon is the second longest and largest river on Earth, and it flows more than eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, up to six miles wide in places.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows from the rivers of the planet into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long and is fed by thousands of smaller rivers.
The building of the stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, but the Giza pyramids were never surpassed in size or technical perfection.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were fascinated by the relics of their ancestors, which were over a thousand years old at the time.
Vatican City has a population of about 800, making it the smallest sovereign state in the world with the smallest population.
In the Vatican, Italian is used for official communication and legislation.
Italian is also used daily by the majority of those who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of the Vatican are Roman Catholics.
People have known about chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times because they can all be found in nature in their natural form and can be extracted relatively easily with simple tools.
The philosopher Aristotle came up with the theory that everything was made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air and fire.
It looked like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, yet he thought they changed into new substances in order to create what we see.
An alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals.
There are alloys that contain a small amount of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, all of which is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them can fit into a period at the end of this sentence.
When the pencil was introduced, it became a good friend to many people.
However, as newer writing methods appeared, the pencil was pushed aside and used less and less.
People now leave messages on their computer screens without ever having to go near a dryer.
Maybe just think about what happens to the keyboard when something new comes along.
A fission bomb uses the principle that energy is needed to assemble a nucleus with a lot of protons and neutrons.
It's like rolling a heavy cart up a hill, and then when the core splits again, some of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they're prone to decay with little or no push.
The surface of the moon is made of rock and dust, and the outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the upside and 100 km on the downside.
It's thinner under the top and thicker under the top.
There could be more lunar seas on the near side because the crust is thinner, so it's easier for lava to come to the surface.
Content theories are about finding what drives people to behave or what attracts them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that become their own as adults.
These theories focus on what motivates people to do certain things and what in their environment causes them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
In general, two types of behaviour can occur when managers start to lead their previous peers.
This type of manager has trouble making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary measures, evaluating performance, assigning responsibility, and even with accountability to people.
At the other end of the spectrum, the person becomes an unrecognizable individual, feeling like they have to change everything that the team has done and do it their way.
The manager is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the entire team.
This behavior often leads to conflicts between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual and traditional teams follow the same quality standards, but with slight differences.
Virtual team members usually serve as a point of contact for their direct physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members because their teams can meet in changing time zones, which may not be understood by local management.
A unique feature of the virtual team is also the presence of a real 'invisible team' (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109).
The Invisible Team is the management team to which each member is subject.
Why would an organisation want to go through the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organisation?
When all available resources are used efficiently across the executive departments of the organization, doors open to creativity and ingenuity.
The process of working together in an organisation to overcome a barrier can then lead to a new innovative process that helps meet customer needs.
An organisation can be innovative, but first management must create a culture of innovation, knowledge sharing and organisational teaching.
The film Angel (2006) explains the continuum approach as a method used to help organisations aim to achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provides tangible evidence for a theoretical approach to cognitive research, narrowing the scope of research and making it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The development of new technologies allows us to see and study brain structures and processes like never before.
This provides us with a wealth of information and material so that we can create simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
AI has a strong science fiction connotation and forms a major branch of computer science that deals with the behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation of robots.
AI research involves the manufacture of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Cases include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
These have become separate disciplines that focus on providing solutions to life's problems.
Artificial intelligence is now widely used in economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, having been built into several applications in home computers and applications in video game software.
Excursions are an important part of every classroom life, and a teacher would often like to take her students to places where the bus is not available.
Technology offers a solution through virtual field trips, where students can view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful works of art while sitting in a classroom with their classmates.
Sharing a field trip in a virtual way is a great way to think about a field trip and share experiences with other classes.
For example, every year, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital, and every year the website is redesigned, but older versions are kept online to serve as a diary.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing, and while students often start their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience usually changes that.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger tries to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging forces students to become more aware of the world around them.The need to satisfy the audience's interest thus inspires students to become more proficient and engage with their interests (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that encourages collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs  will allow students to deepen their analytical and critical thinking; through active response to Internet materials, students can define their positions in the context of other writings and outline their own views on specific problems (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the charming bilingual capital of Canada and offers visitors a wealth of art galleries and museums that represent its past and present.
Further south are Niagara Falls, and to the north lie the pristine natural beauties of the Muskoka region.
All these and more things make Ontario what foreigners consider to be fundamentally Canadian.
Large areas higher up in the north are relatively sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that will surprise many: There are more African Americans in the United States than Canadians.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and is a continent in its own right when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent states or have links with France and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the lands, and it was embraced in a grand fashion in the Comoros and Mayotte.
The era of European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered a route around the Cape of Good Hope from Europe to India.
The region is bounded to the north by the Sahel and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: All women travelers are advised to state that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
Wearing a ring is also useful (but only if it does not look too expensive).
Women should be aware that cultural differences can lead to what they would normally consider harassment.
Be firm when rejecting men and don't be afraid to hold your ground (cultural differences or not, it's not OK!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century B.C.E. and served as a strategic port for the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenides under the name Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, only to abandon it in 1755 after an earthquake.
The Moroccan Sultan renamed the city Dar al-Bayda, and the Spanish traders who established trading posts in the city named it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least attractive places to shop in all of Morocco.
Traditional Moroccan products such as taginas, pottery, leather goods, water pipes, and a variety of geegaws are easily found around the old Medina, but they are all geared toward tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava from Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially its downtown.
Although Goma is reasonably safe, you should do your research before traveling outside Goma to understand the ongoing fighting situation in North Kivu province.
The city is also a starting point for hiking the Nyiragongo volcano and one of the cheapest places in Africa to watch mountain gorillas.
To travel around Goma, you can use a boda-boda (motorized taxi).
Timbuktu has come to be used as a metaphor for relatively inaccessible, exotic and distant countries.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, but it is a popular tourist attraction.
In 1990, the city was added to the list of World Heritage in Danger because of the threat of desert sand.
It was one of the main stops for Henry Louis Gates during a special program on PBS's The Special Wonders of the African World.
The city is in sharp contrast to other cities in the country because its appearance is more Arab than African.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) in northeastern South Africa stretches along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north and its southern border is formed by the Crocodile River.
The park has an area of 19 500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, each of which supports a different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
Here, too, the daily maintenance and entrance fees are the same as in all South African national parks.
The most beneficial way is to purchase a Wild Card, which allows entry to either a select number of parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
The whole area of Hong Kong is named after Hong Kong Island, and it is a place that is a major attraction for many tourists.
The set of buildings that make up Hong Kong's outline could be compared to a luminous column graph seen from Victoria Harbour.
If you want to enjoy the most beautiful view of Hong Kong, you have to leave the island and head for the coast of Kowloon.
The vast majority of urban development on Hong Kong Island is densely concentrated on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is a place that was taken over by the British colonizers, and if you're looking for evidence of the colonial past of the territory, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest coastal mangrove belt, stretching 80 kilometres (50 miles) from the coast to the Bangladeshi and Indian hinterlands.
The Sundarban has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
The forests include not only mangrove swamps but also some of the last remnants of the vast jungles that once covered the Ganges Plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, with about one third covered by wetlands.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a kingdom of wildlife, and it is estimated that 400 Indian tigers and some 30,000 deer are now found in the area.
Buses leave from the intercity bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
It is recommended to buy a ticket a few days in advance, as long-distance buses are often full.
Most districts are served by small Japanese Coaster buses, which are comfortable and robust.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way of getting to nearby towns such as Paro (No 150) and Punakha (No 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a suspension bridge that spans the entire Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque, Brazil, and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, French Guiana.
These two towers rise to a height of 83 meters, are 378 meters long, and have two bands that are 3.5 meters wide.
The vertical lighting height under the bridge is 15 meters.
The full operation of the bridge is scheduled for September 2017, by which time the Brazilian customs control posts should be completed.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group in what is now eastern Paraguay, a semi-nomadic hunter-gatherer who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribal groups, such as the Guaycurú and Payagua, who lived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly called the "Giant Province of the Indies", was born as a result of the clash between Spanish conquistadors and indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a three-century period of colonization.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is well known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in December on the polo courts in the Las Cañitas area.
Smaller tournaments and matches are also held here at other times of the year.
To find information on tournaments and the possibility of purchasing tickets for polo matches, please visit the website of the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency in the Falklands is the Falklands pound (FKP), the value of which is set at the equivalent of one British pound (GBP).
The only bank on the islands, which is located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store, is where the money can be exchanged.
British Pounds will normally be accepted anywhere on the islands and on Stanley credit cards and US Dollars are also often accepted.
Credit cards are unlikely to be accepted in remote islands, although both British and American currency may be accepted; check with the cardholders in advance to see what payment method is acceptable.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so exchange your money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, when it's winter in the northern hemisphere, it's summer, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; temperatures are usually above +30°C in the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity makes it feel colder than the thermometer shows.
There are no special rainy and dry seasons: the amount of rainfall remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are accustomed to the presence of humans, the wild beast remains wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
Park officials say you stay at least 100 yards from bears and wolves and 25 yards from all other wildlife!
No matter how calm they may seem, bison, deer, deer, bears, and almost any large animal can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors get injured because they don't keep enough distance.
Also, be aware that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid serving or cooking spicy foods and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on Upolu Island and has a population of almost 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a notorious maritime dispute in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the port
All but one British cruiser was sunk, killing nearly 200 Americans and Germans.
During the Mau movement's struggle for independence, a peaceful gathering of people in the town led to the assassination of the Tupua Tamasese High Chief Lealofi III.
The two harbours of Auckland allow for a large number of beaches, the most popular of which are in three areas.
The beaches on the North Shore (North Harbor County) are located on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all the beaches are sandy and safe for swimming, and most offer shade from pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive Beaches is located in the Waitemata Harbour in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are occasionally crowded family beaches with plenty of shops lining the coast.
The main local beer is Number One, not a complex beer, but a pleasant and refreshing one.
Many French wines are available, while New Zealand and Australian wines may be more readily available.
Local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but if you are concerned, getting bottled water is not a problem.
For Australians, the concept of flat white coffee is foreign. Small black coffee is espresso, cappuccino is served with a high layer of cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is Belgian, fruit juice is expensive, but delicious.
Many trips to the reef are made throughout the year, and injuries from any of these causes are rare on the reef.
Nevertheless, follow the instructions of the competent authorities, pay attention to the instructions on the signs and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Jellyfish are found near beaches and estuaries from October to April north of the city, and occasionally outside this period.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans, and most sharks are afraid of humans and tend to swim away.
Sea crocodiles don't primarily live in the ocean, their usual habitat is the estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler the assurance that he will have a place to sleep when he arrives at his destination.
Travel agencies usually have agreements with specific hotels, but they also offer the possibility of booking other forms of accommodation, such as camping.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, transport to/from the airport or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also support your booking if you need more time to think about the offer or to obtain additional documents (e.g. a visa) for your destination.
Any suggestions for change or requests should be addressed primarily to the travel agent, not directly to the hotel.
As for some festivals, the vast majority of music festival visitors choose to camp on site and most attendees consider this an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you have to get there early to get camped close to the music.
Remember that even after the musical performance has ended on the main stages, music may play late into the night in some parts of the festival.
Some festivals have special campsites for families with small children.
If you are crossing the northern Baltics in winter, check the location of the hut, as crossing the ice causes quite a terrible noise for those most affected.
The cruise ship is also subject to a visa requirement for passengers travelling on a round-trip cruise (check the conditions).
Casinos usually make a point of making sure that guests spend as much time and money as possible, and most have no windows or clocks, and the exits are hard to find.
They usually have unique food, drink, and entertainment options to keep guests entertained and staying as long as possible.
Since drunkenness impairs judgment, all good gamblers are aware of the importance of staying sober.
Anyone who will be riding at high latitudes or over mountain passes should consider the likelihood of snow, ice or frost.
On icy and snow-covered roads, friction is low, and you cannot drive as if you were on clean asphalt.
During snowstorms, so much snow can fall in a very short time that you could get stuck in it.
The reduced visibility may be caused by falling or blown snow, condensation of water on windows or also by ice forming on the windows of the vehicle.
In contrast, in many countries, ice and snow are common, and traffic continues almost uninterrupted year-round.
Safari is perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and a great experience for many visitors.
The term safari is commonly used to refer to a land trip to explore the magnificence of the African wildlife, especially the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, are used to approaching cars, and standard equipment will allow good observation.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy and are better seen from a distance with a telescope.
A walking safari (also called a bushwalk or tourist safari or just a walk) is a tourist trip of several hours or days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some events will take place at various venues across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, having hosted the 1964 games.
If you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the delay was announced, you could be in a difficult situation.
Cancellation conditions vary, but at the end of March most cancellation conditions, which originate from the coronavirus, do not exceed July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
Most tickets are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with a standard ticket costing about 7,000 yen.
Even when not in the room, many hotels have a portable iron and ironing board.
If an iron is not available or you do not like ironing socks, you can try using a hairdryer if available.
Care should be taken not to overheat the substance (this may cause it to shrink and, in extreme cases, burn).
There are different ways to treat water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, it takes just one minute to boil the water; in others, it takes several minutes.
Filters vary in their effectiveness, and if you are concerned, you should consider buying bottled water from a reputable company.
Travellers may come into contact with animal pests not found in their home regions.
Pests can degrade food, cause irritation, or in the worst case, cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves or dangerous animals that can injure or violently kill humans are not usually classified as pests.
Purchasing in duty-free zones allows goods to be obtained free of customary and excise duties.
Travelers heading to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont is the most challenging stretch of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Freeway, as it often passes through isolated wooded terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, beware: they are full of steep slopes, narrow lanes, and sharp turns.
The published speed limits are significantly lower than in the previous and subsequent sections - normally 56-64 km/h  and strict adherence to them is more important than ever.
Surprisingly, mobile phone service is much stronger here than in many other sections of the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German candy is quite good, and in Bavaria it is quite varied, similar to that of its southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit cakes are common, with apples baked year-round, while cherries and plums are common in the summer.
Many German bakery products also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other tree nuts, often in combination with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want a small but rich pastry, try a stuffed doughnut, which is called either Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a herb and spice based food, along with meat or vegetables.
We know curry as either dry or wet, depending on the amount of liquid used.
Inland areas of northern India and Pakistan commonly use yogurt in curry; coconut milk is commonly used in southern India and some other coastal areas of the subcontinent.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is a term that encompasses a wide variety of regional cuisines that you can find throughout the country.
When used without further qualification, the term tends to refer to food originating in the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine, now widely available throughout the archipelago, includes a variety of easily flavored dishes.
The riders' legs are supported by a rope that hangs on either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider but may also pose a safety risk as they can potentially get the rider's legs stuck in them.
If the rider is thrown from the horse but has his leg caught in the stirrup, he may be pulled if the horse runs away.
Most riders wear riding boots with a high heel and a fairly narrow smooth sole.
Furthermore, some saddles, especially English ones, are fitted with safety bars that allow the saddle to fall off if a falling rider pulls it back.
The Cochamo Valley is a popular mountaineering destination in Chile, and its variety of huge granite walls and rock faces have earned it the nickname Yosemite of South America.
The views from the top of the shields are breathtaking, and climbers from all over the world are constantly discovering new routes through the walls' infinite potential.
Popular downhill winter sports, such as skiing and snowboarding, involve skating on snow-covered terrain with skis or snowboards attached to the feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity that has many enthusiasts, occasionally known as ski fanatics, who plan their entire holiday around skiing in a given location.
The idea of skiing is very old  cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the Norwegians opened Australia's first recreational ski club.
Backpacking: This activity is also called backpacking, ski mountaineering, or ski touring.
It is related to (but usually does not include) alpine skiing and mountaineering, which is practiced on steep terrain and requires much harder skis and footwear.
Consider a ski trail as a tourist route.
Under good conditions, you will be able to cover slightly more distance than if you walked  but very rarely will you reach the speed of running without a heavy backpack on a paved track.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it is home to many independent states.Normally, traveling through several countries would mean having to repeatedly process visa applications and pass passport controls.
In this respect, the Schengen area functions to some extent as a single country.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can usually cross the border without having to go through the passport control posts again.
Also, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa to each Schengen country separately, saving you time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what constitutes an antique, and some tax authorities define antiques as goods that are more than 100 years old.
The conditions for determining the age of consent vary around the world and this age limit may be lower in places such as North America than in Europe.
Craft products can be classified as antiques even though they are younger than a similar mass-produced product.
Reindeer herding is an important means of livelihood for the Sami, and trade culture is important for many other professions.
Traditionally, however, not all Sami people were involved in reindeer herding on a large scale, but they also subsisted on fishing, hunting, and the like, using reindeer mostly as draft animals.
Today, many Sami people are involved in modern crafts, and tourism is an important source of income in the Sámi region of Sapmi.
Although the word gypsy is very common, especially among non-Roma, it is often considered offensive for its association with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of Roma.
If the country you are going to visit is the subject of travel advice, this may affect your travel medical insurance or cancellation insurance.
In addition to your government, you may also want to consult the advice of other governments, but their advice is designed for their citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
News reports provide only a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The opinions given are often vague, general and oversimplified compared to more detailed information available elsewhere.
Adverse weather is a general term for any hazardous weather phenomenon that has the potential to cause damage, cause serious social disruption or lead to loss of human life.
Adverse weather and its various forms, which depend on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions, can occur anywhere in the world.
Strong winds, hail, excessive precipitation and fires are forms and effects of adverse weather, such as storms, tornadoes, waterfalls and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal adverse weather events include thunderstorms, snowstorms, ice storms and dust storms.
Travellers are strongly advised to consider any risks that could arise from adverse weather in their area, which could affect their travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country considered a war zone should undergo vocational training.
You just search the Internet for "Hostile Environment Course" and you'll probably get an address for a local company.
The course covers all the problems discussed here in much more detail, along with practical experience.
The course usually lasts 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing, first aid instruction and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines on survival in the wild are common, but publications on war zones are few.

For travelers who have been able to adjust easily to a new culture, adjusting to their original culture can sometimes be especially challenging.
When you return home from abroad, you have adapted to the new culture and have lost some of your customs from the home culture.
When you first went to a foreign land, people were likely patient and understanding, knowing that travelers in a new country need to adjust.
People may not expect that travelers returning home will need patience and understanding.
The pyramidal sound and light show is one of the most exciting things for children in this area.

Finland is a great place for boating. The land of a thousand lakes also has thousands of islands, in lakes and on coastal islands.
You don't necessarily need a yacht on islands and lakes.
Although the coastal islands and the largest lakes are really large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is Finland's national sport, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
It's the same for Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise it's pretty unique (e.g. in the Netherlands, the number is 1 in 40).
Most Baltic Sea cruises also offer extended stays in St. Petersburg, Russia.
That means you have a couple of days to visit the historic city while you return to the boat for the night.
If you go ashore only for a cruise excursion, you will not need a separate visa (since 2009).
Some cruise booklets list the German city of Berlin. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not by the sea and the price of the cruise is not included.
Air travel can be a terrifying experience for all, regardless of age or circumstances, especially if you have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.

Courier companies are well paid for quick delivery, and time is often very important for business documents, goods, or spare parts for urgent repair.
On some routes, larger companies have their own aircraft, but on other routes and smaller companies, a problem has arisen.
If the goods were sent by air freight, on some routes unloading and unloading could take days.
The only way to get it there faster was to send it as checked baggage, but airline regulations don't allow them to send baggage without a passenger, so here you come in.
The obvious way to fly first or business class is to set aside a large amount of money for this privilege (or ideally to get your company to do it for you).
But it will not be cheap: You can expect to pay an estimated four times the regular fare for business class and up to 11 times the fare for first class!
In general, it is also not worthwhile to seek discounts on business or first class flights from A to B.
The airlines are well aware that there is a basic group of passengers who are willing to pay a high price for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and conveniently and charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau, and the local language is Romanian, but Russian is spoken very often.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Transnistrian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any UN member country.
Economic relations between these two parts of Moldova have been restored despite the failure of political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
İzmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of approximately 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul and a very good transport hub.

Scotturb Bus 403 runs regularly to Sinatra, stopping at Cabo da Roca.
Also to the north, you can visit the important Shrine of Our Lady of Fatima (tomb), which is the site of world-famous Marian apparitions.
Please remember that you are basically visiting a mass grave and also a site that is of almost incalculable importance to a significant portion of the world's population.
There are still many living men and women who have spent time there, and many more whose loved ones have been murdered or worked to death there, both Jewish and non-Jewish.
Approach the site with the utmost dignity, with all the seriousness and respect it deserves, and do not make fun of the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not damage the site by writing or scratching graffiti on buildings.

Rare fauna, such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat, and tetra, are found here, along with many other common species.
When visiting monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover their knees and also to cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries provide scarves for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially one of bright colors, you may be smiled upon by the monk or nun.
The same regulations require men to wear pants that cover their knees.
You can borrow this outfit from the store at the entrance, but you should be aware that the clothes don't wash after every wearer, so you may not feel comfortable in these skirts.
Majorcan cuisine, like other similar Mediterranean cuisines, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and cannot do without olive oil.
A simple favourite dinner, especially during the summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes or other accompaniment such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns and personal pronouns always start with a capital letter, even if they're in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between verbs and objects.
It also has been shown to make reading easier, but writing is a little more complicated because of the need to distinguish whether a verb or an adjective is used in the lower case.
Pronunciation in Italian is quite simple, because most words are pronounced the same as they are written.

Christmas is among the most important holidays of Christendom, and it is celebrated as the birth of Jesus.
Many holiday traditions have been adopted by unbelievers and non-Christians around the world in Christendom.
Tradition has it that you will spend Easter night under the open sky to watch the sun rise.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may well be a pre-Christian ritual of spring and fertility.
More traditional churches often hold Easter mass on Saturday evening during Easter weekend, with gatherings often held at the stroke of midnight to celebrate Christ's resurrection.
All the animals that originally came to the islands either swam here, flew in or swam in.
