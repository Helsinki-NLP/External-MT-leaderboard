White pawn at f3, black pawn at e6, white pawn at g4, black woman at h4 - crazy chess! This is jokingly referred to in chess circles as "fool's madness".
White: Tower in a1, pawn in b6, king in c8. Black: pawns in a7 and b7, king in a8, umpire in b8. White puts the opponent in zugzwang by playing the tower in a6, after which Black has only two options: take the tower in a6 or move his umpire in any other check on the diagonal b8-h2. In the first case, White advances his pawn from b6 to b7 and gives matte check. In the second situation, White takes the black pawn in a7, with the same result.
