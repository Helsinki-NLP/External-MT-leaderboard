Twenty-eight-year-old chef found dead in a store in San Francisco
The 28-year-old chef, who recently moved to San Francisco, was the stairs to a local store this week.
But the victim's brother says he can't think of anyone who wants to hurt him, and he adds, "He's finally starting to get better".
The body found at Westfield Mall Wednesday morning was identified as an 28-year-old San Francisco resident, Frank Galicia, the medical examiner's office said.
The San Francisco Police Department said it was a violent death and an investigation is underway.
Victim's brother Louis Galicia told ABC KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who was previously a regular chef in Boston, got his dream job as a chef at Sons & Daughters six months ago.
A spokesman for Sons & Daughters said his death was shocked and devastating.
"We have a small team that works as a close-knit family, and we're going to miss them a lot", the spokesman said.
In this difficult time, our thoughts and condolences go out to Frank's family and friends.
Louis Galicia said that Frank had first slept in the hostels, but that he had recently finally started to get along.
"He found an apartment, he dated a girl", Louis Galicia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said he couldn't think of anyone who would want to hurt his younger brother.
He had a kind soul and a big heart.
When he wanted to be with his family, he always cooked us dinner, said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to be involved in any quarrel.
He was a brother who took things for what they are.
Even if everything else in the world was wrong, he was a diamond that shone every day.

The Czech Railways have invested over 31 billion euros in vehicle modernization.
They have air conditioning and new toilets.
In the last six years, the state transportation company has invested over 31 billion crowns in vehicle modernization.
One third of the cars are currently air conditioned, about half of the trains have a new closed toilet system.
However, the amounts for modernisation are gradually decreasing in each year except 2012.
Over the past six years, the Czech Railways have invested over 31 billion kroner in vehicle modernization.
One third of the cars are currently air conditioned, about half of the trains have a new closed toilet system.
The money invested has been shown to reduce the average age by two years for locomotives and separate units and by six years for classic cars.
The largest share of the investment was made by the carrier to regional transport, where about 60% of the money was spent, and 40% by the company to the restoration of long-haul vehicles.
The average age of locomotives and units is currently 19 years.
However, upgraded older vehicles are counted as completely new in this indicator.
If the modernisation of vehicles were not included, the average age of the drivetrain of the Czech Republic would increase by 10 years.
The average age of passenger cars is slightly older, with an average age of 23 years at the time of the modernisation.
If only the age from the date of manufacture were taken into account, the average age of these vehicles would be 33,4 years.
However, in recent years, classic railway sets consisting of wagons and locomotives have been gradually disappearing from the Czech and international railways and are being replaced by motor or electric units.
Between 2011 and 2015, the number of classic cars decreased from 280 to 223 and the number of classic cars decreased from 2716 in 2011 to 2132 in the first half of this year.
In particular, the carrier disposed of old vehicles with leather seats and doors without the possibility of blocking the opening during the journey.
From January to July, he had his carrier scrap 110 of these vehicles.
The investments in the fleet that the Czech Republic plans to make in the near future may include, for example, the purchase of 50 cars for speeds up to 200 km/h, which the carrier plans to deploy on the Prague-Bratislava-Budapest international line, or a framework contract for the purchase of electrical units for domestic highways.
The contract includes up to 30 units of motor and 20 units of electrical power.
The authorities have known about illegal advertising for a quarter of a year, they can't get rid of it.
We are utterly helpless, they admit.
For a quarter of the year, the online newspaper Aktuálně.cz has been following the story of a billboard in southern Czech Republic, which now attracts motorists to visit Lipn, where there is not only a tourist attraction to walk in the crowns of trees, but also the Olympic Park.
The highway patrol knows it's black, but they say there's nothing they can do about it.
There are hundreds, maybe thousands of such ads around the country.
Officials say the law is a flawed one that makes it impossible to remove illegal mobile billboards immediately.
First, you need a complex bureaucratic circle.
But in the meantime, the company's changing its name and the office is short on it.
Or you just have to move the ad a few feet and the official process has to start all over again.
The Directorate of Roads and Highways admitted a quarter ago: on the main road from Český Budějović to Lipno, there is a black billboard on our property by the state road.
But not even three months was enough for officials to get rid of the unauthorized portable structure with a giant poster.
Like no one cares that he's standing right next to the highway, in a 50-meter safety zone where nothing can stand for safety.
The road manager says they can't handle the billboard because of the rigging law.
Maybe load it up and take it away.
"We cannot afford it", says Highway and Road Administration spokeswoman Nina Ledvin, referring to a complex bureaucratic cycle that must be prevented by law from removing the billboard.
The case of this particular billboard, whose fate online newspaper Aktuálně.cz began to follow in detail in the spring, is not unique and points to a general problem that the state and authorities cannot solve effectively and quickly.
In the southern Czech Republic alone, the editorial counted dozens of similar mobile ads placed against the rules just off or near the highway.
Other places are like that.
"We have trouble forcing companies to remove the links", confirms the head of the transport department of the Czech Republic's district office, Jiří Klása, whose colleagues deal with similar stories.
According to Klass, the law is a loophole that binds officials.
First, he has to complexly address the billboard owner to get the ad off.
However, the heads of companies are often unavailable or know the secret which Aktuálně.cz has already described in the past when the issue became more detailed: it is enough to move the mobile advertising stand a few meters and the officials can throw the previous call to remove the black ad in the basket.
That's because the Bureau needs to determine exactly where the illegal billboard is.
"If someone moves it and the coordinates suddenly disagree, it's seen as a new device and we have to call the owner again", explains Jiří Klása.
The new law won't help.
The change could have been introduced by a new law that, from September next year, would ban billboards on highways and restrict them on Class I roads.
Critics point out that the rules for countering illegal and easily portable advertising will remain the same.
And the authorities don't like it that way.
Companies can continue to make tens to hundreds of millions of crowns a year on illegal land rents and no one can afford them.
For example, the billboard appealing to Lipno is owned by Commerz Billboard.
Officials know her well: the Czech Republic's Magistrate's Office is currently conducting three administrative proceedings against her for black-made billboards.
The company is subject to a fine of 30,000 in each case.
These are multiple advertisements that were placed without authorisation in the class I road protection zone.
The driving has not yet been completed, says Jaroslav Mráz, head of the transport department of the Czech city of Budapest.
The advertisement that Actu Actu Actuálně.cz is interested in is not yet in the middle of these cases, but it will most likely soon be.
According to RSD spokesman Nina Ledvin, the company has not responded to repeated written calls to remove the case, and the case will be brought to the table by county and then probably county officials.
Commerz Billboard is one of those suspicious companies that we can't get in touch with.
She doesn't receive mail and cancelled her official residence on Zhizhkov more than six years ago.
It's not even clear who's behind it.
In the past, the company's mail was sent to Anton Fischer, a South Czech businessman, who had a sharp dispute with the head of Hyundai's Czech representative.
Fischer, whose Euro Billboard leases the space from Comerz Billboard and offers it to advertisers, has denied any involvement in the past.
And this spring, when the RSD started to take an interest in Lipno advertising, Fischer had state officials send a letter to the secret Commerz Billboard company at his retirement home, where the new company is supposedly based.
But no one has contacted the highway authorities from this address.
It's a waste of time.
Similar silences or opaque changes of seats are not uncommon.
We fined a company a few years ago two million crowns in succession.
But she changed her name and I.O. and there was nothing to do.
The executive returned the case, the ads continued, maybe elsewhere.
We're pretty helpless against these companies and their business practices.
It's like a fight with windmills, admitting to the anonymity of one of the officials.
No one has yet resolved the new law in this regard.
Currently.cz has spoken to several members who are interested in the problem.
But they haven't developed any activity yet.
On the contrary, MEPs have appeared to extend the deadline for maintaining billboards on the main Czech communications networks.
The government has rejected it.
Billboards are a very sensitive and somewhat schizophrenic subject, not only for national but also regional and municipal policy.
On the one hand, they know about the social demand for their restrictions, on the other hand, they need them themselves for their campaign advertising.
I don't give the fairly established impression that if something doesn't work, then the laws need to be changed.
Farmers are harvesting less grain this year, but more rye and maple, statistics estimate.
According to the estimates of the Czech Statistical Office, the cereal harvest this year will be 6.7 percent lower than last year.
Yet this year's harvest is above the average of the past five or ten years.
The yields of rye (3.9 percent) and maple (2.5 percent) will be higher.
The crop yields will be 6.7 percent lower this year than last year.
Farmers harvest 7.2 million tons of grain.
This is according to an estimate published by the Czech Statistical Office on 15 July.
The initial estimate a month ago was more pessimistic, predicting a decline of 10 percent from last year.
But last year's cereal harvest was above average.
This year's harvest is above the average of the last five to ten years.
On the contrary, the harvest of maple and maple will be higher this year.
The crop is 3.9 percent more than a year ago, when 1.256 million tonnes were harvested under the roof.
This year's maple harvest could be 2.5 percent higher than last year's.
The projected decline in cereal production is due to both a decrease in yield per hectare by 3,7 per cent to 5,71 tonnes per hectare and a decrease in seed area.
Farmers are sowing three percent less land this year.
The winter wheat, the most important cereal for the Czech Republic, is projected to be harvested 3.3 percent less this year.
Farmers planted it in more fields.
But the decline will be marked by a lower yield per hectare, which will drop to 6.04 tonnes.
The statistics predict a decline of about five for the spring barley most commonly used in beer production.
The reduction in yields is accompanied by a reduction in the area of the seed by 15.2 percent, but also by a lower yield per hectare.
Barley, on the other hand, is 6.3% more likely to be harvested in the winter.
You'll also grow a grain harvest.
The Bureau of Reclamation's statistics estimate it at 1.305 million tons, up from last year.
The seeds have been increased by 7.3 percent.
But the yield per hectare will be 3.2 percent lower than last year.
This year's crop of rye is 13.3 percent higher than the 10-year average, while the crop is one-third larger than it was ten years ago.
In the last four years, there's been an increase in the field of machete.
This year, farmers planted it on 35,543 acres.
In 2008, when the Czech Republic grew its maize on a record 70,000 hectares, the field is half that.
The expansion of the seed area will make this year's macca harvest richer.
It's up 2.5 percent from last year to 27,423 tons.
But the yield per hectare will be 6.1 percent lower.
Olomouc police charged two men with assault with a knife and machete, and the court sent them into custody.
Police have charged two assailants who attacked a 35-year-old man with a knife and machete in downtown Olomouca on Tuesday.
"Although the attacker tried to escape, he suffered chest and abdominal injuries that required hospital treatment and further treatment", police spokeswoman Marie Strbakova said.
Both of the apparent perpetrators were detained by the police immediately after the attack.
The applicant submitted a motion for their arrest to the court and the court granted it on Friday.
Both men face three to 10 years in prison.
Police have charged two detainees with assaulting a 35-year-old man in downtown Olomouca with a knife and machete.
The assailants gave him a chest and a slit wound, and the man ended up in the hospital.
The attack was preceded by an incident between two groups of people that took place at noon on Tuesday in Freedom's classroom, police said.
The perpetrators ended up in custody, Omumu police spokeswoman Marie Strbakova reported.
A mass brawl between the two families took place in the garden area outside the Tratoria bar, near the center of Olomouc.
After an aggressive verbal dispute, two assailants attacked a 35-year-old man with a knife and machete.
Although the attacked man tried to escape, he sustained chest and abdominal injuries that required hospital treatment and further treatment, a police spokeswoman said.
The clash, which attracted much attention in the city center and resulted in the intervention of several police guards and officers, was a family affair.
The forensic investigators charged a 43-year-old Slovak man and a 37-year-old Olomouc man with attempting to cause serious injury to their health and physical activity.
The applicant submitted a request to the court for their arrest and the court granted it on Friday, the spokeswoman added.
The machete was used in the center of Olomouce in a mass battle by the attackers also five years ago, it happened just a few tens of meters away, in front of the Varna disco on Riegrovo Street.
Police said at the time that a group of about 10 foreigners with guns attacked guests at the business entrance.
Police say they had knives, sticks and machetes in their hands.
The court then sentenced the two foreign attackers to probation.
Abandoned and empty houses in the centre of Prague.
You'd be surprised, you might walk around them every day.
One of the most striking examples of an unused and empty house is the sprawling building of the former IPB headquarters in the middle of the Boring Square.
This was supposed to be a hotel a long time ago.
But still nothing.
That we need to build new and new apartments and offices in the metropolis?
And what about taking advantage of existing, often architecturally valuable and protected ones?
In the immediate vicinity of Václav Square, in the centre of Prague, there are several bungalow houses, which, despite their location, size and often monumental protection, are empty and empty.
We selected properties in the center using the project Prázdnédomy.cz, which maps long-term vacant properties in the Czech Republic.
Homes are usually the victims of financial problems of their owners, of opaque business relationships or of a state that cannot or does not want to get rid of them.
There are more empty houses in the Czech Republic than homeless people.
The owners pay special taxes on them, they want the initiative
Fidel Castro was almost shot, and Hitler's brother lived here.

The Clintons made $10.6 million last year.
Trump refuses to release his tax return.
Hillary Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, made $10.6 million last year.
They donated over a million dollars to Clinton for charity.
Most of the Clinton's income -- over six million dollars -- is on their speeches.
Trump refuses to publish his tax return.
U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton released her tax returns on Friday, increasing pressure on her Republican opponent, Donald Trump, to do the same.
Hillary Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, earned $10.6 million last year, the AP reported.
Most of Clinton's income -- over $6 million -- is for her speeches, mostly from before April 2015, when Clinton launched her campaign before the election.
The tax report showed that the Clintons' spouses reduced the federal income tax rate to 34.2 percent last year, followed by state and local income tax rates to 9 percent.
So they paid a total of 43.2% of their income on taxes.
Trump has a problem with a similar move, but he hasn't decided yet to release his tax return.
There's a good chance that Donald Trump doesn't pay any taxes at all, Clinton tweeted minutes after her confession was released.
Clinton has repeatedly returned to the secrecy surrounding Trump's income, among other things to raise doubts about whether her opponent is actually as rich as she claims, the AP reported.
Trump's fortune is estimated to be in the billions of dollars.
Lower earnings would damage the Republican nominee's reputation as a successful businessman.
Senator Tim Kaine, who is running for vice president in tandem with the former first lady, today released a report on his tax returns over the past decade.
He and his wife, Anne Holton, gave 7.5 percent of their income to charity and 25.6 percent to tax last year.
There's been another outbreak of measles in Nigeria.
Boko Haram Islamists have prevented proper vaccination and killed doctors.
Childhood fever has resurfaced in Nigeria.
In the northeast, the government declared a vaccination emergency because two children infected with the disease have become paralyzed.
The vaccines have been delivering helicopters.
In the affected area, Boko Haram Islamist terrorists have been active, preventing vaccination and even killing doctors.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the virus was circulating unnoticed.
In northeastern Nigeria, emergency vaccination against measles is set to begin as two children infected with the disease have become paralyzed.
In Africa, measles was last diagnosed two years ago in Somalia.
The Nigerian government has announced that one million children will be vaccinated in Borno State and another four million in neighboring states.
Nigerian military helicopters on Friday quickly delivered childhood measles vaccines to the affected northeastern part of the country, where Boko Haram Islamist terrorists are operating, according to the AP.
The World Health Organization (WHO) said the virus had been circulating unnoticed in the area for many years.
Boko Haram extremists have in the past prevented vaccination and even killed doctors.
Their attacks also prevented doctors from reaching the areas where children with measles were found on Thursday.
The disabled baby came from a part of Nigeria that had just been liberated from Boko Haram.
Michel Zaffran, WHO's head of the section responsible for the eradication of measles, told the BBC that vaccination in Nigeria would begin next week.
The Islamic radical group Boko Haram has been active in Borno state for a long time.
The area was not made available to international organizations and governments until early this year, when Boko Haram was able to weaken substantially in this part of the country.
Nigerian Health Minister Isaac Adewole admitted that the new cases of measles are a great disappointment for the country, as Nigeria wanted to announce that the measles had been eradicated in Nigeria next year.
WHO warned that it is possible that the disease, although not present for two years, has spread among children.
Children under the age of five will be vaccinated now.
In 2012, Nigeria accounted for half of all measles cases worldwide.
While measles was present in 125 countries in 1988, it is now present in only three areas - Afghanistan and Pakistan, and northern Nigeria.
The Pope met with former prostitutes in Rome.
He was listening to the moving stories of fallen women.
Pope Francis met with 20 former prostitutes who had escaped from a gang of thugs thanks to the police.
The pope listened to their hard life stories and urged them to look to the future with confidence.
Francis wanted to raise awareness of human trafficking and call for a stronger fight against it.
Pope Francis met 20 former prostitutes in Rome who had been freed from the power of a gang of thugs by the police.
The head of the Catholic Church listened to the inspired stories of fallen women for more than an hour and then urged them to look to the future with confidence, a Vatican spokesman said.
Among the former prostitutes visited by Francis were six women from Romania, four from Albania, seven from Nigeria, and one from Tunisia, Italy, and Ukraine.
Their average age is around 30.
All were subjected to cruel physical violence during forced prostitution, according to the Vatican.
The visit was intended to draw attention to human trafficking and call for an intensified fight against it, the pope's spokesman said.
Francis often points to the fate of people on the margins of society.
For example, on Thursday he had lunch with Syrian refugees who arrived in the Vatican in April and June of this year at his personal invitation.
France is going to attack the jihadist factories.
But without the help of Muslims, it won't work.
France has Muslims to help it fight radical Islamism.
In addition, Prime Minister Manuel Valls' government is planning major changes to the functioning of mosques and the education of clergy.
Since last December, we've closed 20 mosques and a day of prayer.
And others will follow, the interior minister announced.
There are over a hundred jihadist factories in the country.
"If Muslims do not help the state fight those who violate public liberty, it will become increasingly difficult for France to guarantee this freedom", declared Prime Minister Manuel Valls.
In particular, it intends to ensure that only imams educated in France preach in mosques and prayer houses.
At the same time, he wants to stop funding mosques from abroad.
Currently, about 20 percent of the money for the construction of new mosques comes from abroad, mostly from Morocco, Algeria and the Gulf countries.
And that's why they get preachers to mosques that can spread radicalism in France.
"Our country must show that Islam is compatible with democracy", the prime minister added.
The key to achieving these goals will be the new French Islamic Foundation.
It should serve as a bridge between the secular state and the Muslim minority.
No more foreign money.
The country is now home to the French Foundation for Islam, founded in 2005 by then Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin.
By then, the Foundation had already contributed to the transparency of financial flows between mosques and the countries that finance their construction.
But the institutions soon became entangled in internal contradictions and rivalries.
"It's a total failure", Valls recently noted.
The French political scene has been mired in a debate about a new institution to replace a non-profit foundation since the January 2015 attack on Charlie Hebdo.
All of this has accelerated further terrorist attacks in France carried out by radical Islamists in the name of the Islamic State.
French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve recently announced that a new foundation would be established in October this year.
It will have two main tasks - to secure funding for mosques from domestic sources and also to supervise the imams.
It is unclear where he will get the money to build not only new mosques but also various educational centers.
But there are a few suggestions that are being considered.
One of them is a special fee or tax on halal food.
In practice, halal food vendors would be paid to provide certification.
Some of that money would go right to the foundation's treasury.
The contribution of 10 to 20 euros (270 to 540 crowns) could then be paid by French pilgrims going to Mecca.
Every year, about 30,000 travel to Saudi Arabia for their traditional pilgrimage.
And not only that.
According to the Prime Minister, only preachers who have gone through special education programs at French universities should be allowed to work in mosques in the future.
This should ensure that the preaching is in harmony with democracy.
We're going to close the radical mosques.
The French government is also in a campaign against the radicals.
And others will follow, the interior minister recently announced.
There is no place in France for those who declare hatred in mosques and disrespect some of the principles of our country, such as equality between women and men.
It is estimated that there are about 2,500 mosques and prayer houses in the country.
It is estimated that about 120 of them are influenced by radical Islam.
Since 2012, the authorities have expelled about 80 imams, and several dozen more are considering expelling.
But not everyone thinks that the government's actions can have a significant impact on radicalism.
Those who want to radicalize will do the same.
This is not happening in mosques, young people are radicalizing themselves on the Internet, said Severine Labat, an expert at the National Center for Scientific Research.
Dr. Kelemen lost the first round of the sprint to star Baugem.
The Czech road cyclist must fight to reach the semi-finals in the relay.
After progressing from the sprint qualifiers to the top 18, track cyclist Pavel Kelemen at the Rio Olympics lost in the first round to French superstar Gregory Baugé, the defending silver medalist from the previous London Games.
He's got to fight his way to the semifinals on the road.
27 riders took part in the Royal Race and the current Czech best runner set a record time of 14.
He got the flight ticket in 9,969 seconds.
In the main knockout stage, he was expected to be the fifth Bauga in qualifying, who already has bronze from Rio in the team sprint.
The Frenchman was finally able to take advantage of the experience, but he kept an eye on the progress.
The gold-medal player Jason Kenny was a great performer.
The 28-year-old Briton ran the third fastest double in history and won the qualifying event in an Olympic record time of 9,551.
He was then, as expected, able to consult with the last of the advancing Germans, Maximilian Levy.
The British quartet, with Bradley Wiggins, also succeeded in setting a new world record of 3:50.570 in the 4K race and advanced to the final.
The British's record of 3:51,659, set four years after the London Olympics, has been improved by more than a second.
Young doctors are pushing for fresh air in the industry
Representatives of the young doctors have gathered to approve new steps in their dispute over the new treaty.
The Young Doctors Council (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) must request the whole Council to support further sectoral actions from the beginning of September.
The JDC says the ministers have failed to resolve the issues regarding the treaty.
Young doctors and medical students voted in July to reject the BMA's contract.
It was rejected by 58% of its elected members.
In a letter to members posted on Twitter on Thursday night, JDC President Ellen McCourt said the government remained silent on the issues, leading to the contract being rejected.
She said: In this light, the JDC Executive decided by vote to reject the proposed new treaty altogether and to call for new formal negotiations on all issues.
In response to the government's silence, today the JDC Executive Board formally requested a special meeting of the BMA Board to approve the current programme of advanced sectoral actions from the beginning of September.
The dispute has led the young doctor to call six strikes this year, including the first general strike in NHS history.
The BMA's Young Physicians' Leader, Dr. Johann Malawana, resigned after a decision to reject the agreed terms of the contract that the BMA recommended.
He told BMA members in pre-voting meetings before 54,000 young doctors and medical students that the deal was good and should be accepted.
After the vote, the Minister of Health said the contract would be a burden on doctors in England.
Russia and Turkey: Alliance of the Uncompromising?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and announce the formal end of an eight-month-long verbal war and economic sanctions.
But while Vladimir Putin welcomed the Turkish adversary in the luxurious hall of the palace in St. Petersburg, I had the impression that Ankara wanted more of this reconciliation.
It's a handshake, yes.
But Putin didn't smile, and he barely radiated warmth, even by his measured standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, has repeatedly referred to his dear friend, Mr Putin, five times, one report said.
I didn't count it.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to pre-crisis levels, but even better.
The next day, a local newspaper reported that Erdogan acted as if nothing bad ever happened.
I think his enthusiasm was the exact opposite.
But the lingering cold that radiated from Putin showed that the Russian leader had forgotten nothing.
The real cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening speech: the shooting down of a Russian fighter jet by Turkey on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction was furious.
Putin was shooting himself around and accusing Ankara of stabbing Moscow in the back.
The more the insult was, the more it came from an alleged friend.
Rebuilding true trust will be difficult, perhaps impossible.
Russian public opinion has changed since December.
For months, state-controlled media has been leading a massive nationwide campaign against Ankara.
Suddenly it seemed like the Turks were responsible for everything.
More serious was the accusation by top officials that Erdogan's own family benefited from the illegal oil trade in parts of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He denied this.
But the official message from St. Petersburg is that it's time to move on.
After all, this meeting only happened because Putin received an apology he had asked President Erdogan for.
Russia could have declared such a victory.
The benefits of the ceasefire are clear to Ankara.
First of all, Erdogan was almost removed from power in a failed coup last month, and he needs all his friends.
The repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey have visibly shocked him as well.
There's also an economic motive.
The Russian sanctions have had a hard impact - notably the cancellation of charter flights that carry several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.
This figure has decreased by almost 90%.
As for Russia, tour operators and charter companies will certainly rest here if flights resume.
They make money on the Mediterranean tourism at the end of the season.
Even this week, state television promised cheaper fruits and vegetables when agricultural commodities from Turkey were allowed back in.
Tourists there, tomatoes back here, as reported in Vedemosti newspaper.
But the visit had another political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry at the West for what it considers a weak response to the coup attempt.
In addition, the longstanding hostility of the long-running talks on EU accession and Putin's accession - who longs to take advantage of the cold and break Turkey's ties with the West.
The Russian leader certainly earned bonus points when Ankara asked him for the help of elected authorities after the coup attempt.
You must understand that for Moscow, which has a deep-seated fear of regime change, it is given.
So the summit in this magnificent, seaside palace of Russia and Turkey allowed me to show what one of my analysts described as the "Alliance of the Uncompatible" -- how the forces of two countries that feel rejected and exploited by the West are united.
However, despite their public appeal, there are fundamental differences between the two countries.
The first is Syria, where Moscow recently took on the role of a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey are on opposite sides.
After nearly three hours of initial talks, the two presidents reported at a press conference that they had not even mentioned the issue.
The Turkish President deliberately avoided answering a question about the differences between them, while Putin decided to highlight those differences.
There is no clear agreement that would allow the two countries to find common ground on the Syrian issue.
But after months of open hostility - and given the risk of total disaster when NATO member Turkey shot down a Russian fighter jet - it's certainly better that the two leaders at least talk together again.
Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for customers outside Scotland
According to the bank's CEO, the RBS brand is to be repressed into a role back office.
Royal Bank of Scotland will be lost to customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank's global ambitions.
She flooded them when she nearly disappeared eight years ago and had to be redeemed from debt.
At the time, strategic brands used RBS to protect other consumer finance brands.
It cost millions of pounds to sponsor international sport, from the Six Nations Rugby Championship to the champion Andy Marraye.
But now it's decided that it's better to give more prominence to national brands.
Royal Bank of Scotland will be used for Scottish customers, but will not launch new transactions.
All references to RBS in England and Wales, except headquarters and stock-code, will be changed to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other smaller private banking brands that are getting more prominent - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank.
During our visits to customers and employees in Inverness-shire, McEwan answered Ross McEwan's questions.
BBC Scotland said: "The RBS brand will no longer be our investment brand and the brand our employees work for, because we are now becoming a much more branded bank".
Because the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
Now I'm saying that we no longer have global aspirations, we have domestically focused efforts.
Each of these brands will represent something completely different in their own communities, and our employees will work under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will not continue its sponsorship of the Six Nations Championship, and has prepared a profile of individual brands sponsoring the sport.
"The time has come for us to move to a brand bank, because the fundamental question we are asking ourselves is how to focus on becoming a better bank for customers", said the CEO.
Three years ago, it would have been very cynical to say that we would be a great bank for customers and that they would have introduced the brands.
But along with the way we've been focusing on customer needs rather than our own, I think there's a lot of change going on.
We can repeat these marks, I think the time is right.
Frankie Dettori at Newmarket riding the Predilection led to the 3,000th winner.
Dettori is spraying champagne after a double win at Newmarket brought him 3,000 wins.
Jockeye Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th British victory at Newmarket on Friday.
He achieved this milestone with his second victory of the evening at his local track - the Predilection horse, trained by John Gosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to achieve this in the flat-out.
His predecessors include Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
Three-time champion Dettori, who had previously won on the Ghayyar horse, said, "It's strange.
I'm very impressed because my family is here too.
I'm extremely glad that happened in Newmarket, because this is where I anchored 30 years ago.
It's not a big event, it's not Royal Ascot - it's Friday night on Earth with 20,000 people.
I feel relieved and very grateful.
Dettori is congratulating when he brings in the Predilection after his victory.
Two jockeys have achieved this milestone in obstacle course racing - jockeys champion Richard Johnson and 20-time retired champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who has led more than 4,300 winners to the finish line during his record-breaking career.
Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4,493 career wins
Frankie is one of the greatest jockeys of modern times, and it's no surprise that he's reached a milestone that only a few riders have before him.
He's stylish and strong, but it's his tactical finesse that sets him apart from the other riders in the riding.
He's a fantastic racing ambassador, and his enthusiasm and charisma have attracted fans to this sport for years.
A few weeks ago, I told Frankie at Epsom that if he wasn't just racing on weekends and big races, he'd have 6,000 winners already!
But the truth is, Frankie has been riding the winner in the UK for most of his 30-year career, and that's really something.
He's a lively character, which is good for British racing, but more importantly, he's an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated his success with his famous flying jump.
From the flying finishes to the flying jumps, Frankie Dettori was the messenger of British flat racing for two decades.
It was like riding a mountain bike.
He won countless major races, including his famous Ascot Grand Prix, but he also survived a plane crash and was banned from the race due to drugs.
Three years ago, he first stagnated when he returned after a six-month ban, but he showed incredible inner strength and, despite all the doubters, he returned in his best shape.
And it may not be the last time - Dettori has already stated that he would like to continue racing until at least 50 years old.
Russian President Putin has fired the head of the presidential office Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly dismissed Sergei Ivanov as head of the presidential office on Friday.
Ivanov was one of Putin's closest associates for many years.
The 60-year-old Ivanov was appointed as the Special Representative for Ecology and Transport.
The Kremlin statement said that Putin had removed Ivanov from his post as head of the Russian presidential office, but did not state a reason.
He will be replaced by Anton Vajno, who has been Ivanov's deputy since 2012.
44-year-old Vyno was once a diplomat.
Born in Tallinn, the capital of Estonia, in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the Embassy in Tokyo.
The website (in Russian) states that he later served as head of the Presidential Protocol and the Presidential Office.
When he was appointed, he said, "Thank you for your trust".
I believe the most important task of the administration is to support your activities as head of state in terms of drafting laws and controlling the extent to which your instructions are followed.
Putin on Friday told Russian television that Ivanov had asked him to be relieved of his post and recommended that Vajno be replaced.
Will it convince you to smile?
This move has completely mystified Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov was for a long time one of Vladimir Putin's closest associates and like Putin, worked for the KGB.
As head of the presidential office, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin that was broadcast on state television, both men said they were leaving the post of head of the presidential office at their own request.
But the smiles in the cameras convinced only a few people -- especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
So this is the result of some power struggle?
No one knows yet.
But the official claim that a man once thought to be a possible president is suddenly eager to lead Russia's environmental policy has met with great distrust.
The Kremlin website quotes remarks to Putin, in which Ivanov states: "It is true that in 2012 I asked you in an interview to entrust me with this very difficult post, even a problematic post, for four years.
Apparently, I was the head of the presidential office for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
He previously served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and previously worked for the State Security Committee (KGB), like Putin.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was in charge of the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov one of his five closest associates.
At one time, there was even speculation that Ivanov could become Putin's successor at the head of the state after his second term, because a third term would be unconstitutional for Putin.
But this post was taken over by another close Putin associate, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister just three and a half years later before returning to the presidency.
Thomas Gibson, the star of the series Criminal Minds, was released after shooting the director
Gibson was involved in a physical exchange of views on stage in Los Angeles last month.
The ABC and CBS television stations that produce the series announced in a joint statement its release.
Gibson, who played special agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized Thursday before announcing his firing.
There were creative differences on stage and disagreements.
I'm sorry this happened, he said in a statement.
According to a statement from ABC and CBS, details of how Gibson's character will disappear from the series, which follows the stories of a team of FBI agents, will be released later.
The 45-year-old actress, who is best known for her starring roles in the sitcom Dharma and Greg, has been with the show since its first series in 2005.
"I love the idea of a criminal and for the past 12 years I have put my heart and soul into it", Gibson said in a statement released Friday.
I was hoping to be in it until the end, but that's not gonna happen now.
I would like to express my gratitude to the writers, producers, actors, our amazing team and most of all the great fans that this show could have hoped for.
The series is expected to return for a twelfth series on September 28.
In Banff, they mysteriously landed in a fish garden.
A man from Banff Township asked for help identifying the fish that appeared in his garden.
Kevin Bain thinks 75 pieces of fish could be sand dunes left there by the water crease.
Bain, who lives about 500 meters [500 feet] from the sea, posted a short video of his find on the Periscope Channel, believing that someone could help him explain how about five centimeters of fish got into his garden.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connecting to Fife
The project is expected to be completed by May 2017 at a cost of £1.35 billion.
Engineers connected the north platform to Queensferry Crossing and the viaduct - a bridge now connecting to Fife.
This is the first of four closures among the four platforms that are now almost completed around each of the three pillars of the bridge.
Part of the bridge from Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It has 10,000 tons of iron and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 rope.
The project, which will cost £1.35 billion, is due to be completed by May 2017.
Economic Secretary Keith Brown visited the building today and was among the first to come from the mainland to the bridge.
He said, "This is a historic moment and a symbolic moment in the building of Queensferry Crossing.
In this project, we are all witnessing how, on an impressive scale, construction engineers used over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel to build this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the closure between the viaduct and the bridge's platform was a delicate operation that required extraordinary precision.
More than 79% of the total area of the bridge is now in place, and concrete for the final part of the platform is now being poured into Rosythe, so the entire platform is ready to be lifted to the bridge.
Michael Martin, project manager for Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: "The first stop in the construction of any bridge is always an important milestone.
In this amazing project, this closure represents the pinnacle of the land-building industry.
After installing the last part of the road platform and connecting it to the North Tower expansion platform, we had to close the last gap on the north side - toward the mainland.
We did this by stretching the northern approach viaduct 700 millimeters south.
This was a massive and at the same time very delicate operation.
It's massive because the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons, and it had to be pulled up by about 3 percent.
Delicate because the tolerance the team worked with was very small -- only a few millimeters in each direction.
Thankfully, everything went very well.
Rescue in Moelfre Bay: Three men are lucky to be alive
Three men are lucky to be alive after being washed away by the water from their fishing boat off Anglesey.
Moelfre RNLI rescue boat station alerted at 13:20 British time on Friday after the crew witnessed the incident in Moelfre Bay.
All three men tried to swim to safety while their boat continued uncontrollably.
"We saw their boat circling near them and we thought the worst", said Moelfre lifeboat captain Vince Jones.
"A strong wind happily swept it away from them before we left", he added.
Two men were rescued by a local fishing boat, a third man in his 60s was found without a life jacket, exhausted as he held the gun.
All were transferred aboard a coastal lifeboat and transported back to the lifeboat station.
Jones said, "Three men thrown into the water are happy to be alive and completely unharmed.
The boat's engine had a rope to shut down for emergency, but somehow it was cut off from the person driving the boat when the overturn happened.
Someone up above was holding a protective arm over those boys.
The judge refuses to hear the case because of the Fat Man's wife.
Petr Tluchoř is one of three MPs who were allegedly supposed to get political traffic from Prime Minister Nečasa and his then-head of cabinet, Jana Nagy, a lucrative post for political concessions.
In 2012, the tax package was approved.
Schneider, Fux and the Fat Man made it possible for him to resign.
Then they came up in positions of influence in state-owned companies.
That's why they also faced bribery charges and ended up in custody for a month.
The court said it was unlawful, and they received almost 2 million crowns in compensation.
Fat man is now testifying in the case, after the Supreme Court intervened.
His wife works in the fruit market courthouse, settling civil disputes.
However, Judge Helena Králová wants to be cautious and avoid possible objections.
The case will likely be handled by another Prague court district.
The king has already twice pardoned Jan Nečas, formerly Nagy.
It was allegedly the misuse of military intelligence to track down Prime Minister Nečas Radka's first wife.
In this case, the Fat Man didn't act.
According to Jaroslav Ortman, the lawyer is unnecessarily overreacting.
I don't think impartiality can be interpreted in such a way that a court can rule out a witness having a wife or relatives in court.
I'm afraid there's nothing to judge then, he noted for the diary.
"It seems to me a little slippery", he added.
Roman Boček, a former civil servant, is also charged in the political traffic case.
But according to his lawyer, Peter Toman, any objection would have a chance of success.
On 13 June, the Prague 1 District Court heard the charges of former Prime Minister Peter Nečase's chief of staff, Jana Nagy (now Nečase) and other defendants in the case of misuse of military intelligence.
In the picture, Timeless comes to court with her husband.
Fat girl was supposed to be handling the Peroutko rumours.
For example, the exhibition's wife was to judge President Milos Zeman's statements about the democratic prewar journalist Ferdinand Peroutk.
Zeman said he was sympathetic to Adolf Hitler.
One of the school girls is dead!
The girl was apparently killed in an Allied air raid.
She flew to Syria with two friends of her age last February from London's Gatwick Airport.
The British Home Office has not commented on the report of her death.
Young Londoners who fled their homes were reportedly smuggled into Syria via the Turkish border.
Shamima Begum, Amira Abase and Kadiz Sultan have reportedly targeted their next former classmate from London's Bethnal Green Academy.
Last year's incident sparked a huge wave of attention and tension in relations between Britain and Turkey.
British security forces estimate that about 600 British Muslims have travelled to Syria so far, including about 50 young women and girls.
Many of them joined the radical IS and other groups.
Those who return home are a terrorist threat to Britain.
A dream job for a hundred thousand.
A well-paid job that doesn't even require a college degree.
That's what a goat's work looks like at first glance.
And often the other.
The advantage is not only an extremely high salary (you can earn up to CZK 180 000 in Prague for IT) but also extreme benefits.
The reason is the huge shortage of IT specialists.
There are thousands of specialists missing.
It is estimated that there are almost 20,000 IT specialists missing in the Czech Republic.
Grafton's staff statistics show that programmers, developers, network engineers and application specialists are among the most wanted.
Candidates can choose from several job offers.
The candidates are not competing for the job position, but the job position for the candidates, comments Jitka Součková, marketing manager at Grafton Recruitment.
College is not a necessity.
Higher education is not a requirement for young people.
Higher education is a good foundation and is an overall indicator of a candidate's intelligence and education, but it has often little to do with developmental knowledge.
Developers must constantly learn new things, which a graduate college will not replace, says Petr Kubačka, director of Monster Career CZ.
He makes the most money in Prague.
The wages of the Irish are well above the Republican average.
The biggest money will come from Prague and Brno, but in the regions, it's not like a hit parade anymore.
"The wage conditions in Brno are comparable to those in Prague", Cubacki confirms.
The highest earnings are achieved by the technical directors.
In Prague and Brno, they can get 120,000 to 180,000 CZK.
In other regions, wages are lower, but they also do not fall below CZK 80,000.
IT project managers are also in demand.
They can earn $60,000 to $100,000 when they get on board.
The fight is about graduates.
While in some professions graduates often have to go straight to the job office, in the case of apprentices, this is not the case.
If companies are dragging and overpaying a professional from another company, they're happy to reach for a graduate.
They can raise him according to their own will.
They can't run without a tongue.
Knowledge of a foreign language is useful in any profession, but a minimum of good English is required for the young.
Knowledge of at least one foreign language is a requirement for some IT positions.
On the other hand, we find a lot of cases where companies are looking for a person who is highly educated and experienced and content with only an average knowledge of English.
However, if, for example, a support worker is fluent in several foreign languages, it is of interest to his employer because he can serve more customers from different countries, adds the Cuban director.
Yo, Google, there is paradise.
The only thing that can be done is to envy Czech employees at Google.
Of course, flexible working hours, homework, and other shorter-term opportunities are available to them, not just for moms.
"The company provides newlywed fathers with an additional four weeks of leave after the birth of their child", says Martin Jonek, a Google spokesperson.
Whipping also includes healthcare for employees and families, food, transportation, training, wellness or massage directly at the workplace.
Whoever wants to learn, they have the green light, and it doesn't matter what new thing they want to learn.
But that doesn't end the benefits.
A free fridge like that is definitely not for throwing away.
A healthy lunch (in some places including breakfast and dinner) is available on site every day.
In addition, all offices have so-called micro-kitchens, where people always find healthy snacks, the speaker reveals.
And so that nothing is thrown away, what's not eaten is put in boxes that employees can take home in the evening.
And the reason for these incredible advantages in the Czech Republic?
Create a creative and motivating environment!
"For Google, it's not about employees sitting in the office for eight hours a day, but about the results of initiatives or projects, moves or developments, ideas and innovative solutions", adds the spokesperson.
The UN has sharply criticized Bulgaria for criminalizing refugees.
Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, the UN human rights commissioner, accused Bulgaria on Thursday of systematically violating human rights by criminalizing refugees.
The official strategy of the Bulgarian government "exalts serious concerns about Bulgaria's non-compliance with international law", warned Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein in a statement.
He noted that "it is particularly disturbing to see how important and influential public figures are publicly expressing support for criminal armed fighters who are daringly organizing a manhunt for refugees at the Bulgarian-Turkish border".
"One of the most serious problems is that almost all people who cross into Bulgarian territory irregularly are automatically arrested", Zeid stressed.
Worse still, they are often prosecuted and imprisoned - for a year or more - if they try to leave the country.
Their attempts to leave the country are criminalized despite the fact that everyone has the right under international law to leave any country, including their own.
Bulgaria has detained 14,000 migrants this year, up from 21,000 last year during the same period.
Pokémon Go - a rewarding pursuit of health and happiness
It's fascinating to watch the world change.
Over the past decade, many people have lamented that teenagers and children no longer play outside and prefer to spend their free time in front of screens.
Pokémon Go takes people off their sofas and leads them to activity.
Time spent in front of screens has been reduced to television, later to video games, and more recently to smartphones.
It's great to see that technology and activities out there are not mutually exclusive.
I'm talking, of course, about the fashion of Pokémon Go, a character-based app that first appeared in video games in the late 1990s (later came cartoon, card game, and more).
As with many cultural phenomena, there was a decline in interest here before the release of this new game in early July in the US, Australia and New Zealand.
The introduction of the other countries was then postponed due to the huge interest which led to the overload of the servers.
Pokémon Go has gained more users in a matter of days than Tinder and almost as many users as Twitter.
How does it work?
In short, players on their smartphones go out to look for Pokémon they track with GPS, and when they find them, they can either take a picture or capture them.
Mania has captured a generation who played the game at a younger age, lifted her from her seat and drove her out to find Pokémon.
In the United States, this game has led to a significant increase in the number of steps the average person takes every day.
The Apple smartwatch app Cardiogram, which tracks 35,000 users, recently reported to the Washington Post that within two days of the game's launch, the number of people tracked who exercised for 30 minutes a day jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company has no information about who is playing Pokémon Go - they only see rough exercise level data.
Many public campaigns that seek to get people to get up from the couch and be active every day have fallen to the ground because most public health messages are boring and targeted at people who don't look good.
Yet, the importance of exercise must not be underestimated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce their risk of cancer or depression.
Physical activity involves controlling weight, high blood pressure, diabetes, and a long list of benefits that we can't fully list here.
But the beauty of Pokémon Go is that people go out and do something they enjoy.
You're covering the three pillars of health -- exercise, fresh air, sunshine -- and fun.
Some people even make new friends while hunting for Pokémon.
As is often the case, there are, of course, boring patrons who look for any excuse to complain.
And yes, someone can come through the door.
What, like?
He's made a breakthrough.
In their day, smart phone apps like Fitbit could track our activity, but they didn't give us a reason to do anything like this game.
The news is turned around and interest in it begins to wane at some point.
However, with the success of Pokémon, there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with real-world activity and help a lot of people in the pursuit of activity, health and fitness.

Simone Biles won gold in the women's gymnastics world championships
Forget the pressure.
Forget about the excitement.
Simone Biles is immune to all of this.
Dynamic on the jump.
No effort at the box office.
When it comes to the free, everyone's dumb.
Excellent at everything.
And now, finally, the Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast went straight for the world title in the mixed relay on Thursday and beat the others in full line under the Olympic spotlight.
The total score of 62,198 clearly confirmed her lead ahead of silver medalist and finalist Alya Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafin.
Simone Biles (USA) performed in the final of the individual gymnastics event at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on Thursday.
Biles became the fourth American in a row to win multiple fights, and the fifth overall, when she confirmed her reputation as the best gymnast of her generation and perhaps the best ever.
When her overall final score was on the board and her long journey to that point was over, tears came to her face.
This achievement puts her in the same league of unique athletes of her time as Michael Phelps, who added a new dimension to her sport:
Biles has dominated her sport for the past three years, winning 15 medals at the world championships - including 10 golds. Her impressive line-up is a mix of ambition and precision, and 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton named her the best gymnast she's ever seen.
Her final test was in Brazil, not between Biles and the rest of the races, but between herself and the burden of too much expectation.
Anything other than returning home to my family in Spring, Texas with a handful of gold medals would be seen as a disappointment.
Simone Biles (USA), left, and Aly Raisman hugging after winning gold and silver medals in the women's singles final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on Thursday.
Biles won her first on Tuesday as a shout-out at the celebration of the departing national team coordinator Martha Karolyi.
Biles insists that she never looked ahead on her long journey to the summit, which is not entirely true.
Part of her solo set - the one that contains her typical triple salto with a double turn - is set to Latin music that would fit right into the streets outside the Rio Olympic Arena.
It's not a coincidence.
The girl was adopted by her grandparents as a baby and her talent was discovered by coach Aimee Boorman's mother on the way to the gym where Boorman trained and gained strength.
The mixed doubles competition hasn't lost since the summer of 2013 - a winning streak that can continue as long as Biles wants.
Even though Mustafina took over the short lead with two laps, it was just an illusion.
The boxing and the free throw -- where Biles defends the world championship -- are waiting.
She got back to the front with 15,433 points per game and finished with 15,933 points in the free throw.
Raisman hugged her gently as they waited for the final score - a mere formality - and around the glittering red, white and blue shades Biles came tears as a wish she had written down in her diary as a child was fulfilled.
Raisman's performance was somewhat of a payback for the Olympics four years ago when she shared a third place with Mustafina, but she won bronze for the sum of the three best sets.
This time, the 22-year-old captain of the team the Americans call "babbage" was way ahead.
After her vacations, she sent a crowd of airy kisses, defeated by a return that at times seemed uncertain.
For Bilesova, the contribution this 19-year-old athlete posted on Twitter this week, where it became a huge hit, has a whole new meaning:
Police: Three victims in a serial killer case shot while listening to music in a car
According to a police report released Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl were killed in the most significant attack of the decade, the first-ever serial killer in Phoenix, when they were shot while sitting in a car, talking and listening to music.
Authorities have announced that Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot on June 12 in a car parked on the driveway.
The report said the gunman was standing next to the passenger and fired eight gunshot wounds, then fled in another vehicle.
Police say the robbery is not a triple homicide because the attacker did not take the wallet or the $2,900 that one of the adult victims had with him.
Phoenix police spokesman, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, said investigators are looking into whether the shooting had anything to do with any of the four previous attacks.
In two predominantly Hispanic neighborhoods, there were nine attacks in four months, killing seven people and wounding two others.
"It's happening in the villa neighborhood outside the house", Howard told CBS's KPHO branch earlier this month.
Police believe the suspect used several cars, including a brown Nissan from the late '90s, a black BMW from the late '90s, and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Investigators declined to disclose what evidence led them to conclude that the attacks were linked and were carried out by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was taken to the hospital, where she later died of her injuries.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter Maleah died on the scene.
A police witness said it was not unusual for women to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
Authorities also released a police report of a shooting that targeted an empty van just half an hour before the triple murder, which police believe was carried out by this serial killer.
Investigators found the bullets and put a bullet in the seat and under the hood.
Mother of a 6-year-old child with microcephaly:
Edmund Picciuto, like most children his age, loves singing, toys, and of course, his mother.
But unlike his peers, he suffers from microcephaly, a genetic disorder that his mother, Elizabeth Picciut, did not know about during her pregnancy.
When he first came home, I was the first to think I couldn't handle this.
I can't do this.
I'm not ready for this.
Which is not true at all - you're obviously ready for it, she said.
She and her husband Vincent have learned that Edmund may never know them and may not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be placed in a nursing home.
"My first reaction was that I thought people didn't do that anymore", Picciut explains.
Edmund walks with the help of a pedal.
He couldn't sit or crawl until he was three, and he still can't talk.
But some of the boundaries are already being met.
He walks with a helmet and he bikes.
He also loves to play with his two brothers and loves to sing.
Elizabeth is giving a sign language, which Edmund uses to say, "Please sing to me".
"We're teaching him sign language", Picciut told CBS News.
But it's not common sign language - it says Edmund invented some of the signs himself.
Microcephaly can arise from a number of different conditions: genetic, as in Edmund's case, and infections caused by viruses in pregnancy, such as measles or Zika.
Symptoms and prognosis may differ substantially.
It's too early to tell what impact Zika will have on the lives of those infected.
Picciut reminds me of an emotional tax that an uncertain future puts on itself.
I keep asking myself, what's next?
What's next?
And she's still not sure.
In fact, I never asked what the overall prognosis was because I don't expect anyone to be able to tell me at all.
But Picciut has a message of encouragement for mothers of all children who suffer from birth defects caused by the Zika virus.
Things are getting better.
You know, it's gonna be better.
You'll love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rain and flooding have called for rescue efforts in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rain and heavy flooding in Louisiana forced the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday, and the state is expected to receive more rainfall on Saturday.
The National Weather Service (NWS) reports that after extreme flooding, a number of rivers in southeastern Louisiana and southern Mississippi are washing up and threatening widespread flooding.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and aid is already on the way to affected areas.
Mike Steele, spokesman for the governor's Office of National Security and Emergency Preparedness, said they're getting applications for vehicles for driving in the water, boats and sandbags.
Steele said that Tangipahoa County alone asked for 10,000 bags of sand.
Flood patrol will remain in most of southern Louisiana until Saturday.
The Meteorological Service said in a statement that there could be another 8 to 13 centimeters above sea level.
In southern Alabama, flood control was on alert Friday as rain continued in the Mobile area.
The Comite River at Baton Rouge and the Amite River at Denham Springs are projected to peak this weekend.
Meteorologist Alek Krautmann said both rivers could flood a number of homes in the suburbs of Baton Rouge.
He further stated that the danger is flooding in Ascension County, where these discharged streams will flow slowly into Lake Maurepas.
The Tickfaw River, just south of the Mississippi state line in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached its highest point on record as early as 9 a.m. local time on Friday.
Rescue teams are still picking up people from tidal waters in Amite and Wilkinson counties in southwest Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson were among those rescued earlier Friday at Gloster.
Hansford, 62, said that the water from Beaver Creek, which is normally more than 120 feet from his home, rose rapidly overnight.
He said he was alerted by his other stepson, who lives nearby.
"We woke up and the water was coming", Hansford said.
We had it all the way to our waist.
According to his wife, it's the highest level he's ever experienced on the river in 48 years.
Hansford said he and all members of his family are disabled and he's the only one who can swim.
Hansford said emergency workers rescued all three huge military-style trucks and transported them to the Gloster Fire Station, where they were kept undercover on Friday.
Krautmann said the flooding is spreading rapidly as the rain continues to fall and authorities are considering evacuating.
According to Krautmann, an observer near Livinston reported that from midnight to Friday morning, about a foot [35 cm] of rain fell.
Krautmann said the soil has been heavily soaked since Wednesday.
Authorities said heavy rain and paid travel had prompted rescues from their homes in Tangipahoa County and the cancellation of education in five school districts.
The WWL section of CBS reported that according to the Tangipahoa senior, 200 homes were flooded.
Residents were evacuated to two churches, both of which are now flooded.
Mayor Robby Miller said authorities rescued 72 people and seven pets trapped by the high tide.
Shelters were set up in Amite and Hammond for evacuees.
"They'll be able to go home when the water starts to fall", he said.
In Tangipahoa County, Hammond, more than 20 streets were closed due to flooding, and local residents were given sandbags to pick up and try to protect their homes and businesses from the water.
"The last major flooding here was in March", said city manager Lacy Landrum.
Looks like these floods are gonna be similar.
Rupert Lacy, emergency manager for Harrison County, Mississippi, said that a persistent rainfall continues along the Persian Gulf coast.
He said a couple of homes were reported flooded Thursday, but none of them showed up in the report on Friday.
Keith Townson, head of Shopper Value Foods at Amite, has lived in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in a few places I've never seen it before", Townson said, "and it's still there".
Mahaj Brown (6) - A boy shot like a rat, survived a shooting in Philadelphia
According to police, a 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, the second shooting of a 6-year-old in the city this week.
The baby's grandparents identified him for CBS Philadelphia as Mahaje Brown.
Grandparents say the boy suffered multiple gunshot wounds, including weaknesses, legs, arms and stomach, but was conscious when transported to the hospital.
"He caught it so badly, his little body was shot like a rat", his grandmother, Delores Melendez, told the station.
I can't believe this.
The boy is in critical condition and has undergone several operations.
The family told the station the boy should be cured.
He was supposed to be in the first grade of elementary school.
Mahaj Brown is one of four people shot in the Germantown area.
Three other men were shot, two aged 29 and one aged 32.
One of the men, age 29, is in critical condition, according to CBS Philadelphia, and two other victims are in stable condition.
According to the station, the child was found shot in the front seat of the vehicle along with a 29-year-old man in critical condition.
Two other victims were not in the car, and police are investigating whether any of the wounded men could be the shooter.
CBS Philadelphia investigators said there was likely a shooting between several gunmen.
We found ammunition from assault weapons belonging to various assault weapons.
Apparently, it was definitely an ongoing battle.
There were bullets on both sides of the aisle.
So it appears there were several armed combatants who were actively involved, Philadelphia Police Captain Anthony Ginaldi told the station.
Several homes and vehicles in the area were also hit.
No one was arrested, and police are reportedly reviewing the video footage.
Another six-year-old child, this time a girl, was shot in the arm by a stray bullet on Tuesday outside a home in the West Oak Lane neighborhood.
The girl is recovering and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That's exactly how I imagine the women's gymnastics team for this year's Olympics, and for a number of reasons.
First, I've been to every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the U.S. has never been so dominant.
And second, there are three gymnasts on this team, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas, and Lauren Laurie Hernandez, who have inspired so many young girls of color.
Everyone is proud to be part of this team, which is joined by Aly Raisman, who is of Jewish origin, and Madison Kocian, a Catholic.
We finally have a team that looks like America.
He also cemented the presence of black and Latino women at the top of the sport.
The number one gymnast in the last four years was an African-American.
Simone and Gabby were first and second last year.
That means something.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Dougals surprisingly became the Olympic champion and America was in the mix.
Now the world could witness the incredible performance of three-time world champions Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, who featured unexpected but masterful gymnastics figures.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American to win gold in the women's singles.
And team member Aly Raisman won silver.
We're seeing the height of sports, but it doesn't look like it in gymnastics classes in the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie made the Olympic team the same way Aly and Madison did.
They're the final five because the gymnastics team for the next Olympics will be made up of only four athletes, and this is the last year that Marta Karolyi is coaching.
The reality is that gymnastics is a financially demanding sport, and gymnasts train mostly in private gym clubs, which are maintained by parents who pay for training, equipment, travel, dresses, competition fees, hotel accommodation (for coaches and their trustees and families).
Most of these sports clubs are in affluent suburban areas that can support activities.
These clubs provide all training for gymnasts and are a costly and long-term commitment for gymnasts and gymnasts' families.
Aimee Boorman, coach Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach Laurie Hernandez, both coached athletes when they started in gymnastics.
It is our duty to bring gymnastics training that is more accessible and accessible to the countless communities of young girls who have inspired Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I founded the gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
In my organizations, where we offer free or low-cost gymnastics in Harlem to more than 15,000 young people within the city (mostly of black and Hispanic origin) and we have trained national and international champions.
In September, we'll expand into Detroit, my hometown, where we'll provide quality gymnastics to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination of the body and hard work, discipline and determination of the mind.
This combination means lifelong health benefits, success at school and at work.
It's the inspiration of this team that's going to send thousands of young girls to us who want to do gymnastics.
Participating in this sport is very important, especially for girls.
It's a very exciting time.
Thank you, Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison, for demonstrating your girl strength and winning Olympic team gold, and thank you for motivating so many young girls of all backgrounds to embark on a journey to become healthy, strong, and successful young women.
After Jeremy Hunt's proposal is rejected, young doctors are ready to go on strike.
Ministers hoped that after the revised agreement was signed with representatives of the British Medical Association (BMA), a resolution would be reached to the disagreements over the changes, but 58 percent of the 37,000 young doctors who took part in the election rejected the agreement.
Hunt revealed plans to enforce the contract in July, saying the NHS was in no man's land and that further delays would have a detrimental impact on staff and patients.
The first young doctors have already signed a new contract that includes changes to work schedules at night and on weekends to improve care during non-social hours.
Dr Ellen McCourt, Chair of the BMA Young Physicians Commission, said in a statement last night: "Young doctors are still very concerned about the proposed contract, especially in the sense that there will be an increase in the current labour crisis and thus fair treatment of all doctors.
Just eight weeks before the first group of doctors signs a new contract, progress must be made and time runs out.
The BMA's efforts to resolve disputes through negotiations have been met with reluctance to engage dr. and often deafening silence on the part of the government.
And that's despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month that this option is still open.
Jeremy Hunt must now act, push for coercion and address the concerns of young doctors.
If that doesn't happen, then young doctors are ready to take the next step.
During the last strike in late April, almost 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 visits were postponed as nurses and specialists were called in to represent the doctors who were among the protesters.
Ministers hoped that after the revised agreement was concluded, differences on the amendments would be resolved with representatives of the British Medical Association (BMA).
The BMA wants higher weekend salaries for 54,000 young doctors who would be contracted.
Daniel Mortimer, NHS employer president, urged young doctors not to go on strike.
Mortimer said, "The workforce will achieve little or nothing, but there will be pressure on already overwhelmed teams and services and a rise in anxiety, exhaustion and disruption for patients, caregivers and their families".
Over the past two months, we have been working with the Young Physicians Council and, together with the Ministry of Health and others, we have responded positively to their concerns about the role of supervisor and informant.
Employers hoped that continued positive engagement on other important issues - such as burden-sharing, flexibility in training, further training for those returning from retirement, training costs, mutual recognition of subjects, study leave and gender pay gap - was evidence of how seriously employers, Health Education England and the Department of Health take the agreements reached with the BMA in November, February and May.
A 60 crowns a day medication can reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of heart attack-prone patients will be able to take the drug, which costs around 60 crowns (two pounds), and the authorities recommend that more patients be given it for longer periods of time.
The anticoagulant Ticagrelor reduces the risk of a relapse in people with heart disease.
The medicine is now administered for 12 months after a heart attack has occurred to reduce the risk of stroke or other seizures.
NHS watchdog NICE recommends that the drug be given to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now NHS watchdog NICE recommends that it be given to humans for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
In England, about 140,000 people suffer a heart attack each year, and a quarter of them will have another heart attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by a buildup of fat that forms a continuous layer on the walls of the arteries.
If this layer is torn off, blood clots may occur, blood may be blocked from entering the heart, and heart attack may occur.
If the clot is released, it can continue to drain the bloodstream, blocking blood flow to the brain and causing a stroke.
People who have already had a heart attack are at higher risk of another attack.
Ticagrelor, manufactured by the British company AstraZeneca and marketed under the trade name Brilique, reduces the risk by making it less likely to cause collisions.
A draft NICE directive, published today, recommends that patients receive 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months and then 60 mg of aspirin twice daily for the next three years.
Prof Carole Longson, director of the NICE Centre for Assessment of Health Technology, said: "Despite the availability of effective secondary preventive treatment, a quarter of patients who have had a heart attack will suffer another heart attack or stroke - often with devastating consequences.
The fear of repetition can have a significant negative impact on the patient's quality of life.
Ticagrelor in combination with aspirin has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
We are pleased that, with the preliminary recommendation of Ticagrelor, we can expand the treatment options available to the many thousands of people who will benefit from it.
Because information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor - in particular the risk of bleeding - beyond three years is limited, this time period is not recommended in the treatment proposal.
With the advent of computer culture, fraud has flourished in Muslim areas.
Tower Hamlets Mayor Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year for corruption, which was linked to a government report.
A culture of political correctness has led to the disregard of the widespread fraud in Muslim communities, according to a government report today.
Former Prime Minister Sir Eric Pickles has sharply criticized the police, election inspectors and the city council for ignoring voter abuse over their 'sensitivity to ethnicity and religion.'
A former community secretary, now the leader of anti-corruption campaigns, said that intimidating voters on the basis of their religion was so bad that police should set up a security guard and guard the voters outside polling stations.
He recommended that voters bring their identity card with them and be able to prove who they are in the election.
At present, voters are required to state their name and address.
The report further proposes that indelible ink be applied to the fingers of the voters when they cast their ballots to prevent a person from voting twice.
Whistleblowers should have more protection, Pickles says.
It calls for greater access to press documents from meetings and decisions taken by informal committees or working groups.
It is not only about protection against electoral fraud but also about protecting local government from the wider corruption environment and the financial fraud that goes hand in hand with it, he said.
The report was requested by Downing Street in the wake of the election scandal in Tower Hamlets, west London.
Last year, a special election court ruled that the incumbent mayor of Lutfur Rahman should be removed from office after being accused of corruption and illegal practices.
The court found that Rahman had cynically affected the religious sentiments of his Muslim community and silenced his critics on charges of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman said he campaigned to make it a religious duty for devout Muslims to vote for him.
Up to 300 votes were contested or as a result of identity theft, when a person votes and pretends to be someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud all over the country.
He expressed particular concern about the mail voting fraud - allegedly by senior members of the Muslim community during which he pressured people to vote for the candidate they had chosen.
Sir Eric, pictured here, has made several recommendations on how to clean up the electoral system, including presenting a proof of identity
Its report states: There has been evidence that vulnerable members of certain ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, have been pressured to vote at the will of the elderly, particularly in communities from Pakistan and Bangladesh.
There were concerns that... government institutions were turning a blind eye to such behavior because of the politically correct hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion.
Sir Eric has made 50 recommendations on how to clean up the system, including banning political activists from manipulating correspondence votes to prevent voter abuse.
The report, which is now being reviewed by Theresa May, also calls for more rigorous checks on registrations to prevent the use of electoral rolls for immigration fraud and benefit fraud.
Consider asking voters to present proof of identity before the vote.
Use of indelible ink on the fingers of people when voting to prevent someone from voting twice.
The systematic national controls of persons to ensure that they can vote.
Limit applications for automatic correspondence voting to three years.
Prohibit political agitators and activists from manipulating the correspondent votes and ballot envelopes submitted.
Authorise the police to set up cordonings around the polling stations.
Amend the law to make it easier to prosecute those who exert unlawful pressure under the 1983 Reform Act.
Prohibiting the taking of photographs in polling stations.
Require only Englishmen (except Wales) to work in polling stations.
Strengthen training and ensure that staff comply with the rule that voters go to polling stations individually.
Sir Eric is critical of London police and says it is surprising that no criminal charges have been brought after the Tower Hamlets case.
"The Election Court has ruled out Lutfur Rahman and his agent for litany of corruption and illegal practices", he said.
For a number of reasons, he was found guilty beyond reasonable doubt - in the power of evidence.
He also criticizes the ineffective checks on the voter registration boxes in the town hall.
Sir Eric said: "Last year's judgment in the Tower Hamlets case by the wake.
Our nation has a proud legacy of a cottage of parliamentary democracy, but the disturbing and covert spread of electoral fraud and the state of rejection by some authorities are threatening that reputation.
The madness of the cycling double of Duchess Kate and other famous double figures at the Rio Olympics
Fans of the Rio 2016 Olympics have this week become crazy about French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who looks remarkably like the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympian is far from the only athlete seeking gold this year who can boast of her own double from a number of celebrities - at least not on social media.
To celebrate the Rio Olympics and all the celebrities currently appearing on our screens, the FEMAIL women's column compiled a list of Olympians who are more than remotely like the Hollywood celebrities.
As a hunted animal: American archer Brady Ellison (left) was compared to Leonard DiCaprio from a young age
Besides Kate's twin on the cycling track, a number of people online quickly pointed out that a certain archer might be the twin of the star Leonardo DiCaprio.
U.S. archery team competitor Brady Ellison has caused a storm on Twitter after images of him showing him as a Wall Street wolf surfaced.
Brady himself noticed the media frenzy and admitted he'd heard about his likeness to Leo since he was a little boy.
"He doesn't see much of a resemblance, except maybe a beard", Brady told the Huffington Post.
He's a guy and he looks good, so I think it's a compliment.
One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 will undoubtedly be highlighted even more this year: the striking similarity between British long jumper Greg Rutherford and favorite actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina, with her big, distinctive eyes, was said to be a copy of Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And when you look at the swimming pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to the star of the Gell series Matthew Morrison for several years.
And for a change: User thinks Nathan is an athletic version of the actor from the movie Inception
Another long-standing comparison is a comparison of tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who have similarly thick eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver swimmer Yulia Efimov is proud not only of her stitching and blonde hair, but also of her Annalyn McCord, and of Nathan Adrian of the USA team, fans say he looks like an athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levit.
Famous women: soccer star Hope Sol (left) and series actress Dexter Jennifer Carpenter (right) have similar faces and eyes
Not just one: The Twitter user was very happy that others noticed the similarity
On the waves theory: According to this user there may be a reason for the similarity of pairs
One Twitter user recently expressed satisfaction on the page that the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical.
Football star Hope Sol and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter have incredibly similar faces and eyes.
Other favorite comparisons include Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to the smile of actress Laura Linney, or gymnastics gold medalist Gabby Douglas, boasting her beautifully wide smile that seems to copy the smile of Gabrielle Union, star of Bravo, girls!
CBC Olympic commentator apologizes for saying about the Chinese swimsuit that it exploded
The CBC live broadcast of the Olympics on Wednesday angered the performance analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan by commentator Byron MacDonald.
Canadian broadcaster CBC was forced to apologize after one of its commentators said that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer had stinked and exploded during the race.
Commentator Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was off when, at the end of the women's 4x200-meter freestyle relay, he started to make up his own mind.
MacDonald, who was supposed to bring revival to the CBC commentary team, among other things, said, "That little 14-year-old from China gave up, you fool".
Too much excitement, it was like smelling, it exploded.
- Thank you. - Thank you.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan (14) swam the second pole in 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canadian Taylor Ruck - and allowed the Canadians to reach China.
Viewers in Canada quickly began to respond online and were appalled by the tone and language the commentator used
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted: "The broadcaster on CBC announced that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer exploded".
The idiot didn't notice it was still on the air.
Ai Yanhan of China in the women's 4x200-meter freestyle relay final was described as: "That little 14-year-old from China gave up, you fool".
Criticism of Byron MacDonald on Twitter has come from all sides and many have called for his removal
When Twitter users learned how insensitive Byron MacDonald was, they didn't hold back.
Another user, Sarah Paradis, wrote, 'Wow #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada, and it sounds like we're a bunch of racists.
Shortly afterwards, Scott Russell, who hosted CBC's show, apologized for MacDonald's lively comment and said, "We apologize for the comment on the performance of the swimmer that leaked into the show".
It was an unfortunate choice of words, and we're sorry that happened.
CBC eventually apologized more than 90 times to people who tweeted in response to the comment
Co-commentator Scott Russell must have apologized on behalf of MacDonald.
CBC then copied and pasted their apology in response to more than 90 Twitter users who complained about comments by MacDonald's commentator
The station also quickly apologized and issued a statement.
I'm really sorry that the words were spoken, they shouldn't have been on the air.
We quickly apologized to our viewers on the air and to those who follow us on social media.
To be clear, Byron's comments were about the performance of the swimmer, not the swimmer herself.
In other words, it was an inappropriate and unfortunate choice of words.
On Thursday afternoon, Byron MacDonald apologized on the live broadcast and tried to explain his remark by saying he didn't want it to come out as a personal attack.
"I'd like to apologize for the comment I made last night after the women's staff", he said on the CBC Olympic broadcast.
I meant the performance of a swimmer and not the person of a swimmer as such.
Needless to say, I didn't mean to disrespect you, and I'm very sorry.
Customers in Primark are being molested by a woman who shamelessly tried on her underwear in the middle of a store.
When the woman undressed to try on her pants at the Primark shopping mall, shoppers were not sure which way to look.
To make matters worse, she tried to get her size down, took off her pants and put them back on the shelf.
She continued to search and finally tried four pairs of panties at a boutique in Bouverie Place, Flokestone.
Primark at Bouverie Place Mall in Folkestone, where a woman tried on her pants before returning them to the shelf
Jenny Davidson, a mother of two who was at the store at the time, said that after testing her underwear, the mysterious woman dressed again and left the store without buying anything.
She said, "People couldn't believe their eyes".
She stood in the middle of the store, took her pants off the shelf, undressed her own pants and pants, and put them on.
She didn't even try to find a discreet spot - she just stood there, stubborn like a monkey.
"Everyone just watched her take off her pants again, and obviously she didn't like it because she put them back on the shelf".
She did the same thing with three others before finally deciding that she didn't like anything, dressing up again, and leaving.
She didn't seem to care who was watching, nor would she think of the man who might buy the pants she tried.
Ms. Davidson, 33, of Kent, said: "The idea that someone takes home a pair of pants that someone else was wearing and nobody cleaned them is disgusting.
The incident happened Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidson added: "When she left, I collected the things she obviously tried to pull from the sale - which is also the only thing right".
I'd be scared to think I'd bring home new pants and find out that another woman was wearing them, taking them off and not washing them.
Primark's store spokesman said: "Primark knows about the incident that happened at our store in Folkestone on Tuesday, August 9th.
All the products concerned were withdrawn from sale.
How to Defend Yourself Against Gun Attacks With Krav Maga
The world outside is dangerous, but thanks to this video from Dailymail.com, it might be a little safer for you.
We spoke to Rhon Mizrachi, the head of the New York-based Krav Magy Federation, to find out how to deal with armed robbers from nearby locations.
This video will show you how to suddenly gain the upper hand over a bully, whether he comes in from the front or the back.
If he comes to you from behind, says Mizrachi, then the first thing you have to do is turn around to see your attacker and have a free range of fire.
Then you grab the gun between your forearms and shoulder just before you hit it in the face with your free elbow.
Then the knee follows into the weakness, and as the attacker glows in pain, you twist the gun from his hand, hit him in the face, and start to back down, holding the gun at his head.
If an armed man comes at you from the front, it's a similar technique - get your body off the firing line, grab the gun and twist it so the bully can't shoot.
At the same time, put force into the weapon and hit the attacker in the chest, then twist the weapon from its grip and start retreating, still aiming at it.
Does that sound complicated?
Watch the video, where you'll see exactly how Mizrachi does it.
But remember, the safest way to get out of a robbery - if you're not the Grand Master of Krav Maga - is to spend all the cash.
Traveler Ian Wright licks the dirtiest places in Europe into a travel guide
A British traveler decided to put his immune system and reflex to the test by licking the dirtiest and most unpleasant places in Europe.
Suffolk-based roadmap author and presenter Ian Wright, 51, has shown his immune system by using his tongue to carve a euro banknote, a piccadilly circus railing, a toilet button on a train and a Russian public telephone.
Before he scratched each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us all what he was getting into.
The experiment that inspired the film Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength produced interesting results.
The idea of slipping a button on a train that thousands of other people have used may seem completely repulsive, but the fact is that there are many more harmful bacteria in the kitchen sink, for example.
Throughout his travels through Europe, Ian Wright talked to doctors and health professionals about boosting gut bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, nothing he licked left him with a smell worse than a smell.
Ian Wright was famous for testing his gut strength on his travels around the world and eating strange and amazing things.
During this mission, he tested his immune system safely from public railway rails to the sewer system.
In the film he made about it, he says, "I didn't care much about my health since I was a child and I put everything in my mouth, from clay to eating worms and muddy water".
He's really confirmed his reputation in the movie.
The only things he refused were dirty public toilets in Russia.
After a simple screw, the luminometer showed a value of more than 4,000 units.
By comparison, freshly washed hands should be less than 60.
One public toilet in Russia but refused to lick after his luminometer showed more than 4,000 units while the freshly washed hands have less than 60
Ian Wright and Finnish dairy producer Valio made a traveler's film called The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, which shows the number of bacteria in different places, like the bathroom
In the movie, he said, "This is almost the most disgusting thing I've ever felt in the bathroom".
There's nothing dirtier than this!
I'm not gonna cut anything because it's disgusting here.
The film Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was made in collaboration with Finnish dairy producer Valio.
The company provided Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, a product containing lactic acid bacteria and vitamins C and D that help boost the gut bacteria and immune system in humans.
Niko Vuorenmaa, senior vice president of Valio's snacks, juices and new categories, said: "We wanted to offer consumers something really new.
Something that would be followed up with a fascination and at the same time allow us to explain the benefits of probiotics.
We've come up with a lot of crazy ideas that have turned into an idea. Let's call Ian.
It is said that interest in gut health is becoming a worldwide phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to put them in a broader context -- good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health, and how it's connected to the immune system.
The growing interest in healthy gut is a global phenomenon, and we have provided consumers with more detailed information in an interesting way through this document.
I also think the movie has a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, adds: "Let's put it this way, Ian would lose my respect if he sucked something I wanted him to do - like the disgusting Russian toilet that appears in the film".
Some things were naturally easier for Ian to do, while others were quite difficult.
I'm glad we got some of those dirty things on tape.
Valio conducted a survey in 2015 that found that 84 percent of respondents linked lactic acid bacteria primarily to stomach and intestinal health and 58 percent of respondents said they use products containing lactic acid added at least occasionally.
A family of social needy before they moved in destroyed a municipal building in Saltash, Cornwall.
A family of the socially disadvantaged left £50,000 worth of damage to their townhouse after they were accused of terrorizing their neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were evicted from their home in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long series of complaints against them.
After their forced eviction, the housing co-op officials were shocked to learn that the property was in a state of disrepair.
The walls were holes, the floor cover was torn, garbage was all over the floor, and the walls were stained.
The family has already moved and is believed to be living in a private residence
Donna McEvoy, director of housing at Cornwall Housing, said she was concerned the house could be saved.
She said, "It was a nightmare for people here, and I don't think people should live like this.
There are a number of circumstances to consider, as this property will probably be known as the most beautiful part of Cornwall.
That family is notorious and their names are notorious.
The couple has three sons who occasionally stayed at the house, and police said the family's acts of terror included street battles with baseball bats, intimidation of surrounding residents, drug use, drug distribution, and loud screaming, quarrels, and insults.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was mentioned in the lease, was sentenced in June for antisocial conduct.
Smelly garbage was found in several rooms in the house that may be demolished.
The house where drugs were distributed in the past was torn up
Neighbors say they saw them on the street, bathing, and people regularly called the police.
Cornwall Housing forced her and her partner out of their home this week after being given an additional 11 weeks to move voluntarily.
Relieved neighbors welcomed the move, saying their lives were living hell.
One of them said, "They don't care about anyone at all".
We lived next door for 20 years and it was always like this.
How many times we've seen the police here, you can't count.
We couldn't sleep this morning.
We got up because there was incredible silence - we're not used to it!
It'll be nice when they're gone.
Adam Fitzpatrick, supervisor for Cornwall Housing's neighbourhood, said the family had been unable to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, the police were called to the house regularly
Waste and old toys have been crammed into the grey part of the town hall.
He adds: "It is a shame that the tenant has failed to accept responsibility for her own behaviour and that of her family.
It was a very complicated case because their behavior was extreme and the witness said their actions must have frightened her neighbors.
I appreciate all the work my team has done, the Devon and Cornwall police and the local community members who have bravely informed us.
I hope this move will bring some comfort to the neighbors and at the same time bring a message that we will not tolerate antisocial behavior.
Fitzpatrick said all three sons of the tenant who lived in the house at different times were in their 20s.
Dirty mattress that remained on the floor of one of the bedrooms in the house after moving
Workers will now have to remove the garbage piles that have been left around the house.
In 2014, she ran a raid on the house and found over 70 grams of cannabis, weights, equipment and 1,700 pounds in cash.
Skeldon was fined after being found guilty of possessing class B drugs she was trying to sell.
She claimed the money was used to build a house for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
It is believed that Tanya and her partner have moved out and are now living in a private house in Plymouth.
The walls of many rooms in the house were painted with graffiti.
Police say they'll try to evict tenants who violate the rules of their lease
Angela Crow of Denough and Cornwall Police said the move was a clear message to the other tenants who would continue to break the rules.
"This is a message to all those who think they can go unpunished and to those who would like to follow such behavior", she said.
The Denov and Cornwall Police will never tolerate criminal and antisocial behavior and will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal frightened by a low-flying military jet over the beach
Tourists who enjoyed sunshine in Aveiro, Portugal, were terrified to death
The P-3C Orion Portuguese Air Force flight was flying at incredibly low altitudes.
The Air Force declared it was a training flight, insisting there was no security threat.
The moment a low-flying jet landed on a crowded beach, the frightened tourists were in a panic.
The dramatic footage shows a military plane reaching a distance almost touching the sun-drenched people on a sandy beach near Aveiro, northern Portugal.
Tourists began to rise after being disturbed by the noise of jet engines, without seeing what was coming out of the clouds.
The incident occurred yesterday afternoon on the Costa Nova near Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the few recreators who posted videos of the dramatic flight on social media, said: "The plane flew twice at a very low altitude and at one point it seemed to be falling".
Nuno Arroja adds: "I was surfing and I really thought the plane would fall on my head".
Tourists on the beach in Aveiro were horrified when a low-flying plane emerged from the darkness
The Portuguese Air Force today announced that the pilot of the P-3C Orion was on a training flight to identify a fishing vessel off the coast and had to land low because it was the only way to check the ship.
The plane reportedly flew a little lower than usual due to poor visibility from smoke from nearby wildfires, but the airline insists that human safety was not compromised.
Forest fires this summer destroyed part of mainland Portugal and claimed four lives on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force today announced that the pilot had to fly low due to thick fog and smoke from the fires that prevented him from seeing
The plane was on a training flight and the pilot was asked to identify the fishing vessel as part of the training.
Half of the funeral services don't follow the rules.
Half of funeral service providers don't comply with the law.
The Czech Trade Inspection (ČOI) found this during the second quarter inspections.
According to the Commission, funeral services do not usually inform survivors of their prices or issue written confirmation of acceptance.
The C.O.I. has imposed 41 fines totalling 73,000 crowns.
Her spokesman, Jiří Fröhlich, informed her today.
The inspectors have detected a fault in 47 of the 95 checks.
In addition to not providing price information and no confirmation, some funeral services also sold products or provided services at prices other than those agreed.
In five cases the products sold were not properly labelled and once the seller used an unofficially verified meter.
The inspection therefore prohibited the sale of 23 products for a total of SEK 7077.
This concerned urn packaging, candlestick covers and vases which were not properly marked with mandatory information.
'Given that there are still breaches of law in this specific area of services, the controls will continue in the next quarter of this year,' Fröhlich added.
A London school girl who joined ISIS was killed in Syria
It was reported that Kadiz Sultan, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join IS, had died in Syria.
Attorney Tasnime Akunjee said the family learned of her death in Syria's Rakka a few weeks ago.
ITV News reported on Thursday that she was likely killed during a Russian airstrike in Rakcha, which is the group's stronghold in the country.
The Sultan was 17 years old and, according to her family, died just as she was preparing to flee a war-torn country and return to Britain.
"The only good thing about this whole thing - as a message and a warning to others that these are the real dangers of going to war zones - is that it discourages people from ever making decisions", Akunjee said.
In February 2015, Sultan and two other school girls from east London boarded a plane to Turkey and then a bus to the border with Syria.
The Sultan's family learned that she married an IS fighter in Syria - and within months she was widowed.
Reid says if Clinton is elected, she'll keep Garland as a Supreme Court nominee.
Democratic Senate Leader Harry Reid says he believes Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will nominate Justice Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if she is elected.
Republicans in the Senate blocked Garland's nomination, even though President Barack Obama nominated him in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnel says the person who replaces the late Supreme Court justice will elect the next president.
Reid said during a conference call Thursday that he believes Clinton will select Garland with some degree of credibility.
Reid's spokesman later said he had not spoken directly to Clinton about whether she would nominate Garland, and that he was only speculating.
He praised Garland and said that Clinton's team would not want to tear the ship apart if they chose someone else.
Garland is the chairman of the federal appeals court in Washington.
Reid said the Republicans who block Garland's appointment are the "servants" and "spoons" of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He said Trump didn't fit in.
According to Treats magazine, there are naked calendars for women and men.
Treats magazine is working closely with photographer David Bellemer on the 2017 calendar, inspired by the Pirelli calendar of the 1970s.
But instead of being revealed by celebrities, NU must find the next generation of top models for her 2017 calendar.
Treats President Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his nude magazine was different from old-school Playboy because Playboy is for men.
I do it for women.
He obviously thinks the calendar is too.
"We need to get back to the timeless and classic nudity scene, where women and men feel comfortable and are inspired by photographs of the female body", Shaw said in a press release for the calendar.
Women want to be part of this project because it's a beautiful piece of art.
Models can post their photos online or in person during open auditions in Los Angeles and New York.
Where is vinyl headed: who's really buying the records?
Vinyl is a favorite of middle-aged men.
Before you decide to fill the comments section with peppery remarks under the pseudonym Not All Men Were Lonely in the Middle Ages, let us note that this statement is based on actual data.
According to YouGov, the much-discussed revival of the phonograph record is not linked to the millennial boom of self-love, but to the nostalgia of middle age.
Those who recently bought a vinyl album are most likely people between the ages of 45 and 54.
Young people aged 18-24 are the least likely.
It's not even about the fan base - it's all about the emotional dimension: Older people who buy phonograph records are more likely to want to keep their feelings (56 percent versus 53 percent) and are happy to be alone (69 percent versus 66 percent).
But are YouGov's results true?
If this blog was broadcast as a television report, a camera would be watching me drive down a busy street in Soho, dressed in a decent gray suit and gesturing wide, and then I would stop and reach out my hands and say something authoritative, like, "Let's take a look at this".
Let's see what we can do.
While Soho's charm and charm is slowly fading from the heart - the buildings once occupied by independent dealers are now filled with hotels, restaurants and dining rooms, clothing, and office supplies - a few fantastic specialty record shops remain.
I'd probably ask the camera to stop shooting for a while, so I'd stand near the different men in these stores and try to observe their age and emotional mood.
Stuart, 55, a native of Glasgow, who I'm following from Sister Ray (numbers: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (numbers: eight middle-aged men, one woman around 20) is having an afternoon meeting in London and going through the stores to fill up a few hours.
I ask him if he's a collector.
I think so, he says.
I got about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
All those tapes are on the walls of his living room -- in the picture above (he emailed me a picture, I didn't follow him home).
He has this huge amount of albums and singles because he can afford it: he can now buy the records he couldn't afford when they were originally released, and he can buy back what he sold when he was young and didn't even have a guitar.
"Many of the things I buy are from the late '60s and early '70s, and they're things that would have been published when I was 11 or 12 years old, and I was too young to afford them", he says.
He agrees that those who buy the records are probably introverts who like to be with themselves, and he adds, "I don't smoke and I don't drink too much".
This is my sin.
Wez (25) works at Sister Ray and also thinks that a number of the customers she meets fit into the YouGov profile.
He also noticed a new influx of people affected by the media wave -- people who heard about comeback and felt compelled to buy their old records back.
According to my interviews, people got rid of their collections the most between 1998 and 1999.
Customers who once sold their records and bought CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their records back, he says.
That might explain the boom in gramophone lovers of a certain age.
But what about the supposed emotional importance of phonograph records?
It doesn't take you more than a few seconds to find that in a store like Phonica, you can find a pleasant community of like-minded people in a music store.
According to Wes, some older customers are particularly affected by the contactless payment system.
Some fans of phonograph records may feel overwhelmed in the digital world and have chosen the familiar environment of phonograph record packaging, things that evoke memories of peaceful adolescence.
"I think filling a gap or owning something material can bring some comfort", says Wez.
I'm a collector myself, and I think a lot of people are.
It's an easy way to fill a space in your head.
"We're all their social workers!" says a coworker from a bunch of phonograph records.
An ICM survey in April revealed that nearly 50 percent of people who had bought a vinyl album a month earlier had not yet listened to it.
According to the survey, 41 percent of those surveyed have a phonograph that they never use, while 7 percent of those who buy phonograph records do not.
At this point in the reporting, he probably looked really worried going through a bunch of bossa nova compilations.
The aspect of "trophies" and "revival of interest" is something that Jonny (42) has noticed working on Sounds of the Universe.
"Somebody came up recently and said, 'I don't have a phonograph yet, but I want to buy a Radiohead record so we can put it on the shelf,'" he says.
The percentage of these is not high, but it does happen.
It's more about the product side than the music.
People come to us and say, "I don't have a phonograph".
It's younger people, not older, older teens getting into it.
Fopp, where almost a floor is now dedicated to phonograph boards, has a much more diverse audience when I arrive.
There are a couple of 70s, tourists taking pictures, teenagers and middle-aged women.
While the atmosphere is not as relaxed as the shops before - instead of the jazzy sound of the latest pop from Wild Beasts, full of synthesizers and sex, it's good to see a variety of customers.
None of them seem particularly lonely, but the intrusive psychological trauma is hard to fathom when you're standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora (27) is walking around Fopp for a few minutes and checking out the various discounted recordings.
She's one of those people who likes to watch the exhibits rather than spend the money.
She says she's not making much money, so it's unlikely she'd be collecting records.
It's a lot of money.
It's easy to listen to music on a computer or something, but the gramophone records have their magic...
I can't explain it - it's unique.
My last stop is the store that supposedly inspired a new generation of record lovers: Urban Outfitters.
I pretend to be very interested in the thighs of girls in tight jeans and watching a group of teenage girls gather around Polaroid cameras, and then the father and daughter decide to buy a Crosley phonograph.
To the left is the staircase, which is covered by the recordings of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwead Mac: a mixture of contemporary and classical music, the foundation of any average collection of recordings.
No one is looking at them - perhaps because they're just for decoration, and some are so high on the walls that they're not reachable.
It's a purely vinyl trick.
But since any appeal to him could mean more money for the industry and send some customers to the depths of Soho for more, there's not much to complain about.
It's no surprise that the demographic area where more time and money are likely to be spent than other areas is also the one where the most money is spent on the most luxurious commodities, which vinyl is definitely.
But while my findings suggest that YouGov's results are accurate -- at least in record stores -- they don't take into account the large number of collectors and vinyl fans that actually exist in record stores and online forums.
These people probably work hard in schools or offices.
I'm sure he doesn't spend Thursday mornings wandering around the record shops on Berwick Street, scrolling through the tapes and avoiding the sight of a strange, 30-year-old fake TV host who hides behind the backs of middle-aged, unsuspecting men.
Greenland shark is the longest-lived vertebrate - video report
Scientists say that the Greenland shark has the longest life expectancy of any vertebrate on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, a shark researcher, says the recording shows a female estimated to be between 272 and 512 years old and 5 meters tall.
A court in France refused to close the jungle refugee camp.
A court in France has rejected an order from the authorities in Calais to demolish dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle camp, where thousands of refugees live.
During the trial this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be able to cancel a total of 72 temporary shops where people inside the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer haircuts, sell tea for 50 cents or basic food for a few euros in temporary restaurants.
The prefect's office in Calais argued that the sites had to be demolished because they represent a parallel economy that does not pay taxes and because they pose a risk of fire and health risks.
Humanitarian organizations have said in court that shops and restaurants are vital and that free meals offered by state-sponsored associations and other groups do not provide food supplements to the growing number of refugees in the camp.
Controversial temporary shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free food for those in need.
The Court of Lille held that there was no legal basis to prevent people from operating 72 temporary shops, but stated that the objections of the Prefect of Calais were "fully understandable".
Judge Jean-François Molla said that food stores, cafes and restaurants have a much bigger role to play than just serving food to people who live in extremely desperate conditions.
He said the premises provide quiet places for refugees and volunteers to meet.
One of the places threatened with demolition was a cafe in the camp, Jungle Book Kids, run by a nonprofit organization that offers 200 meals a day, classes in English and French, and asylum counseling for hundreds of vulnerable minors without an escort at the camp.
More than 170,000 people signed the petition to protect the children's cafe.
The Guardian received a letter saying closing the cafe would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only eight years old.
On Friday, charities Help Refugess and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated that the number of refugees in the camp after a sharp increase in arrivals over the summer rose to more than 9,000 - the highest ever.
He thought he was dead.
Ulrich's been playing volleyball for a while.
"I've been able to train normally since March", he reported at the start of summer training in full force.
What's wrong with you?
I had a double pulmonary embolism, and then I had heart problems because of it.
Because when I was at college in Korea, I didn't know I had any blood problems.
So he caused trouble on a long flight to Asia?
I had a concussion in my back for two years and I didn't know it.
It hurt, nobody found anything.
Then the collision got up.
There's a damaged vein in the hip, and it'll always hurt, especially when it's wet or weather changes.
But nothing that would limit me is more aesthetic.
Were you worried about your life?
He did.
Last year at the summer tournament in the Woodlands, I didn't know I had an embolism, and I couldn't move at all.
I vomited blood last night.
The doctors told me it was something completely different, I was completely cut out for five days.
I really thought I was dead in the woods, and so was my girlfriend and family.
I've seen myself somewhere else.
How did you deal with it?
I guess I had to go through it, now it's just going up.
I know I have some blood issues, I need to be more careful when I fly.
But you can do anything.
Except last year, when I was about to get back to Prep, I had some heart problems.
It's all right now.
I've been training myself at home since March to be able to play again.
I'm knocking, I'm better off physically than I was before.
What do you expect from the mouth?
I'm looking forward to it. The party looks good. I know most of the guys.
I'm curious about two more strangers coming.
I hope we can sit down humanly to fit together.
Can you lift the mouth?
It had a reputation for being a squirrel, but every season is different.
Brno was eighth two years ago, now it's second.
There's a new team in the mouth, only a few players left.
It was the last one in the extralease, so there's plenty of room for improvement.
How we use it is up to us.
We'll see after the first round who's the winner, we won't.
Is coach Brom the guarantee of success?
He's experienced and he's been through a lot, he'll think of a better place than last.
But my arrival wasn't related to his, I arranged earlier.
There were other coaches in the game, and I'm a good friend, and it was agreed that he'd be working here.
I won't say the name.
Mr. Brom finally came and I'm glad.
He's got a big name, he's been in good clubs, he's been coaching for decades, he's a good former player.
It'll move us up.
What do you bring?
This team will fight, which is my position.
I like to fight, I like to joke, and I like to get a chance on a team that's not so top.
I've been in the Trials for two years, but the Wasteland is a bigger challenge than being in the sixth team right now, because it starts at the bottom.
You mentioned strangers, the Australian Boehm is already training in the U.S.
What's he look like?
I happen to know him. We played against each other in a group in college.
And we've had a few fun times there, we've sat together after games sometimes, so we've become friends.
We beat them 3-1, and I gave him the kick-off of summer training in the U.S.
He has a Slovak girlfriend, he's a nice guy.
American Foundry and Brazilian Ze are coming.
Do you know anything about them?
I've been writing with an American, he looks like a nice guy, a Brazilian who knows how to speak English.
You contacted the American?
I thought it was a good idea.
I'm a recording artist, so I should be able to communicate with everyone.
I immediately figured out what kind of players they were, I looked up the Internet, saw some videos of them playing.
He was doing pretty good, the kid jumps, he's tall.
We put a couple of messages on Facebook, he looked like a prankster, he's gonna fall for us.
How are you looking forward to being the recording number one?
I didn't want to take anything else.
I'm only 24 and I'm not in the mood to go in for a change.
I'd rather be in the center, I'd rather lead the team than have someone else lead it.
I guess I'd hate to play anymore if I had to be the second recorder to do it full time.
How many times have you been number one?
Halfway through the story, when Kust didn't do well as captain, he got hurt, then there were money problems, and he left.
Since then, we've been going up and I've been playing all the time.
In the gate I was raised in, I alternated one and two.
It was a great year in Old Town, and I had a lot of offers after that, and I picked the right tool.
The Budjevics wanted me there, so I stayed, but I didn't finish the season because of the embolism.
Now is a new beginning.
Gold number 22.
The short position remains Phelps' domain.
"It's as sweet as ever to be back on the podium and hear the anthem", Phelps laughed, yet his eyes were full of tears again.
His fiancée and mother were again in the audience, and his son Boomer was sleeping quietly with earphones.
I'm having a hell of a week to finish my career.
It's crazy - 20 years ago, I started racing swimming and in a few hours, it'll all be over, he said, moved.
In the final, the Japanese silver medalist Kosuke Hagino was nearly two seconds behind Phelps, who won the long jump.
The bronze was won by Chinese Wang Shun, the bronze medalist in this discipline from last year's World Championships.
After Alu Oerter (disk) and Carl Lewis (distance), Michael Phelps is the third athlete to master the same discipline in four consecutive games.
For most of the race, Phelps and another American, Ryan Loach, and home run Thiago Perreira, held the lead.
While the gold medalists in the final round of the 50th placed in a crushing finish, they fell out of the medal position.
The American superhero will have at least one more chance in Rio to expand his unique medal collection.
Shortly after the ceremony, he advanced to the final of the 100-meter butterfly.
The legend could not be overshadowed by fellow countryman Ryan Murphy, who won the landmark double - a hundred wins in Rio and a double track.
In the final, he was beaten 37th by Australian swimmer Mitchell Larkin, third by Russian Yevgeny Rylov.
While Murphy is only fifth in the 200 at last year's World Championships, he's become a legendary king in Rio.
He's got Larkin off the imaginary throne, who did the same double at last year's world championships.
But he won the Olympic medal just now.
In the 100m, the Canadian Penny Oleksiak and the American Simone Manuel took the gold.
For 16-year-old Oleksiak, it was her fourth medal at the Games, and for Manuel, second after silver from the relay.
She won swimming gold at OH as the first African American woman in history.
I believe I can be an inspiration to others.
This medal is for all who come after me, sport becomes their love and they get to where I am, said Manuel, moved.
Third was Sarah Sjöström, a Swedish woman who won the world record 100m butterfly in Rio and still holds the silver in the 200m breaststroke.
Australia's Cate Campbell finished sixth.
The two-man event was won by Japan's Rie Kanet, who won her first Olympic medal in 27 years.
She has no precious metal from the World Championships, her highest finish was fourth in the discipline in 2013.
The second silver medal in Rio was won by Russia's Julia Jefimova, who, despite her doping history, has been facing hostility from both her fans and her opponents.
I made a big mistake once.
But I won the court and I don't know why I should always answer those questions.
I'm so tired of this, said the Russian swimmer.
The right to start in Rio was only granted to a special CAS sports arbitration panel just before the games began.
They've been looking into my appeal, and I've won.
Whether anyone likes it or not, or if they have a different opinion, they should go to the arbitral tribunal, she added.
Disappointment, we could have won.
What about a midnight start?
I don't remember that.
The Czechs have had a strange day.
Less than an hour before the game, they knew who they were going to fight.
They must have been able to handle tactical preparation lightningly.
And then, in an unusual time, they started a match on the small court number one.
The first set didn't start well, then they took the lead, but they didn't make it to the finish line at 19:19.
They were clearly better and even in the second, but they didn't make the decisive tie-break.
Most of all, a series of broken serves meant a 10:15 loss and an Olympic farewell.
"We could have defeated the Russians", Hermann regretted.
How would you rate the game?
Hermann: After a bad start, before I lost, we got into the game beautifully.
In the end, the last balloon flew me the income I was used to.
We lost the set, which was key.
Next set, we hit them with a field goal, a different defense, and we pressed the service.
The tie-breaker had a very bad delivery, so we took it this way.
It was a disappointment because we could have defeated the Russians.
Whoo! It's too bad we started the first set, we got away with it.
We were able to pull it off, but we were missing the points.
The second set was great, and the third set was a service.
We made a lot of mistakes.
We gave them five points, and that was five points, we were very hesitant.
It's a shame, because the Russians were playable.
How was your little game at yard number one?
Solution: Similar to the Chinese in the backyard.
The atmosphere and the environment were different.
It was one hour of the night, complete silence, no music, nowhere.
That was the difference from the center.
We wouldn't choose those conditions, but we can't.
How was the game preparation when you found out the names of your opponents an hour before the game?
She was weird.
We started practicing for the game without knowing the opponents, so we couldn't do the tactical preparation for the other teams.
But Simon (Nausch's coach) has prepared a tactic for almost every possibility there was.
He had a lot of tactical papers in his pocket, so we were pretty well prepared for this page.
Do you remember starting a game at midnight?
I guess not.
We played at 11:30, but not at 12:00.
The Russian Birlovs block in the pre-playoff at OH in Rio.
Beach volleyball players Market Slukova and Barbora Hermann in a hug in the run-up to the Rio OH playoffs.
Was that uncomfortable?
Sluk: By playing the last two games in the group of 10, we had a shift earlier.
That was two hours more.
It's weird, I can't imagine any other sport having athletes who have to give their best performance at 12 o'clock.
But I think we've prepared as well as we can.
We knew it would be, but it's not typical, and I don't think it's going to be my favorite time to play.
How do you rate the Olympic experience?
Hermann: Since the group move was our goal, on the one hand, it's okay, good.
We did what we said.
But now after the game, I'm sad.
I'll sleep through it and remember the Olympic tournament in a positive way from tomorrow.
Big Brother's here, first surveillance SIM is coming.
You can't escape her.
The new rules will apply to all non-Thai passport holders who decide to purchase a SIM from a local operator while in Thailand.
This is not only for tourists but also for long-term visa holders who work or marry in Thailand.
The Secretary-General of the Office of National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission, Takorn Tantasith, has informed that no exceptions will be made.
The plan to sell SIMs exclusively for foreigners was presented by the national telecommunications regulator at the beginning of August.
The authorities intend to introduce new measures to monitor their location within six months.
According to Tantasith, this is a means of maintaining national security to tackle crimes committed by foreigners.
The so-called tourist SIMs are also intended to help identify people who exceed the permitted length of stay.
The Commission therefore considers that the Commission should take into account the fact that the Commission has not yet established a specific scheme for the export of the product concerned.
The difference will be the tracking function, which will be permanently turned on for cards for non-Thai passengers.
It won't be able to be turned off.
"This feature is not available for Thai SIMs because we can always track them easily", Tantasith added.
It must be added that in Thailand, subscriptions are not anonymous as in the Czech Republic.
The seller needs proof of identity.
On the other hand, for several years one of the operators was giving away the launch SIM for free to tourists at airports.
They were so completely anonymous.
The Commission also examined whether the measures were compatible with the internal market.
They also currently require SIM registration, but legal use of the tracking system is not possible.
The measures envisaged do not, however, imply that foreigners are obliged to carry a local operator's SIM card upon entry into the country.
They can of course use roaming services with their own home SIM, in which case they will be short-lived by the Thai authorities.
The operators of a given country, after crossing the border, i.e. after signing up for SIM on their network, only know the relevant network information.
So they know the phone number, but not the owner's information.
However, the difference in roaming prices from the rates of local operators is so stark that even most tourists will start to look for local SIMs during their stay in Thailand.
The authorities' efforts to monitor the movement of foreigners have been met with immediate criticism from foreigners living legally in Thailand.
Tantasith calms down and compares the privacy system in place to the requirement to provide a residence address in immigration documents.
In addition, the police will need a court order if they need to track down a particular person.
Any misuse of the system will be punished indefinitely.
"If a service provider tracks the SIM location without a warrant, it will be charged with a crime", Tantasith added.
The system should also maximise the use of prepaid cards.
While the actual number is currently only recycled after the 90 days period after which the SIM has not logged in, the number could be recycled after 15 days if it leaves Thailand.
A luxury apartment in a new building on Vineyards has a swimming pool and a hot tub on the terrace.
Why did you choose an apartment in a new building?
We were looking for a carefree apartment where most of the property care is taken over by a manager.
The condition was enough parking space and an elevator in the house, which essentially disqualified the older building.
Not to mention the problematic acoustics in old houses, the problems with the flooring swinging, the high energy demands and the like.
The condition was also large terraces, which an old building is unable to offer.
You can find other interesting visits in Modern Apartment magazine.
The entire interior was designed for you by architect Lenka Langer and her colleague Kamilla Polák of the studio Artiga.
Why did you call them?
Would you recommend working with an expert to everyone?
We would recommend working with an architect if you're designing an apartment from scratch, because it's a very complex technical process.
The second layer is interior design itself: designers have a much better idea of the range of materials available and are able to fit the interior accordingly to the client's wishes.
Architect Lenka Langer and I had worked together on our mountain apartment, at the time on the personal recommendation of another client, and since everything worked well, it was a clear choice for us to rebuild our new apartment in Vinohrade.
What were your practical and aesthetic requirements?
We wanted a generous social-living space with a suitable backdrop for a family of four, conceived as a modern, but not cool interior.
The priority was to connect the apartment to the terraces and implement intelligent home control.
And of course, the quality of the execution had to be monitored.
Did you leave it all to the experts, or did you interfere with the final design of the interior?
We approved all designs, including technical drawings and material samples, but the design always came from architects.
We started by defining what we expected from the design, and we showed some interior elements that we would like to incorporate into the design, like carpets or paintings.
I think it's our collection of mostly Czech authors, including works by Karl Malich, Karl Dyschilla, Václav Špála or Otto Gutfreund architects, that helped shape our taste.
Also, the combination of black, white and walnut wood was the architect's idea, as well as individual pieces of furniture, walls, floors, lighting, carpets, textiles, art, etc. We then worked together to verify whether they all worked together using visualization.
Did you have any complications in the process that made you give up your original ideas or instead move on to new ones?
Perhaps only in the initial stages of the project, when we came to the building at the time when we were able to climb to the height of our floor for the first time, and found that the views we were planning were actually shadowing the surrounding buildings.
We literally changed the layout overnight.
The kitchen liner and the fireplace wall were covered with granite.
The interior is dominated by wood surfaces with leather, such as the linings of Norma's bar and dining chairs from Arper.
How would you describe the interior?
Are you making any changes or is there something you wish you had today that you didn't?
I think it's a modern airy interior that primarily serves its purpose.
We're not going to make any changes, most of the adjustments after the move took place in the shadowy terrace.
I hope the only thing we can do is to get the floor when the nuts seem too sensitive to the dog house.
In the words of architects, Ing. arch. Lenka Langer and MgA. Kamila Hornych, authors of the realization.
The apartment is on the last floor of the new building, so it was possible to implement completely new layout solutions and several other modifications within the construction.
The installation of light plumbing in the hallway ceiling and the main toilet is an important element of the interior.
That's how we got daylight into the darker areas of the apartment.
Also, the direct entrance from the main bathroom to the roof terrace to the pool from the USSPA is one of the building modifications that was very beneficial to the function of the entire apartment.
It also includes a swimming pool and a fountain.
Compared to the French, you are not negative, says a Muslim woman living in Prague.
You're from France.
Where did you live before moving to Prague?
My parents are originally from Algeria.
I was born in the south of France, just outside the Spanish border.
I've been moving around a lot.
I lived in Toulouse, Lyon and Marseille.
I studied journalism in France, which led me to work for a magazine.
So why did you decide to leave the country?
I was starting to feel like I was choking in France.
I just didn't want to live there anymore.
Especially because of the atmosphere among the people.
I thought every Frenchman was so negative.
People in France are generally in a negative mood, but lately it's gotten worse.
It's interesting that you're talking about negativity.
Some people have this view of the Czech nature.
Believe me, you're not negative compared to the French.
Some people may not feel that way when they come to France because they don't feel it as much as tourists.
But it was too much for me.
The big issue is money.
People feel they have little money, whereas the minimum wage in France is fifteen hundred euros, which I think is enough.
Now there's a problem with people's treatment of Muslims.
I can't understand that.
For example, on the street I lived on, my non-Muslim neighbor started looking at me with his fingers just because I was a Muslim.
Like I was some kind of evil.
That's why I didn't feel good in France.
But my family stayed.
So you decided to go to another country.
Why did you choose the Czech Republic?
I was looking for work pretty much anywhere else, and I ran into a vacancy at Air France here in Prague.
I must admit I didn't know Prague at all.
I knew something about the Czech Republic, my dad even told me about what was happening in Czechoslovakia, but I didn't know what to expect from Prague.
I've been here three years now, and I can't imagine not living here.
Was it a big difference when you moved from France to Prague?
Especially because of a completely different atmosphere.
Maybe it's because I don't speak Czech, so I can't catch any negative reactions or insults, but I feel like people are more free here.
That I can do anything, dress any way I want and no one will judge me.
In France, someone is always looking at you uncomfortably, like when you're dressed up in a special way and stuff.
I started to feel really free in Prague.
I don't think the roaches care about that kind of thing.
Where do you work now?
After working for Air France, I worked for a travel website for a while.
Then a friend and I started a website where people would offer and search for shared housing.
We're only in Prague so far, but we'd like to expand to all of Central Europe.
Do you have any Czech friends in Prague?
I have two very close friends here who are half-Czech, and two other Czech friends.
I have to say, another specificity of the Czechs is that they keep more distance at first.
He won't let anyone get close to his body.
That's quite different from where I grew up.
In the south, everyone hugs and kisses on the face.
It's different here, but I understand it's a cultural thing, so I'm trying to adapt.
You mentioned you don't speak Czech.
Is the language barrier a problem for you?
On the contrary, it's quite simple for me in Prague, because I think everyone here speaks English.
Even at dinners or food.
I'd like to learn Czech, but I don't have much time.
And since everyone can communicate in English at least a little bit, I don't have that much need to learn the language fast.
And every time I have a problem, there's someone to help me.
Have you had any negative reactions?
Maybe because you're a Muslim?
Not really.
Maybe it's also because I work in an international environment that's more tolerant.
I have an experience.
My boss, the Czech Republic, once told me about a French football team and said something in a way: they're not French, they're African.
That kind of touched me.
But if anyone had a problem with me being a Muslim, that hasn't happened to me yet.
And that's despite a colleague once warning me of some anti-Muslim demonstrations.
He told me not to go downtown, they'd swear at me.
The anti-Muslim demonstrations are partly linked to terrorist attacks.
How does the present situation affect you?
Are you worried that something like Paris, Nice or Brussels could happen in Prague?
I feel safe in Prague.
But the problem is, nowadays anything can happen anywhere.
Until recently, I could not imagine that something like this would happen in France.
And it's not just about Muslims.
And Islam does not recognize violence at all.
To me, people who kill are not Muslims.
The Koran says that man has no right to kill because he is not God.
How do you feel when terrorists protect themselves by your faith?
It's very hard.
I feel shame and guilt, even though I shouldn't feel that way.
I try not to follow the violence reports too much, but every time I read something, I need to apologize for something that's not really my fault.
I'm a completely different person, so why should I apologize for the terrorists?
We met in the square of George of Podebrad.
On Wednesday, Czech Muslims and Christians demonstrated against the violence.
Did you record it?
I didn't know that.
But I understand that these people feel the need to prove that they disagree with violence.
I don't think they'd have to do anything like that.
Why should they feel guilty for something they didn't do?
Do you meet other Muslims in Prague?
My colleagues are from Egypt and other Muslim countries, for example.
They're a little bit more religious than I am, so we have a pretty wild discussion about Islam sometimes, because we all see it a little bit differently.
I'm from France, so I went to other schools, they might have taught Islam in school.
We have different attitudes, but we respect each other.
People sometimes associate Islam with the subordinate position of women.
How do you feel about it?
I don't seem to be a subordinate in any way.
It's the opposite.
I'm a woman, I have strength.
It's also about not wearing a head covering.
Like the hijab?
And it's basically about the way I was raised.
My mom, for example, is a very principled Muslim.
He prays five times a day, but he just doesn't wear a robe.
She always taught me that faith is purely personal.
It's up to everyone how they interpret it.
When you read the Quran, you should make your own opinion about these things.
So when I read a passage in the Quran that says that God told the Prophet to hide his wives from the eyes of others, I thought, I'm not the Prophet's wife, so why should I hide?
On the other hand, I respect that, and if I go to Iran or Saudi Arabia, where the clothes are required, I'll take it.
Are you planning on staying in Prague?
I'm not.
I've never felt so good anywhere else.
I've been thinking about Poland for a while, but I'm really happy in Prague.
I can even imagine raising my own children here.
Prague is the perfect city for that.
Czech Muslims and Christians demonstrated against the violence.
The winds of the Goat Fence in Rio are turning on the progressive lines.
Friday's sea trips in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, were launched by Czech yachtswoman Veronica Kozelská Fenclová.
In the Laser Radial class, she moved up to tenth place before the final two laps.
That would ensure the Czech side takes part in the final drive.
You collect packages like Pokemon.
They want to compete with the carriers.
The idea of using the already planned routes for the transport of shipments is the television director Matj Lišk and the manager of the Prague music club Marek Greger.
The idea was to create three applications with different geographical scope.
We launched the national transportation app in May.
There are a thousand cities on it right now, and we're expanding the network.
We want to learn this in the Czech Republic first, before we focus more on abroad, says the 41-year-old manager in an interview with iDNES.cz.
How does the Transportation App work and who can benefit from it?
You can download it and register for free.
Then you can enter the route and the details of how much you can transport and how much you want to transport.
Someone might ask for a ride that day.
If the route and delivery time are correct, the pair shall be matched and the two shall receive a notification.
That's when the chat opens, where the two of them are arranging a handover.
How many people do you think would have to register to have each package always find its courier?
I don't know the ideal situation, I can't estimate how many people are registered and how many trips are needed to get the coverage to be perfectly optimal and each offer matched the demand.
It's already working on the main roads, and it's logically easier than on the road between the villages.
The more people, the greater the potential for speed and precision.
People are building trust too, and they're finding out that no one can get away with a package.
You haven't had to deal with a case like this before?
How many users has the service two months after launch?
We have about 5,000 to 6,000 people building roads right now.
We consider this a success and we believe that more will be added.
Is it safe for the sender to wait too long?
We hope to be competitive with the big conglomerates just because we can deliver the thing on the same day and at a fraction of the price.
At a large company, you'll pay a few thousand for delivery within two hours.
You'll pay a hundred or less here, because that's a road someone's already on.
Should traditional carriers be concerned about the possible loss of customers in the future?
We hope so.
The market has enormous potential, feeding on huge multinational carriers, as well as the retail chains where everyone started shopping and gradually found that quality was not what they paid for.
No one wants to find a ticket in the mailbox saying they're picking up a shipment at the branch office after 7:00 p.m. that day.
I needed a package for six hours at the time, and I was waiting at home because it was important.
We want a better, faster, functional service that won't upset anyone and sends a signal to the competition, no matter what they try.
The Commission has also adopted a number of measures to combat the use of the 'sustainable' energy.
None of them have ever worked in the IT industry.
Marek Greger works as a music club manager, Matthew Fox as a television director.
In 2014, they started developing the Shippansee LTD app, which uses pre-planned routes between the world's metropolises, primarily by air, to transport packages.
In 2015, they submitted a project for processing to a company that created applications for MALL.cz, Jobs.cz or ČSFD.
The programming took three quarters of a year and the application was launched in March 2016.
The Transportation app began development in December last year and was released in May this year.
It is a local version of Shippansee adapted for the Czech market.
The application Mesik and Mesik Profi was developed from January this year and made available to users at the end of July 2016.
The idea was from the beginning to make all these apps that one day would be combined into one.
In the Czech Republic, they want to adapt the application and then, in cooperation with a strong investor, to focus more on the global market.
Shared economy is a topic lately, and this is a service like Airbnb or Uber.
Are you not concerned about operating in an area that no one can tell you much about yet, where the boundaries of sharing are and where the grey economies are?
It's the same, just a different product.
We know that if we succeed and go up with it, we'll be another thorn in the side of the grey economy.
But even though someone is saving and someone is making a profit, it's not the intention to circumvent the financial authorities and tax controls.
Each user, on the one hand or the other, will be encouraged to tax his income if he makes a profit from it.
What makes you think the service has such potential?
The consignor will save and the carrier will profit or reduce the cost of the journey.
That's the powerful idea that connects the interest on both sides.
In an age of social media that divides people, we'd like this one to be closer.
They can create beautiful stories, people are happy to help someone and they'll tell about it.
Maybe someone will bring you some forgotten glasses, keys or pills.
People have been lacking in personal access for a long time, I think, so we call this app people-to-people service.
So how do you guarantee the courier with the package won't slip?
Each user of the application scans the identity card together with the registration and enters a bank account, payment or credit card.
These are channels that give service and people credibility.
Couriers also collect stars based on the sender's ratings.
We'll offer insurance, we'll keep the details.
The courier shall be responsible for the unsecured shipment in case of loss or damage, but shall not be liable under criminal law for the contents if there is something illegal inside and he does not know about it.
If the police stop him and find a suicide bomb or 10 kilos of hashish in a sealed package in his suitcase, the sender is held criminally liable.
Is there a risk of misusing sensitive data from the database?
They are registered, if necessary, by a supervisory authority, which will be the only one to have access to them, and we ourselves are not able to see them, the data is protected against abuse.
How much money will the courier get after delivering the shipment successfully?
The courier determines the price and gets the full amount he asks for.
The sender shall be charged a few percentage points more for the contact intermediation.
This money is our profit, but it's only a few percent because we want to push the volume.
Nor can anyone accuse the courier of not delivering the shipment when it was actually delivered, and the receipt and delivery is verified using QR codes.
Are there any restrictions?
Whether it's the size or the contents of the package?
You can carry anything.
We have three sizes, small as a can of butter, medium as a plate of eggs, and big as a bass of beer.
Then there's no more restrictions, and if someone has a seat in the car, they can carry the refrigerator.
Plus, the sender has the option to take a picture of the packages in the app so the courier can see what's on his mind.
You don't even have to pack a thing if you don't want to hide the contents.
You put a forgotten sweater in the courier's hand and that's it.
Who came up with the idea, and how long did it take to launch the service?
A friend of mine got the idea over two years ago, and I didn't pay much attention to it.
Then he showed me a demo of a transnational application that was primarily targeted at passenger aircraft.
At that moment, I told him I wasn't looking for an investor, but I wanted to become one myself and save money.
The next year, the development continued until we established Shippansee LTD in London to increase the credibility of the product.
But this isn't the version you're focusing on right now.
No, we've been marketing in the Czech Republic, where we're trying to capture the app because it's all been in labor pains and there's still a lot to address and improve.
We're trying to respond to customer feedback, and the foreign market is not so much a solution right now.
We know it's a long run, but we're not doing it, we're trying to create a really good product for people.
Shippansee LTD was the most basic and expensive application, the other two were somehow an upgrade.
Transportation came about when we thought the national segment could be much more interesting and that we would at least learn it in the Czech Republic.
The third application by Mexico is local, for the city.
But it can send a package to the exact address and to the other side of the world.
It works for the transmitter just like Transportation, but the difference is that you can see the shipments in the form of points on the map that are closest to you, thanks to the geolocator in your mobile.
We've called the applications for couriers who want to make a living from it the Pro Man.
So someone can make a living by picking up parcels around town?
Exactly, the latest app is for a taxi driver, a student, a mother on parental leave, someone who wants to earn a way to work.
Now that everyone's messing with the pokemon, they can collect this just the same.
You see where the orders are in town, you come to it, you click and you see when it's to be delivered and you transport the shipment.
It's set up cheaper than competing services.
We're still building a web interface that's going to be the key for companies to send mail, fill out data on the web, or create points on the map.
We can then invoice them for their use of the service, like, every month.
Are you now a full-time project?
It's hard for us, but we normally have it when we're working, so we can feed and develop the project.
There's no such thing as a strong multinational investor behind us, we're two guys, one of whom had a brilliant idea and the other jumped in with other incentives and ideas.
Now we're looking for an investor strong enough to clean up not only the Czech market with us, but who should, with the balls of a ball, join us in a global product and become another huge market player like Airbnb and Uber.
The story arc of Titanfall 2 is supposed to bring a kind of forgotten variety.
That'll fix the second part, and the solo game in it will be more colorful than in Call of Duty, according to initial reports.
The length will be around the standard eight hours and the charge is to be based on the concept of grid congestion in the first part.
The freedom of movement, which includes running and the ability to use a combat titanium, is therefore to be expected.
In addition to the action sequences, the game will feature levels focused on skillful moves.
They'll be like the platforms and include the ribs.
For example, double-jumping, wall running and rope skating are essential to overcoming them.
And sometimes, even enemies will have to be eliminated.
There will be no map missing reminiscent of the maze and levels with special concepts.
One, for example, will allow you to raise and lower the platforms and close a massive door.
You'll be able to adjust the appearance of the battlefield.
The pace of the game should therefore fluctuate between the furious action and the quieter moments of exploring an unknown planet.
We're going to play the footman Jack Cooper who dreams of a pilot's career.
Cooper at the beginning of the campaign, along with Captain Lastima, was wrecked on the alien planet Typhon, inhabited by enemy troops.
And the wildness there won't be too fond of him.
In addition, Lastimos will suffer fatal injuries in an accident, and Cooper will be tasked with launching the Captain's Titan.
His dream of a pilot career comes true sooner than he expected.
But the first step is stealing the battery needed to repair the robot.
Cooper's titanium calls will be important as well.
Players will be able to learn about the soldier's past, but they will also be able to create humorous moments through robotic remote communication.
For example, if the titanium drought names any injuries that threaten Cooper in a planned outburst.
The first information about the Titanfall 2 campaign was brought to us by the Polygon server.
In addition, the results will be available in two months and Bonusweb will give you first impressions of the online game after Gamescom.
Titanfall 2 is out on October 28th, for PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
THQ will come back to life, but the original publisher will remain dead.
Swedish company Nordic is changing its name to THQ Nordic.
In the course of the investigation, the Commission concluded that the Commission had not yet established the existence of a market economy investor.
Nordic has released Darksiders 2 Deathnitive Edition and the Red Faction Collection.
In addition, the company is developing 23 more games, 13 of which the company has not yet revealed.
Thirty years ago, when I was retiring, my wife, after thirty years of marriage, found a man twenty years younger, our neighbor.
I knew it from the beginning - first she tried to get him for obviously a long time, then they got together.
He's such a big guy, I think he's her type, 'cause he's been dating a guy like that before me.
She's totally crazy about him.
In those first few days, her voice even changed, she had such a girl-like, in-love voice.
But when I told her I knew what was going on, she denied it.
I've been watching it.
He left work at half past four, so she always left at three to shop.
Every day she tried to see him at least.
I later found out they met at his house, the laundry room.
How many times have I known they were there?
I took care of the keys, he was determined to find them there.
But I don't know why, I always ended up sitting at home.
I never got to go there, take that decisive step.
You may laugh at me, but I believe my wife's mind controlled me.
I think she soon found out that I was controllable, that I would do whatever she wanted.
And I did.
Maybe I'm just such a bitch.
At the time, the neighbors suggested that he knew about it too.
I was such a jerk, I never asked them what to do.
I was afraid if this all went down, it would be bad.
That this would happen to everyone in the family, only the daughter knew.
So I always put it off, back and forth.
But I went to his apartment one day and thought I might need help with something in the laundry.
He went with me, and I told him I was given anonymity, that he was meeting my wife, and that he was all for it.
I asked him what he'd say.
He was standing there, shrugging his shoulders, looking down and not a word.
Then I met his wife one day on the way from the store.
I told her, but she didn't believe it at all.
She didn't respond to it, and she didn't tell me anything.
No one told me anything back then.
I'm the kind of person who never goes anywhere, who has trouble getting to know anyone, let alone finding a woman.
So I haven't even thought about divorce.
I always relied on it to end someday.
I thought I'd forgive her all this and life would go on.
But it wasn't.
And I've never really been able to get through it.
I still have it.
I used to tell her all the time, but I finally let it go.
He still lives in the house next door and I still live with her.
She's just more than my wife my housekeeper.
She always did everything at home - she cooked, laundered, cleaned.
She's a hard worker.
I think she always tried to make sure I had no other reason to complain.
And you could say she's nice.
But sometimes I want to beat her up, hug her, and she won't leave.
We go out and shop together, and everyone thinks about our happy marriage.
But she once told me she never loved me.
That she loved me and loved me, but that she didn't love me.
And I see she still loves him, he's her god.
And I'm tired of living like this.
When it started, and I was very bad at it, I once told her I didn't want to live, and I asked what she would say if I ended it.
I wanted to know if she'd agree or not.
And I wanted to hear from her, yes or no.
But she thought about it and finally said, "But there's plenty of room here".
Prime Minister Manuel Valls wants to set up a new French Islamic Foundation to serve as a bridge between the state and its Muslim population.
Following the terrorist attacks, France is stepping up its fight against radical Islamists and is calling on the government and the local Muslim minority for help.
"If Muslims themselves do not help the state against those who violate public freedom, it will be increasingly difficult for France to guarantee freedom of religion", said Prime Minister Manuel Valls.
It is intended to ensure that only spiritually educated ones in France preach in the country.
He also wants to stop funding mosques from abroad, where preachers often come with money, vaccinated with jihad.
By October, Prime Minister Valls wants to establish a new French Islamic Foundation to serve as a bridge between the state and its Muslim population.
The new institution will replace the current French Foundation for Islam, which was founded in 2005 by then Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin.
By then, it had already contributed to the transparency of financial flows between mosques and the countries that finance their construction.
Soon, however, she was struck by internal conflicts, and that never worked properly.
"It's a total failure", said Valls.
The new foundation is likely to be led by former Interior and Defense Minister Jean-Pierre Chevènement, known as a secularist.
There are about 2,500 mosques and prayer houses in France, about 120 of which are dedicated to radical Islam.
Since 2012, the French authorities have expelled about 80 Islamic clerics from the country, and several dozen others are considering the move.
This week, the German police also attacked the jihadist clergy.
The Imams were reportedly recruiting fighters for the Islamic State.
One of them operated a facility where believers allegedly radicalized and later attacked a Sikh temple in Essen.
Immediately after the January 2015 attacks on Charlie Hebdo, a debate erupted in France over a new institution to replace a non-functioning foundation.
All of this has accelerated further terrorist attacks carried out by radical Islamists in the name of the Islamic State.
The new foundation will have two main tasks - to ensure the financing of mosques from domestic sources and also to supervise the imams.
But it's not clear where the funding will come from, although several proposals are being considered.
One of them is a special fee for halal foodstuffs, namely meat derived from slaughter according to Islamic principles.
In practice, this tax would be paid to halal food sellers for authorisation.
Some of the money would go directly to the foundation's budget.
The contribution of 10 to 20 euros could also be paid by French pilgrims going to Mecca.
Every year, about 30,000 of them travel to Saudi Arabia from France for their traditional pilgrimage.
In addition, only preachers who have gone through university education programs in France should be active in the mosques.
This should make their preaching in harmony with democracy.
The government is also closing down radical mosques.
"We have closed 20 of them since December and more will follow", Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said.
"There is no place in France for those who declare hatred and disrespect our country's principles, such as equality between women and men", he said.
Zaragoza.
His ex-wife was fatally injured by an unknown gunman Friday morning in a shopping mall in northern Spain, reports the Independent.
The shooting occurred after a woman and her daughter left the garage in their car.
The man was waiting in the car outside the mall, where he started shooting from.
Witnesses said the man then turned the gun on himself, reports the Independent.
The woman was taken to the hospital by her uninjured daughter, and an ambulance had to be sent for the man in critical condition.
The crime occurred around 11:00 a.m. in the central part of the capital of the autonomous region of Aragon, near the local university.
Referring to the Spanish news agency Europa Press, the Independent reports that the motive was probably the recent unresolved divorce of both partners.
Wrapped in a bunch of chillies, wakame algae, ginger and chili sauce.
Summer wishes for light, well-digested food, but we Czechs are rebels and we have our own tastes and our own heads.
And so the summer gardens smell of grilled coconut, goat, pork chops.
Nothing too healthy, nothing too light, even sometimes except for salad or fried vegetables.
True, barbecuing is time-saving and dish-saving, and it's a social thing, and no one needs to be locked in the kitchen.
But there are other alternatives to making good food, which are special dining, preparing them is a small ritual, but at the same time, there is no need to cook, bake, fry or choke for long periods.
And they're also contributing to our health.
Whether it's homemade sushi or sashimi, where quality ingredients and a few well-crafted grips are enough to make the preparation fun and the food itself a true exotic treat.
As well as even easier rolls in rice paper from today's recipe.
Even more time-consuming cooking and cooling of rice is avoided here.
You can just soak the paper in the water for a moment, and then it's all about the cook's imagination, how he wants to play with the stuffing and the accessories.
It's not like an algae.
The advantage of a variety of Asian cuisines is that raw materials are now generally available.
Including a sugary-sour ginger paste, which is a staple of sushi or fresh rolls.
You can make it at home, but true pink ginger has a unique spicy flavor and a delicious flavor thanks to a secret recipe that mixes several varieties of vinegar and ginger.
So you just have to buy a bag of the right size, and the attachment with proven antibacterial effects, digestive and resistant to cough or flu, is ready.
The banana leaves.
They are used in particular in Buddhist and Hindu cultures for serving and decorating dishes in various ceremonial occasions and rituals.
The long, sliced leaves of the banana are very common in many Asian and South American countries and are also used as a "help" for preparing various baked, cooked, and fried foods, which are packaged in a way similar to alobalo.
The banana leaf then gives the food a specific flavor.
They can be bought in our stores with exotic fruits and vegetables, even pre-cut into the shape of wheels.
Instead, choose green leaves that are healthy, without cracks and stains.
Similarly, it is easy to make a salad made from wakame, sesame, and sesame oil.
You can buy it frozen again.
If you eat or cook sushi often, you're probably familiar with algae nori.
In Japan, it is one of the most important seaweed species, and is made by sucking, slicing, and drying nori leaves - plates that are used to make sushi.
Wakame - a dark green algae that grows in the waters around Hokkaido Island - is also eaten fresh and dried and is as popular as nori algae.
By the way, for those of you who don't know miso soup with wakame, it's supposedly used by Asian women for postpartum recovery.
And in fact, this algae has almost miraculous effects.
It cleanses the blood, strengthens circulation, even prevents hair from graying, and is literally loaded with minerals.
Dried and dissolved wakame is also used as a spice, for example to flavor rice.
Fresh algae are first allowed to soak in water, then washed, placed in boiling water, and cooked for half a minute.
Then they cool in ice water, cut the center ribs, and continue to cook, like a favorite salad.
But buying it ready, frozen, is the easiest solution.
So all that remains is to wrap a roll with a light vegetable filling, delicious and light, full of healthy flavors.
Such a long-term bomb.
Unless you resist and add a barbecue.
Eat healthy, easy and summery.
The Asians know how to do it.
You just need a few special ingredients and a little skill, and you have an interesting fresh food that deliciously combines tastes.
And it's done twice.
Four pieces of rice paper, 40 g of carrots, 40 g of white vinegar, 100 g of green chard, 60 g of cucumber salad, 60 g of wakame algae and 60 g of sweet chili sauce.
A handful of chopped coriander, a spoonful of black sesame, a spoonful of chili pepper, 20 g of mango and 40 g of ginger garlic, some pine nuts.
First we'll get the curtains ready.
We'll soak the rice paper in cold water for five seconds.
Then we'll take it out and wait for it to soften.
In the meantime, in hot water, we cook the shell spores briefly, and after about three minutes, we quickly cool them down in the ice water to keep them colored.
We put a vegetable filling on the paper that's allowed and wrap it up.
We fill the dish with white pickles, carrots and cucumbers, which we cut into fine noodles, mix with sweet chili sauce, add the stewed coriander, thoroughly mix and paste on rice paper.
We put the banana leaf with a crust of bark, add the wrappers, and then finish the whole dish with wakame algae, ginger, mango, black sesame, and some pine nuts.
Britain must settle for silver in seven-man rugby, Fiji's selection takes gold
Great Britain's impressive performance in seven-man rugby ended in a devastating final draw, with Fiji beating the British in a final match on Thursday night at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio, high 43:7.
The Fijians have mastered the lessons of processing, landfilling, bending, supporting game, line running and brutal strength - and won gold, their first ever Olympic medal.
The defeat came with an unmatched reward of comfort in the form of a silver medal - Britain's third on the day - and the British could be proud of their performance in the inaugural seven-man rugby Olympics, beating New Zealand, Argentina and the South African Republic.
A 7-5 win over South Africans in the semi-final the same day may have frozen them in the final.
But Fiji would be defeated in its own form by a team of 15 in perfect health.
It's probably not a comfort to the British, but they can be happy that at least one of them will have a gold medal around his neck tomorrow: the head coach of the Fijians is Ben Ryan, former England manager of Wimbledon.
Great Britain has offended a roadblock.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, the Adelaide Sevens lost every game.
They lost only one.
This defeat hurts, but progress is undeniable.
Fiji started out magnificently, the British's breakthroughs reflected joy.
For Captain Tom Mitchell and the other teammates, it was like running behind a row of moving buses and the World Cup champions led 5-0, with Osea Kolinisau coming out of the corner.
The timer was pointing at four minutes and Jerry Tuwai added another down on the right wing from which the conversion was.
12:0 and Britain are hard to hit the ball.
The great Mitchell tried to stop the giant Leon Nakaraw and stop him from scoring a third time, but only slowed the Fijians down.
In the seventh minute, he threw a touchdown to the right corner and the British lost 17-0 on the way.
Nakarawa added another one after returning and there was still more than a minute left on the clock... from the first half.
Vatic Ravouvoua then penetrated the tiny Britons and made his way to the line where he scored.
After the conversion to the state of 29:0, a break followed.
It was like Fiji was born for rugby sevens while the British were still learning to pass.
That's just the way it is.
The British made massive changes after halftime and stopped the Fijians' assault... for four long minutes, which compared to the first half was good until Joshua Tuisov came through after Fiji's brilliant game.
Dan Norton tried to get the British a chance, throwing a touchdown in the left corner to raise the score to 36-7 but the Pacific Islanders had won the game long ago and their fans were singing, waving flags and dancing on the podium.
It was hard not to admire the utterly exhilarating attitude of the Fijians.
In the final moments, Matt William cheered the Fijians on with another attempt.
The whistle rang, the Fijians embraced each other, and the British fell on the lawn, all dressed up.
Earlier that day, Fiji defeated Japan 20-5 in the semi-final and Britain beat South Africa in the close semi-final - by one conversion.
Kyle Brown took the South Africans to the lead in the first half, but Dan Norton, with his brilliant footwork, broke through the defensive line and scored a goal in the second half.
The late late late scrum-half of Marcus Watson, Anthony's brother from England's Under-15 team, secured the victory - and eventually a silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning were inspired to win the rowing race by a trainer who battled cancer.
You won't find any more emotional gold in these games - and that's a lot to say.
From the first shot to the last, during 220 punishing exhaustions into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found another significance in their golden moment at the Estacio de Lagoa.
While there were two in the boat, there were three voices on board, and as the boat slammed across the surface to win its second consecutive Olympic gold in the women's doubles event, the ship was still carrying the voice of coach Robin Williams, the first woman in British sports history to achieve this result.
Their dominance was absolute, their 39th race overall, where they went undefeated.
What we see - two excellent athletes flying over the water with the elegance of a swan - does not fully reflect the nature of victory.
Behind every gold medal in rowing is a battalion of supporting arms that make a difference one by one, and no arms were more helpful than the hands of a trainer who 30 months ago didn't know if he'd make it to this day when he was diagnosed with cancer.
He said it was uncertain.
I had bladder cancer, which can be operated on, and I underwent this surgery.
Anything could happen without surgery.
It would be a very bad situation.
It changes your perspective a little bit.
Williams was diagnosed with cancer in December 2013.
Luckily for the trio, he was able to start treatment early in 2014, off-season, and cut down on the blackout to a minimum -- if that's what we can call it in these circumstances.
I needed to make money, so I had to get myself together fast.
That was a move.
I was in the hospital, walking around the room -- 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet, when they said a few steps was enough.
That's how it started.
Rowing is a journey in itself, but this one was a little more challenging.
Immediately after the victory, their first thoughts were of Williams, who was very nervous in the morning, speaking less than usual as he tried to cope with his own uneasiness.
Stanning, the captain of the Royal Artillery Regiment, who is on a mission to Afghanistan, said, "I've been down with emotions this week, maybe a little extreme, but it means so much.
It just reiterates how much it means to me, how much Helen and Robin have worked together.
So far, it's been three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we'd be nothing, so he's got a huge credit for being the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have wanted a better man for training or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning haven't lost a race in five years.
The pair set an astonishing rhythm that their rivals could not match.
Even in the final 500 metres, when crews from New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, Stanning and Glover had a very large reserve.
We were focused at the time.
Helen shouted, "Don't stop, don't stop.
It's really important not to get carried away.
We got off to a good start and we didn't want to do anything famous.
We weren't looking forward to today's fireworks, we just wanted to cheer up, go out and win the race, which we did.
The two of them will take a year to think about what to do next.
Glover's getting married next week, and she's being cast as the TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Now she wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say it was my last race.
That would be too much pressure.
It took about six months in London to find out I was an Olympic champion.
It was all so new and I was so stressed.
It took about four minutes here.
I feel so much better about it, she said.

The prison?
Rather, he's driving people for free, says taxi hunter Rubesh to the break-in charge.
Six taxi drivers and a former prosecutor in Prague are accused, the Czech Republic said.
You've filmed a number of reports that have exposed fraudulent practices and those who are supposed to be in the group that will be brought to justice.
You've had a few unpleasant clashes with the actors exposed.
How much do you think the report of the indictment of the organized group members is disruptive?
I was hoping there was a trial.
I'm just curious about the verdict.
I don't think they should be in jail.
It's not worth it.
They should first return all the stolen money.
And they should return them so they can get all the people out for free.
That's a rather stern solution.
Does that mean you don't see any punishment as effective enough?
It's enough for me that some of them are so afraid they're not doing the job anymore.
For example, one makes ping-pong, the other weighs pizza, and one completely gives up.
The defendants could theoretically get two to eight years in prison.
Do you think that's an adequate rate?
I have a problem with being taken out of prison.
I consider it a bad punishment.
Putting someone in jail, especially in a case like this, is nonsense.
People like that should give back to the companies that took it.
For a quarter of a century, they've been doing this to destroy our country's reputation and rob people.
So now they're gonna make a good card and free people's room.
I can't imagine it any other way.
It would work like a public benefit job.
Like someone who goes to collect garbage, they get a car and they get people to drive around Prague for free.
No, I really think they're gonna get parole eventually and they're gonna care.
They'll find another way to cheat somewhere.
He studied at Miroslav Ondříček Film Academy in Sand and then at Tomáš Bati University in Zlín.
He's one of the people who started making viral videos and videos directly for the web in the Czech Republic.
She works as an editor for the online television channel Stream.cz, where she participates in a number of programmes, and now prepares the programme Prague Guide, which is aimed primarily at foreign audiences.
In the form of short reports, Rubesh advises which services to avoid in Prague and which to use without fear.
He previously directed series like How to Get It, City of Frauds, Life in Luxury, And Enough! and Prague vs. Money.
The indictment calls them an organized group.
The police followed her for months.
Can a network of fraudulent taxi drivers be called a mob?
They're the cute mobsters, not the kind we know from Kmotra.
It's more like the mobsters, the juniors, but they're definitely organized.
Just that they're guarding each other's staffs.
Prague is all parceled.
I've found out that the main station doesn't like Paris, Paris doesn't like the taxi drivers waiting at the Charles Lausanne.
Everyone's just keeping their own place, and every group is organized.
It's obviously a complicated network.
But the accused are only seven people, six taxi drivers and one former magistrate who warned the driver against checks.
As you say, unwanted phenomena have not disappeared from the streets.
So what percentage of Prague's taxi fraudsters do you estimate?
It's a very small percentage.
The worst guys on the street are still here.
I'm talking about Aleš Ryák, for example.
This is a man who is really dangerous -- he's driving a telescopic crane in his car, and every Friday and Saturday he's standing by Charles Bridge and he's driving people.
Last time I drove with him, he wanted seven hundred for me for three miles.
His police didn't stop him for some reason.
They only picked a few people from the whole big group.
The same situation is, of course, also present in other locations in Prague.
So it's hard to get rid of the now famous Prague scandal, which is probably much bigger than the seven men's charges.
It's not worth anything, of course.
It will help, but all evil will not be extinguished, that's true.
Do taxis stealing foreign tourists still show up in the same places you showed in the news, like Charles Bridge or Paris Street?
Yes, that's right.
They're in these locations every day, and they're violating the regulations every day.
The city police and the Prague High Court are ignoring this.
It's not even kittens anymore, it's total indifference.
Business of Prague taxi drivers in numbers
Yet, some of them, even if they are only part of the group, are brought to justice.
It's a breakthrough.
So I have to ask, do you feel satisfied?
If I took it as a satisfaction, it would be wrong, because my goal was, is and always will be to improve the city centre of Prague.
And even if I feel like I need to do a little better, I'm gonna keep doing it.
You need to push the door from the other side.
Even if the last thief stays, we should still do something to get him out.
You can't be satisfied with that.
But it's not like that, there are more of them, of course.
You're still trying to confront them in the cabs?
I do test drives sometimes, and I have to say it's still bad.
Just last week I caught a cab driver, by the way, from the same group, and he was very surprised to see me again.
He charged 560 crowns for three kilometers, though he later claimed it was 56 crowns (using a ten-digit trick).
He had a license, the cops came, and this cab driver was so cute and stubborn, he still went to the cops and asked them when someone would finally give him the 56 crowns.
It's a similar case.
A taxi driver stuck a decimal on the meter and stole 357 crowns from tourists.
Can you say that the bravery of the fraudulent taxi drivers has not diminished even after you showed the faces of those who were charging useless amounts for short trips in your pictures?
Their audacity is still unbelievable.
What happened to the taxi driver claiming 56 crowns?
The cops sent him away saying they couldn't discuss it on the spot because he issued a bill.
And I think that's going to be a problem in that courtroom, too.
There'll be a cab driver with his bills on one side, and the police on the other.
However, according to the Supreme Administrative Court's decision, the magistrate may not use secret recordings from the taxi service vehicle as evidence in court.
When I was filming episodes of their cheating, the taxi drivers themselves alerted me to this precedent.
I've always wanted to use the footage for reporting.
Are you worried that this fact could protect them from the court?
I hope every judge understands that no taxi driver could drive for six or ten crowns a mile because he wouldn't be able to feed on it.
You mentioned the decimal point trick that fraudulent taxi drivers do, especially in front of foreign clients.
Is it still up-to-date, or are they worried about using this fig after your reporting is published?
I think we popularized this trick by broadcasting the show.
I was driving with a cab driver recently, and he bragged in front of me that he was the honest cab driver.
But then I noticed a black card stuck to the side of the meter.
When I asked him what he had there, he said, "You know what it is".
If the fines on taxis-truckers were not very effective, can a court of law strike them?
Is there anything that can deter them from cheating?
You said that you think they always find a way to cheat.
I think there's nothing to stop them.
But someone can push them out of those places.
And these are fair taxi drivers who should fight harder to get them out of there.
I must say from my experience that the fair taxi drivers in Prague are fortunately the most dominant.
But are they willing to go up against those who ruin the reputation of their services?
They have taste, but they lack intelligence.
They don't know how to walk around and they can't say exactly what they want.
When they organized the demonstration (due to a proposal for a comprehensive restriction from the office of Mayor Adriana Krnacz), it was not very clear what they wanted.
They said they weren't going to protest Uber, that they just wanted the same terms as this service, and then they said they wanted more than Uber.
So they just blocked Prague and it turned out to be the best possible Uber commercial.
How do you assess the Prague Municipality's overall approach to tackling the overpricing problem?
It's obvious that the C.P.D. had to step in to solve something.
The magistrates' court was short-lived.
They had a mole out there that was carrying information, which means the taxi department has been doing its job for years in vain.
I hope that officer is charged with all the unpaid checks until the last check so he can realize what he did.
I think that's the worst thing.
I even went on one check-in with him, which I didn't find out until after their schedule.
It's been months since the last episodes of the series were published.
What's the response?
I mean, the main focus of the show is on foreign audiences.
Whenever I have friends from abroad, I send them the videos.
And then when we walk down Old Town Square, they're surprised that the same people you see in the footage are actually standing there.
Notorious Prague celebrities.
I mean, really.
I'd put fences around them so people could look at them.
The Communist Museum right across the street.
My last question is clear.
Do you take a cab when you need to?
- I'm sure you are.
I'm on a service where I don't have to pay cash, but by card.
I use services like Uber or Liftago where there's no possibility of cheating.
But there are many dispatchers that are fair.
I've only taken a taxi on the street since then.
The driver said to me after getting into the car, "Yeah, you're brave".
I'm dressed up as an Italian tourist.
There was a report of taxi driver fraud back in 2005.
The former mayor of the city, Pavel Bém, went on a check-in that same year disguised as an Italian tourist and was stung by his driver by two hundred on his first attempt.
Editor Rubesh had worse experiences.
Taxi drivers charged him 820 crowns for a ride from Old Town to Václav Square, which is about 195 crowns per kilometer, according to the report's authors.
The Prague Magistrate's Office has set a maximum price of 28 crowns per kilometer.
The reports also show other surprising amounts: for example, a two-kilometer journey from Paris to Truhlářské cost the tourist 400 kronor.
Expensive rides were also provided by taxis waiting at Karl's Bridge.
For a mile and a half to Angel, they'll charge 600 crowns.
Marble is washed mostly with clean water, as much as possible without chemicals, and the longer the better.
The dirt is fine, but sometimes the dirt needs to be scalped, and it needs to be removed from the bends.
It's not easy and it's not fast, the restorationist Vanessa Trost from Oldrichov in The Hague has approached her work.
A hat down in front of it: the tomb is surrounded by a ladder that must be climbed and lowered countless times.
"The restaurant owner should be careful, patient and non-invasive in the workplace", she said.
It's not her first restoration work on Frydlantska.
Thanks to her, the restoration of the stone elements of the facade in the back of the Friedlants Town Hall, the restoration of the statues of St. Mary Magdalene in Zátiše, St. John Nepomocký in Friedlants, Pieta in Friedlants Circuit Street, Marián column in Friedlants and Atlantas in front of the spa in the New Town under Smrk, were completed.
The restoration of the tombs of Melchior, Christopher and Catherine of Redern began in Friedlân in 2011.
Now the surface of the stone elements is cleaned of impurities and debris, and the loose parts of the stone are secured against falling and shifting; they will either anchor to the wall or to each other.
It's also about treatment and preservation of the surface.
The inscriptions on the tomb will go gold again.
"Then it will begin with the gold-plated writing on the marble tablets in pure gold", said the city's State Monuments Authority's referent in Friedlân, Vera Sabotová.
There's no record of the cemetery being repaired in the past.
At close range, they will find holes in the marble columns.
They're hundreds of years old, and they're the remains of a tomb decoration.
It was richly decorated, but unfortunately after the invasion of the Swedes during the Thirty Years' War, everything was lost.
They literally painted the tomb, Sabot noted.
At the Church of the Discoveries of the Holy Cross, the restorers are a bit over-the-top.
After the 2010 flood, burial sites that were underwater had to be repaired, the baptistery, the murals in the tomb, and now the tomb were restored.
"We'd like to go to the stained glass windows in the future too", Sabot revealed.
The church is in very good condition, and we put money into maintenance and repairs every year.
The restoration work to restore the Redern tomb will cost a total of 128 thousand crowns.
They're being paid for by grants, the city won't put any of its money into this part of the renovation.
The 100,000 crowns will come from winning the 2015 Historic City of the Year County Cycle Competition, and the remaining 28,000 crowns will be donated by the Ministry of Culture, Mayor of Friedland Dan Ramzer said.
The winning bid for the restoration of the tomb was approved by the parliament.
Expert opinions on future developments in selected foreign markets, followed by indices and comparisons with the Czech capital market (PX) over a period of one and a half years.
The market is dominated by low volatility and growth.
Who would have thought that at the beginning of the year.
The US S&P500, which underwent a 12% correction in February, is now at a new historic high and has climbed 7% since the beginning of the year.
This reaffirms the iron rule that traders should never go against the interests of central banks, which have always achieved their goals in the long run.
In a situation where US stocks are at their historic high, volatility is once again disappearing, which is currently the lowest since 2014, when markets have grown satisfactorily and without fear due to the quantitative easing of the US central bank and when, as today, the volatility index (VIX) has remained stable below the 12 percent threshold.
And not to be.
While the Fed continues to prepare markets for gradual interest rate hikes, quantitative easing is in full swing in Europe and Japan, and last week the Bank of England also joined the effort, which will buy £70 billion in bonds over the next six months.
The new wave of quantitative easing thus pushes already low yields even lower and contributes to the almost complete elimination of risk and fear of the future.
How long will this condition last?
That's a million-dollar question, of course.
But at the moment there are no risks, the world economy is growing almost constantly without any major fluctuations, the commodity market situation is stabilizing in China and Brexit is no longer a topic, so we probably shouldn't be too surprised if US stocks continue to hold on to a similarly calm regime.
I wish Juncker was studying Klaus!
I am very pleased that my friend Michel Barnier has taken on this important and challenging task.
I wanted an experienced politician for this difficult job, said the European Commission President Juncker, when he appointed a French politician (a really experienced politician, who was so overwhelmed by so many different transnational political functions that we would find it difficult to find a better example of the so-called European elite) as the main negotiator for the European Commission on the terms of the UK's withdrawal from the EU.
Juncker's choice has fueled the hope that it is in the EU's serious interest to seek a future form of friendly coexistence with Britain.
But most British media have adopted Barnier's name as Juncker's act of war.
Barnier is a rock-solid European federalist.
He hates Britain.
As the European Commissioner for the Internal Market (2009-2014), he was responsible for the reform of European banking law.
He took it as he could only take it: a staunch enemy of the Anglo-Saxon concept of free market and the model of capitalism.
A proponent of multilateral regulation, he co-authored the concept of the so-called banking union and, in his hatred of everything that comes from London's City financial centre, has enacted legislation that overly tightly regulates the financial sector and services.
So this Michel Barnier, the representative of Paris in the dispute with London, will be a tough, unyielding and apparently reckless negotiator.
I guess that's not good news.
How can we not recall in this context the calm and friendly division of the Czechoslovak Federation, to which the balance, insight and empathy of Prime Minister Václav Klaus have contributed so much?
That is why today the Czechs and Slovaks can be the closest friends and allies.
It's a shame Juncker didn't learn from Václav Klaus, at least in this one.
It would be for the good of all!
The earthquake around Putin?
The Kremlin ruler has released his close friend Ivanov.
Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday dismissed Sergei Ivanov as head of the presidential office.
Anton Vaino will take his place.
The Russian media reported this, citing a press release from the Kremlin.
Putin has hinted that he will release Ivanov at his own request.
At a meeting broadcast by Rossiya 24 television, the president said he was meeting Ivanov's wishes when he took office that he wanted to be the head of the presidential office for a maximum of four years.
He also announced that Ivanov will be his special representative for ecology and transport.
The report on the exchange at the head of the presidential administration, now led by Ivanov's current deputy, Vyno, is considered quite surprising.
Ivanov, 63, is considered one of Putin's closest associates.
For example, this former KGB officer has served as Minister of Defense and Deputy Prime Minister in the past.
He's now leaving the chair of the President's Security Council.
But Ivanov said in a meeting with Putin that the length of his tenure at the head of the head of state's administration is actually a record.
He stayed in it for four years and eight months.
In this context, he recalled that 11 people had already taken over the post in the 25 years since it was established.
The flowers and the fat ones, Uncle Shapharova and I, we're not gonna play the finals.
So far, not one of the Friday tennis matches has turned into a final.
His first fight was lost by Petra Kvitova, who succumbed to the Puerto Rican surprise of Monica Puig after sets of 4:4, 6:1 and 3:6.
After a while, the Czech fat lady, "Shofar" and "Uncle", followed Kvitova.
The Williams sisters' first set winners reached for the win, but lost two sets and the Russians eventually took the set in a shortened game.
And then they lost the second set, 4:6.
The Czech rower Ondřej Synek won his semifinal with a view, defeating Croatia's second-place finisher Damir Martin by almost a second despite the slowdown in the final.
Today was good, the conditions were great, the wind calmed down.
I tried to save as much as I could, Sonek said.
His opponents, unlike him, had to fight for the process.
So they've lost some strength, it could be easier tomorrow.
But I'm not saying it's going to be easy, it's just playing cards for me, Prague's Ducla said.
But Mirka Topink-Knapkova was not walking the Snyk's steps.
The 35-year-old rower finished fourth in her race in today's semi-final and is set to start in the B final on Saturday, fighting for 7th to 12th place.
London gold doesn't come off that way.
It was the first time I missed the finals at the Olympics.
I'm a little sorry, but on the other hand, I did a good race and I put everything I could into it.
The rivals were just better, the Topink Buttons bowed down to them.
She fought her way to the finish, believing she'd make it to her fourth game in the Elite Six.
She gave up the fight just before the finish line.
I knew the girls were balanced, that anyone could step out of the field.
I was surprised by the Chinese girl who had this finish.
And I thought I could make it through to the finals with the Austrian.
Unfortunately, today she was running a race for life, said the 2011 world champion.
Far behind the final gates in Rio, young shooter Filip Nepejchal, who failed to break through the qualifying stage a second time, this time with a small defeat in the leg.
In it, Nevalekh took 33rd place.
The Russians were the best at qualifying.
Sergei Kamensky led the first round with 629 points, Kirill Grigoryan with 628.9 points.
Nepechal's shot was worth 620.5 points.
Athletes, including Czech seven-man Kateřina Cachová and Eliška Klučinová, also spoke for the first time at the Rio event.
The Czech chess team is ranked 11th in the second Olympic discipline, while the Czech record holder, Eliška Klučinová, is 22nd.
Led by Briton Catherine Johnson-Thompson who jumped to a height of 198 centimetres as did second-place Belgian Nafissatou Thiam.
They both managed to record their best ever performance in seven fights.
They tried to jump another 100 inches, but they didn't succeed.
German, Russian, who's worse?
If we look at the absurdity of these questions: German society has undergone a deep self-reflection, whereas Russian society has not.
In the 20th century, dictatorships emerged in both of the great Eurasian nations, and regimes that were inhuman, brutal and terrible came to power.
The Russian Bolsheviks from 1917 to 1989 contributed to a large extent to the 94 million victims of Communism, as the Black Book of Communism states, whether it was daily individual repression, targeted famine, incompetent warfare, or inhumane experiments.
The Nazis inhumanely exterminated some six million Jews and the total casualties of World War II are estimated at 60 million.
In occupied or abandoned territories, atrocities were committed by the Germans and the Soviets.
In Germany and the USSR, not only a few individuals were guilty, but a large part of the nation participated in these crimes either actively, passively or simply by cowardice or by shoving their heads in the sand.
It's not just the specifics of these nations, we Czechs are equally guilty.
In Germany, immediately after the war, there was a denatification, the Nuremberg Tribunal.
But the most important thing came later.
As the children grew up, they began to ask, "Daddy, Grandpa, why did you participate in such atrocities?"
How could you do that?
It brought real reflection and healing to society.
Until recently, the German elite were concerned with the prosperity of the country, the eradication of poverty, the well-being of their citizens.
Now they have other (often naively idealistic) goals, but they certainly don't want to reattach Alsace-Lothrina or attack someone - in retaliation - militarily - as everyone will probably recognize.
After the losing Cold War in Russia, there was no great reflection.
The window of possible positive change finally closed at the turn of the millennium when former KGB officer Vladimir Putin came to power.
Criminal past is often celebrated in Russia today.
Putin's policy is revenge, conquest of lost territories, humiliation of the West.
The health, prosperity and future of their own people are of no value to the peak.
You beat your own, and strangers will be afraid.
I still believe that it's only after decades of despotic rule that Russians are not genetically or culturally inferior - predestined to Asian tyranny.
Who benefits from the growing tensions around Crimea?
The Ukrainian army.
In recent days and hours, the situation at the Ukrainian-Russian border in the Crimea region has worsened.
Who does it benefit to grow tense?
After a long period of relative calm, relations between Ukraine and Russia have again deteriorated.
The Ukrainian party's claim was the Crimea peninsula, which was annexed to Russia more than two years ago and is part of its territory.
The reports from both hostile sides are, of course, contradictory and difficult to verify independently, so we have only the opportunity to think about an old familiar question, who benefits from it?
According to reports from Moscow, there have been terrorist attacks on Crimea by the Ukrainian side, which Ukraine of course rejects and accuses the Kremlin of provocation.
The information about the arrests of Ukrainian special forces on Russian soil has already come from the case of the pilot Savchenko, a known answer that they were allegedly abducted in Russian soil.
If we were to go to the Ukrainian version, what good would Russia do if the situation around Crimea got worse?
The simple answer is, in nothing.
Escalation of tensions around Crimea can only hurt Russia, especially from the West in the form of further sanctions and intensification of the anti-Russian campaign.
In the past year, the background of the immigration crisis in Europe has led to a shift in attention from the situation in Ukraine.
The Ukrainian leadership has already lost all credit to its citizens, with the current support for President Poroshenko hovering around 15%.
The Ukrainian economy would have gone bankrupt long ago without the generous financial injections from the EU and, in particular, the IMF.
In this situation, the Ukrainian regime needs to draw serious attention to its country once again in order to justify its further requests for financial assistance and to try to improve its reputation with the voters in its country.
President Poroshenko and other members of the leadership of the armed forces want to prove themselves once again as strong men who are not afraid to stand up to the great Russia.
All we can hope is that all those who are trying to start an open conflict between Ukraine and Russia will eventually realize their enormous responsibility for the lives of not only soldiers but all ordinary people on both sides of the conflict and stop their hostile actions in time.
Bulgaria reported inflation for the first time in eight months
According to national statistics, monthly inflation in Bulgaria reached 1% in July.
This is the highest level in several years (since June 2012) and the first non-zero level since October last year when a positive inflation rate of 0,2% was published.
The average annual rate of inflation, measured by the CPI, for the last 12 months (July 2015 - June 2016) compared to the previous 12-month period (July 2014 - June 2015) was -0,8%.
The Commission also concluded that the Union industry's market share was not significantly higher than that of the Union industry.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 versus December 2015) was -0,2% and the annual inflation rate in July 2016 versus July 2015 was -0,2%.
In July 2016, the following groups of consumer goods increased in travel from the previous month: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1,7%) transport (1,8%) culture and recreation (6,3%), restaurants and hotels (1,2%) and other goods and services (0,3%).
Prices fell in clothing and footwear (2,2%) and furniture, household appliances and general maintenance (0.5%), health (0.1%).
Prices for alcoholic beverages and tobacco products, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communications and education remained at the same level as the previous month.
The U.S. Secret Service has reportedly been monitoring Russian hackers for a year.
Information about the Russian attacks came to the public last month when the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) announced it was working on an attack on the servers of the Democratic Party's headquarters.
But there is no official report of Russian involvement in the attack.
Moscow denied any involvement in the attack.
The report of the alleged Russian attack was classified because its reporting would reveal that the US intelligence services were monitoring the hack and detection could be the way they did it and what resources they were using.
Two Russian intelligence agencies were reportedly involved in the attack.
The new Cybersecurity Advisory Board
The Russian trace tracking material was encrypted and accessed by a small group of experts, Reuters reported.
Of the public officials, only a small group of eight leading members of Congress, known in the United States as the Gang of Eight, were informed.
It is made up of the heads of both houses Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan, the presidents of both houses of the Democrats Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid, and four members of the Defense and Security Committees of Congress.
Democratic Party Executive Director Donna Brazile announced on Thursday that she is setting up a cybersecurity advisory board to "prevent future attacks and ensure first-class protection of Democratic Party servers".
There was a dangerous parasite in the married salmon from Alberta.
The chain apologized.
On the basis of a consumer's suggestion of health problems following the consumption of food Losos wild ozen - 100 g pieces, date of consumption 22.11.2016, Prague hygienists carried out a check at the Albert shops on Václav Square and Na Brostka.
The inspection found that batch L23012562/T4 with a date of consumption of 22.11.2016, which the customer notified, is no longer available and therefore the product of the same batch with a date of consumption of 11.12.2016, was withdrawn.
The presence of Anisakis spp. Anisakis simplex has been confirmed by laboratory examination.
It's a parasitic worm of the digestive tract of marine mammals.
It is dangerous to humans - the larvae in the body cavity or fish muscle are a strong allergen, and human-looking live larvae can penetrate the stomach wall into the internal organs, Sticha said.
We apologize to our customers for any problems with this branded product.
We immediately withdrew the said batch from sale and, for preventive reasons, withdrew all other batches of this item.
There was a mistake on the part of the supplier we're dealing with, and we also had the product tested ourselves, spokesman Albert Barbora Vanko told the news.
If the customer purchased this product, they can return it at any of the stores in the chain and get the money back.
Larvae will be destroyed by frost and adequate heat treatment
The seller was Nekton-Vornata.
The presence of a dangerous product was reported to the veterinary administration of Prague and Central Czech Republic.
According to safetyfood.cz, people may develop anisakiosis after being exposed to the parasite, which can be manifested by severe abdominal pain, vomiting and nausea, or the disease can progress without symptoms, the CDC said.
Symptoms appear one to two weeks after eating under-heat-treated infected fish.
After three weeks of onset, the larvae usually leave the digestive tract spontaneously.
Adult worms and larvae are sensitive to high and low temperatures, so they are killed either when fish meat is processed warmly enough or when it is frozen.
Veterinarians are currently testing salmon in the recipient of imported goods in the Central Czech Region.
Three of the five samples studied contained the parasite.
According to the State Veterinary Administration (SVS), a consignment of 1700 products arrived in the Czech Republic at the beginning of April.
Vyeped, mostly into the Ahold chain, there were 919 packages to date.
The unrelated stocks of the product are currently being withdrawn from sales, SVS spokesman Petr Pejchal said on Friday.
Immediately after positive samples were found, veterinarians prohibited the shipment of other products from the warehouse.
A 17-year-old Briton tried to escape from Raqqa, apparently killed by a Russian airstrike.
After the initial excitement and quick marriage to a jihadist who was killed soon after, a wake-up call came.
The expected paradise of the caliphate turned into a hell on earth for British girls from which there was no escape.
The girl's relatives say she was in contact with her sister Halima.
She called her back to Britain repeatedly, telling her she wanted to go home.
Leaving ISIS is like trying to escape Alcatraz.
They have an order to shoot without intent, quotes The Telegraph's family lawyer for the deceased girl Tasnim Akunjee.
The last trail led to Rakka, where the girl made her last call.
Then came the news of her death, which cannot be verified.
Her family was communicating from an apartment in east London.
They discussed how she could get out of Raqqa and cross the Turkish border.
They were hoping to meet their former student there again.
But Kadiz was probably killed before she could escape, as the house where she was staying collided with the ground in May, reported ITV News.
Television added that the bomb was likely dropped by a Russian plane that attacked an IS base in Syria.
You would take blue from the sky just to get your child out of a dangerous area, said Tasnim Akunjee, a family lawyer.
The week she was considering fleeing Islamic State, an Austrian woman was caught trying to escape and was reportedly publicly beaten to death.
I think she took it as a warning and decided not to take any chances, according to BBC Akunjee.
The family would do anything.
Kadisa Sutlana and her 15-year-old school friends Shamima Begum and Amir Abas left on February 17 last year.
At home, they just said they were going out.
But they're aiming at Gatwick Airport and from there through Turkey to IS-held territory.
The girl's family, according to the lawyer, did everything in their power to get Kadizu back.
You would bring blue from the sky just to get your baby out of a dangerous area, and this family did everything they could, poured all their energy to get their daughter home.
But they couldn't have done it without risking being caught themselves, the lawyer added.
The only positive thing he says is that Kadisa's fate can serve as a deterrent case for other girls or even boys who are being fooled by Islamist propaganda.
"There are many cases where people have gone there, realized how things are there, understood how far it differs from the promises of the propaganda of the Islamic State, and wanted to return", Akunjee added.
The fate of Kadisha's classmates is unknown.
But because they also kept quiet, their families must come to terms with the fact that they are most likely dead.
To jail for money.
In Scotland, you can go to jail without committing a crime.
For many centuries, the village of Inveraray was the county seat and seat of the Duke of Argyll.
Since the mid-18th century, the town hall has been used for trials and the basement under the hall has served as a local prison.
Conditions were pathetic, and many prisoners tried to escape.
A lot of them have been successful.
So the city officials decided to move the prison premises to a new location.
Completed in 1848, the new building was much more hospitable, with heating and gas lighting.
In any case, it was not in operation for a long time, having been closed for economic reasons as early as the end of August 1889, since the smaller repair plant was expensive to operate and did not pay much.
Criminal stories and ghost chasing.
The prison opened to the public a century later, and visitors can compare the old building with the new one to see for themselves how different conditions prevailed.
The guides in the time-fashioned costumes reinforce the authentic experience.
There is also a torture chamber where visitors can learn about the forms of punishment used against criminals, whether it was breaking fingers or burning marks on the body.
During the tour, tourists may be locked up in one of the cells, often for a memorial photo or to create the impression that prisoners experience behind bars.
In addition, Inveraray Prison is one of Scotland's most famous allegedly scarecrow sites.
Several groups of paranormal hunters have already gone out there, and to this day, the museum allows people to come and hunt some ghosts.
But a night like this costs 300 pounds, which is roughly 9500 crowns.
In addition to this popular tourist attraction, the town is also attracted to great food, scenic views and history.
The animated effect on Snapchat is being criticized as an Asian cartoon.
Snapchat says this filter is animated, but some observers say it's racially insensitive.
Snapchat allows about 150 million users to change reality and play with identity in ways that border on absurdity every day.
You can make yourself a pineapple, a dog, or a figure that looks like it came from a painting by Roy Lichtenstein.
Filters are simple tools that distort reality, generating more than 30 million enhanced selfies every day.
Any mistake will be made public immediately.
Snapfilters have earned criticism in the past for alleging that the app promotes blackfacing or promotes white skin shades as a beauty ideal.
So when she offered users a filter this week that made them have slimy eyes, crooked teeth and puffy faces, some critics called it a racist cartoon of Asians -- yellowface.
And they asked if these repeatedly controversial questions didn't point to a bigger problem for society -- the problem of diversity.
On Wednesday, Verge and Motherboard posted about it, and news and outrage spread rapidly, and Snapchat announced the next day that it had cancelled the feature.
The company offered an explanation: The filter was designed to show the accounts to anime characters, not as an Asian cartoon.
But to observers who witnessed racism, the filter reminded them of painful stereotypes in action.
The others without the cover rejected the comparison with the anime.
Grace Sparapani, a Korean American art student whose tweet about the photos was widely shared, said in an email that the filter was "at least harmful and embarrassing".
She added that it was difficult to argue against comparing the obvious Asian cartoons and filter effects.
It turns out that the filter is not just about the yellow face, but that the yellow face is stretched to the despicable extreme.
Snapchat isn't the only company that's crossed these cultural boundaries.
It seems that American culture has an endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, from corporate meeting rooms to Holywood and the facilities we all carry around.
And the huge number of young people on Snapchat -- who are more racially diverse than their older counterparts -- can mean that even greater sensitivity can be expected.
"When one Snapchat filter creates an image that is offensive to some user", said 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday, "it's very hard to go unnoticed today like it used to be".
Katie Zhu, a product manager and designer who works for Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account on Thursday and urged others to do the same.
In an article for Medium and a telephone interview, she said she believes racially motivated issues reflect the lack of diversity in Snapchat's recruitment.
Katie Zhu criticized the predominantly white, all-male leadership of the company, and the article ended with the hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
"It's either that they don't have any diversity among the staff and people of color at the time when these things are decided", Zhu, who is of Chinese-American descent, said, "or that people of color work there, but not in positions to feel safe or comfortable talking".
Other observers share her opinion -- a complaint that Snapchat largely left unanswered.
The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its employees, since it has a private company status.
Snapchat on Thursday declined to talk about the racial background of its employees, but according to the company, it recently hired a recruiter who should focus on underrepresented populations and internal inclusion management.
Zhu added: "I wonder if they really need more users like this who can say that it's not okay to have their account canceled.
Military officials have distorted intelligence on IS, says parliamentary committee
The parliamentary committee said in a report released Thursday that officials at US headquarters had modified intelligence reports to paint a more optimistic picture of the war against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than they had provided from inside the country.
According to a preliminary report by a working group composed of the Republican Chairman of the Armed Services Committee, the Intelligence Committee and the Defense Subcommittee, there was widespread discontent among Central Intelligence analysts that their superiors had changed their assessment of the US effort to defeat the Islamic State.
Central Command, known as CentCom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which oversees U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
The press release to the report states: The intelligence services' reports approved by Centcom's senior officers usually offered a more positive picture of US counterterrorism efforts than confirmed by facts on the ground, and were consistently more positive than analyses obtained from other parts of the intelligence community.
"What happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our fighters are hurt when the top policymakers are presented with a wrong analysis", said Ken Calvert, a congressman and Republican from California.
The failure of Centcom's leadership extends to the top of the organization.
The 10-page report details the ongoing problems faced by the Central Staff in describing and analysing the U.S. efforts to train Iraqi forces in 2014 and 2015.
While no conclusive evidence is provided that top Obama administration officials ordered the reports to be changed, the report says that analysts felt they were under pressure from Centcom leaders to present a more optimistic view of the threat posed by the Islamic State, or IS.
In the first half of 2015, many press releases from the Central Staff, statements and congressional statements were substantially more positive than what actually happened, the report says.
For example, a Centcom official has publicly stated that a major military attack to take over Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"This is clear after months of investigation", said Mike Pompeo, a Republican representative from Kansas.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the highest-ranking US Central Intelligence Staff personnel manipulated the intelligence output of the Staff to downplay the threat of IS in Iraq.
Republicans formed a task force after learning of analysts' concerns that intelligence services information about the Islamic State was being manipulated.
Following the report published on Thursday, further investigation must follow.
The Centcom intelligence services are still conducting further investigations led by the Inspector General of the Department of Defense.
The Democratic Intelligence Committee members released their own findings on Thursday, which matched some of the findings of the Republican task force.
Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom developed a very narrow process for compiling an assessment of IS and Iraqi security forces information, said Representative Adam B. Schiff, Chairman of the Committee and Deputy Democrat.
According to Adam Schiff, this process has led to a distortion of intelligence output, damaged analyst morale and insufficient consideration of disagreements.
However, Schiff and the Democrats say they have found no evidence that the White House was trying to pressure Centcom analysts to adjust their conclusions to the "subject" or political situation.
The preliminary results of the parliamentary inquiry were published in the Daily Beast on Tuesday.
Last August, the New York Times reported an ongoing investigation by the Pentagon's inspector general, which was launched following complaints from Centcom analysts.
Lt. Col. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that the Department of Defense would not comment on the parliamentary report as the inspector general's investigation is still ongoing.
However, he noted that experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex data and that the intelligence community and the Ministry of Defence welcome a healthy dialogue on these key national security issues.
The investigation has implications beyond the question of whether the US-led bombing of Iraq and Syria is successful (a statement now announced by a growing number of defense officials).
However, last year's accusations raised questions about the extent to which President Obama can count on the Central Command's honest assessment of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis areas.
Criticism of the Islamic State intelligence has reflected the conflict for more than a decade, as CIA intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker wrote a paper that stated that the administration of President George W. Bush - despite objections from many analysts - defended a small unit in Iraq and spent little time thinking about what would follow the 2003 invasion.
Hooker also played a key role in the resistance against the Islamic State intelligence services.
Last year, authorities announced that Hooker's team concluded that despite public statements to the contrary, airstrikes against the Islamic State refineries did not significantly weaken the terrorist group's financial resources, as the group built temporary refineries and sells oil on the black market.
The Times reported in September that the findings were not reported outside of the main staff.
Centcom's commander, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was then criticized last year after many lawmakers found the testimony of the Senate to be too positive of a war review.
General Austin resigned in April and was replaced at Centcom by General Joseph L. Votel.
The United States have won the fourth game in a row in field hockey, so today's decisive match will be played by the Great Britain team.
Katie Bam in a match against Japan, which ended in a 6-1 victory, scored three goals and just a day later, for the US women's field hockey team, she scored the first two goals of a match in which the US defeated India 3-0 on Thursday.
Five goals in two matches is a memorable achievement, but Bam, 27, said she was not sure if she ever achieved anything like that.
I have no idea, she said.
I'm not one of those people who keeps a notebook.
But he knows this: the Americans at the Olympics lead the games 4-0 and share the first place in the group with Great Britain, who remained undefeated on Thursday after defeating Japan 2-0.
Great Britain and the United States will face each other on Saturday in the final match of the first round.
Both teams have qualified for the quarter-finals and the match will decide which of the six teams will finish first and which will finish second.
The first-place team will be a little longer away from the strong Danes, who are leading the second group.
Whatever the outcome of Saturday's game, the Americans here have stirred up a surprise ride four years after finishing among the 12 teams at the London Games.
Bam was on that team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and first picked up a field hockey game when she was 3 years old (her older twin sister played in Drexel) and joined the national team at 16, becoming his youngest player ever.
She missed the 2008 Olympics because she didn't make the final roster.
Then came 2012 when neither she nor her teammates had much success.
The following year, Englishman Craig Parnham was named coach, and things started to change.
'Cultural change, mental change, physical change,' said Bam.
In London, we didn't have the pace of work we have today.
We've made a complete turn.
On Thursday night, Bam opened the first half with a close-up cannon.
India entered the match without winning the tournament, but the team proved surprisingly tough and maintained a 1-0 lead until the end of the third quarter when Bam seized the opportunity.
She skipped the left side of the field, then she cried out to the center and shot the ball into the goal to get the Americans to a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez added the final goal in the middle of the fourth quarter.
The elimination of American goalkeeper Jackie Briggs, who helped one goal in each of her three wins, was the first ever in the tournament.
He's in great shape.
As was Bam.
"We're in a good place now", said Parnham, "but how good it is will depend on the outcome of Saturday's game.
Zen trampolines in the midst of the Olympic rage
No matter where you are, no matter what time it is, it's the Olympics.
The events in Rio de Janeiro are a persistent, indescribable and intense exchange of competence and effort.
It's like the Olympic marathon itself is a hot stick stick that's passed from a shooter to a swimmer, gymnast, and triathlete.
You can't turn on the TV, read the newspaper, or listen to a conversation your neighbor is having in a coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or the animosity between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, the upcoming sweetheart of women with face-picking balls, is at the Olympics for the first time and could also be among those whose names are heard in the homes during prime time between commercials and sponsorship spots, if he were a swimmer, gymnast or even a sniper.
But Dooley, 28, of Lake Forest, California, is fighting for an Olympic gold in the trampoline jump.
The Olympic fire doesn't shine on all competitions the same way.
Farther from the center, a little shadowy, are sports that are not universally recognized: air gun shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
We'll always have success in the classic swimming style - and it'll probably rule for a long time.
But if I may name my exceptional favorite, let me point out the hidden magic of the trampoline.
Although trampoline jumping has been an Olympic sport since it was first introduced to the Games in Sydney in 2000, after 16 years of intervention, it remains almost unnoticed - many of the people I interviewed did not even know it was an Olympic sport.
It could be regional indifference.
The U.S. has never won a medal in the trampoline jump, and until 2012, none of the athletes made it to the finals.
Prices in the men's category are usually divided between China and Russia and in the women's category between China and Canada.
This year, the gold medals from London will be won by Dong Dong of China and Rosie MacLennan of Canada.
But trampoline jumps are another bad luck, in part because the uneducated ear will seem more suited to a clown university than an Olympic.
I must admit I'm not an expert, but just an enthusiast watching from the country.
It has comic potential -- the comic vibrations of infinite reflection -- but also the beauty of gymnastics and diving, two sports that it combines.
The word trampoline is derived from the Spanish word trampoline, meaning "scoot plate".
Aspiring champions jump on a giant trampoline that will shoot them to a height of nearly 10 meters and perform sets with several elements (salts, spikes, and combinations) before finally landing on their feet again.
According to the official Olympic programme, they are rated by performance, difficulty and airworthiness.
In Rio, 23 athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete.
The usual Olympic track is ahead.
Gold medalists must go on, faster and higher, sometimes to the end, sometimes back and forth, up and down.
They're trying to catch up not only with the target band or the start wall, but, as the TV news reports, another imaginary line: the world record or the Olympic record.
This unilateral effort is noble, admirable, a little fanatical - and enough to make the audience cry.
But I think it's also a bit exhausting when you watch the Olympics.
Jumping on a trampoline brings relief in this regard.
The track of the athlete on the trampoline is upward.
The point is not to move forward.
He or she reflects as if they were in a weightless state like astronauts, flying up, then down, and then again without effort up.
It's impossible without competition and, of course, without difficulty, but for the duration of the build, there's no fierce struggle to reach the goal, no measurement of distance, but only perfect, pleasant stretching of time and gravity.
This is just as close as the Olympics and Zen are getting.
The women's qualifying and final will be held on Friday afternoon at 1pm Eastern time, followed by the men's competition on Saturday at the same time.
NBC will broadcast the finale as part of the afternoon block, which begins at 2 p.m. both days.
Amidst the Olympic madness, they promise quiet, pleasant moments that you'll probably miss despite all the other fights.
And if attention is to be drawn only by male athletes being the object of beloved looks and embellishments - as the Wall Street Journal recently suggested by gymnasts in the United States - then Logan Dooley is just waiting for his new fans to take their breath away.
Protesters in Ethiopia, longtime ally of the US
Violent Protests in Ethiopia
Protesters demanding political change in Ethiopia have encountered violent opposition from the government.
Witnesses say many protesters were shot during clashes with police.
Is there a war in Ethiopia?
In the past decade, it has been one of the most stable nations in Africa, a strong Western alliance with a rapidly growing economy.
But in recent months, the country has been gripped by anti-government unrest that has spread to more and more areas.
In the past week alone, thousands of people have taken to the streets demanding radical political change.
Human rights groups say the government's response was ruthless.
Witnesses claim that police fired and killed unarmed protesters.
The circulating video recordings of the protests, probably from late last year or early this year, show security forces beating young people with their heads up after being forced to stand by a wall on their hands.
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights is now calling for a thorough investigation.
"It has always been difficult to keep this country together and it will be even harder to move forward", said Rashid Abdi, Horn of Africa project manager for the International Crisis Group research group.
Ethiopia is the second most populous nation in Africa after Nigeria, and its stability is supported by the West.
The US military and intelligence services are working closely with Ethiopia to address the threat of a terrorist attack in the region, particularly in Somalia, and few African countries, if any, receive such assistance from the West.
Ethiopia's economy has been developing at an impressive pace.
Its infrastructure has improved dramatically - a new suburban train is even running in the capital, Addis Ababa.
And the streets of the city are typically quiet, safe and clean.
However, Ethiopia can hardly be described as a model of democracy - human rights organizations that speak out against government repression - the opposition in the country has been suppressed, dissidents effectively silenced.
Many were exiled, imprisoned, executed, or exiled far into the wilderness.
But that can change.
"When you choke people and they have no choice but to protest, there is a breakthrough", said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer at a university in central Ethiopia.
It's all the youth protesting.
It's been a generation of protests.
The grievances are many and they cover everything from land disputes to absolute control of power by the ruling coalition.
After the widely criticized election last year, the ruling party and its allies won the last opposition seat and now control 100 percent of parliament.
At the same time, pressure is rising on the border with Eritrea, where hundreds of people died in June in a conflict along this ill-defined, disputed border.
Analytics fear that separatist groups that have been more or less suppressed in recent years, such as the Oromo Liberation Front or Ogaden National Liberation Front, may try to exploit the confusion and rearm themselves.
There are several factors that explain why, after years of smoking under the surface, these bitter feelings have now reignited.
The first is seemingly harmless: smartphones.
Many Ethiopians have been able to communicate via social networks for a few years now, as cheaper smartphones have become commonplace and internet services have improved.
And even if the government bans access to Facebook or Twitter, as is commonly done during protests, many people can still communicate through Internet proxies that hide the location of these people.
Several young Ethiopians spoke about how they had gathered for the protests.
There is also greater solidarity between the Oromo and Amharians, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
The Oromo and Amharians are not natural allies.
For centuries, the Amharians, mostly from the Christian highlands of Ethiopia, excelled in politics and trade and exploited the Oroma, many of whom are Muslims and live in the lowlands.
But that's changing too.
"We are on the path to a united leadership", said Mulatu Gemech, the leader of the Oromo.
The largest protests took place in the Amhara and Oroma inhabited areas.
Many Amharians and Oromans believe that Ethiopia is unjustly dominated by members of the Tigray ethnic group, which makes up about 6 percent of the population and controls the military, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third cause of the riots is the death of Melese Zenawi.
Zenawi, a former rebel leader, was Ethiopia's prime minister for 17 years until his death in 2012 from an unspecified illness.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could see beyond the corner.
Analysts say he was especially skilled at detecting initial signs of dissatisfaction and using emissaries to manipulate and win over opponents.
"The current regime lacks basic knowledge", said Abdi, a conflict analyst.
Ethiopia's new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was pulled from relative obscurity to replace Zenawi.
Unlike Zenawi, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam came from the south.
Analysts say he has no confidence in the security services controlled by the Tigers.
Many fear that the result will be another bloodshed.
Ethiopia last experienced such unrest in 2005 after thousands of people protested what analysts described as elections that the government cowardly and then stole.
A severe strike followed, during which many protesters were killed - though fewer than in previous months - and this period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new suburban train and measurable progress in the fight against poverty.
However, it is clear that the gradual increase in dispute within the Ethiopian government did not stop this.
And there is a dangerous ethnic formation.
Last month, protesters in the Amharic city of Gondar attacked Tigray-owned businesses and anti-Tigray hatred on social media is becoming more common.
Analysts say the protests are putting the United States and other Western allies in a precarious position.
The US government is using Ethiopia as a drone base for drone flights over neighboring Somalia, although it recently announced that the base was closed.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it also does not want its ally to fall apart in an area that is no longer stable.
"That", said Abdi, "is a very sharp edge of the blade.
Donald Trump explains his statement about Obama and funding ISIS as "sarcasm"
Donald J. Trump tried to downplay the latest controversy flooding his campaign on Friday, saying he didn't mean it when he repeatedly insisted this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the founders of the Islamic State terrorist group.
The explanation has raised new questions about the Republican presidential candidate's ability to speak openly to the American public.
He also puts his supporters in a difficult position, who have worked hard to defend him during a stormy time, and he must explain that he may not have taken his remarks seriously.
After this proposal at a meeting on Wednesday night, Trump confirmed the statement on Thursday and in interviews insisted that he did not actually intend to say that the president and Clinton created IS.
But in a tweet on Friday morning, Trump said he was only sarcastic.
The contribution was the opposite of the old one's claim just one day, when Trump in several interviews said that his accusations were serious.
When conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump's remarks with a reminder that Obama was striving to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential nominee did not respond.
The latest storm comes at a time when Trump has tried to focus his campaign on the economy while his preferences in the polls are declining.
Trump and Clinton were in a Michigan economic duel this week.
On Friday, Trump tried to get back to that.
He again warned on Twitter that Clinton's proposals were linked to tax hikes, and said that she thought her speech was boring.
Trump has used sarcasm defense before.
In late July, when he was reaping a wave of criticism, when he came out with a proposal that the Russians should infiltrate Clinton's emails, he later explained his comment in the words: "I'm obviously sarcastic".
This approach allows Trump to push the boundaries of political statements and mitigate them as needed.
"I think it's his way of testing how well some messages have a reaction from his supporters to see how they react, and then, depending on the reaction, one way or another", said Ruth Sherman, a communication specialist who followed the language used by both candidates.
But I also think he's clever with his statements and he knows they're vague enough to be explained in different ways.
As the results of the polls in his favor continue to decline, Trump has in recent days chosen an even more aggressive tone, rather than tempering things for the general electorate.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll, published Friday, showed that Tump is a long way behind Clinton in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado and very close behind her in Florida.
Trump tries to avoid apologizing for the provocative statements he makes, but he often accuses his critics of misinterpreting his words or misunderstanding his sense of humor.
But as Trump faces increased attention in the final months of his presidential campaign, Trump's jokes have put his loyal supporters in a precarious position, who must stand publicly behind him, no matter how provocative his remarks may be.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York City, who is one of Trump's most prominent supporters, had to defend the candidate in a CNN interview on Thursday.
"I think what he's saying is legitimate political commentary", Giuliani said when asked about the credibility of Trump's claim that Obama and Clinton founded the Islamic State.
This is true in the sense that before Obama, ISIS was almost unknown, a small organization that he mistakenly called a novelty, and it happened because he pulled his troops out of Iraq.
Most ordinary Republicans are trying to argue that the Obama administration, in which Clinton served as secretary of state, allowed ISIS to flourish and failed to handle the situation in the Middle East aggressively.
Before Friday's Pennsylvania rallies, Trump continued to tweet about himself, setting fire to the media for broadcasting every word he said and being interested in him.
He laughed at the poor, pathetic TV pundits who were trying to understand him, and he said, "They can't do that!"
Several Democrats have been sneaking up on Trump's apology saying it's just another proof that he's not fit for the presidency.
They've pushed the price of the coffee shop off the market.
The Verb Cafe was a dirty place in Williamsburg where you could pay cash, no Wi-Fi, but where coffee was served for 15 years.
Naturally, she was pushed out of the front of the house on Bedford Avenue.
Soap Cherie - the store that Verb replaced in the summer of 2014 - sells soap in the shape of cake.
The locals were mourning it as the last loss of a growing city.
Artist Molly Crabapple tweeted: "New York is a change, I know, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel is looted and Verb is now a soap shop".
But if New York is a change, then it's also a rediscovery.
The Resurrected Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new Verb has wifi and it accepts payment cards, but some of the original employees work there and there's a similar, modest atmosphere.
The coffee's still good too.
The new Verbu is managed by Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the original cafe who is also the owner and CEO of the new location.
He started in Verb in 2001 and stayed until the end.
When one of his customers offered to pay for his move, he said he would gladly do so.
Rodriguez, 36, left a lot of things as they were.
Verb still has the same bakery vendor and bought the same espresso machine model.
He even used the lighting from the old Verb again.
But Rodriguez said he wanted to try something new, too.
He started using new ingredients.
There's ham, egg and cheese sandwiches on offer and topping like kapra and fried onions.
You'll also find bowls of brown rice.
The cafe doesn't serve beer anymore, but they offer fresh fruit juice.
After nine months, Rodriguez noticed a steady influx of original guests.
"A number of the original customers had to move out of Williamsburg too because of the prices", he said.
One of those customers was here last Sunday, Rebecca Oliveir.
Mrs. Oliveir, 34, lived in Williamsburg and frequented the Verb Cafe.
She was still getting married when the cafe moved to Greenpoint.
She said that after Verb closed, she stopped drinking coffee for a while.
"I found out what I like is coffee and culture in Verba", she said.
Now she's drinking coffee again, but that day, instead of her usual iced coffee, she's mixed chai, another news story.
Tom Rosenthal, another longtime customer, has been a devoted worker at Verba since 2003.
He goes to work and always orders the same thing.
"I come here every day at four and eight, like an hour, and they're already preparing my violin for me with everything and butter", he said.
Photo: Rodriguez said he wanted to try something new and add new ingredients to the offer.
Mr. Rosenthal continues to order what he usually does, but sometimes he has bacon, eggs and ham on his violin with everything.
Rodriguez said he's not sorry the soap store took his old spot.
The truth is, the owners of Soap Cherie offered to make a special soap for Verb and use filtered coffee from the cafe as an ingredient.
"I think we could still use it", Rodriguez said.
The traditional Polish residents of Greenpoint also welcomed the cafe.
One of the new customers translated the offer into Polish, and Rodriguez said he wanted to find a place to put it out soon so his new neighbors could feel at home.
The new place has other advantages.
Local fruit juice producers want to bottle and sell filtered coffee.
The possibility of extending the cafe to the adjacent building is being offered.
Many customers are satisfied with having their old favorite back.
Joseph Whitt was a regular customer, and he said that when the cafe closed, his heart was broken.
Mr. Whitt says that when the cafe opens again, going in and having coffee is like coming home.
"I missed the smell", he said.
Depressive food from the crisis - in Square Meal
Shortly after taking office in March 1933, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat in the Oval Office and had lunch.
President Roosevelt's lobster enjoyed select foods from Fifth Avenue, like goose-shaped pasta and Maryland turtle soup.
But his menu for the day was more modest: devilish eggs in a paradise sauce, potatoes and a dessert of pollen pudding.
"It was an act of cooking solidarity with the people who suffered", said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added: "It was also a message to Americans about how to eat".
A couple living in Brooklyn Heights are devoted to gastronomic history.
Andrew Coe's latest book Chop Suey was about Chinese cuisine in America, while Jane in her book 97 Orchard tells the life story of a Lower East Side apartment building through food.
Their new collaborative work, A Square Meal, to be published by Harper on Tuesday, is a history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.
They showed cooking solidarity and met with a reporter for dinner at the Eisenberg sandwich shop, a small, rugged Flatiron neighborhood buffet that's been in operation since the 1929 crisis.
Jane (54) ordered cream cheese and a sandwich with chopped olives, and Andrew (57) ordered turkey, potato chips, and a mixed vegetable.
A reporter ordered a meatball, which the couple said was a great fit for a food interview during the crisis.
"The carbans were very popular", said Miss Ziegelman.
It was a beetroot, liver and bean curd.
They were made from the mixture and other cheap foods that set the ingredients.
Think about how many beans you'll have to eat for dinner.
Andrew Coe has choked.
"They'd be in your stomach like lead", he said.
In the years before the crisis, American cuisine, especially in rural areas, was served in the form of a buffet of snacks.
Women's teams cooked for farm workers and served freshly baked cake for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during World War I. A Square Meal follows the ways the nation coped with suddenly not being a land of plenty.
"It was a time when food became a central, feared point for the American people", Coe said, explaining why he and his wife decided to write about it.
The new budgetary diet was equally fearsome: mysterious foods like carbans and castrell dishes were spreading, castrell as a "wonderful way to use leftovers", Ziegelman noted, because cooks could hide unsightly ingredients under the layer of cream sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced with cheaper dried fruit.
Meat - the staple of American food for many years - has become a sparingly allocated luxury.
Strange blends, intended to be a calorie and nutritional filling, were preferred to taste or even common sense in cooking.
During her research for a book containing recipes, Ms. Ziegelman prepared a seasonal meal made from baked onions filled with peanut butter.
"It wasn't a favorite addition to the dinner table", said Andrew Coe.
Jane Ziegelman said, "It was surreal.
Peanut butter and baked onions don't go together.
It was typical of many homemade recipes.
As never before and never afterward, home economists - including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Home Economics Office from 1923 to 1943 - controlled the country's eating habits.
They published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, urged women to take on the burdens of the budget, and turned snacks like carrot-creamed spaghetti into delicious food.
The book A Square Meal is a celebration of historical taste.
Mostly, cakes were created in response to the government's hunger-stricken citizens, like President Herbert Hoover's "I'm having a cake" pose.
While he publicly praised the simple Iowa farming cuisine of his childhood, he stood as a select millionaire who became.
"He loved continental cuisine, like fish with a turmeric sauce", said Andrew Coe.
He was eating in a nearly gold-plated room, wearing a tuxedo.
He was incredibly old-fashioned.
President Roosevelt would probably have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor hadn't made him set an example with his own stomach.
As the book tells us, Mrs. Roosevelt hired a hostess who was not interested in taste at all, which led to the White House not only serving almost the richest food in all of Washington, but also the most unpleasantly prepared.
A number of the food habits of the crisis were reversed as the country rebounded.
The link has remained in our ongoing study of calories and nutritional values, says Ms. Ziegelman, and in the way science is applied to cooking.
The couple say that while writing the book, they got a better understanding of Ms. Ziegelman's mother's eating habits - perhaps why she couldn't throw away her food.
"She was really afraid of wasting food", Andrew Coe said.
Ziegelman recalled, "It was a bad look".
There was a wreckage.
When the Eisenberg tables were clean, she and Mr. Coe pulled out a home-made dessert: a pebble dessert that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
"It's called peanut cream", Ziegelman said, adding that the usual trick was to give modest recipes elegant names.
There was no cream, just pollen, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone reluctantly put a spoon in a thick brown substance.
It was surprisingly bad.
Andrew Coe added, and then one more.
And the master of the house said to his wife, I need a little of the cut off fish.
Europeans: Migrants are going for doses.
Most of the refugees who flock to Europe come for economic reasons.
Young Russians make fun of themselves.
This is what the series would look like if we were doing it.

Gilead is entitled to a fee for legal representation in the case of a patent against a C-type yellowing against the Merck Group.
The District Court ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc was entitled to the payment of the fees for lawyers incurred by it in the case of the patent against type C jaundice against the manufacturer of medicinal products of Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead's judgment to pay $200 million in damages for infringement of two Merck patents in connection with highly successful Gilead, Sovaldi and Harvoni drugs was overturned after a federal judge found repeatedly unlawful conduct by Merck, including lying under oath and other unethical practices.
Federal Judge Beth Labson Freeman filed a motion Thursday that Gilead be entitled to a discharge of fees incurred in connection with the case.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, which dominates the market for next-generation C-type jaundice drugs that can cure more than 90 percent of patients with liver disease.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other and claimed to own the basic laboratory research for sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in Gilead's drugs.
U.S.-backed military forces claim full control of Manbij
U.S.-backed military forces have gained full control of the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last Islamic State fighters fled the city, a group spokesman said on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) is now sweeping the city after the departure of the remaining group of radicals who were hiding in the city.
The units have freed more than 2,000 civilians held by the radicals, Sharfan Darwish of the SDF alliance and Manbij military council told Reuters.
"The city is now under our full control, but we're still searching", he told Reuters.
The Clintons made $10.75 million in 2015 and paid a federal tax rate of 34.2 percent.
Hillary Clinton on Friday released her 2015 tax return, which states that the Democratic presidential nominee and her husband had $10.75 million in revenue that year and had actually deducted a 34.2 percent tax.
In 2015, Clinton was given $1 million to charity, mostly to the Clinton Foundation. Former President Bill Clinton contributed nearly $5.3 million in lectures fees to the common fund, and the former secretary of state admitted receiving $3 million from Simon & Schuster for her book on her work at the State Department.
Clinton's running mate, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, and his wife, Anne Holton, have filed a 10-year tax return.
In 2015, they paid an actual tax of 20,3%.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to be models of financial transparency", said Jennifer Palmieri, who helped Clinton campaign.
Donald Trump, however, is hiding behind false excuses and backing down from his earlier promises to release his tax returns.
It's a custom for candidates for President of the United States to release their tax returns, even if the law doesn't require them to.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers cited the U.S. Treasury Department's tax audit as a reason for his refusal to release his tax return.
"Your move", said Hillary Clinton's campaign aide on Twitter, and went on to cite the Democratic nominee's tax return.
Michael Cohen, Trump's special counsel, told CNN on Thursday that he would not allow Trump to release his tax returns until the audits are complete.
According to Trump's critics, including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other members of the Republican Party, they agree that his rejection raises questions about his net worth, charitable contributions, trade transactions and various other relationships, including relations with Russia.
Clinton is speaking out strongly on the issue, and on Friday she posted a video reminding her that senior Republicans are urging Trump to release his tax returns.
On Thursday, he'll mention the question in his speech on economic issues in Michigan.
"She refuses to do what all other presidential candidates have done for decades - publish their tax returns", she said in public.
Politico reported that Trump paid no or very low taxes for the past two years in the 1990s, and a New York Times columnist quoted a number of tax advisers and accountants as saying it could be the case today.
Federal tax rates have become a topic in the presidential election.
Clinton is enforcing a rule named after billionaire Warren Buffett that would ensure that anyone earning more than $1 million a year pays a tax of at least 30 percent.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
Last week, at a Clinton rally in Omaha, Nebraska, where Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is headquartered, Buffet invited Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said he's also gone through an IRS audit and that Trump's not afraid of the IRS, but of the voters.
The Clinton campaign published tax returns back to 2007.
The Clintons, who now live in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average federal tax of 32 percent and a combined tax of about 40.5 percent between 2007 and 2014.
The Clinton's 2015 tax returns show that unlike most Americans, they make only $100 in their income.
Their main investment was a low-cost mutual fund, which they reported to the Clintons on dividend and interest income of $109,000.

Condoms filled with chili or elephant fireworks in Tanzania
Conservationists in Tanzania use an unorthodox method to prevent elephants from entering human habitations - throwing condoms filled with chili powder at them.
This has been proven, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which came up with the idea a few years ago, together with the American environmental organization The Nature Conservancy, is promoting and training volunteers in rural areas in northern Tanzania to use this non-violent four-step process to protect their homes and crops without harming animals.
Many of them used spears in their defense.
Friday is World Elephant Day, which is dedicated to protecting these animals.
"Since they developed this... toolkit, we've seen a change in behavior in these communities, and people are much more confident that they can keep elephants off their fields without hurting them", Honeyguide Foundation Executive Director Damian Bell said in a statement.
The first and second steps are to light a flashlight and play the horn on the passing elephant.
If he doesn't stop it, he'll be thrown out of the so-called Chilli Cloud.
Chili powder mixed with salt is wrapped in a condom with a firecracker, the end of which is sealed so that only the knot can see.
After the explosion, the condom explodes and a fine powder of chili sprays into the air.
Usually, one wave is enough and the elephant goes the other way.
The last option is to detonate a fire engine, which will cause a loud, clear explosion.
Jewish director accused Berlin hotel for removing code to call Israel on Arab request - RT News
A French film director of Jewish origin caused a stir in the media after finding out that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not have a code for calling Israel in it, according to an employee on the basis of a request from Arab clients.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the documentary on the Holocaust, vented his frustration from the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin in an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his recent stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the hotel's call codes list.
However, the state was not listed among the countries to which you can call directly from the room.
How is it possible that in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of Germany, Israel was removed and erased?
It was written by Lanzmann.
The Kempinski Bristol Hotel instead offers the option of calling Israel through its own call centre.
The director was looking for an explanation and turned to the hotel reception desk.
The answer he got was shocking to Lanzmann, he said.
The hotel employee replied that the measure was "decided after consultation with the management of Kempinski Hotels".
The reason for this move was pushed even further by the director.
"Most of our guests are Arabs and they've asked for Israel's calling code to be deleted", Lanzmann quoted the staff member as saying in his letter.
According to the Suddeutsche Zeitung, Israel's ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, called the case a "great shame".
We were shocked and horrified by the incident.
It's a huge shame in itself.
The fact that something like this happened in Germany and in a hotel chain like this is even more shameful.
No further explanation is needed.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions, he said.
The incident sparked a strong online reaction, with people calling it outrageous.
Some believe that the Kempinski Hotel simply lost its way in the demands of Arab customers.
"Shame on you", says another post, which points out that the hotel, which is located on the noble Kurfurstendamm Street, is near the synagogue.
According to the Spiegel, the hotel quickly dismissed any allegations by calling the incident a "preemption" and apologizing to Lanzman.
"There has never been a direct order to exclude Israel from the call codes list", quotes Suddeutsche Zeitung, a spokesman for the Kempinski Hotel.
He adds that the call code has been added to the list.
Police used tear gas and rubber projectiles against protesting Brazilian students
A student-police clash occurred in São Paulo, Brazil, on Thursday when students gathered for a demonstration against government reforms in the public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber projectiles against protesters.
The problem escalated when government law enforcement tried to disengage students, resulting in police using rubber projectiles and tear gas.
Several hundred students attended the demonstration to express their concerns about the plans.
Among the proposals by San Paulo Governor Gerald Alckmin to save money is the closure of nearly 100 public schools and the relocation of 300,000 students.
Some of the demonstrators were seen spraying on the walls signs against interim president Michel Temer.
The latest protest comes just days after protesters took to the streets in support of deposed President Dilma Rousseff as the country's Senate ruled on her impeachment.
Trade between Russia and Iran increased by 71 percent - RT Business
According to Russian Ambassador to Iran Levan Dzhagaryan, trade turnover between Moscow and Tehran has increased by 70.9 percent year-on-year since the lifting of sanctions.
The Russian ambassador said that since the lifting of international sanctions against Iran, there has been an increase in interest from Russian companies doing business in the country.
Russian companies are reestablishing existing ties with Iran while new companies are ready to enter the market.
Further trade expansion is of course one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran, Dzhagaryan said.
The Commission notes that the volume of imports from the PRC and the PRC increased by EUR [...] million during the period considered.
Specifically, Russian exports to Iran jumped 91.5 percent to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $158 million.
The jump in trade was driven by supplies of machinery, ground vehicles and weapons, the ambassador said.
Dzhagaryan also expects a record number of Iranian tourists to visit Russia this year.
Last year, the Russian diplomatic mission in Iran issued about 35,000 visas to Iranian citizens, mostly travel visas.
In addition, Iran has been ranked among the top 20 countries for the first time in terms of the number of tourists arriving in Russia.
It can safely be said that the record number of Iranian tourists to Russia from last year will be surpassed, he said.
But at the same time, Iran is visited by a relatively small number of Russians, and the ambassador hopes there will be a change.
"I personally recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, where the ancient Persian civilization is well preserved", he said.
Scott Callum Skinner is rushing home after the British won the gold in cycling
Callum Skinner of Scotland was inducted into the Hall of Fame last night in the men's team sprint at the Velodrome in Rio, as the trio of VB team defended the title from London 2012.
A 23-year-old Glasgow native was in the brake role, which he took for his Scot Sir Chris Hoy, and the young legend delighted when he hit the target and stole the victory from the favourite New Zealand.
Britain won a surprise victory four years ago, and Hoy won his fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated the same trick after finishing a modest sixth at the World Road Cycling Championships in March, even though Hoy had ended his career in the meantime.
The problem between Beijing and London was replacing the specialist starting driver Jamie Staff.
So Hindes showed up just in time.
After Hoye left, there was also a vacancy that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Skinner was the man of the British trainers, and the search for potential has now been confirmed.
Kenny Hindes - who was the Hoye champion four years ago - and Skinner set an Olympic record in qualifying, but New Zealand took the t-shirt in the first round.
And the British trio won gold in the team sprint.
Hindes was slightly behind his bike, but Kenny pushed the team forward and Skinner kept the lead.
The change in strategy was a big part of the transformation, as the Hindes went for a higher gear to slow down and allow Kenny and partly Skinner to keep pace.
Hoy was watching the race from his position as BBC commentator and when Skinner, Kenny and Hindes took the stage, he kept his eyes on them.
Skinner, 22, a native of Glasgow, said: "It's a flattering comparison.
I'm here to make the best of myself and honor my name.
We set an Olympic record in the finals and beat the best.
It was just incredible.
There's no better way to win this.
After a triumph alongside Kenny and Hoye in London in 2012, Hindes admitted he deliberately fell onto the track after a poor start.
The note was later withdrawn and the British opponents had no choice but to appeal.
This time around this victory, there was no such problem.
Hindes said, "With all the British flags on the stands, I felt like I was in London".
For the last three months, we've all been teamed up.
We've lost a lot of worlds, so winning the Olympics again is just amazing.
It's one event, one gold medal for a nation that has won seven of the ten competitions in Beijing and London.
If that's going to be an indicator of progress over the past five months, then we've got five successful days on the velodrome.
With the form Kenny has shown, it's unthinkable that he would repeat Hoy's success and win three gold medals at the same Olympics.
That would mean for Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, and also has a birthday on March 23 (a date that seems to be sacred to British sport, on which day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister also celebrate their birthdays) - a total of six gold medals and one silver medal.
Whatever Hoy got.
Kenny's next in line for the sprint, which starts today and will last for three days.
A 28-year-old Bolton native said, "I'm enjoying this one now.
Team racing is always the best.
You're winning with the others.
To tell you the truth, winning for yourself is a little lonely.
Hindes said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be knighted".
It was the only medal race of the day, but Britain had more good news to tell.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified as the fastest in the co-operative four-kilometer race.
They finished with a time of 3:51.943.
The world record, which fell in London in 2012, is 3:51,659.
The first round and the final (22:42) are on today's second day of the race, which is really what Wiggins is going to focus on.
Yesterday before the qualifying he was debating with the commissioner when the referee asked him to measure height.
In a similar women's race, which continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavia set the world record with a time of 4:13.260.
The VB team relied on its strong track cycling team and dominated the mid-Olympic era, winning a lot of medals.
After truly exceptional performances, demonstrating absolute superiority in Beijing and London, expectations have fallen during the preparations for Rio.
The background was dramatic, including the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April on charges of sexism and discrimination, and the career ending of giants like Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, as evidenced by the first night of the race at the Velodrome, it seems that the legendary reputation that the UK team can deliver top-notch performance with perfect timing could be confirmed again.
The future of the Portland tavern after the energy contract is terminated
The future of the Portland aluminum plant in Victoria - and hundreds of jobs - is uncertain because of the power plant that supplies the plant with electricity and that has informed one of the plant's owners of his intention to terminate the power supply contract.
This is after the Victorian Government decided earlier this year not to extend the granting of subsidies that keep the business running.
The fixed 20-year grant expires in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs may be at risk at Alcoa Portland.
Up to 2000 jobs, direct or indirect, may be at risk during closures.
And because the tavern consumes about 10 percent of all electricity produced in Victoria, there could be other avalanche effects.
Alcoa closed the Point Henry plant in 2014, which led to the closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
Alcoa's Portland office is in a state of disrepair and is in danger of closing.
This move follows years of speculation about the future of the plant, initially in response to the strong Australian dollar and more recently due to the prices of the plant's production.
AGL, which supplies electricity to a large aluminium smelter from Loy Yang A power plant in the Latrobe Valley, said it expects one of the other three owners to also decide to terminate the contract.
The majority of the plant is owned by the joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, while small business shares are held by CITIC of China and Marubeni Corp of Japan.
AGL expects the Portland plant to continue operating, in other words that the challenging demand for electricity from the plant will continue, it said.
AGL stated that the contracts are so-called provisioning contracts which were to enter into force from November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month notice period, so they will effectively expire in 2017.
AGL still expects the contracts to share in the profit for the 2017 financial year, the plant said.
The Commission therefore concludes that the Commission is not in a position to assess the impact of the measures on the Union industry's capacity to meet the market needs.
AGL stated that it had already recorded the value of contracts in its accounts of $187 million in the event of termination.
Alcoa stated that the decision to terminate the contract would have an impact on its ... ability to operate the tavern or secure electricity supplies to the tavern.
The US company said it had signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010 that was due to come into force in November this year, although it still has to explain why it withdrew.
Analysts are very cautious about the possible closure of the Portland factory in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the weak economy in the sector.
AGL's chief operating officer Stehpen Mikkelsen, who turned to analysts earlier this week, said Portland consumes about 600 megawatts of electricity a year and Tomago about 900 megawatts.
If both companies withdrew from the market, this would mean a substantial reduction in demand on the market [electricity].
It wouldn't be good for us as producers, he said.
Kendall is not only the star of the Kardashian reality TV show - she's now the cover of Vogue September
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of Kris Kardashian-Jenner's family manager, appeared on the cover of the September issue of American Vogue magazine.
Kendall, brand ambassador Estee Lauder, who has presented at fashion week in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on Thursday on her Instagram account.
"In a room full of people I love, I want to cry when I look at this front page", Kendall wrote.
The cover story was followed by a bizarre (or simply a continuation of the Kardashian's humor?) staged video featuring the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (colorful comedians Rob and Caitly and all their favorite show business uncle, producer Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest) on the cover of their sisters' cover, only to end the scene with a classic twist: they're having a secret party.
It's a circulated storyline for almost every Christmas episode of a children's TV show (Seacrest says, "Did you think we forgot you?" with the honestly cartoon rabbit on the 8 a.m. show), but Kris somehow needed to make sure the other girls could feed off of this commercial.
Because when you look at the September issue of Vogue, we're definitely entering a new era of Kardashians.
Kim's older sister may have pressed Kendall on the cover of Vogue (she was on it with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the title of the September issue of the magazine is a different league.
The lightning edition of Vogue is the best-selling issue of the year.
The publication, which is more like a book for advertising than a fashion magazine, attracts a number of advertisers (Fashionista estimated that 615 pages of advertising were available in the 832 pages of last year's edition).
The discovery of the star that appears on the cover is eagerly awaited, so it is no wonder that in the past two years, images of the magazine have been leaked even before its official publication.
Women who have appeared on the cover in the past include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evandelista, or Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have been more celebrity models on the cover than celebrity models.
Jennifer Lawrence, Oscar winner and Dior brand ambassador, appeared on the cover in 2013, and a year later, Lady Gaga was honored.
But while it's highly unlikely that Kendall -- who the magazine describes as the "breakthrough model" of her generation -- will fall into the top category, she'll be in very good company.
These celebrities are not relatives of famous people, or reality show stars, or kids today who know how to make a well-cut video (even though Jenner represents all of this).
They're proving talented women who excel in the entertainment industry.
Beyoncé, who made the cover last year, had one of the strongest years of her career with the release of her album Lemonade.
Of course, not everyone is thrilled with Jenner's success.
Her position in the world of fashion will always be difficult because of her participation in the reality show.
Stephanie Seymour, the former Victoria's Secret model, criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid in June, calling them "the girls of the moment".
These feelings were fueled again by the news that Jenner was appearing on the cover of Vogue.
But this discontent is not appropriate.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of September's Vogue.
She's a supermodel in the real world.
He's performing for Mark Jacobs.
He sells you make-up from Estee Lauder.
She and all her sisters are selling you pictures of themselves on their own paywalls.
He sells photos of Cindy Crawford's daughter, which she took for LOVE magazine.
And in her spare time, she's acting in reality shows, maybe just as one way to see Kourtney and her kids.
Community legal aid centres reject 160,000 people a year
More than 160 000 most vulnerable citizens are denied legal aid each year in community centres and are preparing for the consequences of further restrictions on financial resources for already overburdened services in the sector itself.
In Queensland, three in five people - mostly elderly people, immigrants, threatened workers, victims of violence, and people without the financial means to fight unfair displacement and the like - are rejected as soon as they seek free legal aid and representation.
Community legal services, already so tense to break, are about to be cut back.
Starting next June, these legal aid centers will lose an additional 30 percent of federal funding.
James Farrell, director of the Queensland Community Legal Aid Center, said that the National Association of Community Legal Aid Centers' most recent summary report found that 5,000 people are denied a year.
Mr. Farrell said that without the federal government's decision being reversed, the situation would get worse.
'The community legal aid centres in Queensland are chronically underfunded, meaning thousands of people are denied the vital services they need,' he said.
People who have escaped from a violent relationship, people with excessive and crippling debts, families going through separation, workers being unjustly dismissed - all these people have legal issues, and this report shows that they have no chance of getting the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by 30 percent from June 2017, which will mean that thousands more at-risk people in Queensland will have to navigate complex legal issues without help.
We call on Attorney General and Senator George Brandis of Queensland to immediately prevent this cut in funding so that people can get the help they need when they get into legal trouble.
Last year, the State Government made an undertaking to ensure that legal aid funding was up to the national average.
Now is the time to look at the needs of community legal aid centres and their client communities and the Palaszczuk government must invest in this important work.
A lawsuit against Donald Trump's campaign after a staff member allegedly aimed a weapon
New York: The Donald Trump campaign was sued for alleged inaction after being told that the North Carolina operations director had pointed a gun at a staff member while riding a jeep in February.
The incident was described in a court filing Wednesday in a Charlotte state courthouse handed over to Vincent Bordini, a former state campaign software trainer.
Bordini said he waited months for the situation to be resolved internally before he concluded that it would not be.
Director Earl Phillip "marked the fingers of the gun, put the right trigger and pointed Vincent's head at the Czech", Bordini said in the lawsuit.
The file says Bordini, after complaining to local and regional campaign officials, found that at least four other people had experienced the same with Phillip.
"Weapons do not have to be fired to cause damage", Bordini said in the lawsuit.
The lawsuit comes just two days after a Republican presidential candidate sparked a riot when he told voters in North Carolina that they could intervene with gun owners and holders (as the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution provides) if his opponent Hillary Clinton was elected and could appoint her own judge.
Trump's campaign says the media took his words out of context and that Trump was not advocating violence.
Bordini is suing the campaign for negligent surveillance and Philip for threatening personal safety, using unlawful force and causing emotional harm.
Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks did not immediately respond to the report with a request for comment.
Attempts to get a statement from Phillip were unsuccessful.
WCCB, the local news agency in Charlotte, has announced that Phillip recently left the campaign.
His call to his consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services, was unresponsive for a short time.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is running a controversial campaign.
The Court of Appeal held that the Court of Appeal held that the Court of Appeal's decision to dismiss the case was unfounded.
Britain must continue to spread the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow.
Heathrow will also be a source of renewal and prosperity not only for our local communities and across London, but for the whole country.
Heathrow is hugely attractive to me, just as London was in 2012, when we made extraordinary efforts to ensure that all our nations and regions could benefit from the Olympics.
The Olympics were a huge asset to both Startford and the East End.
And we're going to do that again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
We're creating 10,000 new jobs for our local communities alone, 40,000 new jobs, and ending the youth unemployment around the airport.
As before the London Olympics in 2012, there will be people here who think the Heathrow expansion is too big.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the Olympics and that we would be ridiculed on the world stage.
The complainants were wrong in 2012 and in the Heathrow case they will be proven wrong.
There will always be obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow can answer any question that comes his way.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project involving many people and companies, not just a few.
Expansion is an opportunity to create 180,000 new jobs, economic growth of £211 billion, and leave a legacy of skills and jobs both around the airport and across the UK.
We have a great team at Heathrow who, on time and on budget, have put in place an infrastructure investment programme of £11 billion, starting with Terminal T5 - which has been voted the best terminal in the world five years in a row - to Terminal T2 which was built between the two busiest corridors in the world.
Now they're ready to add a third straw, which costs £16 billion of private investment.
The London 2012 Games were a huge success for the UK and I'm confident the Heathrow expansion will be a huge success too.
It's time to continue to spread the spirit of the Olympics and expand Heathrow, secure our future of business and leave behind a legacy of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.

Adblock Plus - Facebook in the cat and mouse game in ad blocking
Attempts to circumvent ad-blocking programs have become a cat-and-mouse game for companies that make money from online marketing, at least one of the companies that program such software claims.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced it would block advertising filters on its desktop pages, Adblock Plus posted a post on its website stating that users can update filters in their software and re-block ads on this social network.
Facebook said on Tuesday that its desktop website would change the encoding around ads to make it more difficult for ad filters to determine which parts of the page are advertising.
But now Adblock says they've already bypassed the new codes.
Adblock spokesman Ben Williams wrote in a blog post that "this kind of war between the open source ad-blocking community and those trying to get around it has been going on since ad-blocking was invented, and that Facebook is likely to come up with another fix of its own.
The fact that the company that owns the world's largest social network is involved in war only proves how much of a problem advertising has become for industry.
According to a study done by Pagefair last year, and Adobe, about 200 million people worldwide use ad filters -- almost four times as many as in 2013.
Mobile advertising now accounts for 84 percent of Facebook advertising revenue, with 1.03 billion active users visiting Facebook every day from mobile devices.
The spokesperson said the company was opposed to desktop advertising filters, however, because the mobile filters for social media apps and Instagram ads are not working.
Desktop ads are still profitable enough for Facebook to invest in.
Facebook also announced on Tuesday that it will update its Ad Preferences tool to give people a better control over how ads are displayed.
Facebook said on Thursday that the new Adblock filters are worrying because they could also block content that is not related to advertising.
"This is not a pleasant experience for people and we want to solve this problem", a Facebook spokesman said in an email statement.
Adblocking is a very insensitive tool, so we've focused on building tools like Ad Preferences that give people control.
A woman was hit by a car on a Swiss highway
Victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are looking for witnesses to an incident Thursday morning where several cars were driven by a woman who may have attempted suicide.
The accident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight on Thursday.
Vaud police said in a statement that the actress of the "desperate" act was lying in the dark on the road and was greeted by several cars.
It's clear that the victim, a 49-year-old woman, tried to kill herself and was hit by several cars, including a truck.
She died on the spot.
Several drivers have already been questioned, but police say they have not yet been identified, and police are urging these drivers and all other witnesses to register.
A criminal investigation has been opened, a logical step in a situation like this, said lawyer Gilles Hofstetter to Le Tribune de Geneve.
It remains to be seen whether any of the drivers involved will face any charges.
Was it possible to prevent the impact?
This is something the prosecutor needs to find out, Hofstetter said.
Based on two similar cases from the last five years, it seems that drivers will not be held responsible.
In both cases - one involving a person walking on the highway - it was decided that motorists could not expect a pedestrian crossing the highway in the middle of the night, the newspapers reported.
Last year, a police officer was acquitted of negligent homicide after she struck and killed a man lying on the A1 near Paynerne on the night of August 2014.
The court found that the 22-year-old victim drank alcohol and passed out on the road.
The court found that the police officer - who was responding to the emergency call - was driving in an appropriate manner and that the presence of a man on the road was a "totally exceptional and unpredictable situation", the judge said.
Anyone with information about Thursday's incident at Morges should report to the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
A tolerant city.
Prague is a popular destination for the LGBT community.
The Association of Czech Travel Agencies and Agencies (AČCKA) expects up to 20,000 visitors to Prague as part of Prague Pride.
This was announced by the CEO of the AČCKA, Katerina Petříčková, on Friday.
The sixth edition of Prague Pride began on August 8, bringing the lives of lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transgender people (LGBT) closer together.
Last year, about 35,000 people attended the event.
"Prague is among the most popular destinations for the LGBT community, due to its high tolerance and a wide range of specialized businesses", Petříčková said.
According to a poll of organisers, foreign visitors to the festival spend on average 3100 crowns per person per day.
For gay tourists, a special map of Prague is available to support their travel with a complete list of Prague's gay and gay-friendly bars, clubs, cafes and restaurants in the form of mobile apps, etc.
"For tourism in general, LGBT customers are very lucrative, interested in staying in higher price relationships with high standards of travel services and spend more than others", Petříčková said.
The first Pride Tourism Symposium is also taking place this year.
It is attended by experts from the LGBT tourism sector from Europe, the US and China.
The festival continues until Sunday, August 14.
The theme this year is love, but the event will also focus on several thematic areas, including family, AIDS prevention and transgender issues.
The festival culminates in a traditional parade of allegorical cars from Václav Square to Summer.
A rally attended by thousands in recent years will honor this year's memory of the victims of the June attack at a nightclub in Orlando, where an attacker shot 49 people, mostly gays.
Pat and Matt are celebrating their 40th birthday.
The relentless quirks Pat and Mat, whose efforts usually end in disaster, have entertained audiences of both size and size for forty years.
The pilot episode of this late-night series, directed by Lubomir Beneš, premiered on August 12, 1976.
The animated series, now known to audiences in more than a hundred countries around the world, was created by artist and director Lubomir Beneš, who created the two-boxes of the Lords Ouholíček and Sedlec for the magazine.
Benesh then invited the playwright Jiří Kubíček and the artist Vladimir Jiranek to collaborate and together they created the film Kuciáci.
The current form of yellow and red tricks and bullets and radio was given to the characters in 1979, when a series for Slovak television began to be created in the short film Prague.
The names Pat and Mat were given in 1985, this time for the short film Prague.
In 1990, Lubomír Beneš founded his own animation studio AIF Studio in Prague and Zurich, where other works were created.
After his death in 1995, other works with other creators continued, many of them with Benes' son Marek.
There are currently over 90 episodes of stories of these boxers who are all right, but never get angry with each other and are always full of optimism, ideas and boxing enthusiasm and finally happy with their work, as evidenced by the well-known gesture "...and that's it!"
Pat and Matt have even moved from television screens to books, DVDs and theater, and characters and other toys featuring Pat and Matt are a hit at every toy store.
A fairy tale for Fiji and for two years of Harmony.
The weekend is a fairy tale sign, we've chosen one for you, sports and life.
Both have good endings.
Let's see.
Fiji has achieved historic success.
What is the reason for the joy of the whole country?
A two-year-old British girl has an identical friend and she's happy with her.
And what are the things people spend the most on at airports?
This is a Friday overview of the World Wide Web.
First medal of the Olympics.
The island nation of Fiji celebrates its historic achievement.
The rugby team of this archipelago defeated the Great Britain team in the final of the Olympic rugby sevens tournament.
It's the first medal Fiji has ever won at the Olympics.
The first precious metal had been waiting for profit for 60 years since the first expedition to the Olympics was sent.
The Fiji coach has a great credit for success.
But the irony is that it's Brit Ben Ryan.
The team has been in charge since 2013 and after the final as a British citizen, unlike his fellow citizens, he could be satisfied.
"Let's play it easy and free and see if we can make the biggest game in our history", the coach said before the final.
Fiji eventually gained sovereignty over it, and a small nation of 900,000 now lives the Olympic fairy tale.
The news was reported by the French newspaper Le Monde.
New friend and good luck for a little girl.
2-year-old Harmonie-Rose Ivy Allen, who has been without arms and legs for 11 months, has a new girlfriend.
A doll that looks like her.
"Mom, she's like me", rejoiced a two-year-old girl, as her mother told ABC News.
She added that her daughter likes to take off her hands and feet and then sit together without the prosthetics.
Harmony was diagnosed with type B meningitis less than a year into her life, and doctors gave her only a 10 percent chance of survival.
There's nothing I wouldn't love about her.
She's beautiful, smart, funny and never gives up.
He's got a good eye.
I saw her introduce herself to the other children with the words "Hello, I'm Harmony and I don't have arms", her mother added.
Look at the joy the doll has caused.
What's the most money we spend at the airport?
CNN reports that people at airports spend the most on bottled water.
Hudson's Travel Essential Stores has released data for the past year, summarizing the 10 products customers buy most often in its airport stores.
Water was supremely first.
The drinks were generally very popular, with eight of them in the top 10.
Ninth place was taken by a large pack of coconut-flavored M&M candies.
And can you guess who's closing the top ten?
As the only thing above, it's not edible.
According to CNN, it's the Wall Street Journal.
Other popular newspapers sold at airports include the New York Post, The New York Times USA Today.
Among the magazines are US Weekly, In Touch and The Economist.
The sovereigns of the Knights.
We're just going to win, Murray and Bond are laughing.
New Zealand rowers Eric Murray and Hamish Bond have been sovereign over the unmanned pair category for seven years and have confirmed their dominance at the Rio Olympics.
At first glance, the two have been a little different after the Beijing Olympics and have been competing since 2009.
At the Rodriga de Freitas lagoon, they claimed their 69th consecutive win in the quarterfinals.
How are we different from the others?
We're just nicer, Murray joked about during the Olympic race when he was asked about the dominance of the New Zealand team.
Frankly, we're not doing anything different than the others.
We're just training hard, very hard.
And we're constantly trying to improve our technique, that's our philosophy, Murray said more seriously.
Their superiority is also remarkable because they are physically different.
Murray is a nearly two-foot-tall, stocky-foot, academically-looking Bond is five centimeters smaller and 15 kilograms lighter.
Besides, they're different in nature.
Bond is a college student and a financial advisor, Murray is a charity boxing match.
And that's why they don't spend much time together outside of rowing.
Eric's getting on the boat basically with the idea that we can't lose.
We're just going to win.
I tend to think about what could go wrong, Bond admitted, who even made it clear at a press conference that Murray was the dominant crew member.
He was the one who always answered first, and Bond was waiting for his chance.
But on the water, he destroys his opponents with calm force.
They are moving at their own pace, and although they are often not in the lead halfway through, their opponents have not yet found a recipe for their gradual acceleration.
We're racing a two-mile course, and we never wanted to go the first mile.
We're just trying to keep up with the pace that no one else can.
We know what we have to do to win, said Murray, 34.
With his four-year-old partner, he won seven gold medals at the world championships.
They also won in 2007, when both members of the Golden Four were without a helmsman.
It was after an unexpected failure at the Beijing Olympics that a year later the larger crew decided to move to a two-piece without a rudder.
At the London Olympics, they apparently suffered the biggest defeat of their career and confirmed their dominance in Rio.
London was very intense.
We did everything the coach told us to do, and they didn't ask us anything.
It was a little more fun this time.
We knew it was going to be a hell of a lot harder, and we had to make sure we were psychologically okay with it, Murray said.
We know they're all trying to overthrow us.
We always have that target on our backs.
But we're trying to be half a step ahead of everybody, he added.
Climate model by NASA: Venus was once inhabited
According to NASA's new climate model, Venus was once inhabited.
Scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies have developed a model for exploring Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those used by scientists working on climate studies.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus, whose surface is hot, without water and saturated with CO2, could once have had conditions similar to those on Earth.
Scientists have previously suggested that Venus' low rotation rate can be explained by its dense atmosphere.
But according to the latest simulations, it appears that Venus once boasted a thin Earth-like atmosphere, while rotating slowly.
The model also dealt with the earlier topography of Venus.
Earth's landmass was probably drier than Earth's, but it once had enough water and geographic diversity to sustain life and provide protection from rapid evaporation.
Venus used to use the Sun, which was 30 percent dimmer.
In a simulation of the GISS model, Venus exposes its daily side to the sun for almost two months at a time during a slow rotation, explained GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a new report.
This warms the surface and creates rain, which creates a thick layer of clouds that behave like an umbrella and shield the surface from the sun's excessive heat.
The result is a climate with average temperatures that are actually slightly lower than the Earth currently has.
The model compiled a story of Venus-like evolution that had previously been hypothesized by planetary scientists.
Although Venus was probably inhabited in the past -- over several billion years -- it was exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet radiation.
Its oceans evaporated and its water vapours were burned by ultraviolet light.
Hydrogen escaped, leaving only a dense atmosphere of carbon dioxide with the deadly effect of greenhouse gases -- that's Venus as we know it today.
The researchers published their results from the new climate model of Venus in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigned as head coach of the Colorado Avalanche.
Patrick Roy resigned his position as coach and vice president of hockey operations for the Colorado Avalanche on Thursday, citing his inability to participate in the decision-making process on team matters.
Colorado Executive Vice President and General Manager Joe Sakic confirmed the move and said the club will immediately begin looking for a new coach.
"For the past three years, I've been the head coach and vice president of hockey operations for the Colorado Avalanche, with energy, passion and determination", said 50-year-old Roy in a statement.
I've been thinking long and hard over the years about how I can improve the team, give it the depth it needs, and take it to the next level.
To achieve this, it is necessary that the vision of the coach and the Vice President of Hockey Operations is consistent with the vision of the organisation.
They must also be able to participate in decisions that affect the team's performance.
These conditions are not currently met.
The Sakic, which Roy accepted on May 23, 2013, thanked him for his contributions to the team.
"Patrick informed me of his decision today", Sakic said.
We appreciate everything he's done for our organization, and we wish him all the best for his future.
Roy was nominated for the Jack Adams Award as the league's top coach during his first season with the Avalanche in 2013/2014.
He led the team to 112 points and first place in the Central Division, but Colorado faced Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs and for the past two years, he's never had a good postseason game.
The Avalanche finished the 2015-16 season with a 39:39:4 record and were five points short of their second wild card in the Western Conference.
Hall of Fame quarterback Roy won the Stanley Cup four times -- twice with the Montreal Canadiens and twice with the Avalanche.
Oil workers in the North Sea resume talks and strike halt
The High Representatives of the Parties said that the strike on wages for workers in the North Sea oilfields was suspended while all parties to the dispute had met for a new round of negotiations.
Strikes against the Wood Group oilfield services company have occasionally taken place on the North Sea platforms operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
Wood Group and the trade unions Unite and RMT can confirm that they have agreed to resume the process to resolve current disputes,the statement said.
Starting next week, we'll have a series of day-long meetings over the next few weeks where we'll try to look at the issues from new angles.
According to the union, their recent action, which they say was the first in more than 25 years, is a protest against wage cuts of up to 30 percent.
Wood Group reduced rates this year and paid its suppliers in the North Sea about 9% less due to negative market pressure.
The reduction in the company's rates follows a 10% reduction for coastal companies in 2014.
The company claims that further cuts would give companies room to cope with the market decline.
On the other hand, Shell has stripped thousands of people of their paychecks and announced plans to abandon oil and gas operations in as many as 10 countries to modernize its processes - immediately following a mega merger with British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure from low oil prices, the economic situation linked to Britain's June decision to leave the European Union.
Scottish MP Dave Anderson met with union leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labour disputes of our generation that led to a North Sea strike.
The North Sea, he said, is vital to the region's economy.
"In the North Sea and across the country, we need an economy that works for everyone, not just some", he said in a statement.
For comparison, almost $1.4 billion of new projects in the North Sea are expected to be invested in 2016, while the average over the past five years was around $7 billion.
Kepler is measuring the speed of the stars in the Pleiades.
The latest mission of the Kepler Space Telescope to assist astronomers is to obtain a nearly complete list of the rotational speeds of stars in the Pleiades.
New data help astronomers understand why stars rotate at different speeds in a star cluster, and how rotation time relates to the formation of the planet.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other star clusters, we will learn more about the relationship between stellar matter, its age, and even the history of its solar system", said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a new report.
The Pleiades is located 445 light-years from Earth.
Many stars, in aggregate, are now reaching maturity, having formed over 125 million years ago.
Now it's turning faster than ever.
At their peak, these teenage stars release a huge amount of stellar wind.
Because these winds move along the magnetic fields of stars, they have a slowing effect on them.
As the star ages, its rotation rate slows down.
Kepler measures the speed of rotation of each star by measuring the time between the discovery of distinct points on stars -- similar to sunspots.
According to the latest data on rotational speeds, larger stars rotate more slowly than smaller massive stars.
Rebull compares stars to dancers, making larger pirouettes slower than smaller ones.
"In the Pleiades, we see that slower-spinning stars are more massive, while those that spin faster are usually very light stars", Rebull said.
Because the Pleiades cluster is so close, it serves as the ideal space laboratory for comparing the quality of stars and their rotational velocities.
"The pleats provide an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions, in younger and older stars", Rebull said.
There's still a lot to learn about how, when and why stars slow down their spins, so to speak, hanging their dance shoes on the nail.
Rebull and her colleagues have detailed the latest analysis of Pleiades' rotational speeds in three studies that will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
Is a qualification agreement necessary?
If I didn't sign up, then the qualification agreement wouldn't be finalized and after a few months I could move to another hospital?
Is it possible to work after school without special education?
The point is that the job I want to work in is now only available in a slightly more distant hospital, but in about six months, there could be a job in another one where I would like to work.
I don't know how to handle the situation about that half year, the question goes on.
This is Mr. Lenka the Wolf.
No legislation provides for the obligation to conclude a qualification agreement with the employer - the hospital.
A qualification agreement is a legal institution governed by the Labour Code and may be concluded between an employee and an employer in order to ensure the return on costs incurred in raising or deepening the employee's qualifications.
In the health sector, however, long-term pressure is developing not to conclude these agreements with a view to ensuring the mobility of healthcare workers and not all hospitals currently require this agreement.
According to Law No 95/2004 Coll., on the conditions for obtaining and recognising professional qualifications and specialised qualifications for the medical profession of doctor, dentist and pharmacist, it is expressly stated that participation in specialised training is considered to be a deepening of qualifications (not an increase).
This means that a qualification agreement can only be concluded under the Labour Code if the costs reach at least CZK 75 000.
No legislation or regulation requires you to enroll in specialised education.
The law only lays down the conditions for applying for inclusion in specialised education.
However, the doctor is legally entitled to practise the profession of doctor already by having completed the necessary university degree, although under the conditions laid down by law (under the supervision of a specialist qualified doctor in the relevant field).
The law provides for a situation where professional practice in another area of specialization may be included in the medical specialisation, provided that its content and scope correspond to the relevant training programme.
In theory, it would be possible to calculate the time spent elsewhere, which would correspond to the situation of the person in question.
However, as I do not know the details of the case, it is advisable to consult the relevant department of the Ministry of Health (the Science and Medical Professions Committee), since the Ministry of Health provides statutory advice and consultation services related to and during specialised education.
The Czech Medical Chamber also provides free consultation services, of which every doctor must be a member.
The Syrian medical team in Halab is calling for US intervention.
The United States has not made any efforts to end the siege (rebel parts of the city by government troops) and has not used its influence to promote the protection of civilians, AFP quoted a letter to the White House as saying.
"We do not need tears, compassion, or even prayers; but we desperately need to create a no-fly zone over eastern Halab to stop the attacks, and we need international action to ensure that Halab is not besieged again", the doctors said.
Russian forces, which support the military loyal to President Bashar Assad, have announced that they will halt three-hour daily strikes in the Halab area as of today to allow safe passage for humanitarian convoys.
From 9:00 to 12:00 SELČ, all military activities, airstrikes and artillery fire must be stopped.
While UN humanitarian chief Stephen O'Brien welcomed the move, he stressed the need for at least a two-day truce.
According to AFP, Obama was contacted in a letter by 15 of the 35 doctors working in the eastern part of Halab, which is now controlled by the rebels.
He writes that during the five-year war, they witnessed the violent, cruel deaths of countless patients, friends and colleagues.
The world is watching and realizing how complicated Syria is, but doing little to protect us.
Recent offers to evacuate Syrian residents and Russia sound like a slightly overt threat, pediatricians, surgeons and other doctors have pointed out.
Doctors said that in the past month, 42 attacks on medical facilities in Syria have been recorded, including 15 on hospitals where they work.
The sad thing is that we have to decide who lives and who dies.
We have children who are so seriously injured that we have to choose the ones most likely to survive.
And sometimes we don't even have the materials to help them, doctors describe.
Two weeks ago, four newborns were choked when the explosion cut off oxygen supplies to their incubators.
They took their breaths and then their lives ended before it could really begin, they recalled.
The army loyal to President Bashar Assad, backed by Russian forces, has in recent weeks surrounded the rebel-held eastern part of Halab, leaving more than 200,000 people without food supplies.
The rebels, who are under constant attack from the Russian and Syrian air forces, managed to break through the siege and launch a counter-offensive on Saturday after three weeks.
Both sides then joined forces in the city and its surroundings.
