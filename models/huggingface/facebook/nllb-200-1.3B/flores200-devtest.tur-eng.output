This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, which is already a theory, but it also provides details like color and three-dimensional arrangement that fossils generally cannot.
Scientists say that the feathers of this animal are pale or carotenoid in color at the base of the body and chestnut-brown at the top.
The discovery also provides clues to the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since dinosaur feathers did not have a well-developed stem called the bird's feather stem, but did have other feather features, such as fangs and fanglets, the researchers concluded that the feather stem was likely an evolutionary development that evolved later than these features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature control and imaging, suggesting that the specimen shows adult feathers rather than pups, even though this is the tail of a young dinosaur.
Although this was the tail of a young dinosaur, researchers claimed that it was pointing to adult feathers, not to a chick's, for example.
A car bomb exploded yesterday morning at the police headquarters in the Turkish city of Gaziantep, killing two police officers and injuring more than 20 others.

Brightness and rotation are used together to determine the Rossby number associated with the plasma flow of a star.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is compared to magnetic inversions.

Voting in France is traditionally a low-tech experience: voters are left alone in a booth, and they put a pre-printed piece of paper showing the candidate they've chosen in an envelope.
Once the authorities have confirmed the voter's eligibility, the voter places the envelope in the box and signs the voter list.
French electoral law regulates the process quite strictly.
Voting boxes have been transparent since 1988, so that voters and observers can confirm that there are no envelopes in the ballot boxes at the start of voting and that no envelopes have been added to the boxes except for those thrown by voters who are deemed appropriate and approved.
Candidates can send representatives to witness each stage of the process, and in the evening, votes are counted by volunteers under intense observation, following certain procedures.

He is in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but the credibility of the evidence that witnesses can present may be compromised by the fact that the photo is widely available.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scottish justice has found the publication of photographs potentially objectionable.
"When journalists publish pictures of suspects, etc., they make it look like they are walking a dangerous line", says Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee.
The Royal Office, which is in charge of the prosecution, told reporters that it would not comment until at least the indictment is ready.
The leaked document allegedly refers to a border dispute in which Palestine demanded a return to the borders that preceded the 1967 Arab-Israeli War.
Other issues covered include the future status of the holy city of Jerusalem and the Jordan Valley.
Israel has demanded that the valley be occupied for ten years after the signing of the agreement, while the Palestinians agree to limit this condition to five years.
The hunters involved in the complementary insect-disinfection trial were scheduled to be closely monitored by guards while the trial was observed and the effectiveness evaluated.
A joint effort by the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc. has joined the team of qualified volunteers as part of the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Park Conservation Deputy Director Mick O'Flynn and NPWS Legacy, the four hunters selected for the first hunting operation received extensive safety training and training.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday before the new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
This will be Martelly's fifth Interim Electoral Council in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the CEP's resignation as part of a package of measures to get the country into a new election.
Martelly responded with this commission to the high-profile anti-regime protests that began in October.
The failure to hold the required elections has set the stage for sometimes violent protests, some of which have been waiting since 2011.
A total of six fires and about 60 iPod overheating cases were reported, causing minor burns in four people.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents involving the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of 34 new extreme warming events, and that the company considered these events to be in the "not serious" category.
The ministry responded by calling Apple's delay of the report "really sad".
The earthquake occurred at 07:19 local time (09:19 GMT on Friday) in the Marianas.
The Northern Marianas Emergency Management Bureau said there were no reports of damage in the country.
Also, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer hijacked a bus in the Philippine capital of Manila and took hostage Hong Kong tourists.
Rolando Mendoza fired on tourists with an M16 rifle.
It was confirmed that at least six people have been killed so far, while numerous hostages have been rescued.
Six hostages, including children and elderly people, were released along with Filipino photographers.
Then the photographers went to an old woman who had to go to the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and embarked on a career in medicine.
She trained as an obstetrician and began work at the Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began studying preterm birth in his spare time.
His research showed that if given hormones, the baby's fetal lungs would mature faster.
Xinhua reported that government investigators on Wednesday recovered two "black boxes" of flight recorders.
His wrestling buddies paid their respects to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of Extreme, and my first manager, Luna, died the night she was two months old, and she's just as unique as she is, a strong woman".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels said, "Luna was as strange as I was... maybe even more so... I love her and I'll miss her... I hope she's in a better place".
A poll of 1,400 people before the 2010 federal election showed that the number of people who opposed Australia becoming a republic had increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should be a republican treacherous country at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's term.
34 percent of those polled share this view, wanting Queen Elizabeth II to be the last Queen of Australia.
At the end of the poll, 31 percent believe Australia should never be a republic while 29 percent of those polled believe Australia should be a republic as soon as possible.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and the three flag events at the British Commonwealth Games but his fitness is in question due to complaints.
He couldn't get the medication he needed to ease his pain because they were banned from competitions.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number ever known on January 25.
In early February, many people confirmed the discovery using different hardware and software, and it was announced on Tuesday.
The source comets could be the ones that bring water to Earth, along with the organic matter that makes up proteins and can support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets, especially Earth, formed when comets collided with Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office earlier this year, and just last month, he signed a bill that legalized gay marriage.
He called the rumours "political gossip and stupidity".
There's speculation that he's going to be a presidential candidate in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims will allow planes to fly shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel each year, and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to older ground-based radar technology to allow air traffic controllers to more accurately locate aircraft and provide more accurate information to pilots.
No extra travel, no overhead trains stopping at Wembley, no cars and parking on the surface, and no facilities.
Fearing lack of transportation, the match was forced to be played behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the discovery of a new bird species in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that species evolved in just two generations, although this process was believed to have taken much longer due to the breeding between an endemic Darwin's spinous, Geospiza fortes, and the migrating cactus spinous, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be molded into any shape and shape, and it can be rolled into tiny shapes.
It can be twisted into a thin piece of wire that can be bent, or it can be bent or bound into a board.
It can be made so thin and glued to other metals, so thin that it's sometimes used in books to decorate hand-painted paintings called "fast".
It's called the pH of a chemical, and you can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical is.
The pH level is determined by the amount of Hydrogen (H) ions in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons with their electrons taken away from them, because hydrogen atoms are made up of one proton and one electron.
Mix two tablespoons of dry powder, then shape it into a ball with your clean, wet hands.
The moisture in your hands reacts with the outer layers, which gives you a fun feeling and creates a kind of shell on your hand.
Nearly every house in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a toilet with a drain connected to a sophisticated sewer system.
Remnants of a sewage system have been found in the homes of the towns of Minos, Crete, and Santorini, Greece.
In ancient Egypt, Iran, and China, toilets were sometimes part of baths where men and women were in mixed company.
When you're looking for someone who lives thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite as a vehicle.
A satellite in space picks up the call and reflects it back almost instantly.
Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere blocks some of our light and vision.
To put a satellite or a telescope into space, you need a huge rocket more than 30 meters tall.
The wheel changed the world in incredible ways, and the greatest thing it did for us was to make transportation much easier and faster.
He brought us the train, the car and many other means of transportation.
At the bottom of these are the more moderate cats, which eat prey of average sizes, from rabbits to antelopes to deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including domestic cats that are released) that eat many small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of a niche, a special business that each cat owns and prevents them from competing with others.
Lions are the most social cats, living in large groups called herds.
The lion herds consist of one to three adult male relatives, with a female and cub in the 30s.
Females are usually closely related to each other and are part of a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion herds behave very similarly to wolf or dog herds, which are animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not to other big cats) in behavior, and are also very lethal to their prey.
A versatile athlete, the tiger can climb (though not very well), swim, jump great distances, and pull with five times the force of a strong man.
Tigers are in the same group as lions, leopards, and jaguars (Genus Panthera).
The tiger's roar is not the exact sound of a lion's roar, but rather a phrase made up of more roaring, shouting words.
Ocelots love to eat small animals, monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can, and almost all the animals that Ocelot hunts have bodies that are much smaller than his own.
Scientists think that ocelots track and find other animals for food by sensing, smelling, and finding where they are on the ground.
With their night vision, they can see very well at night and are also extremely stealthy, integrating with their prey's environment to catch them.
A small group of organisms (a small population) will often find themselves in a different environment from their previous environment when they leave their native population (for example, if they follow a stream or river, or move to a new island where it will not be easy to return).
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to become a stronger competitor than they have previously needed.
The original population hasn't changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to their new environment, they begin to look more and more different from other populations.
Eventually, thousands or even millions of years from now, these two animals will appear too different to be the same species.
This process, which we call speciation, which means the creation of new species, is an inevitable outcome and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe and take in the carbon dioxide that humans expel.
Plants get their nutrients from the sun by photosynthesis, and they provide shade.
We make our homes out of plants, we make our clothes out of plants, we eat most of our food out of plants, and without plants, animals wouldn't survive.
The Mosazor was the top predator of his time, so he was afraid of nothing but other Mosazors.
Their long jaws, along with an extra set of teeth in the upper part of their mouth, were filled with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, meaning there was no escape for anything that crossed their path.
We don't know for sure, but maybe he had a fork tongue, and his diet included turtles, big fish, and other mosasaurs, and maybe he ate his own kind of creatures.
It also attacked anything that entered the water, not even a giant dinosaur like the T. rex.
While we are familiar with much of their food, the Romans took their share of strange or unusual feasting elements, such as wild boar, peacock, snail, and a type of rodent called the nut rat.
Another difference was that poor people and women liked to eat on chairs, while rich men liked to eat on the side while they were feasting.
Ancient Roman cuisine could not have included foods that came to Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman turkey had ever tasted.
The Babylonians had built a primary temple to each of their gods, considered the house of that god.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and priests tried to satisfy the gods' needs with ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple has an open temple courtyard and then an inner sanctuary, which is only accessible to priests.
Special pyramid-shaped towers, sometimes called ziggurats, were built as part of temples.
The top of the tower was a special temple to the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, home wasn't that important.
The Hebrew family spent much of their life outdoors.
Women cooked in the garden, the shops were just open stalls facing the street, and the stone was used to build the house.
The land of Canaan was not heavily forested, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland is sparsely settled. In Norse mythology, Erik the Red was driven from Iceland for murder and, while traveling west, found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But despite his discovery, the Eskimo tribes were already living there.
Although each country was 'Scandinavian,' Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland all had many differences in their peoples, kings, traditions, and histories.
If you've seen the movie National Treasury, you might think that the back of the Declaration of Independence is a treasure map.
But that's not true, because even though there's something written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
The Declaration of Independence was backed by the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4 July 1776".
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that early in life, the large parchment scroll (293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was wrapped around it for concealment.
So it's likely that the information is simply added as a label.
The Normandy Landings and subsequent wars liberated northern France but the south was still occupied.
Vichy was run by the French, who in 1940 made peace with the Germans and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, which was renamed Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces had liberated southern France and were heading for Germany.
Civilization is a single culture shared by a substantially larger group of people, a society, living and working together.
The word civilization comes from the Latin word civilis, meaning 'civil' and is also related to the Latin word civis, meaning 'citizen', and the Latin words civitas, meaning 'city' or 'city-state', and it also defines the size of society.
The city-states are the forerunners of nations. Civilized culture refers to the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a lasting cultural imprint and equitable distribution.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving historical evidence about themselves and are not considered true civilizations.
During the American War of Independence, the thirteen colonies first established a weak central government under the Confederate Constitution, and Congress was the sole component of that government.
Congress had no taxing authority, and with no national-level executive or judiciary, it relied on often uncooperative state officials to enforce all its acts.
Nor did he have the power to overturn tax laws and interstate tariffs.
The amendments required the unanimous consent of all the states, and the states so disregarded the central government that their representatives were often not in office.
Italy's national football team is the second most successful team in the world, along with the German national football team, and were FIFA World Cup champions in 2006.
Football, basketball, volleyball, slalom, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, ice hockey, and F1 motor racing are popular sports.
Winter sports are most popular in the Northern regions, and Italians compete in international games and Olympic events.
The Japanese have about 7,000 islands, the largest being Honshu, making Japan the seventh-largest island in the world!
Japan is often referred to as a "confederation" geographically because of the island group that it has.
Taiwan's turning point dates back to the 15th century, when European sailors recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company made a change in local grain production methods by building a plant in southwestern Taiwan and employing Chinese workers to work in the rice and sugar fields.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) forces took control of the western and northern coastal regions of Taiwan, and in 1885 declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which would rule the island until 1945.
Macchu Picchu consists of three main structures known as Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Many of the buildings around the facility have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of how they originally looked.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu was restored, and restoration is still ongoing today.
For example, the most common still image photography format in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It's still in production today, but more importantly, it takes its en-size ratio from the digital camera image sensor formats.
It's a bit confusing that the 35mm format is actually 36mm wide and 24mm long.
This format is said to have an aspect ratio of 3:2 (which is divisible by twelve to find the simplest integer ratio).
Many common formats (e.g. the APS family of formats) are equal to or very close to this en-size ratio.
The overused and often over-typed rule of three is a simple rule that creates dynamics in a photograph while maintaining size.
It states that the most effective area for the main subject is the point of convergence of the lines dividing the image into three longitudinally and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was brought under control.
For over a thousand years, Christianity had held together the nations of Europe despite differences in language and customs.
The all-pervading power affected everyone from the king to the common people.
One of the most important beliefs of Christianity is that wealth is used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and the church's capital is used specifically for this purpose.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and the concentration of power and money there had led many to question whether this principle was being followed.
Immediately after the war began, Britain imposed a naval blockade on Germany.
This siege was strategically effective, and prevented the transport of vital military and civilian supplies, despite violating international law, which has been recognized as general law in many international treaties over the past two centuries.
Britain threatened even neutral ships by laying mines in international waters to prevent any ships from entering the entire ocean.
As this tactic was given a limited response, Germany expected a response similar to the submarine warfare that was unleashed.
In the 1920s, the dominant attitude of most citizens and the nation was pacifism and isolationism.
Nations that witnessed the horrors and persecution of World War I wanted to avoid facing such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He came to the United States with 4 cents, a book of poetry and a letter of reference from Charles Batchelor (his former manager) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China followed a unique way of representing different time periods; each period or dynasty in China is a separate dynasty.
There was also a period of instability between each dynasty, with the most famous being the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, fierce battles took place among many nobles vying for the throne.
During one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, the Three Kingdoms Period, thousands of people died fighting for the highest office in the great palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political influences, such as the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people, not to a single ruler.
Again, after the Revolution, the professions were open to all male candidates, ensuring that the most ambitious and successful would win.
The same is true of the army because the army ranks are no longer based on the Cailaber.
The French Revolution inspired many oppressed working-class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond this ordinary life, and frequently visited a cave on Mount Nur (Light) later called Hira to immerse himself in thought.
The cave itself, which is from that time, offers a very clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclination.
Located on top of a mountain north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, even if it were known to exist, it's not easy to find, because it's a complete isolation inside the cave.
Except for the clear, beautiful skies above us and the surrounding mountains, very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid at Giza is just one of the seven wonders of the world that still stands today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of many great pyramids built to honor deceased pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau or "Necropolis of Giza" in Egypt's Valley of the Dead contains several pyramids (the great pyramid being the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and a large Sphinx.
The magnificent pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and much of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family heirs.
The upper bow sign appears as a V, and the "bottom bow sign" appears as a cube or a square with the bottom missing.
That means you start at the top and you push the bow, and you start at the bottom at the shaft and you pull the bow.
The upper bow generally produces a softer sound, while the lower bow is stronger and more definite.
Feel free to make your own markings with the pencil, but remember that the printed bow draw signs are there for a musical reason, so you usually have to follow them.
The horrified King Louis XVI, his two young children, Queen Marie Antoinette (11 years old Marie Therese and Louis-Charles 4 years old) and the King's sister Madame Elizabeth were forcibly driven from Versailles to Paris by a mob of women on 6 October 1789.
They returned to Paris in a car, surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and threatening the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to open the car windows.
At one point, one of the crowd shook the head of a royal guard who had been killed at Versailles in front of the frightened Queen.
The war expenses of US imperialism to conquer the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They had to pay taxes to the US colonial regime to cover a large part of the interest and expenditures on bonds held on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
Undoubtedly, the extra profits from the long exploitation of the Filipino people are among the major gains of US imperialism.
To understand the temple people, one must also understand the circumstances that led to the creation of the cult.
The period in which the events occurred is often referred to as the High Middle Ages, which is the time period of the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries in European history (1000-13000 CE).
The High Middle Ages came before the Early Middle Ages, and were followed by the Late Middle Ages around 1500, when the treaty ended.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a very broad range of ideas in practice, including views such as the technological drive or the inevitability of technology, which holds that the fate of people is determined by the unconscious by scientific laws and a logic associated with the application of these laws to technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path that largely transcends cultural or political influence, and that technology also has some "impacts" on societies that are intrinsic rather than socially conditioned.
For example, one might say that the motor car was necessarily the precursor to the development of roads.
However, having a nationwide highway infrastructure is not economically feasible if the number of vehicles is low, so new manufacturing methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning vehicles.
Mass car ownership also leads to more accidents on the road, leading to new techniques in the healthcare industry for repairing injured bodies.
Romanticism was characterized by a broad cultural determinism passed on by writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped people, and over time, traditions and culture developed that were more in line with the location of society and better than arbitrary laws.
Just as Paris was seen as the fashion capital of the modern world, so was Constantinople as the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Around 400 C.E., it gained a reputation as a center of luxury, which it maintained until about 1100 C.E.
The status of the Crusaders declined in the twelfth century as they returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were valued more than what the Byzantine markets offered.
The title of fashion capital has shifted from Constantinople to Paris in these years.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and in the 14th century.
Initially, clothing was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, because of the slow pace of communication, Western styles could be traced back 25 to 30 years.
By the late Middle Ages, Western Europe was starting to develop its own style, and with the end of the Crusades, one of the greatest advances of the period was the use of buttons to pinch people's clothes.
Subsistence farming is farming that is done solely to produce enough food to meet the needs of the individual engaged in farming and his or her family.
Sustainable agriculture is a simple and mostly organic system using seeds and crop rotation or other relatively simple methods that are conserved specific to the ecological zone to achieve maximum yield.
Historically, most farmers were subsistence farmers, and this is true today in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel excluded by social standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be distinctive because of the age, ethnic origin, class, location and/or gender of members.
The attributes that distinguish a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of various factors.
Members of a subculture express themselves as part of that culture often using a distinctive and symbolic style that incorporates fashion, attitude, and slang.
One of the most common ways to show the importance of socialization is to point out a few unfortunate cases of children being socialized by adults through neglect, unwittingly, or deliberately abusing them.
Some wild children were confined to enclosed spaces by humans (mostly their own parents), in some cases because the parents rejected a child's severe mental or physical disability.
Wild children may have been subjected to severe child abuse or trauma before being abandoned or escaped.
Others are said to have been raised by animals, some are said to have lived in the wild on their own.
When raised entirely by animals, a feral child displays almost entirely self-rearing behavior (to the extent that physical limits allow), such as fear of humans or insensitivity to humans.
Project-based learning takes the instructional support a step further, making learning easy and engaging.
Guidance support is not a learning method, but rather a support to individuals who are experiencing a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Routing support can be both virtual and real, in other words a teacher is a router, but so is the little attaché guy in Microsoft Office.
Virtual Scaffolds are embedded in the software and are designed to question, guide and explain procedures that can be challenging for the student to handle alone.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, from neglect to abuse to even robbery.
No child should grow up in a place that is not protective, compassionate and educational, but unfortunately, that's not the case.
We see the Protective Family System as a safe zone for these kids.
We expect our foster family system to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
Child Welfare is obliged to meet all the needs that were not present in the home they were previously taken in.
The Internet brings together elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive features of the Internet add dimensions to the approach to use and satisfaction.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are recommended as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
When investigating audience reactions to internet sites, "personal participation" and "transmitted relationships" were also identified by Eighmey and McCord (1998) as new incentives.
Using video images has led to important discoveries in interpreting facial movements that last for several milliseconds.
It is suggested that the correct interpretation of micro-expressions in particular can help to determine whether a person is lying.
In his article entitled The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks noted that people who have trouble correctly perceiving speech because of brain damage can correctly assess intimacy despite this problem.
He even claims that animals, such as dogs, may have the same ability to interpret human behavior.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two different pools of genetic variation: the hidden and the extroverted.
Change creates new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
In each generation, the separation and re-merger between the two pools will mix up the variation back and forth.
In the savannah, a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans would be hard pressed to meet its amino acid requirements with existing plant sources.
Moreover, failure to do so has serious consequences, such as growth depression, malnutrition, and, eventually, death.
The easiest plant sources to access would be proteins from leaves and legumes, but it's unlikely that plants could be digested by primates like us without being cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible but also provide high amounts of protein, which contains all the important amino acids.
All things considered, it should come as no surprise that our ancestors solved the protein problem in a similar way to the chimpanzees in the wild today.
Sleep interruption is the process of waking up consciously during normal sleep and falling back to sleep shortly afterwards (up to 60-minutes).
This can easily be done by using a relatively quieter alarm clock to just clear your consciousness without waking you completely from your sleep.
If you find yourself resetting the alarm in your sleep, the clock can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn off the alarm.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking a lot of fluids (especially water or tea, a known deodorant) before bedtime and forcing someone to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely related to the amount of tension in his body and spirit.
The less tension, the more positive the current life force, and every person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Enlightenment is available to all, and the only thing that stands in the way of that goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is a teaching based on the teachings of Buddha, but expanded upon by the Mahayana path of love and many techniques derived from Indian Yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, it consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and an all-embracing path of love.
Kundalini Yoga is the practice of awakening the Kundalini energy through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is God Yoga, where the visualization of various gods clears the energy channels, activates the chakras, and creates enlightened consciousness.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the United States.
Two years after the war ended, the former allies were now enemies, and the Cold War began.
It would be fought by proxy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places for the next 40 years.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defences were already broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
But these plans were virtually overnight thwarted when the Soviet Union invaded the eastern regions of Poland and opened up the fronts of Belarus and Ukraine, with more than 800,000 troops of the Red Army, in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Nonaggression Pact, and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to transport large quantities of people and goods over the oceans.
The Navy's mission has traditionally been to protect your country's ability to transport your people and your goods, while also preventing the enemy's ability to transport their people and their goods.
One of the most notable modern examples of this was the North Atlantic front of World War II, where the Americans tried to transport troops and equipment across the Atlantic to bring aid to Britain.
Meanwhile, the German Navy, which used U-boats in its heavy role, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would have probably taken England, as well as the rest of Europe.
It is estimated that goats were first domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran about 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and tribes began feeding them milk, wool, meat and mail for easy access.
Domesticated goats were usually kept in herds that roamed the hills or other pasture areas, often by child or adolescent goat herders, similar to the more commonly known shepherds.
Wagon roads were not built in England until the 16th century.
Although the wagon tracks consisted of only parallel wooden beams, the horses pulling them allowed them to reach higher speeds and to pull larger loads than the slightly more rugged tracks of the day.
Travers were used to hold tracks in place at an early date, but it was discovered that they could be more efficient with an iron strip on top of the tracks.
This became common practice, but caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the iron wagons.
As a result, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first railways made entirely of iron were put into operation.
The first known mode of transport was walking, and humans began walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus, which means upright man.
The previous generation of Australopithecus could not normally walk on two legs.
The earliest known use of two legs is in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start to live more environmentally consciously, we can join environmental movements, we can even become activists to reduce the problems of the future a little bit.
In most cases, it's like symptomatic treatment, but if we don't want a temporary solution, then we need to find the root of the problem and neutralize it.
It is abundantly clear that the world has changed dramatically because of man's scientific and technological advances, and that the problems are being exacerbated by overpopulation and the wasteful way of life of mankind.
After its adoption in Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congressman John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to John Dunlap's print shop a few blocks away.
Now known as "Dunlap broadsides", the notices were produced in 150 to 200 copies overnight.
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon on July 8 in the garden of Independence Hall.
One of these documents was sent to George Washington on July 6 to read to his troops in New York on July 9, and a copy arrived in London on August 10.
The earliest known copies of the document are the 25 Dunlap pamphlets, which are still in existence.
Today, most paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are alive today, which we call birds.
Most people don't think of them as dinosaurs, because they have feathers and they can fly.
But there's still a lot about birds that looks like dinosaurs.
They have polled feet and claws, they lay eggs and they walk on their hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on the misuse of information encoded in binary form.
A binary number can have only one of the values 0 and 1. These are called bits in the field of information technology.
Internal intoxication may not appear immediately, and symptoms such as vomiting are too common to be diagnosed immediately.
The most prominent sign of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open medicine container or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for the poison in question.
The term insect is used officially by entomologists for this species of insect.
The term is derived from its ancient similarity to the woodpecker, which has adapted to parasitic relationships with humans.
Both Killer Insects and their woodpeckers are native plants that have adapted to living in their nests or homes.
There are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) in the United States, which means that the most common neurological disease in younger and middle-aged adults is multiple sclerosis (MS).
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Studies have shown that women are twice as likely to get MS as men.
Couples may decide that having children is not in their best interests or in the best interests of the child.
These couples may choose to make an adoption plan for their baby.
At the time of adoption, the parents terminate parental rights so that the child's family can become another couple.
The basic purpose of science is to discover how the world works by the scientific method, which actually guides most scientific research.
But experiments are not alone. An experiment is a test used to test one or more possible hypotheses, to ask questions, and to observe guides scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, especially the Latin Bible.
He accepted Aristotle's views on all scientific subjects, including the science of the soul.
As Greek science declined, the West broke away from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many of the rhythms observed in physiology and movement are largely dependent on the existence of significant internal cycles and the production of these cycles through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms that do not respond to external periodic cues alone have been documented in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that continue a period of free rotation even in the absence of signals from the outside.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the leading proposals that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages and viruses to implant their DNA into a bacterium.
They did two experiments, either tagging the DNA in a radioactive phosphorus phage or in a radioactive sulfur portein phage.
Mutations can have many different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the piece of genetic material affected, and whether or not the affected cells are germline cells.
While mutations in germline cells alone can affect children, mutations in other areas can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery, including plant and animal wildlife.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching and visits to parks and studying information about ecosystems.
Another example is visiting, photographing, and learning about the orangutans of Borneo.
Every morning, people leave their small rural towns in their cars to go to work, passing other employees who are on their way to work.
In these dynamic, interconnected journeys, everyone is connected to, and supports, a transportation system based on private cars.
Science shows that this massive carbon economy is disrupting the stable state of the biosphere that has supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone is part of the community and they use the transportation system.
In developed countries, you rarely hear complaints of this level, like water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transportation systems get so many complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transportation engineers inefficient? Or is there a more fundamental problem?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interactions with each other.
Unfortunately, traffic flow is difficult to study because driver behavior can't be predicted with 100% accuracy.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave at a reasonably steady interval, so traffic flows tend to have an acceptable consistency and can be roughly mathematically described.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships between three main characteristics are identified: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help with the planning, design and operation of roadway facilities.
The first animals to fly were insects, whose flight abilities helped them escape enemies more easily, finding food and mates more easily with less effort.
Most insects have the advantage of folding their wings backward across their body.
This gives them a wider and smaller range of space to hide from predators.
Today, the only insect species that cannot fold their wings backward are the sunflowers and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many people believed that the solar system, including the sun (and even other stars), revolved around the earth.
That makes sense, because it doesn't feel like the Earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth, carrying more than eight times the amount of water of the second largest river.
The Amazon, at six miles wide, is also the widest river on earth.
Exactly 20 percent of the water that flows from the rivers of the planet into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River's main tributary is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long, draining thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the stone pyramid was built until the end of the Old Kingdom, it never surpassed the Giza pyramids in terms of size and technical perfection of their structure.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom looked with wonder at the monuments left by their predecessors, which were more than a thousand years old at the time.
The Vatican has a population of about 800, making it the smallest independent country in the world and the least populous.
The Vatican uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is the daily language spoken by most of the people employed in the province, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All the citizens of Vatican City are Catholic.
Since they can be discovered in nature in their original state and can be extracted relatively easily with primitive means, people have known about the basic chemical elements of gold, silver, and copper since the earliest times.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
It's more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, but he also theorized that they evolved into new forms of matter that we see.
Alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals, and of course, there are metals like silver and gold.
There are also alloys containing small amounts of metals, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, each of which is made of tiny particles called atoms.
The atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit into the dot at the end of this sentence.
In short, the pencil was a good friend to many people when it first came out.
Unfortunately, as new writing methods emerged, the range and frequency of pencil use declined.
People are now writing messages from computer screens without ever having to get close to a stylus.
Who knows what will happen to the keyboard when something new comes out?
A fission bomb works by taking energy to put together an atomic nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
This process is like taking a wheelchair up a hill, reusing the core and then releasing some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning they can be broken down with little or no intervention.
The surface of the moon is made of rock and dust, and the outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
It's thinner under Maria, thicker in the mountains.
The shell is thinner, so there could be more maria on the side, so it was easier for lava to get to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding things that trigger or attract people.
These theses reveal that individuals have certain internalized needs and/or desires as they mature into adulthood.
These theories are concerned with what causes some people to desire what they do and what causes the things around them to do certain things to them.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's Theory of the Hierarchy of Needs and Hertzberg's Theory of Two Factors.
In general, there are two behaviors that can occur when managers start referring and managing their former colleagues.
They have difficulty making decisions that the majority dislikes, disciplining, evaluating performance, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, the individual becomes an unrecognizable individual who changes everything the team does and thinks he should do it himself.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behavior often causes conflict between the leader and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often act as a consultant for their close physical group.
Because they can meet at varying timescales that may not be understood by local governments, virtual teams often have more autonomy than traditional team members.
The existence of a real invisible team (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p.109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The invisible team is the management team, where each member reports, and the invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of building a learning organization? One goal of implementing organizational learning concepts is development.
Creativity and mastery can emerge when all possible resources are effectively used in the functional departments of an organization.
As a result, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can pioneer a new innovative process that will serve the needs of customers.
For an organization to be innovative, leadership must not only encourage knowledge sharing and in-company training, but also create a culture of innovation.
Melek (2006) explains the Continuity approach, a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition, and therefore narrows the field of study and makes it much more precise.
The link between brain pathology and behavior is supporting scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, trauma, lesions and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
New technologies are also allowing us to see and study brain structures and processes that have never been seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material support to design simulation models that help us figure out how our minds work.
Although AI has a strong connection to science fiction, AI is a very important branch of computer science that deals with behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
Artificial intelligence research involves developing robots that will automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and programming, responding to client diagnoses and questions; handwriting, voice and facial recognition skills.
Each of these skills has become a separate discipline focused on solving real-life problems.
AI systems are now commonly used in economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as well as in home computers and video game software.
School trips are an important part of all classes, and teachers often love to take their students to places where bus travel is not possible.
Technology offers a solution by offering a virtual tour, where students can explore the structures in a museum, visit an aquarium, or be enchanted by beautiful works of art while sitting in class.
Sharing a school trip in a virtual environment is a great way to share thoughts and experiences about the trip with other classes.
For example, students at the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their annual trips to the State Capitol, the website is re-edited every year, but the older versions are kept online for use as a notebook.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing, as students often start their blogging experiences with careless grammar and spelling mistakes, while the presence of a reader audience often changes this.
Since the most critical audience is usually students, bloggers try to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging "forces students to be more aware of the world around them". The need to nurture the interest of followers inspires students to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that opens the door to collaboration and encourages students to take learning far beyond the traditional school curriculum.
Appropriate use of blogs "can make students more analytical and critical; students can actively react to internet materials to determine their position in the context of others' writings and their own point of view on certain issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa, Canada's fascinating bilingual capital, is home to many art galleries and museums that offer a glimpse into Canada's past and present.
Further south lies Niagara Falls, and it is home to the untouched natural beauty of northern Muskoka and beyond.
All of this and more underscores the fact that Ontario is labeled by foreigners as a self-contained Canadian.
The vast areas to the north are sparsely populated and some are made up of almost deserted wilderness.
For a demographic comparison that surprises most people: there are more African Americans in the United States than there are Canadians.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean, off the coast of eastern Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest of the islands, and it is a continent in its own right when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or dependencies of France and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to these lands, and it became very widespread in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century with the discovery of the Cape Route from Europe to India by the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama.
The region is bordered on the north by the Sahel, on the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that every female traveler, regardless of actual civic status, state that she is married.
You might also find it helpful to wear a ring (not one that looks too expensive).
Women need to realize that cultural differences can result in what they would label as harassment, and that it's not uncommon for them to be followed, held in their arms, etc.
Be firm when rejecting boys, and do not be afraid to express your disapproval (whether cultural differences exist or not does not mean that it is the right thing to do!).
The foundations of the modern city of Casablanca were laid by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and it was also used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merenids, under the name of Anfa.
The Portuguese demolished it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, but abandoned it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya, and it was later named Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established trading posts in the city.
If you want to shop in Morocco, Casablanca is one of the least interesting places.
Around the old Medina, it's easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan products like crowns, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and various other crap, but these are always for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the easternmost part of the Democratic Republic of Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which covered most of the city's streets, especially the city center.
Even if Goma is reasonably safe, all visits from outside Goma should be investigated to understand the situation of the ongoing conflict in the North Kivu region.
With some of the cheapest mountain trail in Africa, the city is also a base for those who want to climb Nyiragongo volcano.
To get around Goma, you can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi).
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has come to be used as a metaphor for exotic, faraway lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, although it is famous for its tourist attractions and its airport.
In 1990 it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger due to the threat of desert sands.
Henry Louis Gates was one of the most important stops during the PBS special "Wonders of the African World".
The city is in stark contrast to other cities in the country, with Arab air being darker than in Africa.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa and stretches along the border of Mozambique in the east, Zimbabwe in the north, and the southern border is formed by the Crocodile River.
The park covers an area of 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecoregions, each supporting a different wildlife.
As well as being one of South Africa's most popular attractions, it is also seen as the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African National Parks, there are daily maintenance fees and entrance fees for the park.
It may be useful to purchase a Wild Card, which gives access to various parks in South Africa or to all of South Africa's National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the Hong Kong area and is the place that many visitors consider to be the main focal point.
The buildings that make up the skyline of Hong Kong are likened to a glittering column of graphite that rises even higher in the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the opposite shore of Kowloon.
Much of Hong Kong Island's urban development has been acquired from heavily reclaimed land along its northern coast.
This is where the British colonists took it for themselves, and so if you're looking for evidence of the area's colonial history, this is a good place to start.
Stretching for some 50 miles [80 km] from the coast to the interior of Bangladesh and India, Sundarban is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world.
Sundarban is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The remaining part of the forest within the Indian borders is called Sundarban National Park.
But forests are not just mangrove swamps - they also contain the last remnants of the vast forests that once covered the Ganges Valley.
Sundarban covers an area of 3,850 km2 of which about one third is wetland.
The Sundarbans has been a wildlife conservation area since 1966 and is currently thought to have 400 Royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses depart from the Inter-District Bus Stop (across the river) during the day, but mostly, especially those going east and Jakar/Bumthang depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
It is recommended to buy tickets several days in advance, since inter-regional buses are often crowded.
Most neighborhoods are served by small Japanese vans, which are comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxis are a quick and comfortable means of getting to nearby places such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that connects the city of Oiapoque in Brazil to the town of Siant-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guinea.
The two towers are 83 metres high. There are two stripes 378 metres long and 3.50 metres wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group in the land now known as Eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also engaged in subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to the Guaycurú, Payaguá, and other indigenous tribes, who made their living by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Formerly called the "Giant Territory of the Indians", Paraguay was formed in the 16th century as a result of Spanish conquerors' encounters with indigenous communities.
The Spanish began a three-century colonial period.
Paraguay has largely managed to preserve its indigenous identity and character since the founding of Asunción in 1537.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best polo teams in the world and the best players.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in December at the polo grounds in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For news on where to buy tickets to tournaments and polo matches, see Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland pound sterling (FKP), which is pegged to the British pound sterling (GBP).
You know, the only bank in the islands, in Stanley, across from the FIC West store, is the foreign exchange.
British pounds are generally used throughout the islands, and Stanley credit cards and U.S. dollars are also commonly accepted.
Credit cards will probably not be accepted on remote islands, but sterling and US dollars may be used.
It's almost impossible to change the Falkland Islands pound outside the islands, so change your currency before you leave here.
Montevideo is south of the equator, so it's winter in the northern hemisphere, and summer in the northern hemisphere, and winter in the northern hemisphere.
Montevideo is in the subtropical climate zone, with temperatures above 30°C in the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively cold, with temperatures rarely below freezing, but wind and moisture combine to make you feel colder than the thermometer would indicate.
They have no distinct seasons that can be defined as rainy and "dry" seasons.
Although most of the animals in the park are familiar to humans, wildlife is still wild and animals should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park officials, you must stay at least 100 yards per meter from bears and wolves and 25 yards per meter from all other wild animals!
Bison, moose, deer, bears, and almost all large animals can attack them, no matter how tame they seem.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don't keep proper distances, and these animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so know their territory.
Also, remember that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid keeping or cooking smelly food and make a clean camp.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on the island of Upolu, and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889, seven ships from Germany, the United States, and England refused to leave the port, giving it its unfortunate reputation.
All but one British cruiser sank, with the loss of about 200 American and German lives.
A peaceful meeting in the town, organized by the Mau movement, resulted in the assassination of the Supreme Chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Because Auckland is between the two ports, there are many beaches, the most popular being in the three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour area) are in the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all are sandy beaches that are safe to swim on, and many are shaded by pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located between the Waitemata Harbour, the luxury suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These are family beaches, with a variety of shops lining the shore, sometimes crowded.
The main local beer is 'Number One' which is not very sophisticated but is nice and refreshing and the other local beer is called "Manta".
Although there's plenty of French wine to drink, New Zealand and Australian wines might do better.
It's perfectly safe to drink local tap water, but if you're afraid of it, it's easy to find bottled water.
The idea of 'flat white' coffee is foreign to Australians. It is a short black 'espresso', cappuccino comes as a high cream (not crunchy) toppings and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is Belgian standard, the juices are expensive but delicious.
The reef is frequented throughout the year, and for these reasons, injuries are rare.
However, consult the authorities, follow all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Boxfish appear near the shores and near river beds in the north from October to April 1770, and can sometimes be seen outside of these times.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans, and most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live permanently in the ocean, their primary habitat being the riverbanks north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance helps travelers feel comfortable knowing that they have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agencies usually have agreements with certain hotels, but you can also opt for other forms of accommodation, such as camping sites, through a travel agency.
Travel agencies often offer packages that include breakfast, airport/airport transport arrangements, and even combined flight and hotel packages.
If you need time to think about the offer or to obtain other documents (such as a visa) for your destination, they can hold your reservation for you.
Any changes or requests should be communicated to the travel agent first, not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of music festival attendees decide to camp out on the festival grounds, and most attendees see this as an important part of the experience.
If you wish to be close to the action, you should go ahead to catch a campground close to the music.
Even if the music has ended on the main stages, there may be parts of the festival that continue to play music into the late hours of the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you're passing through the North Baltic in winter, make sure you know the location of the cabin, because crossing through the ice makes a terrible noise for the sensitive.
Saint Petersburg cruises include time spent in the city, and tourist cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check conditions).
Casinos often spend a lot of time and money to maximize the time and money spent by guests. Often there are no windows and clocks, so it may not be easy to find exits.
To keep guests in good spirits and to please them, there are often specially prepared food, drink, and entertainment.
Some places may offer alcoholic beverages, but being drunk negatively affects your judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone who will drive at high latitudes or on mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or frost.
The friction on icy and snowy roads is very low, and it is impossible to drive on dry asphalt.
Snow may fall in a short time, enough to keep you stuck in a snowstorm.
Vision may also be restricted by snowfall, type, concentration in vehicle windows, or frostbite.
On the other hand, icy and snowy weather is common in many countries, and traffic usually flows uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safari is perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the most prominent point of interest for many visitors.
The term safari is often used to refer to trips made to observe the spectacular African wildlife, especially those that live in savannas.
Some animals, like elephants and giraffes, tend to get closer to cars, so standard equipment provides good visibility.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy, and you'll see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "nature walk", "nature walking safari", or "stand-up") is a walk of several hours or several days.
The Paralympics will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021, with some events taking place at other locations across Japan.
Tokyo, which hosted the 1964 Games, will be the only Asian city to host the Summer Olympics twice.
If you've booked your flight and accommodation for 2020 before the delay announcement, you may be in for a tough time.
Cancellation policies are subject to change, but as of late March, most coronavirus cancellation policies will not extend until July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled to take place.
The vast majority of event tickets are expected to be priced between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with average prices around ¥7,000.
Most hotels have a iron and a iron table that can be borrowed even if they are not in the room.
If you don't have any ironing or don't like wearing ironing socks, you can try using a hair dryer if available.
Do not let the fabric overheat (this may cause it to pull or even burn in extreme cases).
There are different ways to purify water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is enough, while in others, it takes a few minutes to boil.
The effectiveness of filters is different, so if you're concerned about this, you should consider buying your water in a bottle of a well-known brand.
Travelers may encounter insects unfamiliar to them in their own region.
Insects can spoil food, cause irritation, or worse, cause allergic reactions, poisoning, or infection.
Dangerous animals that can injure or kill humans by themselves or by force are usually not affected by insects.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to buy goods that are exempt from taxes in certain places.
Travelers to heavily taxed countries can sometimes save significantly, especially on alcoholic beverages and tobacco products.
The land between Point Marlon and Fairmont offers the most challenging driving conditions of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, which often runs through secluded, backwater areas.
If you're not familiar with driving in rural areas, watch out for steep slopes, narrow lanes, and steep turns.
The published speed limits are noticeably lower than the previous and subsequent sections  generally 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h)  and a strict adherence to them is more important than the reverse.
Strangely, the cell phone signals here are stronger than in other parts of the route, like the Pennyslvania Wilds.
German pastry is quite good, and in Bavaria, as in its southern neighbor Austria, it is as rich and varied.
Fruit pastry is common with apples cooked into pastry throughout the year and cherries and pears that appear in the summer.
Many German pastry works also include almonds, nuts and other tree fruits. The highly sought-after cakes generally form a particularly good pair with a cup of unsweetened plain coffee.
If you want small but rich pastry shops, try what's called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen, depending on where you are.
Curry is a dish that includes dried herbs and spices in addition to meat or vegetables.
Curry can be called "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid it contains.
In the interior of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is mostly used in the cows, while in southern India and some other coastal parts of the subcontinent, coconut milk is widely used.
When referring to Indonesia, which has 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a general term that encompasses various regional cuisines found throughout the country.
However, when used without another descriptor, the term is used for foods from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
The cuisine of Cava, which is now common in the archipelago, is characterized by a number of basic, highly flavoured dishes.
The reins are supports for the legs of the rider, which hang on either side of the saddle.
They provide more stability for the rider, but there may be safety issues with the possibility of the rider's foot getting stuck in them.
If a rider gets stuck in a ditch while falling from a horse and the horse escapes, some safety measures can be taken to minimize the risk.
First of all, most riders wear very narrow-bottomed riding boots with heels and smooth ones.
Some ponies, especially British ponies, have safety bars that allow the fallen rider to retract and the fallen skin to fall off the horse.
Chile's premier climbing destination, the Cochamó Valley, is known as the Yosemite of South America for its high granite walls and steep cliffs.
The climbs include spectacular peaks, and climbers from all over the world are constantly finding new routes amid endless climbing opportunities.
Climbing, such as skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve skating or snowboarding down snow-covered terrain with skis attached to your feet.
Skiing is also called "ski muppets" and is an important travel activity for many enthusiasts who plan all their holidays to ski at a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old. Cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back at least to the 17th century, and in 1861 the first sport-oriented ski club was opened in Australia by the Norwegians.
Backpacking: This activity is also called skiing, ski tour, or skiing in rural areas.
It is similar, but usually slightly different from alpine skiing or mountaineering, which is practiced on steep terrain and requires much harder skis and boats.
Think of a ski run as a walking route.
If the conditions are good, you can cover much more distance than you can walk, but you can rarely reach cross-country speed without well-maintained tracks and a heavy backpack.
Europe is a relatively small continent but home to many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, travelling to multiple countries means going through many visa applications and passport checks.
The Schengen area, in this sense, operates more or less as one country.
As long as you stay in this area, you can usually cross the border without going through the passport checkpoints again.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, you do not have to apply for a visa separately to each Schengen member state, saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no comprehensive definition of which manufactured objects are antiques.
The definition of antiquity varies by geography, as the age limit may be shorter in regions such as North America than in Europe.
