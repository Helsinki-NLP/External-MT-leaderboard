This does not prove that some dinosaurs still had feathers, a theory popularized in the past, but it gives a broad interpretation of fossils in general, such as color and triangular structure.
The researchers say the animal's plumage was a chestnut-white coat with a spotted or carotenoid-colored underside.
They get help by working on the creation of bird feathers.
Because dinosaur feathers did not have a fully developed shaft called a rachis, but had other types of feathers - barbs and barbules - researchers say that the rachis was likely to have developed later in evolution than the others.
The shape of the feathers means that they are not flat but rather provide warmth and comfort. Researchers suggest that, although the feathers of dinosaurs, they probably represent the feathers of a large bird rather than a small bird.
Researchers have concluded that despite the dinosaur's footprint, the fossil remains are the remains of birds and not of insects.

For example, one might say that a race car is required to make a road crossing.
However, the interstate highway system is not economically viable for many cars, so measures are being taken to reduce the cost of owning a public car.
The increasing number of people with cars is causing an increase in road accidents, which is leading to the development of new medical techniques to treat the injured.

Moreover, failure to do so has serious consequences: disgust, frustration, and premature death.
The plant-derived products that would be more readily available would be the nutrients found in leaves and seeds, but these are difficult for us to eat as humans leave them in the oven.
In comparison, animal food (eggs, flies, eggs) is characterized by its slowness to digest, its high nutrient content and its high acidity.
