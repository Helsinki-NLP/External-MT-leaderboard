28-year-old chef found dead in a San Francisco mall
A 28-year-old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stairwell of a local shopping mall.
The victim's brother testified that he can't think of anyone who would want to hurt him, "He's finally coming around".
The body found Wednesday morning at the Westfield Mall has been identified as 28-year-old Frank Galicia of San Francisco, according to the San Francisco Coroner's Office.
The San Francisco Police Department said the death was ruled a homicide and an investigation is underway.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told ABS station KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who used to work as a chef in Boston, had landed his dream job as a chef at Sons & Daughters restaurant in San Francisco six months ago.
A spokesman for Sons & Daughters said they were "shocked and devastated" by his death.
"We are a small team working as a close family and we will miss him dearly", the spokesman said.
Our thoughts and condolences are with Frank's family and friends at this difficult time.
Louis Galicia stated that Frank initially lived in hostels, but that, "things finally went downhill for him".
"He found an apartment, he had a girlfriend", Louis Garcia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said he couldn't think of anyone who would want to hurt his younger brother.
He was a kind man with a big heart.
His way of connecting with his family was to always cook for us, to make us dinner", said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to be part of any kind of argument.
He was the brother who swam with the current.
"Of all the things that went wrong in the world, he was this diamond that shone bright every day", he said.
Anyone with information on the case is asked to call the SFPD hotline at 415-575-4444.
Jennifer Aniston: I'm always being put in boxes.
Jennifer Aniston doesn't always have to be perfect or successful.
The Hollywood star made that clear in an interview.
"I'm always put in boxes or got labels from outside that have little to do with me and reality".
"I myself have no desire to be perfect and successful all the time".
"Honestly, I'm kind of into that stuff".
Jennifer Aniston, 47, can only laugh at being considered "Miss Perfect", as she explains in the current "Cosmopolitan".
The actress prefers to spend her time at home, watching TV, eating soft-dust and Mexican food, the magazine says.
She raises the question of childbearing: "We women don't have to be married or have children to be perfect", says the Hollywood star.
In her new film, Mother's Day, Aniston is a single mother of two sons.
The film will be shown on August 25th.
Longer wins the gold medal
His experience on the horse is manageable.
At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer and some colleagues were looking for a change by going for a ride on the beach.
It was a first for the 58-year-old.
CHIO: "golden sports pyramid" for Bernhard Langer, who has been a member of the
After a few minutes, the horses remembered their evening off, and they ran home at full gallop to the feeding troughs.
A mile at this rate, I was scared.
"It was not a good experience", says Langer.
And that was the end of my riding career.
On Saturday, Germany's all-time leading golfer - 101 tournament wins - was once again close to horses.
He and his family were shown around the ALRV plant, and he didn't even swing on a horse for photography.
Langer was in Aachen for the first time and thus also at the CHIO.
The reason was quite convincing.
The German sports aid awarded the man from Anhausen the Golden Sports Pyramid at a small gala.
The sympathetic athlete is not short of awards.
Cross of Merit, Silver Laurel Leaf, Champions Tour player of the year...
Even the Queen of England has ennobled him.
Langer is the 18th prize winner in the sports pyramid.
In Aachen he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday.
"This award means a lot to me", says Langer, "because it is not only for sporting achievements but also for social commitment".
For decades, Langer has been promoting the young.
And he also handed over the prize money of 25,000 euros.
With 15 other outstanding athletes, the two-time US champion was inducted into the Hall of Fame of German Sports on Saturday.
Among the laureates are the athlete Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the athlete Eberhard Gienger, the fighter Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the rower Peter-Michael Kolbe, the bobsledder Meinhard Nehmer, the judoka Frank Wieneke, the jumper Alwin Schockemöhle and posthumously the handball player Erhard Wunderlich.
Many of these sports legends had come to Aachen on Saturday.
After the official part, the illustrious company moved to the Spring Stadium, where the Lavazza Award was held.
Bernhard Langer kept his distance from the big animals.
Clinton and Trump's economic policies compared: It's all about the money
Invest in infrastructure and prevent the TPP trade deal - that's what both Clinton and Trump want.
The two US presidential candidates, however, are at odds over tax and energy policy and a matter of principle.
The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are based on a fundamental, rather philosophical difference.
The one about the role of the state.
Trump wants to keep the doubts small and warns of how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations.
Clinton wants to tax and regulate the economy to death, he says.
He, on the other hand, would be quite different, Trump claims.
He will drastically reduce regulations and he is pushing for far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and for businesses.
Clinton, on the other hand, says that the state has certain tasks to perform, it has opportunities for the disadvantaged and it needs money to do that.
That's why taxes would be raised for the rich, she says.
Interestingly, both are very close on the infrastructure front.
The Commission has been asked to take a decision on the proposal for a directive on the protection of the environment.
The Democratic candidate is announcing the largest investment in new jobs since World War II.
Government investment programmes in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strongly opposed by the Republican Tea Party, for example.
So Trump could be the subject of some internal party debate.
The differences in energy and climate policies are more pronounced.
Trump wants to build coal plants and increase coal production in the United States.
The Commission is also proposing to increase the number of EU-funded projects in the field of energy.
Clinton, on the other hand, has a clear investment agenda to expand renewable energy, saying: "One country will become the clean energy superpower and create millions of jobs".
"It's either China or Germany or America - I want it to be us".
But not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far apart.
The TPP, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, neither of them wants to sign.
At the same time, they both want to protect American jobs, not isolate the United States from international trade.
The Commission is also proposing to increase the number of jobs in the Community.
The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a famine wage.
She wants to raise it to $15 an hour.
What Trump wants to do in this matter is not entirely clear: once he says: the minimum wage must go up, then he says it must not be changed.
But the big debate in the coming months is likely to be more about tax policy on both sides.
On one side is Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth.
His critics accuse him of only making the budget deficit bigger.
On the other side is Clinton, who wants to at least demand that the rich pay more taxes, and whose critics say more taxes are not the answer.
Flight: "Every female refugee has experienced sexual violence"
Sexual violence is almost a part of everyday life for women who run away alone.
When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized.
A house is a place of refuge.
There are four women in a large kitchen.
Each one has a baby with them, one year old at the most.
One put her little boy in her arms.
He looks in the room with wide eyes.
His mother stares at the tabletop.
Until she realizes she's being watched.
She smiles briefly and kisses the little one.
The scene seems normal.
Until you speak to Katrin Bahr.
She is a regional manager at Condrobs, a social assistance agency in Bavaria, and she works on the issue of women on the run.
The four women in the kitchen are refugees.
They live in the north of Munich in one of the few decentralized shelters for single women and their children in Bavaria.
In January Condrobs opened the facility together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women's Aid.
It was recently officially opened.
There are 60 people living there - about 40 women and 20 children.
There are no men, not even as visitors.
The exception is a guard at the door.
"It is no exaggeration to say that every woman who arrives here has experienced sexual violence on the run", says Bahr.
"Men flee wars because of political persecution, because of threats of torture or death, or because their families send them to Europe as hope", she says.
For women, other reasons outweigh the escape: "Many sneak away because they see no other way out".
In their home countries, they have experienced sexual violence, forced prostitution, honor killings, slavery, and forced prostitution.
That's what drives her.
It's not over until you run.
"It is not uncommon for traffickers to demand a sexual act for a bottle of water, for example", says Bahr.
And the women are alone, they're not protected by their families.
If you think that the end will be crazy when they arrive in Germany, Bahr says.
Here again, single women in refugee shelters are often treated as inferior and, in the worst cases, abused.
As a result, she estimates that about 90 percent of the women living in the shelter in the north of Munich are traumatized.
"Some of the children were probably not born voluntarily".
Many women are so used to not saying anything.
"Or they don't dare to talk about what they've experienced openly because they're too ashamed".
Since they often cannot help themselves, more accommodation is needed for them alone, Bahr says.
In Bavaria, the seven county governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees.
When asked if they knew of a similar project in their area of responsibility, some answered no.
In the Upper Palatinate and Upper Franconia, for example, there is no such thing in government residences.
In Swabia, too, single women refugees are not housed separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, a government spokesman.
In Upper Bavaria, Lower and Middle Franconia, some communal housing houses have floors or private houses for single women and their children only.
The exception is Lower Bavaria, where there are two central shelters exclusively for women.
The Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality in the European Parliament also calls for women to be housed separately from men.
A study published for the committee states: "It is very important that men and women be housed separately".
"If privacy is lacking or if men and women are housed together, there can be - continuous - violence against women".
In particular, the laundry rooms should be separate and easily accessible to women, the study says.
The extent to which women feel this need for protection can be seen in the demand for the house in Munich.
"Since word got out that we exist, we have a long waiting list", says Bahr.
You could easily open a second house.
Strike by nurses: demands for new labour measures
Representatives of the nursing staff have called on their union to approve new labour action measures in their disputes over a new contract.
The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has asked its full council to approve more workplace strike measures from early September.
The JDC stated that ministers had failed to address the concerns about the treaty.
In July, nurses and medical students voted to reject a contract with the BMA.
It was rejected by 58% of its members who voted in the elections.
In a letter to members posted on Twitter on Thursday evening, JDC chair Ellen McCourt said the government had "kept quiet" about the problems, which led to the contract being rejected.
She said: "In light of this, the JDC Board has voted to reject the proposed new contract completely and requested formal renegotiations on all your concerns".
In response to the government's silence, the JDC board today formally requested a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve an ongoing program of escalating labor strike action beginning in early September.
The disputes have led to six nurses striking this year, the first total strike in the history of the NHS.
The head of the BMA's medical assistants, Dr. Johann Malawana, resigned after the vote to reject the agreed terms of the contract recommended by the BMA.
He informed BMA members during the meetings, which took place before the vote by 54,000 nurses and medical students, that the contract was beneficial and should be adopted.
After the vote, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the contract for doctors in England would be enforced.
Russia and Turkey: An "Alliance of Outsiders"?
It was a gesture that ended a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and officially declare an end to the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin welcomes his Turkish opponent in the gilded hall of the St. Petersburg Palace, I can't help but think that Ankara wants this reconciliation most of all.
There was the handshake, yes.
But Putin's smile was a little tight-lipped, and he hardly radiated any warmth, even for his reserved stature.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, spoke repeatedly of his "dear friend" Putin - according to one report, five times.
I couldn't count it anymore.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their pre-crisis level, but would even improve.
The next day, a newspaper described Erdogan's behavior as if nothing bad had ever happened.
I thought his enthusiasm was more of a counter-intuition.
But a lasting coolness emanating from Putin showed that the Russian leader had not forgotten anything.
The first thing he mentioned in his opening remarks was the cause of the crisis: the shooting down of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border by Turkey.
Moscow's reaction at the time was furious.
Putin distributed and accused Ankara of falling behind Russia.
The crime was even greater, since it was committed by an alleged friend.
Rebuilding trust will become difficult, if not impossible.
Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.
For months, the state-controlled media carried out a fierce, unrestricted attack on Ankara.
Suddenly, it seemed like the Turks were to blame for everything.
The most serious were allegations by senior officials that Erdogan's own family had profited from the illegal oil trade in areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He vehemently denied this.
But in St. Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to look ahead.
In the end, this meeting only took place because Putin got the apology from President Erdogan that he wanted to hear.
Russia could have won something.
The benefits of a ceasefire are clear to Ankara.
Erdogan needs all the friends he can get after he was almost removed from office in a failed coup last month.
Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.
But there are also economic motives.
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular, the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.
The number has fallen by almost 90%.
In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when flights resume.
They're counting on a late-season rush to the Mediterranean.
This week, state television predicted cheaper fruits and vegetables once Turkish agricultural imports are allowed to resume.
A report in Vedemosti put it this way: "Tourists this way, tomatoes this way".
But the visit had an added political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry at the West, considering its response to the attempted seizure of power a weak response.
Added to this is the lingering resentment over the sluggish pace of EU accession negotiations and Putin's eagerness to take advantage of the cooling mood and reduce Turkey's relationship with the West.
The Russian leader certainly won a bonus in Ankara for calling for support for elected state bodies after the attempted coup.
This is a matter of course for Moscow, which itself has a deep-seated fear of regime change.
The summit in this glittering palace by the sea allowed Russia and Turkey to form what an analyst once described to me as an "alignment of outsiders": two countries that feel rejected and treated badly by the West and now ally.
However, despite the public reconciliation, there are still major differences between the two.
The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently played the role of peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.
It may be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks, both presidents stated at the press conference that they had not even touched the subject.
The Turkish president deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences, while Putin chose to emphasize them.
There is no clear consensus on where to find a common denominator on Syria.
But after months of open hostilities - and given the potential for a complete disaster when NATO member Turkey shot down the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two leaders at least talk again.
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available to customers outside Scotland
The Bank's Board of Directors has stated that the RBS brand will be reduced to a back-office role.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank's global ambitions.
The bank has distanced itself since it nearly collapsed eight years ago and had to be rescued.
During this time, brand strategists have used RBS to protect other consumer financial brands.
She supported international sport with millions of pounds of sponsorship, from Six Nations Rugby to Wimbledon winner Andy Murray.
But now it's decided to focus on more national brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland, but will not be initialized.
In England and Wales, all RSB references, decentralised headquarters and listing will be transferred to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other smaller brands for the retail business that will gain more prominence - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a tour of clients and staff in Inverness-shire.
He told BBC Scotland: 'The RSB brand will become our investor brand as well as the brand under which our employees will be employed as we become more of a bank of brands.'
As the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I say now that we are not pursuing global goals, but local goals.
Each of these brands will represent something completely different in their own communities, and our people will work with customers under those brands.
RBS has already stated that it will no longer continue its Six Nations sponsorship and that it will increase the visibility of the different brands in its sports sponsorship.
"It is time for us to develop into the bank of brands, because how do we focus internally (we asked) on making this a better bank for customers?" said the CEO.
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and launched these brands.
But with our work, focusing on customer needs and not our own, I think you're going to see a lot of change.
We can re-launch these brands, so I think it's time.
Frankie Dettori makes his 3,000th win at Newmarket on Predilection .
Dettori splashes champagne after a double at Newmarket, which brings him his 3,000th win.
Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th British win at Newmarket on Friday.
He bet on Predilection, trained by John Gosden, at his local track to set a milestone with his second win of the night.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach the milestone in the flat race.
He is followed by Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddry and Willie Carson.
Three-time winner Dettori, who beat Ghayyar earlier, said, "It's something special".
I'm very emotional because my family is here too.
I'm very happy that it happened at Newmarket, because I ended up here 30 years ago.
It's not a big gathering, it's not Royal Ascot - it's a casual Friday night with 20,000 people.
I'm relieved and very humble.
Dettori cheers as he wins on Predilection
Two jockeys have reached the milestone in the obstacle course - jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time winner Sir Anthony McCoy, who has more than 4,300 career victories.
Lester Piggott, the nine-time Derby winner, had 4,493 career wins.
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of modern times and it's no surprise that he's reached this milestone that few have before him.
He's got style and he's strong, but it's his tactical intellect that sets him apart from the rest of the weight room.
He's a fantastic ambassador for racing, and his enthusiasm and charisma have been inspiring fans for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that he would have won 6,000 by now if he wasn't just a weekend and major tournament jockey!
Frankie's been racing winners in Britain for almost 30 years, which is great.
He has a lively personality, which is good for a British race, but beyond that, he's an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a typical flying dismount .
From flying finishes to flying dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the face of British flat racing for two decades.
It was nerve-wracking.
A string of major tournament wins, including his famous "Glorious Seven" at Ascot in 1996, but he also survived a plane crash and was banned from the sport.
Three years ago, he initially struggled when he returned from his six-month suspension, but he showed impressive strength of character to defy his doubters and return to his best form.
And he's far from finished - Dettori once said he wants to continue competing until he's at least 50.
Russia's Putin fires Sergei Ivanov, chief of staff
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly fired his chief of staff Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov was for many years part of Putin's inner circle.
The 63-year-old was appointed Special Representative for Environment and Transport.
The Kremlin said in a statement that Putin had "ordered Ivanov's dismissal from his duties as head of the Russian presidential administration" without giving any reason.
Anton Vaino, who had been Ivanov's deputy since 2012, was appointed his successor.
Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in 1972 in the Estonian capital of Tallinn, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the embassy in Tokyo.
The Kremlin website states (in Russian) that he was later Chief of Protocol and Chief of Staff of the Government Staff.
On his appointment, he told Putin, "Thank you for your trust".
I think the most important task of the government is to support your work as head of state in drafting laws and monitoring the implementation of your instructions.
Putin told Russian TV on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.
Do the smiling faces convince you?
This move has Moscow wrapped in mystery.
Sergei Ivanov was one of Vladimir Putin's closest confidants for a long time and works for the Soviet secret service, the KGB, like him.
As chief of staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
In a televised meeting with President Putin, both men claimed that the chief of staff was resigning at his own request.
But despite the smile for the cameras, few here are convinced - especially now, just before the general election.
So is this the result of some kind of power struggle?
No one knows at this time.
But the official claim - that a man once touted as a potential president suddenly wants to lead Russia's environmental policy - has been met with great skepticism.
In his remarks to Putin, which are quoted on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said "it is true that I asked you in a conversation in early 2012 to entrust me with this very complicated - you could almost say - cumbersome post for four years.
As it turns out, I've been the head of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months.
He was appointed by the President of the Russian Federation on 1 January 2014.
He was previously Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, a former member of the KGB.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was head of the Federal Security Service (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov as one of the five people he trusted most.
It was once believed that Ivanov could become president of Russia after Putin's second term, as a third term would violate the Constitution.
But that post was taken by another close ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister before becoming president again three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds star Thomas Gibson fired for beating up producers
Gibson was involved in a physical altercation on the set of the show in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce the series, announced his resignation in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized publicly Thursday before his resignation was announced.
There were artistic differences and a disagreement on set.
I regret the incident", he said in a statement.
Details of how Gibson's character will be written out of the series, which follows a team of FBI agents, are expected to be released at a later date, according to a statement from ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
The 54-year-old, who previously starred in the sitcom Dharma & Greg, has been with the show since its first season in 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds and have put all my heart and soul into it for the past 12 years", Gibson said in a statement released Friday.
I was hoping to be there until the end, but that's not gonna be possible now.
I just want to thank the writers, the producers, the actors, our wonderful crew and most of all the best fans you could ask for in a show.
The scheduled airing of the twelfth season is scheduled for September 28.
Mysteries of Fishes Landing in Banff's Garden
A resident of Banff asked for help identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks the 75 fish may be sandals spewed from a spring.
Mr. Bain, who lives about 500 meters from the sea, posted a video of the spectacle on Periscope in the hope that someone might shed some light on the appearance of the two-inch fish.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connected to Fife
The £1.35 billion project is due to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have connected the north deck of the Queensferry Crossing to the viaduct - which means the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It is the first of four "deck-blown" locks approaching completion around each of the three towers of the bridge.
The Fife bridge section is now 2,000 feet long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 sliding ropes.
The £1.35bn project is due to be completed by May 2017.
Economy Minister Keith Brown paid a visit to the site today and was one of the first to walk from the land to the bridge.
He said, "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Crossing.
We are all witnessing an engineering feat of truly epic proportions in this project, with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used in this section of the bridge alone.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate task requiring extremely precise tolerances for fit.
In total, almost 79% of the entire bridge deck is in place and the last section of the deck is receiving concrete casting today in Rosyth, which means that the entire deck is ready to be raised on the bridge to its place.
Michael Martin, project manager at Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: "The first lock is a significant milestone in any bridge project.
In this fantastic project, the fence represents a future-oriented high-rise and low-rise building.
After installing the last section of the road deck and connecting it to the north tower deck, which was being expanded, we had to fill the gap on the north or country side.
This was achieved by moving the north drawbridge 700 millimetres south.
This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.
Massive, as the viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs about 6,000 tonnes and had to be pulled upwards at a slope of about 3%.
This was tricky, because the tolerances the team was working towards were tiny -- just a few millimeters on each side.
Fortunately, everything went very well.
Three men are "lucky to be alive"
Three men are "lucky to be alive" after being thrown from their fishing boat off Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station sounded an alarm at 13:20 BST on Friday after a crew observed the event in Moelfre Bay.
The three men struggled to swim safely as their boat moved on its own.
"We saw the boat spin around near them and imagined the worst", said Moelfre rescue station manager Vince Jones.
"Fortunately, the strong winds had already blown the boat out of reach before we launched", he added.
Two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat, while the third man, aged 60, was found exhausted and hanging from a buoy without a life jacket.
They all got on the shore rescue boat and were taken back to the rescue station.
Mr. Jones said: "The three men who were thrown into the water are lucky to be unharmed and still alive.
The boat's engine had a stop-gap system, but it was detached from the person steering the boat when the boat capsized.
Someone was watching over these men today.
Seriously injured man stabs ex-girlfriend
A man attacked his ex-girlfriend with a knife in Hamburg-Harburg and seriously injured her.
Police said yesterday that the 50-year-old man was given the key to his apartment to get his personal belongings.
Instead, the drunk perp cut his ex-girlfriend's clothes.
When she came into the apartment, he stabbed her twice.
The 44-year-old woman was wounded in the hand and body.
The police were able to arrest the perpetrator.
While the 50-year-old was destroying his ex-girlfriend's clothes, he called his mother.
She then alerted his sister.
Together with her partner, the 45-year-old tried to calm her brother.
But she couldn't get him to leave the apartment.
So she left the house with her partner.
On the road, they met the man's ex-partner.
When the two women entered the apartment again, the 50-year-old pushed his sister aside and attacked his ex-girlfriend.
Who builds cheap housing in Braunschweig?
The SPD and the Greens believe that investors should be made much more responsible in future.
How do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 affordable apartments in the next few years?
The SPD is proposing an action plan for housing for the next Council meeting.
But fighting is programmed.
The first question is: Who will build the affordable housing?
There is no regulation yet.
The Socialist Group leader Christoph Bratmann said: "We agree with the Greens: those who want to build on urban land will have to designate 20 percent of all housing as social housing".
The low-cost housing can also be built in stock.
The main point of contention in the town hall, however, Bratmann said, was: "How do you deal with investors who want to build on private land?"
"We want investors to build at least 10 percent, but preferably 20 percent of the housing units on such land as social housing".
A new urban housing subsidy programme, which will cost millions and still needs to be funded, is to provide incentives.
The problem, Bratmann says, is that "there is currently no agreement between the political groups".
The CDU wants to make as few rules as possible for investors.
The left still wants tougher conditions for investors.
Despite this, Bratmann said, the situation on the housing market was set to worsen.
The implementation of the Action Plan will create additional tasks for the building management.
We need more personnel.
It is not clear whether we will get the specialists.
But the programme is not yet complete: the 1,260 or so new homes that should be built anyway.
But how do we compensate for the loss of another 1,300 affordable housing units, which will be phased out in the coming years?
By 2020 alone, there will be 500 apartments.
To prevent this, planning policy spokeswoman Nicole Palm said, expiring bonds should now be purchased from the city.
The Commission has also been asked to take a decision on the future of the housing market.
It's possible in the West City.
The problem could be solved in one fell swoop.
Because in the West City, deadlines expire at the end of the year.
Some 1,800 homes could be brought back into the price range for affordable housing.
Only the owners don't want it, the housing companies don't.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to this effect.
The Commission is proposing to reduce the concentration of the socially disadvantaged in a few urban areas.
The Greens expect there will be more movement in the discussion.
The Commission has also been asked to provide a list of the Member States which have not yet adopted the euro.
I'm told they're focused on building more single-family homes.
But that does not mean that a compromise cannot be found.
Pokémon Go, a health and happiness quest worth pursuing
It's fascinating to watch the world change.
The fact that teenagers and children no longer go out to play but instead prefer to spend their free time staring at screens has been a source of much complaint over the past decade.
Pokemon Go is about getting people off the couch and getting them to be more active.
Screen time was limited to television, then video games, and finally smartphones.
So it's great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive.
I am referring, of course, to the Pokémon Go craze, an app based on the characters originally created for video games in the 1990s (later turned into a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs).
Like many pop culture phenomena, interest in the game declined slightly before its release in the US, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
The launch in other countries was delayed by the massive demand that overloaded the servers.
Within days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
How does it work?
In short, players go out with their smartphones and look for Pokémon that are tracked with a GPS and, once found, can be "photographed" (via a screenshot on the phone) or "captured".
A generation that played the game when they were younger joined the craze and jumped in search of the couch.
In the United States, the game has led to a significant increase in the number of steps taken by the "average" person each day.
Cardiogram, an app for the Apple Watch that tracks 35,000 users, recently reported to the Washington Post that within two days of the game's launch, the number of people tracked who exercise 30 minutes a day jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company doesn't know which of them is playing Pokémon Go - it just sees the raw data to improve performance.
Many public health education campaigns that encourage people to "take 30 minutes", "get off the couch", and "be active every day" have fallen on deaf ears because many public health messages are boring and come from people who look miserable.
Nevertheless, the importance of sport cannot be overstated.
Regular exercise reduces the risk of cancer and depression.
Physical activity helps control weight, high blood pressure, diabetes, and a long list of benefits that is too long to list here.
But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it gets people to do something outdoors that they enjoy.
Thus, three pillars of health are covered - exercise, fresh air and sunshine, and fun.
Some people even make new friends while hunting.
As usual, there are grumpy game-breakers who always have to complain about something.
And yes, someone could run into a door.
What's the matter?
There's been a breakthrough.
Even though smartphone apps like Fitbit were able to track our activity earlier, they didn't give us a reason to exercise like this game does.
The new thing will lose its appeal and use will fade with time.
But because of Pokémon's success, there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with being active in the real world, helping many people on the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier.

Simone Biles is making gold in the diamond tournament
Forget about the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is immune to all of this.
Dynamic on the jump horse.
Easy on the bar.
Breathtaking on the floor.
Brilliant, all the way.
And now, finally, an Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast won the mixed doubles title Thursday, widening the gap between herself and the rest of the world in full view of the Olympics.
Her total of 62.198 was clearly ahead of silver medalist and Final Five teammate Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.
Simone Biles of the United States is doing gymnastics on a suspended ceiling during the women's individual all-around final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday.
Biles is the fourth straight American to win a mixed martial arts title and fifth overall, as she cemented her reputation as the best of her generation or even of all time.
She broke down in tears when her final result was shown and her long journey came to an end at that moment.
This achievement puts her in the same league as exceptional athletes like Michael Phelps, who have taken their sports to new heights:
Biles has dominated her sport for the past three years, winning 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold medals - with such amazing exercises that include a blend of ambition and precision that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called her "the best gymnast I've ever seen".
She was facing a final test in Brazil, a competition that was not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a burden of oversized expectations.
Not returning to Spring, Texas with a handful of gold to your family would be considered a disappointment.
Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman hugging after winning gold and silver in the women's individual all-around final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday.
Biles claimed her first medal on Tuesday while serving as a cheerleader at the farewell ceremony for retiring team coordinator Martha Karolyi.
Although Biles insisted that during her long journey to the top, she never planned for the future, that's not really true.
Some of her floor exercises - which include her typical tumbling pass - are tuned to Latin American music that would fit in the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio.
It's not a coincidence.
This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a toddler and discovered by coach Aimee Boorman's mother during a school field trip to the gym where Boorman trained, became a force.
She hasn't lost a multi-game match since the summer of 2013, a winning streak that will last as long as Biles wants.
Even though Mustafina led easily through two turns, she carried the picture.
Floating beams and floor towers - in which Biles holds the world title - were waiting.
She caught up with 15,433 on the rack and put another one on the floor with 15,933 on the rack.
Raisman embraced them gently as they waited for their final destination -- a mere formality -- and tears streamed down Biles' shiny red, white and blue eyeliner as the vision she once described in her collection became reality.
Raisman's performance was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she was fighting for third place, but the bronze medal in a tiebreak went to Mustafina.
This time, the 22-year-old team captain, known to Americans as "Grandma", had the lead.
After her floor exercise, she threw a kiss hand to the audience, overwhelmed by a comeback that sometimes seemed doubtful.
As for Biles, the 19-year-old's fast-moving tweet from earlier this week has a whole new meaning:
Police: Three victims in serial murder case shot while listening to music in car
According to police reports released Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl who were shot dead in one of the deadliest attacks in a decade in Phoenix's first serial murder case were shot while talking in their car and listening to music.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot June 12 while the car was parked in a driveway, authorities said.
The perpetrator fired eight rounds from a handgun while standing on the passenger side of the car and then fled in another vehicle, the report said.
Police said the triple murder does not appear to have been the result of a robbery, as the assailant did not take the handbags or the $2,900 that were in the possession of one of the adult victims.
Phoenix police spokesman Sgt. Jonathan Howard said the shooting prompted investigators to take a closer look at whether it's connected to four previous attacks.
In total, seven people were killed and two others injured in nine attacks over four months, mostly in Hispanic residential areas.
"It's happening in a residential area in front of a house", Howard told CBS affiliate KHPO earlier this month.
It is believed that the suspect used multiple vehicles, including a brown late 1990s Nissan, a black late 1990s BMW and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Investigators refused to release the evidence that led them to conclude that the attacks were linked and committed by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized for her injuries and later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter Maleah died at the scene.
A witness told police that it was not unusual for her to sit in a parked car listening to music.
Authorities also released a police report on the shooting, which targeted an empty pickup truck half an hour before the triple murder, and is believed to have been the work of the serial killer.
Investigators found cartridge casings and secured a bullet from the seat and bullet fragments from the engine compartment.
Mother of a 6-year-old with microcephaly: "It's getting better"
Like most six-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto loves to sing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But like most of his peers, Edmund has microcephaly, the result of a genetic disorder that his mother Elizabeth Picciuto knew nothing about during her pregnancy.
When he first came home, my first thought was, I can't do this.
I can't do this.
I didn't go for that.
Which is not true at all -- of course they've agreed to it", she said.
She and her husband Vincent were told that Edmund might never recognize them and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors even went so far as to suggest institutionalizing him.
"My first response was 'I didn't know people still did that,'" Picciuto explained.
Edmund can walk with a walker.
Edmund was unable to sit or crawl until he was three years old, and he still cannot speak.
But he's making progress.
He can walk and ride a bike with assistance.
He also loves to play and sing with his two brothers.
Elizabeth shows the sign language that Edmund invented for "Please sing to me".
"We are teaching him sign language", Picciuto told CBS News.
But it's not typical sign language -- she says. Edmund invented some signs by himself.
Microcephaly has a variety of causes: genetic, as in Edmund's case, and infections with viruses, such as measles or Zika virus, during pregnancy.
The symptoms and prognosis can vary widely.
It is too early to tell how it will affect the lives of those infected with the Zika virus.
Picciuto remembers the emotional toll of an uncertain future.
I kept asking, what's going to happen?
What's going to happen?
And she still doesn't really know.
I haven't asked about the prognosis in a long time because I don't expect anyone to actually tell me.
But Picciuto has some hopeful advice for mothers of babies with birth defects caused by the Zika virus.
It's getting better.
You know it's gonna get better for you.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rain, flooding calls for rescue in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rains and massive flooding in Louisiana forced the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday, with more rain expected throughout Saturday.
Many rivers in southeastern Louisiana and southern Mississippi flooded their banks, threatening massive flooding after extreme rains, the National Weather Service reported.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and aid is on the way to the affected communities.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Governor's Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, said requests for flood vehicles, boats and sandbags were increasing.
Steele said that the Tangipahoa community alone would have requested 10,000 sandbags.
A flood warning system will be in place across much of southern Louisiana through Saturday.
The weather service said that an additional three to five inches of rain could fall in the area.
An early warning system for flooding was put in place in southern Alabama on Friday as rain continued to fall in the Mobile area.
The Comite River near Baton Rouge and the Amite River near Denham Springs, both in Louisiana, are likely to reach record highs over the weekend.
Meteorologist Alek Krautmann says both rivers could flood many homes in the suburbs near Baton Rouge.
He also said that a downstream flood in Ascension Parish would be a danger because it would flow slowly through the trodden rivers into Lake Maurepas.
The Tickfaw River, south of the Mississippi state line in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached its highest level on record as early as 9 a.m. on Friday.
Rescue teams are still pulling people out of floodwaters in Amite and Wilkinson counties in southwest Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson were among those rescued near Gloster on Friday.
Hansford, 62, says that water from Beaver Creek, which is usually more than 400 feet from his home, rose sharply overnight.
He said another stepson who lives nearby warned him.
"We woke up and the water was flowing and flowing in", said Hansford.
It reached my waist.
His wife told Hansford that in the 48 years she had lived there, she had never seen such a high level of the river.
Hansford said that he and his family members had all disabilities and he was the only one who could swim.
Hansford said emergency workers rescued all three in a large military truck and took them to the nearest fire station in Gloster, where they were housed until Friday.
Krautmann said the flood had "spread quickly" as heavy rains continued to fall and that authorities were considering evacuation orders.
According to Krautmann, an observer near Livingstone reported 13.75 inches of rain from midnight Friday to tomorrow.
Krautmann said the ground has been significantly drained by the rains since Wednesday.
Authorities said heavy rains and road flooding caused residents to be rescued from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and school closures in five school districts.
CBS affiliate WWL reported that a Tangipahoa resident reported 200 flooded homes.
The residents were evacuated to two churches, both now flooded.
City manager Robby Miller said authorities had rescued 72 people and seven pets from the floodwaters.
Emergency shelters were set up in the towns of Amite and Hammond to house the evacuees.
"As soon as the water starts to recede, they will be able to return to their homes", he said.
In Hammond, Tangipahoa County, nearly two dozen streets were closed due to flooding and sandbags were provided for residents to take with them as they hope to keep the water out of their homes and businesses.
"The last major flood we had was in March", said Lacy Landrum of the city.
This seems to be a similar incident.
In Mississippi, emergency manager Rupert Lacy of Harrison County said it was still raining on the Gulf Coast.
He said a handful of homes were reported flooded on Thursday, but as of Friday, none have been reported.
Keith Townson, manager of Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has lived in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places I've never seen it before", Townson said, "and it's still coming".
Mahaj Brown, 6, "shot through", survives shooting in Philadelphia
Police say the 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, the second time this week that a 6-year-old child has been shot.
The boy's grandparents identified him to CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.
The grandparents stated that Brown suffered multiple gunshot wounds, including to the waist, leg, arm and abdomen, but that he was conscious when he was transported to the hospital.
"He's been through a lot, his little body was riddled with bullets", his grandmother Delores Melendez told the station.
I just can't believe this.
The boy's condition was declared critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations.
The boy's family told the station that he is expected to recover.
He should have started first grade at a local elementary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in Germantown.
Three men were also shot: two aged 29 and a 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition; the other two victims are in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The boy was found shot in the front seat of a car with the 29-year-old in critical condition, the station reports.
The other two victims were not in the car and police are investigating whether the perpetrator may be underneath one of the injured men.
Investigators have informed CBS Philadelphia that there appears to be a crossfire between several shooters.
Cartridge casings for assault rifles traced to various assault rifles were found at the scene.
It seems that this was clearly a continuous struggle.
On the road, on both sides of the sidewalk, were pods.
So it seems there were several armed fighters involved, very active", Police Chief Anthony Ginaldi told the Philadelphia Police Department.
Several homes and vehicles in the area were also hit.
No arrests have been made and police are currently reviewing the surveillance video, according to reports.
On Tuesday, another 6-year-old girl was hit in the arm by a cross-hatch as she was playing outside her home in the West Oak Lane residential area.
She's recovering and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That's what I envision for the women's Olympic gymnastics team, and for more than one reason.
First of all, I've been to every summer Olympics since 1984 and the U.S. has never been more dominant.
And second, this team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who have inspired many young girls of color.
The structure of this team, which brings together Aly Raisman, who is Jewish, and Madison Kocian, who is Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This team finally reflects the United States.
It's cemented the presence of black and Hispanic women at the forefront of the sport.
For the past four years, the number one female gymnast has been an African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were #1 and #2.
That's a sign of strength.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was a surprise Olympic winner and America cheered.
Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of three-time world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez as they delivered unexpected but masterful gymnastics routines.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth straight American to win gold in the women's individual all-around.
Team member Aly Raisman won silver.
We're at the pinnacle of this sport, but this is not what gym class looks like across the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all took the same path as Aly and Madison to make the Olympic team.
They're the "Last Five" because the next Olympic team will only have four female gymnasts on the team, and this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as coach.
But the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport and gymnastics is primarily in private gyms run by parents who pay for training, furnishings, travel, clothing, competition and hotel costs (for the coaches and their gymnasts and families).
The majority of these gyms are located in affluent suburbs that can support the business.
In these clubs, the gymnasts receive all their training and this is a costly and long-term commitment for the families.
Aimee Boorman, Simone Biles' coach, and Maggie Haney, Laurie Hernandez's coach, have both been training their athletes since they started gymnastics.
We need to make gymnastics more affordable and accessible to communities and to the countless young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I started my 20-year-old gym foundation.
At my events, we've provided free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem to over 15,000 urban youths (mostly black and Hispanic) and trained national and international winners.
In September, we'll expand to Detroit, my hometown, to offer high-quality gymnastics to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Exercise develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.
This combination provides lifelong health benefits as well as academic and professional success.
It's the inspiration from this team that's gotten thousands of young girls interested in gymnastics, and that's great.
It's so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.
This is such an exciting time.
Thank you, Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this true representation of girl power by winning the Olympic team gold, and thank you for inspiring so many young girls from all walks of life to begin their journey to becoming healthy, strong, successful young women.
Nurses want to hold more strikes after rejecting Jeremy Hunt's proposal
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting a reformed contract with the British Medical Association officials, but 58 percent of the 37,000 primary care physicians who voted in an election rejected it.
In July, Hunt had revealed plans to force the contract into effect, saying the NHS was in a "no-man's land" and any further delay would be harmful to staff and patients.
The first assistants are to be given a new contract, which will include changes to night and weekend work to improve care at unwelcoming hours.
Dr Ellen McCourt, chair of the BMA's Nursing Committee, said in a statement last night: "Nurses continue to have serious concerns about the proposed contract, particularly that it will fuel the current employment crisis and fail to treat all doctors fairly".
With only eight weeks left before the first group of doctors are covered by the new contract, progress must be made and time is running out.
Efforts by the BMA to resolve disputes through talks have met with reluctance and sometimes deafening silence from the government.
This is the end of a promise Jeremy Hunt made just last month that his door would always be open.
"Jeremy Hunt must act now to end the enforcement and address the concerns of the paramedics".
If he does not, the nurses have made it clear that they are prepared to carry out further work-related measures.
The last strike in late April postponed nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments as nurses and specialists were brought in to provide cover for doctors on the strike line.
The Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting the reformed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association.
The BMA wants a better weekly wage for the 54,000 paramedics who will be covered by the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, director general of NHS staff, called on the paramedics to end the strike.
Mortimer said: "Working conditions are not getting any of the few benefits, but they are putting a strain on already overworked teams and providers, and they are causing patients, carers and their families nothing but worry, distress and disruption".
Over the last two months, we've been talking to the Nurses' Committee and with the Department of Health and other departments to positively address concerns about guardianship and whistleblowing.
Employers hoped that the continued positive engagement on other important issues - such as posting, flexibility in training, additional training for those returning from a break from work, training costs, mutual recognition of curriculum, training leave and the gender pay gap in medicine - was a sign of how serious employers, Health Education England and the Department of Health were about complying with the agreements with the BMA in November, February and May.
The £2-a-day drug that can reduce heart attack risk
Thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £2 a day drug after authorities recommended giving it to more people over a longer period.
The anticoagulant medicine Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks in people with heart disease.
The medicine is given for 12 months after a heart attack, which reduces the risk of a stroke or another heart attack.
The NHS regulator NICE has recommended taking it for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
The NHS regulator NICE has recommended taking it for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
About 140,000 people have a heart attack every year, and a quarter of them have another heart attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulations of fatty material in the arterial walls that form the linings.
When the lining breaks off, it can cause a blood clot that clogs the blood flow to the heart, causing a heart attack.
When the clot dislodges, it can flow through the bloodstream and block the blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already had a heart attack are at a higher risk of having another one.
Ticagrelor, which is made by the UK company AstraZeneca and sold under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making it less likely that blood clots will form.
The draft NICE guidance published today recommends a 12-month dose of 90mg of Ticagrelor followed by 60mg with aspirin twice daily for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Centre, said: "Despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of all people who have had a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke, often with disastrous consequences".
The fear of another heart attack can have a significant negative impact on a person's quality of life.
Experience shows that Ticagrelor, when used in combination with aspirin, is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
By making a preliminary recommendation for Ticagrelor, we are pleased to be able to expand the treatment options available to thousands of people who can benefit from it.
Information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a maximum of three years, and the draft guidance does not recommend treatment beyond this period.
Culture of Political Correctness is Making Election Fraud Flourish in Muslim Areas
Former Tower Hamlets Mayor Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year following a government report on corruption.
A culture of political correctness has led to widespread voter fraud being deliberately ignored in Muslim communities, as a devastating government report revealed today.
Former Cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles verbally attacks police, election observers and city halls for ignoring evidence of election abuse due to "hypersensitivities about ethnicity and religion".
The former Minister of Integration and Local Government, now an anti-corruption kingpin, said that intimidating voters on religious grounds would be so bad that the police should be allowed to put barricades outside polling stations to protect intimidated voters.
He recommends that voters should carry an identity card to prove their identity in elections.
At present, all a voter has to do is give his name and address.
The report suggests applying indelible ink to a person's finger when they cast their vote to prevent someone from voting twice.
Sir Eric says whistleblowers should be given more protection.
He demands that the press should have more access to municipal documents and decisions of unofficial committees or working groups.
"This is not only to prevent electoral fraud, but also to protect the local government from the wider culture of corruption and financial fraud that comes with it", he said.
The report was commissioned by Downing Street in the wake of the Tower Hamlets election scandal in east London.
Last year, a special election court ruled that acting mayor Lutfur Rahman should be removed from office after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices.
The court found that Rahman had "cynically perverted" the religious sentiments of his Muslim community and silenced his critics with accusations of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman is said to have "led his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to vote for him".
Up to 300 votes were either doubtful or the result of a copycat vote in which one person votes for another.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud all over the country.
He was particularly alarmed by the fraudulent election by mail, in which senior members of the Muslim community had pressured people to vote for a candidate of their choice.
Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean up the voting system, including carrying IDs to prove identity
The report states: "Evidence was presented that pressure was exerted on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, to vote in accordance with the will of the elderly, especially communities with Pakistani or Bangladeshi backgrounds.
"There were concerns that... government institutions would have deliberately ignored such behavior because of 'politically correct' oversensitivities regarding ethnicity and religion".
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including a ban on political activists editing ballot papers to stop "elected people".
The report, which is being considered by Theresa May, also calls for tougher registration checks to prevent the electoral register from being used for immigration and social fraud purposes.
Consider options to ask voters for your ID before the election.
Using indelible ink on a person's finger once they've voted to prevent someone from voting twice.
systematic checks on a person's nationality to ensure that they are eligible to vote.
A three-year limit on requests for automatic postal voting.
Prohibition of political activists from editing complete ballots and envelopes of ballots.
Authorise the police to blockade polling stations.
A change in the law to facilitate the prosecution of intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983.
No photographs at polling stations.
Requirement that only English be used at polling stations (except in Wales).
Intensify training to ensure that staff enforce the rule that voters go to the polling booth alone.
Sir Eric falls for the Metropolitan Police and finds it "amazing" that no criminal charges have been filed after the Tower Hamlets case.
"The electoral court has disqualified Lutfur Rahman and his deputy for a litany of corrupt and illegal practices", he said.
He was found guilty of a number of offences, in accordance with the high standards of criminal procedure.
He also criticises the ineffective "abhak controls" of the electoral registration departments of the town halls.
Sir Eric said: "The judgment in Tower Hamlets last year was a warning signal.
Our country has a proud heritage as the mother of parliaments, but the alarming and covert spread of electoral fraud and denial by some authorities threatens that good reputation.
Crazy for Kate's cycling double and other famous double of Olympic athletes in Rio
Fans of the 2016 Rio Olympics were stunned this week by French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who has proven to be an impressive double for the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympian is far from the only athlete vying for gold this summer to have her own famous double - at least not if social media is to be believed.
In honor of the Rio Olympics and all the famous faces that are currently flashing on our screens, FEMAIL has compiled a list of Olympians who bear more than a passing resemblance to Hollywood celebrities.
The Hunter and the Wolf: U.S. archery team member Brady Ellison, left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since childhood
Aside from Kate's double on the bike path, a lot of people on the Internet pointed out how a certain archer could be the twin of A-list Leonardo DiCaprio.
US archery team member Brady Ellison has caused a furore on Twitter after images surfaced showing him looking eerily similar to the Wolf of Wall Street star.
In fact, the archer got the craze on social media and admitted that he's been hearing since he was a kid that he looks like Leo.
"I don't see much resemblance myself, except for the facial hair", Brady told the Huffington Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I'll take that as a compliment".
One of the most popular comparisons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be even more prominent this year: the striking resemblance between British long jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina with her big, expressive eyes is set to be a double for Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to Glee star Matthew Morrison for years.
One step higher: This user believes that Nathan is the "athletic version" of the Inception actor
Another ongoing comparison was drawn between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who has similarly heavy eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver medalist Yulia Efimova has more than just sun-brown skin and blonde hair like actress Annalynne McCord, while American Nathan Adrian was described by fans as resembling an "athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt".
Strong women: soccer star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, right, have similar facial shape and eyes
Not the only one: One Twitter user was very happy that others noticed the similarities
The theory put into the room: this user says there may be a reason for the resemblance of the couple
One Twitter user expressed her satisfaction that "the rest of the internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are almost identical".
In fact, American football star Hope Solo and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter have an incredibly similar face shape and eyes.
Other popular comparisons included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to that of actress Laura Linney, and gold medalist gymnast Gabby Douglas, who has her own beautiful, broad smile, similar to that of Bring It On Star Gabrielle Union.
CBC Olympic commentator apologizes for saying Chinese swimmer "died like a pig"
Byron MacDonald's analysis of the fourth place finish of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan in the 4x200m freestyle relay outraged viewers of CBC's live broadcast of the Olympics on Wednesday.
Canadian broadcaster CBC had to apologize after one of its commentators said the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "went off like a rat" and "died like a pig" during the race.
Commentator Byron MacDonalds thought his microphone was off when he was about to give his own opinion at the end of the 4x200m freestyle relay.
MacDonald, who had been brought on board the CBS commentary team to add color, could be heard saying: "This little 14-year-old Chinese girl lost her connection, baby".
Too excited, went off like a bitch, died like a pig.
Thank you for that.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second leg of the relay 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada's Taylor Ruck, allowing the Canadians to close the gap to China.
Viewers across Canada reacted quickly online after being shocked by the sound and language
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted, "Did the CBC commentator just say that the 14-year-old swimmer from China "died like a pig"????
The idiot didn't realize they were still on the air".
Ai Yanhan from China was described in the women's 4 x 200m freestyle final as "This little 14-year-old Chinese girl has lost her touch, baby".
The criticism of Byron MacDonald on Twitter came quickly and harshly, with many calling him out
Twitter users were not deterred when they heard how insensitive Byron MacDonald was
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: "Wow, #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and make us all look like racists. #disgusted.
Shortly after, Scott Russell, who hosted the CBC show, apologized live for MacDonald's comment, saying, "We apologize that the comment was broadcast about a swimming performance".
It was an unfortunate choice of words, and we're sorry it happened".
CBC ended up apologizing over 90 times to people who responded to the remark on Twitter.
My fellow commentator Scott Russell had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald.
CBC copied and pasted its apology to more than 90 other Twitter users who had complained about MacDonald's comments.
The network also quickly apologized and issued a statement.
We sincerely regret that these statements were made and that they were allowed to be broadcast.
We apologized quickly last night to our viewers on the air and our social media followers.
To clarify one thing, Byron's comments were about the swimmer's performance, not her as a person.
Yet they were inappropriate and an unfortunate choice of words.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized on the show and tried to justify his remark by stating that it was not his intention for it to be construed as a personal attack.
"I would like to take a moment to apologize for the comment I made after the women's swimming competition on the CBC Olympic broadcast", he said.
"I was referring to the swimmer's performance, not her as a person".
Of course, no disrespect was intended and I am very sorry".
Shoppers at Primark are outraged over a woman shamelessly trying on underwear in the middle of the store.
Shoppers didn't know where to look when a woman took off her clothes in the middle of a supermarket to try on underwear.
To make matters worse, she examined her appearance, undressed her, and put her back on the shelf.
She kept browsing and tried on four pairs of underwear at a store at the Bouverie Place shopping mall in Folkestone.
The Primark store at the Bouverie Place shopping mall in Folkestone, where the woman tried on the underwear before putting it back on the shelf.
A mother of two, Jenny Davidson, who was in the store at the time, said that after the mystery woman tried on the underwear, "she put on her clothes and left the store without buying anything".
She said, "People couldn't believe what they saw".
Standing in the middle of the store, she took a pair of underwear from the store, took off her own tights and pants, and tried them on.
"She didn't even try to find a more discreet place to do it - she just stood there, cheeky like Oscar".
"Everyone was staring as she took off her underwear, which she obviously didn't like, "since she put it back on the shelf.
She repeated the same with three more panties before finally deciding she didn't like anything, put on her clothes again, and walked out.
"She didn't seem to mind being watched - or thinking about the person who might buy the underwear she was trying on".
Mrs Davidson, 33, from Kent, said: "It's disgusting to think that someone would take home underwear that someone else was wearing that hadn't been washed".
The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon.
Mrs Davidson added: 'I have heard that the staff tried to withdraw the clothes from the sale after she left - which is just as good.'
"I'd hate to go home with a new pair of underwear and find out that another woman had them on and took them off and they weren't washed".
A Primark spokesman said: "Primark is aware of the incident which occurred at our Folkstone branch on Tuesday 9 August".

How to Use Krav Maga to Protect Yourself From Gun Attacks
The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com might make it a little safer for you.
We spoke to Rhon Mizrachi, a grandmaster at the New York Krav Maga Association, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close range.
Whether you're approached from the front or from the back, this video will show you how to turn the spike for your robber.
If approached from behind, the first thing to do is turn around so you can see your attacker and "get out of the line of fire", Mizrachi says.
Then grab the gun between your forearm and your shoulder before you hit him in the face with your free elbow.
Then you hit him in the groin with your knee and you twist the gun out of his hands as the attacker bends in pain, you hit him in the face with your runner and you move backwards as you point the gun at him.
For attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the line of fire, grab the weapon, and turn it so that the attacker cannot shoot.
At the same time, shift the weight onto the weapon and hit the attacker on the chest, then twist the weapon out of his grip before they move backwards and aim the weapon at him.
Does that sound difficult?
Watch the video to see exactly how Mizrachi is doing.
But remember, the safest way to get away with a robbery is to hand over your money - unless you're a Krav Maga grandmaster.
Traveler Ian Wright scratches his tongue for a guide at Europe 's dirtiest places
A British traveler put his immune system and choking reflex to the test by licking some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.
Suffolk-based travel writer and presenter Ian Wright, 51, scratched his train on a euro bill, a railing at Piccadilly Circus, a sink button on a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system.
Before licking each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he was going to be involved in.
But the experiment, filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength", brought some surprising results to light.
The thought of licking the sink button of a train toilet that has already been used by thousands of others may seem completely repulsive, but in fact, there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.
During his trip through Europe, Mr Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria and about his own health.
Fortunately, nothing he licked left behind but a bad taste in his mouth.
Mr. Wright became known for testing the resilience of his intestines by traveling the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
From public areas at train stations to toilet sinks, the task definitely put his immune system to the test.
In the film, he said, "Even as a child, I was relatively unconcerned about my health, and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, dirt, worms and muddy water".
He certainly lived up to his reputation in the movie.
The only thing he didn't like was a dirty public toilet in Russia.
His sample sample showed a luminometer count of over 4,000 units.
In comparison, the luminometer count of freshly washed hands is less than 60.
But there was a Russian toilet that he refused to flush after its luminometer count was over 4,000 units, while freshly washed hands have a rate of less than 60
Mr Wright and the Finnish dairy manufacturer Valio produced the travel film 'The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength', which shows the bacterial population in various places such as the bathroom
In the movie, he says, "This is the worst smell I've ever heard in a bathroom".
There's nothing dirtier than that!
I'm not gonna lick anything in here because it's disgusting in here.
The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was produced in cooperation with the Finnish dairy producer Valio.
The company supplies Mr Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamins C and D to help promote gut bacteria and the immune system.
Niko Vuorenmaa, Senior President of Snacks, Juices and New Categories at Valio Venice, says: "We really wanted to offer something new to consumers.
Something that's fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics.
We were doing crazy brainstorming sessions that ended up with us saying, "Let's call Ian".
They claim that the interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a larger context -- the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it's linked to the immune system.
The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information about it in an interesting way.
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added: "Let me put it this way - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had licked some of the things I told him to lick, like the disgusting Russian toilet shown in the film".
Of course, there were some things where it was easier to get Ian to lick her and some things where it was quite difficult.
I'm glad we got some of these dirty treats on film".
In a 2015 survey conducted by Valio, 84 percent of all respondents associated lactic acid bacteria with gut health in particular, and 58 percent said they at least occasionally use products that contain lactic acid bacteria.
An antisocial family destroyed before eviction social housing in Saltash, Cornwall
An antisocial family left their social housing after being evicted with £50,000 in damages for terrorising their neighbours.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown from their estate in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long list of complaints.
After being forcibly removed from their property, shocked housing cooperative employees found the property in an irreparable state.
The walls were showing gaping holes, wood panels were being torn apart, trash was being scattered on the floor, and graffiti was being smeared on the walls.
The family has been relocated and is believed to be living in a private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, who works for the housing authority at Cornwall Housing, said she was concerned the apartment was beyond repair.
She said, "It's been a total nightmare for people here, and I don't think people should have to live that way.
There are many things to consider, as this property will probably be considered not so beautiful part of Cornwall.
The family is infamous and so is their reputation.
The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime, and police said the terror the family had inflicted included street fights with baseball bats, intimidating residents, drug abuse, drug dealing and excessive yelling, fighting and swearing.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, got a restraining order for antisocial behavior in June.
In some rooms of the house, which is likely to be demolished, old rubbish was found.
The wooden planks were torn up in the property where drugs were traded in the past.
Neighbors said they saw them fighting in the street and had to call the police regularly
Cornwall Housing evicted her and her partner from the property this week after giving them an 11-week extension to voluntarily move out.
The eviction was cheered by relieved neighbors who said it made their lives a living hell.
One witness said, "They didn't care about anyone".
We lived next door to them for 20 years, and it was always bad.
The number of times we tell the police here is unbelievable.
"We couldn't sleep this morning".
We got up because it was so quiet here - we're not used to it!
Now that they're finally gone, it's gonna be nice.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighborhood Enforcement Manager at Cornwall Housing, testified that the family would have failed to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals for 20 years.
Garbage and old toys were thrown down the overgrown side of the town hall
He added: 'It is a shame that the tenant failed to take any responsibility for her behaviour and that of her family, as eviction is always the last step considered by Cornwall Housing.
This was a very difficult case, because the behavior was extreme and their actions must have been horribly visible to their neighbors.
I appreciate all the work that my team, the Devon and Cornwall Police and members of the community have done to courageously approach us and pass on the information.
I hope this development will bring some comfort to some neighbors and send a message that antisocial behavior is not tolerated.
Fitzpatrick said all three sons lived in the house at different times, but they were all in their 20s.
A dirty mattress left on the floor in one of the bedrooms of the house after the de-logging
Housing administration workers will now have to clear garbage piles surrounding the house
In 2014, police raided the house and found over 70g of cannabis, as well as scales, paraphernalia and £1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined after pleading guilty to possession of a class B drug with intent to distribute.
She claimed the money was for a tombstone for her son Lee Skeldon, who was killed in a car accident in 2013.
Having been homeless, it is believed that Tanya and her partner are now living in a private residence in Plymouth.
Many of the walls of the house were smeared with graffiti.
The police say they'll evict tenants who don't follow the rules.
Angela Crow of Devon and Cornwall Police said the eviction was a clear warning to the other tenants who are not following the house rules.
"This is for those who think they can behave without self-reproach and for those who have been harmed by such behaviour", she said.
Devon and Cornwall Police will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behaviour, and will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal panic after low-flying military jet flies over beach
Sun worshippers in Aveiro, Portugal, experienced the shock of their lives
A Portuguese P-3C Orion Air Force plane has made an incredible crash
The Air Force said it was on a training flight, but insisted there was no security risk.
This was the moment when frightened tourists began to panic after a low-flying jet crashed onto a crowded beach.
Dramatic video footage showed the military plane flying almost within striking distance of the sun worshippers on the beach in Aveiro, northern Portugal.
The holidaymakers jumped when they understandably began to worry about the noise of the jet engines, without first seeing what was coming at them through the clouds.
The incident happened yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of many vacationers who posted videos of the dramatic flyby on social media, said: "It flew really low twice and there was a moment when it looked like it was going to crash".
Nuno Arroja added: "I was surfing and it felt like the plane was falling on me".
Tourists on Aveiro beach were in a panic as the plane emerged from the darkness and flew incredibly low
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast, flying so low that it was the only way to spot them.
The spokesman said the jet was flying a little lower than usual due to poor visibility from nearby surface fires, but the Air Force insisted that safety was not at risk at any time.
Fires have ravaged parts of mainland Portugal this summer, killing four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot had to fly so low due to conditions - heavy fog and smoke - that his vision was limited.
The aircraft was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise.
Barca worried about Sevilla
Sevilla FC Barcelona will fight on Sunday for the first step towards winning the first title in the new football season.
The Catalans will play against Sevilla in the Spanish Super Cup away match, the replay will be held three days later at Camp Nou.
The double winner must face off against the losing cup finalist and reigning Europa League champion, among others, Neymar, who is playing with Brazil in the Olympic football tournament.
And the goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen is also missing.
The German suffered a tendon sprain in his knee during training, which at least for the time being has cleared the Barca one-point question in favour of Claudio Bravo.
The Chilean International and Ter Stegen have been competing for the number one spot in Barcelona for two years.
Coach Luis Enrique has so far given up a clear decision and left Bravo in the league, but Ter Stegen has the lead in most other contests.
Before the first game of the new season, the Spanish champion has doubts about the fitness of the team, which was humiliated on Saturday in a test match against Liverpool with 0:4.
Even in the 3-2 test match against Sampdoria on Wednesday, Lionel Messi and Co. were not really convincing.
Sevilla, on the other hand, have to deal with the 2:3 defeat in the European Super Cup against Real Madrid after extra time and are aiming for the second triumph in the "Supercopa de Espana".
Barcelona is the record winner in this competition with eleven wins so far.
Ma Long in a league of his own for table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - Chinese Ma Long is the new Olympic table tennis champion.
The 27-year-old beat fellow countryman and "defender" Zhang Jike 4-0 (12,5,4,4) in a one-sided final in Rio de Janeiro on Thursday.
The world ranking leader won the "Golden Grand Slam" with success at the World Cup, World Cup, World Tour final tournament and even the Olympics.
Bronze went to Japanese Jun Mizutani.
The two Chinese made it to the final as expected and fought for the title.
It was clear that for the third time in a row a Chinese would win the singles title in the Five Rings.
The last non-Chinese to climb the top Olympic ladder was former Soviet Union Navy SEAL Ryu Seung-min from South Korea.
Ma and Zhang were left alone at the plate, with no coaches between sets and time-outs.
They had retreated to the stands and let their subjects fight each other in a fair competition.
"I've played all the matches for my country".
"In the final, I'll play for myself", Zhang had said.
After the match, gold and silver medalists posed with the Chinese flag.
The match itself was unexpectedly one-sided.
Ma only really had to fight his 28-year-old opponent in the first set.
After that, he set the pace at the plate and left Zhang with only 13 points.
Ma's superiority did not lead to the exciting match that was expected.
Nevertheless, there were sufficiently breathtaking changes of balls to be seen.
Mizutani won the bronze match against 40-year-old Vladimir Samsonov 4-1.
The Belarusian had suffered a rib injury in his quarter-final against German European champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov, was then under medical treatment, had to settle for "finally" with sheet metal.
The Swedes Jan-Ove Waldner (38/2004) and Jörgen Persson (42/2008) had, by the way, become Olympic fourth in table tennis at similarly high ages.
Donald Trump admits to "massive problems" in his campaign
The Republican leadership in the United States is plagued by massive concerns about losing their majority even in traditionally conservative states.
Presidential candidate Donald Trump has now admitted to weaknesses in his campaign in the Republican stronghold of Utah.
A rare moment when the usually pompous and self-assured multimillionaire expressed anything like concern, correspondents reported.
After he has eliminated 16 rivals from within his own Republican camp, doubts are growing about his success in the race for the White House.
"We have tremendous problems in Utah", Trump told evangelical Christians, who he asked for support in key states like Ohio, Florida or Virginia.
He was blamed for false reports about his candidacy, he again took up his well-known media reproaches.
Republican Fortresses are shaking
Utah is usually a safe haven for Republicans.
A survey conducted by SurveyUSA in June found that Trump and his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, were on a par.
Other agencies see Trump ahead, but not by the margin that is common for Republican candidates in the state.
Arizona and Georgia are also listed as endangered.
In an interview with CNBC, Trump replied to the question of how he would stop Clinton's advance: "Just like I've done before".
And pushed back: "This will either be successful, or I'll take a very, very nice, long vacation".
He does nothing but "tell the truth".
If it's not enough for him in the end for reasons of political correctness, that's fine, Trump said.
Then I'll go back to a very good way of life.
According to press reports, Trump's party threatened to cut off funding to his campaign if he failed to improve his poll numbers.
Instead, they want to give the Republican candidates for Congress a bigger hand.
Olympic: Cheating at doping test
The IOC wants to set up a disciplinary committee on the case.
Kenya's athlete is in trouble after the second doping scandal at the Rio Olympics.
After an attempted cheat at a doping check at the Olympic Village, Kenya sent a coach home.
The International Olympic Committee has announced the immediate establishment of a disciplinary commission to investigate the case.
A Kenyan official had reported that former sprinter and current coach, John Anzrah, had taken a urine sample at the Olympic Village under the name of 800-meter runner Ferguson Rotich.
This was reported to the Kenyan team management by the doping controllers.
The IAAF has asked the IOC for information on the case to allow it to conduct its own investigation, an IAAF spokesman said.
"Depending on the results of the investigation and the IOC's subsequent actions, the IAAF will make an assessment", the IAAF said in a statement.
"He (Anzrah) went to the doping control station and posed as Ferguson Rotich, gave the sample and signed it", Kenya's chief of mission, Stephan Arap Soi, said.
He was in possession of the athlete's accreditation, which was on the World Anti-Doping Agency's training checklist.
Ferguson Rotich was fourth in the 800 meters at the 2015 Beijing World Championships.
Four days earlier, Kenyan athletics delegation head Michael Rotich had been pulled out of the Rio Games.
He is said to have informed athletes from his country about upcoming doping tests in exchange for cash payments.
According to media reports, he was arrested on his return from Nairobi airport.
Kenya has been under special observation by the IOC for some time now following a number of doping offences.
The announcement of the more than 2000 doping target checks imposed by the IOC ahead of the Rio Games was unusually preceded by a warning that athletes from Kenya and Russia would be particularly targeted.
The World Anti-Doping Agency had put a lot of pressure on the African country to create an anti-doping law and a functioning control system before the summer games in Brazil.
The law was passed a few weeks before the Olympics.
Subsequently, WADA removed Kenya from the list of countries whose anti-doping policies comply with WADA rules.
Kenya is considered a great runner nation.
The country's athletes won the most medals at the 2015 World Championships in Beijing.
In a series of television reports by ARD, there have been repeated allegations that doping agents are readily available in Kenya and that there is a significant mentality of sports fraud.
IOC member Richard Pound recently called for a similar investigation in Kenya, as he had done in Russian athletics.
The Commission has therefore decided to initiate the procedure laid down in Article 108 (3) of the Treaty.
Russia's athletes were subsequently banned from the summer games.
Salzburg West Side Story with Cecilia Bartoli
In the year of Shakespeare, the Salzburg Festival presents "West Side Story" with Tony and Maria as a tragic couple of lovers, much like Romeo and Juliet.
And with a surprising Cecilia Bartoli.
A musical is taking Salzburg: the West Side Story, the masterpiece of Leonard Bernstein.
Artistic director Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and fulfilled a childhood dream with the role of Mary.
In the orchestra pit, the Simón Bolívar Orchestra, conducted by Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel, exclaims: "This music is full of rhythm".
We always say she's very Latin American.
There's a lot of Latin American ingredients in their tempo and their melody.
It's a wonderful blend, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.
I'd say we really have Bernstein's music in our blood!
In this production, Bartoli plays an elderly Maria.
She remembers her love affair with Tony with sadness, while the younger Mary plays and dances.
I've always been fascinated by the role of Mary.
First, because she is exceptional musically.
And then there's the personality of Maria.
She says it in her song, "I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and witty and bright".
So she's smart, of course, she's naive, and she's very passionate.
"She is very similar to me, my Italian character, which I have as a Roman", laughs Bartoli.
Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist".
It's such an honor to work with her.
She's a very generous person.
And Bartoli returns the compliment: "Dudamel is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate!"
He's a man who needs to conduct.
You can see it in his every move, in his eyes, it's his life!
It's such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him.
We both have a rather southern temperament, a fire, a passion and also a cheerful approach to life, which is very important in general!
For American director Philip W. McKinley, "West Side Story" is highly timely: "This play is about prejudice and bigotry".
Today we have the refugees, then the Puerto Ricans went to New York, and the New Yorkers didn't want them.
It is the same issues, and they are as relevant today as they were then.
59 years later, the play is still relevant.
London schoolgirl who joined ISIS was killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIS, reportedly died in Syria.
Lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said her family learned of her death in Raqqa, Syria, a few weeks ago.
She was believed to have been killed by a Russian airstrike in Raqqa, the group's stronghold in the country, ITV News reported on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and died, according to her family, shortly after she planned to leave the war-torn country and return to England.
"One can only hope that the only good thing is to stop people from ever making that decision - as a reminder and warning to others that these are the risks that come with going to a war zone", Akunjee said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other schoolgirls from east London boarded a plane bound for Turkey and then boarded a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultana's family was told that she had married an ISIS fighter in Syria - and within a few months she was widowed.
Reid says Clinton will remain on the Supreme Court bench if Garland wins.
Harry Reid, the leader of the Democratic Senate, is convinced that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will nominate Justice Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court.
The Republicans in the Senate have blocked Garland's confirmation since his nomination by Barack Obama in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is of the opinion that the next president will nominate the successor to the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.
Reid said Thursday during a conference call that he expects Clinton to select Garland "with some degree of certainty".
A spokeswoman for Reid later said he hadn't spoken to Clinton about whether she would nominate Garland and he was speculating.
He praised Garland and said Clinton's team wouldn't cause any trouble with a new candidate.
Garland is the chief judge for the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
Raid said the Republicans blocking Garland's nomination are lackeys and aides to Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He also stated that Donald Trump was unfit for the presidency.
Treats wants a nude calendar for "women and for men"
Treats magazine is working with photographer David Bellemere to produce a 1970s Pirelli-inspired calendar for 2017.
But instead of famous naked people, they want to find the next generation of top models for their NU Muse calendar for 2017.
Treats editor Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his nude magazine is different from old-school playboys because "Playboy is for men".
I do it for women.
Apparently, he thinks the calendar does, too.
"We need to return to depicting timeless and classic nudity, where both women and men feel comfortable and inspired by these images of a female body", Shaw said in a press release announcing the calendar's release.
Women will want to participate in this project because it's a beautiful work of art.
Models can submit their images online or in person through open casting calls in Los Angeles and New York.
Turkey: Kurdish community expects mass exodus
"Anyone who doesn't adapt and praise Erdogan is sitting on packed suitcases", says Ercan Karakoyun, chairman of the pro-Gulen Dialogue and World Foundation.
The Kurdish community in Germany expects tens of thousands of asylum seekers to flee Turkey for Germany in the near future.
In the medium term, it could even reach "a few hundred thousand", says Ali Toprak, the association's president.
Because of the harsh action taken by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the coup attempt, the Kurdish community in Germany is expecting a mass flight to Germany.
"In the short term, I expect tens of thousands, in the medium term, a few hundred thousand refugees from Turkey to come to Germany if the Erdogan regime continues to fight minorities and the democratic opposition", Ali Toprak, the association's president, told the German newspaper Welt on Friday.
The report also calls for the EU to take a more active role in the fight against terrorism.
After the failed coup, secular and opposition ethnic Turks would join them.
Many will want to start anew in Europe if they continue to be oppressed in Turkey.
"It cannot be that a state that takes in refugees itself produces refugees in its own country", Toprak said.
The head of the association deplored the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish but also Alevi cities.
The Turkish government has been trying to force the Kurds to leave.
"They are the last major minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have already been exterminated or expelled in the last hundred years", said Toprak, also a member of the Christian Democratic Union.
The head of the association demanded that the German government "take a position as sharply as Austria against Erdogan and his supporters".
In Germany, too, a "witch hunt" is under way against Erdogan critics.
I'm not safe in Germany for the first time in months.
The German branch of the Gülen movement also fears the flight of many Turks abroad.
More Turks will seek asylum in Germany, especially Kurds and oppositionists.
The brand of Gülenism destroys the professional existence of teachers and other academics.
"Those who do not adapt and praise Erdogan are sitting on packed suitcases, including the Kemalists and secularists", Ercan Karakoyun, chairman of the pro-Gulen Dialogue and Education Foundation, told the World.
The newspaper reports, citing figures from the Federal Ministry of the Interior, that even before the coup, Turks were the largest group of asylum seekers in Germany recognized as being politically persecuted.
The report also highlights the need to ensure that the EU's asylum system is fully functional.
This survey does not include those who have fled war, poverty or the lack of prospects.
The right to asylum is granted to individuals who are persecuted exclusively for political reasons, i.e. by the State.
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: 'Going where it hurts'
Strange thing about Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the locals get nothing from the summer election campaign - and the holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to vote for the state parliament.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood.
In 2021, the election of the state parliament will not take place again at the end of the summer holidays, the Schwerin Parliament decided at the beginning of the year.
I am not sure that the Commission is prepared to accept this proposal.
The locals, who are supposed to be convinced by the campaigners, are on vacation.
The vast majority of holidaymakers in the country, whether travelling to Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, are not local, so they are not allowed to vote in the Landtag.
Added to this are practical problems: During the holidays, it is difficult to find helpers who hang posters, blow up balloons, distribute flyers, and finally count votes.
Until 4 September 2016, the election and last holiday day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern must once again let the election campaign pass by the people.
The hot phase, if you can even say that, has just begun.
And there is also something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of an SPD/CDU coalition, must fear for his office.
The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in opinion polls.
It will be interesting to see how well the new AfD performs and what remains in the end.
Sellering, 66, head of government since 2008, has been campaigning almost unobtrusively, apart from his big posters.
He travels the country, distributing roses and chatting with people, just as his legendary, wordless predecessor Harald Ringstorff did.
Otherwise, Seelering has got cold feet and blames Chancellor Merkel for the AfD's rise.
Their refugee policy, their "we can do this" policy, has accelerated the rise of right-wing populists, which will probably cost him his beautiful office.
The CDU, with its leading candidate, Interior Minister Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced what it is like to campaign in the wrong place at the wrong time.
It has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to large rallies; Merkel's Bundestag constituency is in the northeast.
But the target group was not right, there were more North Rhine-Westphalians, Berliners and Saxons there than Mecklenburgers and East Pomerania.
"There were probably the majority from other states", complained Vincent Kokert, general secretary of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in the GDR.
But it does no harm to anyone from other parts of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel.
Otherwise, the north-east CDU largely abandons the usual election stands in marketplaces and shopping centres with umbrellas and balloons.
This, Kokert says, is only a "subordinate role".
The Union has also realised that it is breaking down the base in the countryside, that it has to work very hard to find a link back to the people.
It is like the Left, the SPD, the Greens: hardly present in the country.
The advice of the CDU candidate Kokert to his fellow party members is also self-explanatory: "They have to go where it hurts, where people are: village festivals, golden weddings, every birthday party must be used".
Because there is a lot at stake, Sellering has now called on his SPD to campaign with particular commitment.
In the latest polls, the Social Democrats were 22 per cent behind their CDU partner (25) and just ahead of the AfD (19).
In the 2011 election, the SPD had still clearly won with 35.6 percent ahead of the CDU (22).
The Greens, a small party with seven percent in the polls, are likely to make the jump to the state parliament.
They're turning the need for vacation into a modern virtue and putting a lot of their campaigning on the Internet.
"Online election campaign", the head of state Claudia Müller calls it.
Otherwise, green campaigners will be looking for indigenous voters among the holidaymakers.
Silke Gajek, the top candidate, is just curving a houseboat through the Mecklenburg lakes and she still thinks it's beautiful.
The impression they got was that "electoral leave in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is not a punishment".
B27: Restoration: Restaurants are under lockdown
The speed with which the B27 is being renovated is not to be blamed.
The construction workers, who start at 5:30 a.m. and finish at about 8 p.m., are widely praised.
"They've made a mess of everything", says Elvira Tetzlaff of the Jet service station.
This is a super team.
There's no delay either.
The site could be moved south at the beginning of the week at half-time as planned, and everything should be finished by the end of October.
The willingness of those responsible for the construction work, such as the installation of reservoir entrances, is also commended.
Since the construction site moved south on Monday and the blockade of the Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen was lifted and the connection to Rottenburg was re-established, the traffic situation within the town has eased.
The B27 is now open to public use in both directions.
The traffic around the place seems to be declining.
"There were some significant complaints", says Florian King, deputy head of the transportation management department responsible for the renovation.
The inhabitants of Bachsatzstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to struggle with more traffic noise because many people were looking for shortcuts and were more confident in their navigation than in the signage.
Which led to some trucks crashing into residential areas.
Since the speed limits were not respected, the municipality requested the measuring vehicle from Mössingen.
"There was a significant overreach", says King, who once reported on the situation himself.
There's been two or three lightning strikes a minute.
The fastest was traveling in the 30 speed zone at 77 kilometers per hour.
But since the site moved on, it's been quieter.
For businessmen on the B27, it is only a small consolation that the road is now open again for customers from Rottenburg.
Businessmen don't like to look at the cards.
But the fact that the B27 renovation led to a drop in sales for them makes it clear to anyone you ask.
However, some are more affected and some less.
The restructuring will have little effect on those who have less to do with the "end customer", i.e. produce for other companies.
The carmaker Maier also described a "very slight decline", but admitted that "the running clientele is lacking".
The most affected are the shops along the street.
J. Albert Göhner, owner of the steakhouse, formerly Crown, finds clear words.
That's already existential.
Not only him, but all the restaurants were "hard hit".
The customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil were missing.
We must be happy about every euro of turnover.
He estimates the loss of turnover at "well over 50 per cent".
The road repair "set his business back two years".
He had to lay off half his staff.
If I had a company with 4,000 employees and half of them were laid off, the politics would have reacted differently.
Instead, Prime Minister Jörg Schmidt replied to a question from Göhner about the possibility of financial compensation, saying that otherwise the restaurant would benefit from the advantages of its location on the B 27.
Göhner knows of other counties where this has been handled more generously.
Despite all the lawsuits, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist.
After all, the family business has been here since 1715, he points to the long history.
He can understand that other regulars are now less likely to stop by because of the complicated traffic management.
If you can't drive here, it's nice somewhere else.
Göhner has no doubt that his regular customers will return after the renovation work is completed.
Despite the BSE and avian flu crises, Göhner considers the impact of the B27 construction on his clientele to be the biggest crisis his restaurant has experienced in its long history.
Six months of construction is brutal.
The law is constantly being screw up in the name of fighting terrorism.
After the recent attacks, Interior Minister de Maizière is now presenting a thick security package.
But what does tolerance have to do with terrorism?
And what does the coalition partner say about all this?
Thomas de Maizière is giving the reconciler.
All his proposals are "politically reasonable" to the coalition partner, says the Federal Minister of the Interior at the presentation of his new security package.
You're not overwhelming anyone.
Other, more far-reaching points would be discussed first within the parties.
I'm a part of that, too.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to ionising radiation.
De Maizière has given a little time after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach before presenting his conclusions on security in the Republic.
But now they are even more important.
There's something that's already been said, announced, and pointed out: that a new security agency is going to take care of cracking encrypted communications is not new.
Nor is the fact that Germany has to implement several EU regulations on passenger data and gun laws.
The call for more video surveillance and security personnel is also not surprising.
The Commission is also proposing to increase the number of EU citizens who are eligible for asylum in the EU.
"These will be difficult points for the SPD", admits the CDU man.
He nevertheless considers this to be reasonable and does not demand anything that the coalition partner does not have any chance of doing.
De Maizière also presents some new ideas.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to this effect.
Refugees who are brought into the country specifically are asked to have their smartphones checked and social media accounts disclosed for security screening.
He wants to make it worse than ever for some to tolerate rejected asylum seekers - for example, those who commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers to hide their identity.
Some of it is politically and legally delicate.
Some of it seems unresolved and leaves questions open.
And on some points - the unequal treatment of patients, for example - the question arises: what does this have to do with security and terrorism?
Yes, de Maizière says it is important to differentiate between the issues of refugees and terrorism.
But it cannot be denied that the assassins of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.
In addition, many people were concerned about their safety in view of the high numbers of refugees.
And things that people were deeply concerned about, they couldn't be left out of the election.
Internal security has been a huge focus.
First the attacks in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.
Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.
The uncertainty is great.
And yes, there are campaigns.
The Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly taking a stand on internal security.
In the last few days, the two parties have been on a high.
First a nasty dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police, then a collection of security policy ideas by some Union interior ministers, in which the heads of departments also call for a ban on the burqa and an abandonment of dual citizenship.
De Maizière is also trying to find a conciliatory tone here.
He doesn't care about a double pass.
We have pacified the discussion in Germany.
It's no use reopening it.
And if he's got a burqa ban, he's got constitutional concerns.
Whether his own package is constitutional in all respects and whether it is indeed "reasonable" for the coalition partner remains to be seen.
There's some stuff in there that could cause a fight.
But the SPD is also trying to make a name for itself on the subject of internal security.
The party leader Sigmar Gabriel is cautious about talking, saying: "The SPD is ready to talk about anything that helps to increase security further".
Volkswagen is still getting by.
Despite the diesel scandal, deliveries are rising worldwide.
But not all markets are doing well.
There is a word in the recall.
Volkswagen will start to deliver more vehicles in the second half of the year.
Europe's biggest carmaker has continued to perform well this year despite the diesel scandal, thanks to its many brands and some well-run markets.
However, in July the core brand VW weakened, particularly in Western Europe, again weighing on overall sales, the Dax listed company said.
Worldwide, the VW brand sold 449,100 cars in July, 1.8 percent fewer than in the same month last year.
In Western Europe alone, the second most important market after China, sales were 14 percent lower than the previous month.
In the home market of Germany, deliveries fell by almost one sixth.
Brand sales manager Jürgen Stackmann attributed the weaker figures from July to two fewer sales days in Europe.
In addition, there was a deterrence in some core markets due to 'changing economic conditions'.
In addition to the situation surrounding the coup attempt in Turkey, the British vote to leave the EU has also weighed on the situation, a spokeswoman said.
In the United States, where the emissions scandal first escalated, the negative situation continues.
The Chinese market is a major support for VW.
The mainly affected brand in Lower Saxony is still in the spotlight because of the diesel scandal: after the first seven months, there was only a 0.9% drop in deliveries to 3.37 million vehicles.
Group sales manager Fred Kappler continued to show a sales surplus from January to July.
Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles during this period, 5.904 million worldwide.
Volkswagen had tampered with exhaust gas tests with a software.
In Germany alone, VW is recalling some 2.5 million vehicles for conversion.
In the course of the conversion, VW confirmed that the conversion of the cars would not have any negative impact.
After conversion of vehicles, there is no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine performance.
The car manufacturer issued a certificate of "guarantee equivalent" to the customer after the conversion, but did not speak of a "guarantee", as was said on Friday in business circles.
The Commission has not yet decided on the application of the directive.
The focus had reported that Volkswagen was now offering a guarantee to its German customers for converted diesel models.
This was confirmed by VW representatives at the Federal Ministry of Transport last Monday.
The Ministry of Transport has confirmed that this meeting took place.
'VW must fully comply with the requirements of my investigation committee and the KBA.'
"Devisions from this are not accepted", said Federal Minister for Transport Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), according to the ministry.
VW has undertaken to guarantee that after conversion there will be no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine performance and that all vehicle values relevant for type approval will remain unchanged.
Volkswagen itself does not use the term 'guarantee', as it was known in company circles.
The broad term 'warranty' is used by Volkswagen to describe the possibility that customers may come to a workshop with an engine failure, for example six months after the conversion, and attribute this to the new software, even if the damage is unrelated.
It is also important in the interests of customers to avoid any uncertainty about possible guarantee schemes, as was said, in the event of any other damage not related to the exhaust gas scandal.
Therefore, VW does not use the term 'guarantee'.
Raiffeisenbank Gmund am Tegernsee is the second institution in Germany to charge penalty interest on wealthy savers.
Bank President Josef Paul said on Thursday: "We are talking about 139 customers who have €40 million in bank accounts".
The Federal Association of German Banks speaks of a single case and sees no signal in it: Normal savers should "not be afraid to pay penalty interest on their savings".
Banks that deposit money overnight with the European Central Bank (ECB) must pay a 0.4 percent penalty.
The Commission has already taken a decision on the application of the exemption for the use of the euro as a medium of exchange for the purposes of Article 92 (3) (c) of the Treaty.
"The first 100,000 euros are free".
"The next 100,000 will cost 400 euros a year in the future", Paul said.
He has been holding 40 million euros for some time, which could be withdrawn overnight and which he cannot use.
"They're on my central bank account and cost 0.4 percent", said the bank manager.
"I can't put in 4,000 euros for every million".
The costs are now passed on on to the producer.
Leaving the cash in the safe at Raiffeisenbank would be far too dangerous: "I've already been robbed four times, I don't want a fifth!" said the bank manager.
Most clients would understand and switch to other forms of investment.
Only a few migrated to other banks.
The Bavarian Cooperative Association stated: 'The extreme monetary policy stance of the ECB is causing considerable costs for all banks.'
The Commission's proposal to introduce a new system for the collection of data on the use of the Internet is not yet in force.
Some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account management, credit cards or bank transfers.
The Thuringian Volks- und Raiffeisenbank Altenburger Land with its Skatbank branch made headlines in 2014 with penalty interest on deposits from three million euros.
Michael Kemmer, CEO of the Banking Association, said: "We don't expect private customers to have to pay a comprehensive deposit fee, and the competition in Germany between banks and savings banks is far too strong".
A banker said that there is "a clientele on Lake Tegernsee that is a little more affluent".
"That can be a problem for a small bank" if it keeps money for free.
The cooperative bank Gmund, founded in 1911, has branches in Bad Wiessee, Rottach-Egern, Kreuth and Tegernsee.
The region is home to well-known actors, sportsmen and entrepreneurs.
The Bavarian Cooperative Association "is not currently aware of any other banks that charge a deposit premium for deposits from private customers", said spokesman Ernst.
The President of the Federal Association of German Banks and Raiffeisenbanken (BVR), Uwe Fröhlich, had stated at the end of June: "The threshold for going negative towards the private customer is very, very high".
The Commission has also been asked to provide a detailed description of the measures taken to ensure that the new rules are implemented.
The customers in Germany will not be pleased with this in general.
Destination records: who actually buys records?
Lonely middle-aged men like records.
Before you rush to the comments section to smear it with harsh insults under the pseudonym NotAllSinglesMiddle-Aged, this statement is based on current data.
According to YouGov, the much-talked-about resurgence of records is not due to a boom in millennials who want to welcome the novelty of physical items, but to midlife nostalgia.
Those who have recently bought a record are most likely between the ages of 45 and 54.
In fact, the 18-24 age group is the least likely buyer.
It is also not a hobbyist-collecting horde - it has an emotional meaning: older record buyers are more likely to keep their feelings to themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).
But are YouGov's results correct?
If this blog was a television news story, the camera would follow me as I walk down a busy Soho street, wearing a modest gray suit and driving wildly before I stop, hold my hands and say something definitive like, "Well, let's take a closer look at this".
So, let's take a look at that.
Although the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm - hotels, restaurants, and offices now fill the buildings that once housed independent salesmen - there are still a handful of fantastic record shops.
I would probably ask the cameraman to turn off the camera for the next part, where I'm standing in close proximity to different men in such shops, trying to gauge their age and temperament by observation.
Stuart, 55, from Glasgow, whom I follow from Sister Ray (data: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (data: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably in her 20s), is in London for a day meeting and going to the shops to fill the few hours.
Is he a collector, I ask?
"I guess so", he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These records, pictured above (he emailed me the snapshot, I didn't follow him home), line the walls of his living room.
The reason he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his disposable income: he is now able to buy records he could not afford when they came out and to buy again items he sold when he was young and broke.
"A lot of the stuff I buy is from the late '60s, early '70s, that came out when I was 11 or 12, stuff that I was probably a little too young to buy", he says.
He agrees that those who buy records are more likely to be introverts and to enjoy being alone, adding: "I don't smoke and I don't drink very much.
That's my truck.
Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many of the clients he meets match the YouGov profile.
But he also noticed a new wave of people being influenced by the media hype, people who heard about the comeback and were moved to buy their old records again.
In the conversations I've had, people usually get rid of their collection around 1998 or 1999.
Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their records again", he says.
That would explain the boom in record revivalists of a certain age.
But what about the supposed emotional meaning of records?
It only takes a few seconds in a store like Phonica to realize that record stores offer a reassuring community of like-minded people.
According to Wez, some of the older customers were offended by the contactless payment system.
Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar record covers, to objects that evoke happy youthful memories.
"I think sometimes it can be filling a void or having material possessions as a form of comfort", says Wez.
That's how it is for me as a collector, and I think it's the same for a lot of people.
It's an easy way to engage your mind.
"We're like their social workers!" a coworker shouts from a stack of records.
An ICM survey in April revealed that almost 50% of people who bought a record last month had not listened to it.
The survey also found that 41% own a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record do not own a record player.
At this point in the news report, I would probably look very concerned as I flip through a stack of bossa nova compilations.
Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe, has noted a "trophy aspect" of the revival.
"Someone recently came in and said, 'I don't own a record player, but I'd like to buy a Radiohead record so I can put it on the shelf,'" he says.
This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.
More product-heavy, less music-heavy.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player".
These are younger people, not older ones, who are just slowly coming in.
Fopp, who has devoted almost an entire floor to the record, has a more colorful audience than I enter.
There are couples in their 70s, tourists taking pictures, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
Although the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the aforementioned stores - Wild Beasts' latest synth- and sex-packed pop is thundering from the speakers instead of experimental jazz - it is good to see such diversity among the customers.
None of them look particularly lonely, but nagging psychological trauma is hard to detect when you're standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been walking around the store for a few minutes, looking at the variety of records on sale.
She's more likely to do a window shopping than a wholesale shopping.
She doesn't make much money, so record collecting isn't a real option, she says.
It's expensive.
It's easy to listen to music from a computer or any other way, but the beauty of records is"... she sighs with a sigh of love.
I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.
My final stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: Urban Outfitters.
While I pretend to sample the jeans hot pants, I watch a group of young teenage girls group around Polaroid cameras for a moment before a father and daughter decide to buy a Crosley record player.
On the left is a stairwell, a wall full of records by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential records for an average collection.
No one looks at them -- maybe because they're purely decorative, some so high up that it's impossible to touch them.
It's all recording art.
But considering that any attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and send some customers to the depths of Soho for more, there's nothing to complain about.
It is not surprising that a population group that has more time and money than others is also the one that spends the most on luxury items like plates.
And even though my research found that YouGov's findings are correct, at least in record stores in Soho, they ignore the large number of female collectors and record lovers that exist in the real world, in record stores and online forums.
These people probably work hard at school or in offices.
You certainly won't spend your Thursday morning wandering through Berwick Street record stores and flipping through records while avoiding the staring gaze of a creepy, 30-year-old fake anchorman who's poking around unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Greenland shark is the longest-living vertebrate - Video
Scientists say that the Greenland shark has the longest life span of any vertebrate on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, a shark researcher, says the record was held by a female, believed to be between 272 and 512 years old and five meters long
French court rejects offer to demolish shops in jungle refugee camp
A French court has rejected an offer by Calais authorities to demolish dozens of makeshift shops and restaurants in the Calais jungle, home to thousands of refugees.
At a court hearing this week, Calais authorities argued that the state should be able to demolish 72 makeshift shops where people inside the camp sell goods ranging from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer hairdressing services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in makeshift restaurants.
The prefecture of Calais argued that these sites should be demolished because they would represent a parallel economy, from which no taxes would be paid and which would pose a fire and health risk.
Humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important because the free meals provided by the state-backed association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.
They also pointed out that the makeshift shops and restaurants would often provide accommodation and free meals for people in need.
A court in Lille ruled that there was no legal basis for the expulsion of people who ran the 72 temporary shops, but admitted that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais were "absolutely understandable".
Judge Jean-François Molla said that the grocery stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role than simply feeding people who "live in extremely precarious conditions".
He said the areas provide quiet meeting places for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places threatened by the collapse was the camp's nonprofit Jungle Book Kids' Café, which provides 200 meals a day, English and French classes, and asylum counseling for the hundreds of vulnerable unaccompanied minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed the petition to save the Kids' Café.
A letter to the Guardian said that closing the school would be "a disaster for these children, the youngest of whom is eight".
The two aid organizations Help Refugees and L'Auberge des migrants estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle camp had risen to over 9,000 - the highest number ever - after a sharp increase in new arrivals over the summer.
Despite the disappointment of the Olympics, Martin remains a fighter
Despite his disappointing performance in the Olympic time trial, professional cyclist Tony Martin is not going to let himself be undermined.
"I will keep my eyes on the World Cup, remain confident and keep fighting", the 31-year-old wrote on Facebook on Thursday before leaving Rio de Janeiro.
He has no explanation for his miserable 12th place finish in the Sugar Bowl.
"I find it hard to comment on yesterday's time trial", said Martin.
He must calmly analyse the reasons that led to the debacle.
At the World Time Trial in Qatar in October, Martin actually wanted to fight for the title.
"I'm going to take a closer look at everything we've changed lately".
"My position is also included", wrote the three-time world time trial champion, who lost the 54.5-kilometer race on Wednesday by more than three minutes to Olympic champion Fabian Cancellara (Switzerland).
Olympic: Tennis pro Siegemund missed the semifinals
Laura Siegemund's winning streak ended in the quarterfinals of Rio: the world ranked 32nd from Metzingen missed by a 1:6, 1:6 against Monica Puig (Puerto Rico/WTA-No.
34) the semi-final of the Olympic tennis tournament.
Siegemund, who was plagued by back problems, was only able to make her throw once and seemed powerless compared to the previous rounds.
On Thursday, the eventual medalist Angelique Kerber (Kiel/No. 2) had the chance to jump into the preliminary round.
The Australian Open winner was joined by Briton Johanna Konta (No. 10).
As the last German tennis professional, Tommy Haas had won a medal (silver) in Sydney in 2000.
Two German DTB starters in the quarterfinals of the Summer Games had last been in 1992.
Never before has a German duo been in an Olympic singles semi-final.
The Group is stepping up its start-up activities in the field of live video game broadcasting
Watching other people play video games is a huge trend - and Microsoft wants to take advantage of it.
The tech giant is buying the startup Beam, which specializes in this hobby.
Microsoft did not disclose how much money is involved in the acquisition on Thursday.
Beam launched its service in January and has already over 100,000 users.
You can watch others play, but you can also intervene.
For example, they can assign missions to players and confront enemies and provide equipment.
The gaming giant Activision Blizzard is launching a new HD video service for the booming world of esports.
Facebook is supposed to help on the way to the global media event.
The advertising industry is already listening.
The employees of the startup, which has been based in Seattle, Washington, are moving to Microsoft's headquarters in Redmond, California, Beam co-founder and CEO Matt Salsamendi said.
The acquisition will not change anything for customers.
Beam is being integrated into the video game division around the Xbox console, according to Microsoft.
The market for live streaming of video game activities is currently growing rapidly.
Well-known platforms are Twitch and YouTube Gaming.
Twitch was bought by online retailer Amazon in 2014 - for almost a billion dollars.
YouTube Gaming is owned by Google's parent company Alphabet.
Here comes the enforcement trailer
Germany's speedometers must be prepared for the next generation of speedometers: in various federal states, including Hesse and Brandenburg, new flash devices are being tested to transmit speed sensors particularly effectively.
The futuristic enforcement trailers from Vitronic, a company based in Wiesbaden, can be used, for example, at accident hotspots where it would be too dangerous for mobile police measurement.
For example, on motorway construction sites or bridges undergoing renovation with temporary speed limits, there is often no infrastructure to ensure that the speed limit is respected with a stationary flash.
However, a permanent mobile setup can be too dangerous or expensive.
The Enforcement Trailer is self-sufficient: its battery lasts five days with continuous measurement operation, and the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem.
Laser measurement technology can also be used to detect all vehicles on multiple lanes at the same time.
Variable speed limits and traffic bans by time, lane and vehicle class can also be monitored.
The manufacturer says that any car with a trailer clutch can move the trailer in high gear.
To prevent it from being stolen, it is lowered during measurement, so that the wheels disappear in the armored and incidentally bulletproof outer shell.
The Blitz has also been equipped with an alarm system to protect it from vandalism.
According to Vitronic, the trailer has been tested in various German states since 2015 and is now also being used.
Foreign authorities are also thrilled with the new technology: France recently ordered 100 of them, after ordering 150 last year.
Great Britain take silver in rugby sevens after Fiji Masterclass takes gold
Great Britain's impressive performance in the Rugby World Cup final came to an abrupt halt in the final hurdle on Thursday night in the form of Fiji, when they were beaten 43-7 at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji won a championship in handling, side-stepping, backflow, line running and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any color.
The defeat was sweetened by the not-so-bad consolation prize of silver - Britain's fourth that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament, where they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The Boks' dramatic loss, 7-5 in the semi-final on the same day, could spill over into the final.
But regardless, Fiji would have beaten a 15-man team in top form at that level.
It might be a comfort to Britain - but probably won't be - that at least one Briton will have a gold medal around his neck tomorrow: Fiji's head coach Ben Ryan, the former England boss from Wimbledon.
Britain had a difficult road ahead.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game to the Adelaide Sevens.
They only lost one here.
This is gonna hurt, but the progress is amazing.
Fiji started off wonderfully, bouncing off the British attacks for fun.
It felt like running into a moving bus for Captain Tom Mitchell and Co. as the World Series winners went 5-0 up when Osea Kolinisau overshot them in the corner.
With four minutes left in the game, Jerry Tuwai delivered another right-handed corner attack, which he converted.
12-0 and GB barely touched the ball.
A superb tackle by Mitchell stopped the mountain from manning by Leone Nakarawa to score a third goal, but it only stopped Fiji.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua scored a touchdown in the right corner and it was 0-17 for GB.
Nakarawa added another since the restart and there was still over a minute left in the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou pressed through another weak tackle from the GB team and rushed to the line to score a goal.
The conversion brought a 29-0 lead to halftime.
It's like Fiji was born to play the seven while Britain is still learning.
That's the way it is.
GB made fundamental changes in the half and closed the Fijian gap...for a full four minutes, which was good for the first half conditions until Joshua Tuisova went through after a brilliant intermission play from Fiji.
Dan Norton started a try for GB, scoring a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game was long in favour of the South Sea Islanders, whose fans sang, waved flags and danced in the stands.
It was not difficult to admire Fiji's playful approach.
Mata Viliame set the i-tip with another try in the final seconds.
The whistle sounded, the Fijians embraced, and the British kicked the grass in a devastating way.
Earlier in the day, Fiji had defeated Japan 20-5 in the semi-final and Britain had pushed South Africa out of the race in a close semi-final match - Britain's conversion of the gap.
Kyle Brown led the boxes in the first half, but Dan Norton broke through the line with an impressive footwork and scored a goal under the post in the second half.
A brilliant late tackle by Marcus Watson, brother of Anthony of the England 15-a-side team, secured the win - and thus the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired to win by their trainer's battle with cancer
There's not gonna be more emotional gold than at these games, and that's a big deal.
From the first row to the last 220 hard hives that will go down in history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found added meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.
Even though it was just the two of them at the helm, there were three voices in the boat, the echo of coach Robin Williams, who was all around as they rowed for their second consecutive Olympic gold in the double without a helmswoman, the first women in British sport to set such a standard.
Their dominance was absolute, their 39th undefeated effort, which is also unprecedented.
What we see are two brilliant female athletes gliding across the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not fully reflect the nature of the triumph.
Behind every gold in the row is a battalion of willing volunteers who contribute to the incremental progress that makes the difference, and no one was more helpful than the coach who didn't know if he'd even survive that day 30 months ago when he was diagnosed with cancer.
Like he said, he's a risk.
I had bladder cancer that could be operated on, and they did.
If you don't, it'll spread everywhere.
It would have been a pretty bad situation.
It changes the outlook a little bit.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio was lucky to be able to begin treatment in early 2014, off-season, which kept the interruption to a minimum, if that's even the right term under the circumstances.
I needed money, so I had to get better soon.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital, walking around the ward -- 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time, when they said a few steps would do.
That's how it starts.
Rowing is a challenge in itself, but that makes it even more challenging.
In the immediate aftermath of the victory, their first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nerve-wracking morning talking a little more than usual, trying to process his own fears.
Stanning, who was a captain in the Royal Artillery Regiment in Afghanistan, said, "I was an emotional wreck this week.
It just repeats how much this means to me, how much Helen and I and Robin have worked.
It was three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we'd be nothing, so a big thank you to him.
I couldn't have asked for a better person to train with or a better coach.
Helena Glover and Heather Stanning haven't lost a race in five years.
The pair had a hard rhythm that their opponents couldn't keep up with.
Even in the final 500 metres, as the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to close in, Stanning and Glover had too much to spare.
We were very caught up in the moment.
Helen called out, "Stay in the process, stay in the process".
It's really important not to get carried away.
We got off to a good start and at the same time we weren't looking to do anything great.
We didn't want to fireworks tonight, we just wanted to score a good score, go out there and win the race, which we did.
The couple will take a year off before making decisions about their future.
Glover has to appear at a wedding next week, her own with TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say that was my last race.
That would have put too much pressure on me.
It took me about six months in London to realize I was an Olympic champion.
It was all so new to me and I was so stressed.
This one took about four minutes.
It feels so much better", she said.
31 Years of Exemplary Clarity
The director of the water association "Veitensteingruppe", Ruppert Göller, is retiring.
The association is considered "exemplary throughout Bavaria".
A small drinking water association in Frankish towns, a model for the big water producers.
The Commission has not yet decided on the future of the Community.
A little later, the Water Forum of the government of Lower Franconia recognized the purpose of the association.
The work of the Veitensteingruppe is considered "exemplary throughout Bavaria".
The main reason for this is that the company has been in business for 31 years, 28 of them as a manager.
Now he has been retired at the age of 65.
The drinking water association of Veitensteingruppe, based in Kottendorf, Breitbrunn, produces about 150000 cubic metres of water annually and supplies 32 villages with about 5500 inhabitants.
Member municipalities are the municipalities of Kirchlauter, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the city of Baunach.
Other cities and municipalities have water supply contracts.
The current chairman, Gertrud Bühl (FW), mayor of Breitbrunn, recalled that Rupert Göller was hired as a water guard in 1985 and was appointed as managing director of the association in 1988.
"His duties were very varied and ranged from waterworks construction and maintenance to office and organisational work, budgeting, calculating fees and contributions to emergency work on weekends", said the chairman.
She highlighted the commissioning and inauguration of the new wells (1994), the purchase of land in the area of the new wells (1998) and compensation for farmers, the refurbishment of the reservoirs (1999), the purchase of a new central computer control (2004) and the partial renewal of water pipes.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to ionising radiation.
In her laudatio she praised Göller's faithful, reliable and correct service over 31 years.
He has been very active in his water association and he has lived his water association as if it were his own company.
A few weeks ago, he was given the opportunity to present the success of the Veitensteing Group's nitrate reduction concept at the Water Forum of the Lower Franconia region.
He has received much recognition and praise for this.
Rupert Göller, for his part, praised waterman Alfons Griebel, who had worked with him for 28 years.
He's the best lifeguard and he was a loyal servant.
Together, we were an unbeatable team.
He described the construction of the well and the restructuring of the association as highlights.
The biggest challenge and the most difficult operation was the rupture of the pipe at the high tank at Kirchlauter on 3 January.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to this effect.
The supply of Neubrunn was also once maintained only because the tank was filled with hoses from Pettstadt.
The management of the drinking water association was handed over to Daniel Stürmer from Lauter, who succeeds Rupert Göller.
Soprano Anna Netrebko is open about her son Tiago's autism - and she appeals to other parents who are affected: "You have to have the courage to talk about it".
"Medicine has made great strides", the 44-year-old told the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera.
When her son was diagnosed with the disease, she thought she was going to die.
But Tiago, now eight, has made good progress and is now in private school in New York, where the best therapists are available.
"To give an example: if I ask him something that happened two years ago when I sang at La Scala in Milan, he remembers nothing", Netrebko said.
But he's the luckiest man in the world.
Tiago is from Netrebko's connection with the bass baritone Erwin Schrott.
She is now married to the tenor Yusif Eyvazov.
Relationship in Bargteheide - Man shoots his wife
A 35-year-old man shot and killed his partner at 10.45am on Friday in a multi-family house in Bargteheide, Stormarn County.
"The man called us himself and said he had shot his wife", said a police spokeswoman.
The perpetrator is on the run and is being sought publicly.
It's now nationwide, because Sven S. could be driving.
The man is about six feet tall, muscular, tan, and bald.
Meanwhile, the police have released a photo of him.
It's a few years old, though.
The man is now bald.
I don't want you to talk to the man directly.
He's still capable of carrying the gun, police say.
If you see Sven S, call 110.
The police are talking about an "act of relationship".
Victim was born in 1988, perpetrator in 1981.
The police in Lübeck initially refused to give details of the crime or the relationship between the perpetrator and the victim, but confirmed that one person had been killed.
"This is a homicide".
"We are not saying more at the moment", said a police spokeswoman in Lübeck.
According to eyewitnesses, a Special Operations Command (SEK) was at the scene.
- Steel vision for the German steel industry
The crisis-ridden and energy-intensive German steel industry is spared additional costs in the millions.
The financial burden that threatened the industry from green power promotion is off the table.
The exemption from the renewable energy levy on existing plants for the so-called self-generation of electricity in the German steel industry will remain, said Federal Minister of Economics Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) to the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" (WAZ, Friday edition).
"I am really happy that after two years of tough negotiations we have finally reached this".
The European Commission had therefore initially planned to charge steel producers who use gas from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption.
The steel industry was facing additional costs of EUR 120 to 240 million per year, according to the German industry association.
Gabriel told WAZ that there was now agreement in principle with the EU Commission after talks with Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.
The EEG surcharge of 20% will only apply if the generators in the steelworks are replaced.
But even this is not levied in the steel industry.
IG Metall welcomed the agreement reached by Germany with the EU Commission on the generation of electricity from its own resources.
This largely confirms the status quo of the previous system.
The successful efforts of Gabriel for the steel industry are of particular importance.
"This is the first step in our 'Steel is the Future' campaign".
"More must follow".
"Climate and employment objectives must also be balanced when reforming emissions trading", IG Metall CEO Jörg Hofmann said in Frankfurt.
The steel industry in Europe has been suffering from overcapacity and significant price pressure since the 2008 financial crisis.
Last year, the situation worsened further when China, the world's largest producer, dumped steel on the world market in large quantities in response to weakening domestic demand.
European producers accuse Chinese steel companies of dumping.
During this spring the situation has eased somewhat.
On the one hand, import duties on imported steel are having an effect and on the other hand, the economic outlook in China has improved.
It is unclear how sustainable the price recovery is.
The German industry leader Thyssenkrupp remained cautious on Thursday.
Last time, prices would have been stagnant again.
The industry is responding to the difficult situation with further cost cuts.
Thyssenkrupp did not rule out the closure of individual plants.
The Commission notes that the German authorities have not provided any evidence that the aid was granted in breach of Article 107 (1) TFEU.
In July, German steel producers remain cautious despite rising prices and increasing orders.
They produced 3.4 million tons, a good six percent less crude steel than in the same month last year, the Steel Association announced on Friday.
After a brief increase in May, the volume produced fell for the second month in a row.
Since the beginning of the year, production has been two percent below the previous year's level.
The association expects an increase in output in the coming months, thanks to an improved order situation.
Community, Mind, Health: Singing is Good for Seniors
Singing has accompanied Ursel Kipp all her life: as a young girl she was in the school choir, in the teacher's study she took the music subject, and today the 78-year-old singer in a senior choir.
"Singing moves me - emotionally and physically", she says.
After a rehearsal, she says, she feels balanced, cheerful, and overall more alive.
And she's doing her health and her mind good, by the way.
Because singing is a great hobby for seniors in many ways, says Erhard Hackler of the German Senior League.
Most seniors sing in choirs and share the joy of music with others of the same age, Hackler says.
Regular social gatherings help older ones to establish and maintain social contacts.
Because social and family structures often dissolve with age, a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.
This is what Ursel Kipp has experienced in her choir: "To agree and organize, to be able to rely on others and to learn from one another - a choir is a very special form of togetherness".
Singing can be stressful in a positive sense, says Hackler.
Because it's how seniors practice deep, controlled breathing.
If you regularly exercise your lungs, you won't get out of breath so quickly in everyday life.
Even if it is about keeping the sound of the voice in old age, singing is an optimal hobby.
Singing often has a very special effect on older people, says Ursula Lenz of the Federal Association of Senior Citizens' Organizations.
In the older generations, singing together was much more important, part of everyday life, both in school and in leisure, she explains.
Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs brings back many memories in older people, often associated with positive feelings of youth.
Even people with dementia can recall events from long ago through lyrics and especially melodies.
Singing also requires a special effort on the part of the head, Lenz explains.
Concentrating on your own voice and a given rhythm while adapting to the other singers is a big cognitive challenge.
Especially older people who live alone practice not focusing on themselves.
Another positive aspect is the recognition you get from singing in the choir, Hackler says.
An enthusiastic audience is a great compliment.
Singing in the choir also increases self-esteem.
Showing myself: If I practice for a long time, I get better and grow beyond myself - this experience strengthens.
There are good reasons to start singing, so there are plenty.
Lenz advises that those who want to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if they think they have little talent.
You don't sing alone. With 50 people singing, who can hear if a note goes wrong?
In their search for the right offer, senior citizens have a variety of options, Hackler says.
If someone you know is singing in a senior choir, you can just join.
Many cities also offer overviews of the choirs in the area.
If you want to sing in a church choir, you can contact the congregation or the church leader directly.
Many senior choirs are also available online.
If you do not have access to the Internet, you can ask your family, friends or neighbors for help with your Internet search.
If you feel like singing, join a choir, Hackler advises.
Singing is good for the soul and has something liberating - this is true for all ages.
Cats are more sensitive to the cries of young animals than are cats
Biologists in Hanover have studied the effect of the cries of kittens on adult animals.
To their surprise, the meowing did not stop the males either - but unlike the females, they always behaved the same.
Female cats can tell the degree of excitement of kittens by the meowing of the young.
They respond ten percent faster to the sounds of cats who feel in dire need, scientists at the University of Veterinary Medicine and the University of Medicine in Hanover (MHH) found.
Cats respond to the calls of kittens, but they always respond the same way.
"It seems that the acoustic differences between the meow of less excited and highly excited young animals are either not noticeable or not significant to the males", said biologist Wiebke Konerding of the MHH.
She is the lead author of the study, which was published this Friday in the journal BMC Evolutionary Biology.
In a previous study, the research team had already found that the duration and tone of the kitten's cries differed with the urgency of their need for help.
A total of nine adult cats and eight female cats from the MHH's livestock farm were observed.
They were given the calls of little ones taken from the litter box for three minutes and separated from their mother and siblings.
Second, they were confronted with screams from more excited kittens, which were raised up.
The researchers consider their results meaningful despite the small sample size.
"All females, even those that had no offspring of their own, responded differently to the screams", Konerding said.
They turned to the speaker faster when the call of the more excited kittens played.
This ability may be inborn or develop with sexual maturity.
"One surprise was that the males responded at all", said the biologist.
In the past, scientists have repeatedly studied the reactions of women and men to baby sounds in humans.
Again, some studies have shown that women are more sensitive to infants, whether they have already been mothers or not, reports biologist Marina Scheumann.
Podolski reaches the Super Cup with "Gala"
Hakan Sükür is a football legend in Turkey.
In Turkey, an arrest warrant has been issued for former football star Hakan Sükür.
He is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
For the first time since the coup attempt, an important football match will be held in Turkey.
Before the match between Besiktas Istanbul and Lukas Podolskis Galatasaray Istanbul for the Super Cup in Konya, the official line is clear: "Business as usual" is in order.
The government has already declared a state of emergency after the coup attempt in July, insisting that ordinary people's daily lives should not be affected.
This does not apply to those suspected of belonging to the movement of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is blamed for the coup attempt.
And they're not stopping before football.
The prosecutor's office issued a warrant for the arrest of former Starkicker Hakan Sükür.
According to the report, Sükür, who now lives in America, is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
Sükür is said to be a supporter of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is blamed by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for the coup attempt.
The state of emergency, which was initially imposed for 90 days, will remain in force until October, but in fact it has little impact on the lives of most Turks.
The nightly "democracy watches" in public squares across the country were declared over by Erdogan on Wednesday.
The sport, like the whole country, is divided into supporters and opponents of Erdogan.
Especially fans of the Besiktas Workers' Club are not traditionally considered friends of the president.
The Turkish people, however, are united by their strong opposition to military coups, given the dramatic experiences of history.
Even the fans agree - whether their hearts beat for Galatasaray or Besiktas.
The most important thing for the winner of the Gala Cup is Lukas Podolski.
The 31-year-old finished his first season as the club's top scorer with 17 goals and nine assists in all competitions.
In the final against Fenerbahce, he scored the winning goal of 1:0.
The newspaper "Fanatik" hailed him as "the best on the court".
He finished the season in an excellent way and secured the trophy for his team.
Thanks to "Poldi", the disappointing season for the record champion came to a peaceful end.
After the preliminary knockout in the Champions League, the "Lions" also left early in the Europa League.
In the Super League, it was only enough to finish sixth.
The season wasn't good.
The trophy was the only way to win anything.
"We have done that and that is the most important thing", Podolski said.
The year was better for the champion Besiktas.
Especially thanks to Mario Gomez, who set the stage for the 14th Super League title with 26 goals.
That's why fans are still hoping for the 31-year-old's return.
Gomez, who was under contract with AC Florence and was only on loan to Besiktas after the coup attempt, had announced that he would not return to the country after his European Championship vacation due to the political situation.
"If Mario wants to come to us, he just has to say so", club president Fikret Orman was quoted as saying by the magazine "Kicker".
But the striker would have to be willing to forgo about a third of his annual salary, estimated at €7.5 million, Orman said.
Despite doping, these athletes still have a chance at a medal at the Rio Olympics.
The 34-year-old Justin Gatlin has already been suspended twice for doping (2001 and 2006).
Rio de Janeiro - Whistleblower Julia Stepanowa is not allowed to run in Rio.
Other convicted athletic offenders can only laugh at this - they are fighting for medals in Rio.
The issue of doping continues to dominate the headlines at the Rio Olympics.
The Russian swimmer Yulia Yefimova, who had been banned for doping shortly before the games, was mercilessly whipped and booed at her start (100 meters breast).
A strange scene ensued: With a smile on her face, she was still struggling in the hall and had provoked with her performance.
When it was determined that she would not get gold, the audience burst into a cheer.
But there are many other athletes who, despite a history of doping, compete in the Rio Olympics.
Here 's a rundown .
Justin Gatlin (100, 200, 4x100-meter relay/USA): The 34-year-old is one of the most controversial figures in athletics.
He was suspended twice for doping (2001 and 2006 to 2010).
Since his spell, the 2004 Olympic champion and former world champion has run even faster than before, he is the world number one over 100 meters in 9.80 seconds and is considered the greatest challenger of Usain Bolt.
Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce (100, 4x100-meter relay/Jamaica): The two-time Olympic champion and seven-time world champion was banned for six months in 2010 after testing positive for the painkiller oxycodone.
She had severe toothache after surgery, the 29-year-old defended herself.
Sandra Perkovic (discussion/Croatia): In 2011, the 2012 Olympic champion, 2013 World champion and 2010-2016 European champion tested positive for the banned stimulant methylhexanamine.
Perkovic denied knowingly taking the drug and was suspended for six months.
The four farthest shots this year go to the big gold favorite.
LaShawn Merritt (200, 400, 4x400-m relay/USA): The Beijing Olympic champion and two-time 400 m world champion, was tested positive in 2010 and banned for 21 months.
A penis enlargement product was responsible, Merritt claimed.
This year, the 30-year-old 200m and 400m runner is the fastest man in the world.
Ivan Tikhon (hammer throw, Belarus): Hardly any athlete has been stripped of so many medals.
So Tichon lost his 2005 World Championship title nine years later after he was diagnosed with testosterone doping.
The now 40-year-old also had to forfeit his Olympic silver medal in 2004 for steroid doping and his European Championship title in 2006 for testosterone abuse.
He also lost the bronze medal at the 2008 Olympics, but was reinstated by the International Court of Justice (CAS).
With 80.04 m, he is ranked second in the world ranking.
Liu Hong (20km walking, China): The world record holder and gold favorite tested positive in May, but is still allowed to race in Rio.
The 29-year-old world champion was found to have taken a banned dietary supplement, and the ban by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) was mild and expired on July 13.
Bomb attack in Thailand - Austrian woman injured - Several dead
The Austrian embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman, Foreign Ministry spokesman Thomas Schnöll said Friday morning.
She had suffered cuts and was being treated in hospital but had already been able to leave.
She said she was planning to go home in early September.
It was not immediately clear whether the further explosions on the holiday island of Phuket and in the southern cities of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon also affected Austrian citizens.
The Foreign Ministry is in constant contact with the local authorities, Schnöll said.
In Hua Hin, about 200 kilometers south of the capital Bangkok, two bombs exploded in a neighborhood on Thursday evening.
The police said a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.
On Friday morning, two more explosions exploded, killing another person, authorities said.
A bomb explosion was also reported from Phuket this morning.
Police said a taxi driver was injured in the explosion near Patong beach, a popular beach for holidaymakers.
In Surat Thani, on the country's southeastern coast, another bomb exploded, killing a municipal worker.
The authorities said the explosion occurred in a flowerbed outside the coastguard station.
The Commission has also received information from the United States that the United States has been involved in the chemical weapons proliferation in the region.
It was said that the explosion was linked to the Hua Hin bombing.
"The bombings are written in the same handwriting", Army General Danai Kritmethavee told reporters Friday morning.
"We believe this is a coordinated attack".
It is too early to comment on possible motives, but it is likely that the acts were carried out by Muslim rebels.
Thai media also wanted to see a pattern in the attacks, typical of the bombings by Muslim separatists in the south of the country.
The Thai police, however, said the attacks were not linked to the Islamist insurgency or international terrorism.
"This is only local sabotage, limited to limited areas and provinces", a spokesman in Bangkok said.
It is more likely that the bombs were planted by opponents of the ruling military junta.
Authorities have received intelligence in recent days about imminent attacks in the south of the country, but have not been informed of the exact time and place.
It's not clear which group is behind the attacks.
Police have ordered officials across the country to increase security around key government buildings, as well as airports, train stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.
There are frequent small bombings in Thailand, but they are not usually directed at tourists.
In Hua Hin is a palace that was used for years by Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej.
Following the recent bombings, the Austrian Foreign Ministry recommends on its website that the instructions of the Thai security authorities be strictly followed.
High security risk (security level 3) for the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla and Preah Vihear and surrounding areas.
The government has warned against unnecessary travel to these provinces after clashes between security forces and Muslim populations.
High security risk (security level 2) applies to the rest of the country.
The attacks on Thursday and Friday came just days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drafted by the military junta.
This will give the military a great deal of influence in the years ahead.
Junta chief and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombings were an attempt to create chaos as the country moves towards stability, economic improvement and tourism.
The military junta, which seized power in 2014 after a period of bloody unrest, credits itself with restoring stability and order to the kingdom.
However, the military has also failed to contain the Muslim rebellion that has been simmering for years in the far south of the country.
More than 6,500 people have already been killed in the conflict.
In Bangkok, a year ago, an attack on a popular Hindu shrine killed 20 people, most of them foreign tourists.
It was the bloodiest attack in the country's recent history.
The right-wing Identitarian Movement has been targeted by the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution.
The group has also been monitored by the Federal Constitutional Defenders, following several state offices.
"We see in the 'Identitarian Movement' evidence of efforts against the free democratic basic order", said the head of the German constitutional protectionist Hans-Georg Maaßen to the German Press Agency in Berlin.
For example, immigrants of the Islamic faith or from the Middle East are defamed in an extremist way.
That's why we're watching the movement now.
The "Identitarian Movement" is a group with French roots that has been active in Germany since 2012.
It is against "multicultural mania", "uncontrolled mass immigration" and "the loss of one's identity through over-alienation".
The "identitarian" are already being watched by constitutional defenders in nine German states - Bremen, Bavaria, Hesse, Berlin, Baden-Württemberg, NRW, Lower Saxony, Saxony and Thuringia.
Maaßen said his authority had closely coordinated with the state offices in making the decision.
"Groups like the Identitarian Movement are trying to pick up their target group where it is", the head of the constitutional protectionist said.
Generally, extremists try to address them in youthful language, often with pop music.
Islamists would do that, as would right-wing extremists.
This is not a publicity stunt for your cause.
The propaganda is to appeal to people emotionally.
Young people are particularly vulnerable.
It's dangerous. I'm not going to.
Recently, there had been reports from several German states of contacts between the "Identitarians" and AfD politicians.
Maassen said he had no evidence of that.
The Commission considers that the Commission's decision to initiate the procedure is not in itself justified.
The main thing is whether the party concerned - in this case the AfD - is changed and becomes extremist by certain extremist individuals.
The decisive issue is whether such persons have a leading influence on the party.
This is not apparent.
In view of the marked increase in law-based crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee shelters, Mr Maaßen said he would not be speaking of a new right-wing terrorism in this context.
But we have seen in recent years that there can be right-wing terrorist structures.
There was the group Old School Society or the Freitaler Group.
It is quite possible that other right-wing terrorist groups or micro-groups may be formed, planning attacks against asylum seekers, refugee camps or other attacks for extreme right-wing motives.
The Commission has not yet adopted a decision on the application of the directive.
The previous groups had been created at regional level or in social networks.
Maassen expressed concern that many of the attacks were carried out by people who had not previously appeared in the right scene.
That's the worrying part.
Many of the suspects in the attacks on asylum facilities were not previously known as criminals, politically motivated offenders or right-wingers.
"So many people have committed crimes that were not previously associated with right-wing extremists, who may have been politically indifferent or voted for the CDU, SPD or left, for example, but then radicalised themselves by creating a right-wing extremist mood".
Rio 2016: Robel Kiros Habte becomes an internet hit
Not always are the Olympics or world records the headlines at the Olympics.
This is demonstrated by the courageous performance of Robel Kiros Habte at the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.
At the Aquatics Center, the slightly overweight swimmer from Ethiopia swam so slowly that he was temporarily not seen on TV.
He just disappeared, no matter how far the clip was chosen.
In the social networks, Habte subsequently became a viral Internet hit.
In fact, the 24-year-old finished 48 seconds behind his lead and placed 59th out of 59 starters.
But it was his not-so-sporting figure that attracted international media attention.
Why is the 24-year-old still competing in the Olympics?
The Ethiopian was given a special start by the International Swimming Federation.
This is distributed to raise awareness of swimming in underrepresented countries.
Since most athletes in Ethiopia run, I just wanted to do something different.
Preparation is everything, Robel Kiros Habte is getting ready for the big race.
Soon the first nicknames were making the rounds.
Some media called it "the whale's robin".
In reference to a "prosperity belly", the English tabloid The Sun made fun of him with "Dad Bod".
His time, which was only a minute and almost five seconds over the 100-meter freestyle, didn't matter.
Comparisons with "Eric the Eel" have also been drawn.
At the 2000 Sydney Olympics, Eric Moussambani's run attracted media attention.
The swimmer from Equatorial Guinea was unforgettable when he competed alone in a preliminary 100 meter freestyle.
Moussambani was being frantically cheered on back then.
The then 22-year-old had only learned to swim eight months before the Olympics and had never run such a long distance before the competition.

An open-air industrial loft at DTLA is getting a cozy makeover
We're celebrating the 90th anniversary of the Los Angeles Central Library with - what else? - a new book.
The owner of a shop in New Square has been robbed.
According to police, the 67-year-old woman left her shop around 5:30 p.m. on Monday and forgot to close a window on the ground floor.
When she returned the next morning at about 8:15, about $250 had disappeared from the register.
No trace of the perpetrator could be found.
There is no video surveillance.
Trump doesn't see the looming election defeat as a close one.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at a campaign event in Florida.
If the election for the presidency of the United States does not go well, Donald Trump already has an alternative idea.
He's going on vacation.
If Donald Trump loses the US presidential election in November, he would be relatively indifferent: "In the end, it will either work or I will have a very, very nice, long vacation", the Republican candidate said in a telephone interview with the US television channel CNBC.
If it's not enough for him in the end for reasons of political correctness, that's fine, Trump said.
He called US President Barack Obama and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton the founders of the Islamic State (IS) terrorist militia.
Within his party, more and more resistance has recently formed.
Post enters the electric haulage trade
An electric delivery vehicle from the Deutsche Post in action.
Other companies are obviously very interested in the vehicle.
The Postal Service is planning to sell their electric street scooter as well.
The company plans to start trading the van soon.
The Postal Service plans to offer its electric vans on the open car market from next year.
"We want to get into third party sales", a postal spokesman said on Friday.
The company has been considering for months whether to sell its self-developed street scooter, which delivers letters and packages, to other companies.
Postmaster Jürgen Gerdes had said that there were always demands, for example from craftsmen.
According to information from the news magazine Der Spiegel, the Bonn-based group will soon be entering the mass production of the vehicles.
In the post-owned factory, the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and shift.
Gerdes had announced that the group wanted to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and aim to switch completely to environmentally friendly vehicles in the long term.
"We will take a very, very robust step towards 2020", he said at the end of July.
I imagine we'll have to surround the entire fleet.
The StreetScooter has been operating on German roads since 2014.
GfK's management resigns after disappointing sales figures
The consumer research company GfK is replacing its head, Matthias Hartmann.
The resignations came suddenly - but not surprisingly.
The difficult situation of the market research company GfK suggested that the chair of Matthias Hartmann would become even more uncertain the longer the company failed to achieve its promised successes.
Turbulence at the helm of Nuremberg-based market research company GfK: After another disappointing turnover and the resignation of management, the world's number five in the industry is facing a new beginning in terms of staffing.
GfK's CEO wants to leave the company at the end of the year.
The Chairman of the Supervisory Board of GfK, Arno Mahlert, will step down from the Supervisory Board with effect from 12 September.
The company announced that the current board member, Gerhard Hausruckinger, will take over as of 1 September.
He is to officially take over as "chairman" until a successor is found for Hartmann.
The company cited 'different views' on the long-term business policy orientation as the reason for the withdrawals.
A company spokesman declined to give details on Friday.
The Commission has already taken a number of measures to ensure that the market is not affected by the new rules.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to ionising radiation.
Mr Hartmann has been at the helm of GfK since 2011.
"The fruits of the restructuring are not yet visible even after five years", it said.
Given the recent poor GfK sales figures, every shareholder will get restless at some point.
"If BMW did that, the Quandts would do that", they said.
The company was unable to stop its loss making in the second quarter of 2016 after setbacks in the previous quarters.
At EUR 361.2 million, turnover was 6.1 per cent below the level of the comparable quarter of the previous year.
In the first half of the year, sales decreased by 3.4 per cent to EUR 721.2 million.
The profit in the second quarter was mainly affected by the decrease in the company's value in view of its difficult economic situation.
The Group's net loss from the EUR 139 million write-downs in the Consumer Experience business unit was EUR 148.2 million.
In the second quarter of 2015, GfK had made a profit of 19,7 million.
Accidents - Bus slips in a ditch in Krummhorn: Eight injured
In a bus accident involving 43 elderly passengers, eight people were injured in Krummhörn (Aurich county) on Thursday.
Two of the inmates sustained serious injuries, police said.
The 66-year-old driver of a bus from a travel company in Eisenach had to avoid a truck that was partly on the opposite lane.
The bus came off the road to the right and slipped into a ditch, a police spokeswoman told Aurich/Wittmund.
"Because of the bus's location, the people were unable to get off the bus on their own", she said.
The fire department freed the inmates.
Six ambulances and an ambulance arrived at the crash site on State Road 2.
The uninjured passengers were taken by bus back to the Krummhörner district of Pewsum.
There they were to wait for a replacement bus from the travel agency.
Investigators have asked the truck driver and possible witnesses to report to the police.
The fees per cubic metre of waste water will be EUR 3,44 from EUR 2,10 for the Neudorf/Reuth/Welschenkahl waste water treatment plant area from 1 October 2016, EUR 3,36 for Zultenberg/Lindenberg/Lopp (previously EUR 2,26) and EUR 3,64 for Azendorf (previously EUR 2,18).
The waste water charge for the plant in Azendorf will be increased again at the latest when appropriate improvement measures are necessary.
The price of waste water in Azendorf will then be 4,37 euros per cubic metre.
As Mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, when the budget was approved by the Kulmbach County Council Office, it was found that these wastewater treatment plants were under-covered.
The Kasendorf market is legally obliged to operate the plants in a cost-compensating manner.
From 1 October 2016, citizens and businesses in Welschenkahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to put more effort into their pockets.
The increase in fees is between 48 and 67 per cent.
As the Board's managing director, Herbert Schmidt, pointed out to the Board, a recalculation of the charges for the waste water treatment plants of the market community was necessary.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet established the amount of the aid to be recovered from the beneficiary.
The Commission therefore concludes that the aid was not selective and that the aid was not selective.
The low distribution base would, for example, lead to costs of several thousand euros for necessary repairs.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet decided whether the aid is compatible with the internal market.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet received any information on the measures in question.
The plant in Azendorf is almost 30 years old, the plants for Welschenkahl, Neudorf and Reuth and Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp are almost 20 years old.
Schmidt pointed out that the mechanical ventilation system at the Azendorf sewage treatment plant had to be replaced due to a breakdown.
The Welschenkahl pump plant had to overhaul its nearly 20-year-old conveying systems and the Lopp pond treatment plant had to excavate its first sewage pond after almost 20 years of operation, dispose of sewage sludge and install additional ventilation to comply with water regulations in the future.
Schmidt: "In addition to these extraordinary expenses, there are the continuing maintenance and servicing costs which must be taken into account in the new calculation period".
The same applies to electricity costs, which were still well below the current level in the previous calculation in 2011/2012.
Steinhäuser made it clear that the low wastewater level at the three plants meant that the operating and maintenance costs were "above average".
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to ionising radiation.
The situation for the plants mentioned will remain precarious in the long term, Steinhäuser believes, especially since the supply area of the Friesenbachtal Wastewater Association cannot be extended by these plants because they are inadequate facilities.
Bulgaria records inflation for first time in 8 months
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis in July.
This is the highest level since June 2012 and the first above zero since October last year, when a positive 0.2% was recorded.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet established the existence of a significant increase in the number of Union producers in the Union.
The Commission established the profitability of the Union industry by expressing the pre-tax net profit of the sales of the like product to unrelated customers in the Union as a percentage of the turnover of those sales.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet established the existence of any significant distortions of competition in the Union market.
In July 2016, the following groups of consumer goods showed an increase compared to the previous month: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1,7 %); transport (1,8 %); leisure and culture (6,3 %); restaurants and hotels (1,2 %); various goods and services (0,3 %).
Prices fell in clothing and footwear (2.2%); furniture, household appliances and routine maintenance (0.5%); health (0.1%).
Prices remained unchanged for alcohol and tobacco, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communications, and education.
Snapchat's "anime" effect criticized as Asian cartoon
Snapchat says this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it's racially insensitive.
With its filter tool, Snapchat enables its 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in ways that border on the absurd.
You can turn into a pineapple, a dog, or a figure that could be from a Roy Lichtenstein painting.
The filters are blunt, feature-reversing tools that create more than 30 million enhanced selfies a day.
All the wrongs are made public.
Snapchat filters have in the past attracted criticism, accusing the app of promoting blackface or white skin as a beauty ideal.
When it suggested a filter to some users this week that gave them puffy eyes, false teeth and puffy cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asians - "yellowface".
They wondered if these recurring controversies pointed to a larger problem that the company had with diversity.
The news and outrage spread widely on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat announced it had disabled the feature.
The company offered an excuse: the filter was meant to be a tribute to anime characters and not a caricature of Asians.
But to outsiders who have experienced racism, the filter reminded them of hurtful clichés.
Others strongly rejected the anime comparison.
In an email, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweets about the photos were widely shared, wrote that the filter was "injury and, to put it mildly, unpleasant".
She added that "it's hard to argue with the contrast between a very disgusting Asian cartoon and the filter effects.
It shows that the filter is not yellow-faced, but that the yellow-faced has been pulled to the downward extreme.
Snapchat isn't the only company that's crossing these cultural barrier wires.
American culture seems to be engaged in an endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in our hands.
And Snapchat's large audience of young people -- who are more racially diverse than their older counterparts -- might be more likely to expect sensitivity.
When one of Snapchat's filters creates an image that is offensive to a user, "it's much harder to ignore things like that than it used to be", 25-year-old Katie Zhu said in an interview on Thursday.
On Thursday, Zhu, who works as a product manager and engineer for Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and urged others to do the same.
In an essay for Medium and in a telephone interview, she said that she believes that racial controversies reflect a lack of diversity in Snapchat's hiring practices.
Zhu criticized the predominantly white, all-male leadership and ended her essay with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
"Either they don't have a diverse representation of people of color in their workforce to make these decisions", said Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people of color working there who aren't in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say anything about it".
Others share their opinion, a complaint that has largely left Snapchat unanswered.
The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to discuss the cultural backgrounds of its employees, but according to a spokesperson, the company recently hired a human resources manager who focuses on underrepresented populations and internal integration efforts.
Zhu said for her part that she will be closing her Snapchat account, adding, "I wonder if they need more users like us to be able to say that this is not OK".
Military leadership falsifies ISIS intelligence, congressional committee finds
Military officials at the United States Central Command altered intelligence to paint a more optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than actual conditions on the ground would have allowed, a congressional investigative committee said in a report Thursday.
The preliminary report, prepared by a task force of Republican members of the Armed Services Committee, Intelligence Committee and the Defense Budget Committee, reports deep discontent among Central Command intelligence analysts who reported how superiors changed their assessments of American efforts to fight the Islamic State.
Central Command, or Cencom for short, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, that controls U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"Intelligence typically leaked by senior Centcom commanders regularly painted a more positive picture of U.S. counterterrorism efforts than actual conditions on the ground would have allowed and was consistently more positive than analysis by other intelligence agencies", a newspaper article quoted the report as saying.
"What happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analysis is presented to our political leaders", noted Ken Calvert, a Republican member of the House of Representatives.
The leadership failures at Centcom reach to the very top of the organization.
The 10-page report details persistent problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analysis of American efforts to train Iraqi forces.
Although it provides no direct evidence that Obama administration officials gave instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts faced pressure from their superiors to paint a more optimistic picture of the threat posed by the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
"During the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and congressional testimony were significantly more positive than factual", the report noted.
For example, a Centcom official publicly announced that a military retake of Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"After months of investigation, one thing is clear", said Mike Pompeo, a Republican congressman from Kansas, in a statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the top brass of Central Command altered intelligence reports to downplay the threat posed by ISIS in Iraq.
Republicans created the task force after being told that analysts were concerned about the manipulation of reports about the Islamic State.
The report published on Thursday will be supplemented by more detailed findings as the investigation continues.
In addition, further investigations into the Centcom reports by the Inspector General of the Department of Defense are ongoing.
Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee released their own findings on Thursday, which were consistent with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.
"In 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an overly restricted process for intelligence assessment of ISIL and Iraqi security services", senior Democratic member of the committee, Representative Adam B. Schiff, said in a statement.
This process, Mr. Schiff said, "delayed the release of intelligence reports", damaged analyst morale, and "left too little room for dissent".
But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats said they found no evidence of White House interference with Centcom analysts regarding "a particular political opinion".
The preliminary results of the congressional investigation were published Tuesday by The Daily Beast.
Last August, the New York Times reported on an investigation by the Pentagon's inspector general, which was launched after complaints from Centcom analysts.
Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that the Defense Department would not comment on congressional reports while the inspector general's investigation is still ongoing.
But he also stated that "experts sometimes have quite divergent opinions on the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence community and the Department of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important national defense issues".
The investigation has implications beyond the question of a successful US-led air campaign in Iraq and Syria (a claim now being made by a growing number of DoD officials).
But last year's accusations raised the question of how much President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.
Criticism of the Islamic State's intelligence is reminiscent of a dispute more than a decade ago when a Centcom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a paper about how the George W. Bush administration, contrary to the recommendations of many analysts, planned a small occupation force in Iraq and spent little time thinking about the consequences of the 2003 invasion.
Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the uprising against current coverage of the Islamic State.
Last year, Mr. Hooker's team, according to government sources, found that contrary to government claims, airstrikes on ISIL-controlled refineries would not have a significant impact on the financial position of the terrorist group, as these temporary refineries were set up to sell oil on the black market.
However, this finding was not published, the Times reported in September.
Centcom's then commander, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the Legislature for his overly positive assessment of the war situation at a Senate hearing.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced at Central Command by General Joseph L. Votel.
The United States wins its fourth match in women's field hockey, a showdown with Great Britain is imminent
A day after scoring three goals in a 6-1 win over Japan, Katie Bam also scored the first two goals for the US women's field hockey team in a match against India on Thursday that the Americans won 3-0.
Five goals in two games should be a memorable performance, but Bam, 27, said she could not remember ever doing that.
"I have no idea", she said.
I'm not one of those people who remembers their gates.
But she knows this: the American women are 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are tied in their group with the British women in first place, who remain unbeaten after their 2-0 victory over Japan.
Great Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final game of the first round.
Both teams have already qualified for the quarter-finals, and the match will decide which of the two teams will finish first and second in their group of six teams.
The first-place finisher will be a little longer out of the way of the strong Dutch women leading the other group.
Whatever the outcome of Saturday's game, the American women have created a surprising whirlwind of success four years after finishing last out of 12 in the last London Games.
Bam was part of that team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and first picked up a hockey stick at age three (her two older sisters played the sport at Drexel University), becoming the youngest player in team history at age 16 and the first to win a gold medal in the U.S. National Team.
She missed the 2008 Olympics because she couldn't qualify for the squad.
Then came 2012, when everything went wrong for her and her team.
The following year, Craig Parnham, an Englishman, became the coach of the national team, and things began to change for the better.
"A cultural change, a mental change and a physical change", Bam said.
We didn't have the workload in London that we have now.
We've completely turned the wheel.
On Thursday night, Bam opened the scoring in the first half of the game with a close-range reverse.
India had entered the tournament without a win, but the team proved surprisingly tough and held the score 1-0 into the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands.
She sprinted the flat ball over the left flank, then moved to center and rammed the ball into the goal to give the Americans a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez scored the final goal in the middle of the last quarter.
The shutout was the first of the entire tournament for USA goalkeeper Jackie Briggs, who had to score a goal in each of the previous games.
She's got a run.
Just like Bam.
"We are in a good position", said Parnham, "but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday".
In the midst of the Olympic fury, the zen of trampolining
Wherever you are, no matter what time it is, it's the Olympics.
The events in Rio de Janeiro feel permanent and inevitable, a furious relay race between competition and ambition.
It's like the Olympic torch itself is a burning stick, passed from the armband to the swimmer to the gymnast to the triathlete.
You can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper, or listen to your neighbor in line at the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or the fight between Michael Phelps and Chad Le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, who is in the Olympics for the first time and a bunch of women with dimples, could have been one of those household names on prime time, built up by sponsors and feel-good TV commercials, if he was a swimmer, gymnast or even a fighter.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is fighting for Olympic gold in the trampoline event.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event equally.
Further from the centre, partly in the shade, are the sports not generally recognized: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
We'll always have the breast swim and may it last.
But if I may make a modest argument for my particular favorite, let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.
Although trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it made its debut in Sydney, it has been so underrated for the past 16 years that many of the people I interviewed didn't even know it was an Olympic sport.
It could be regional ignorance.
Although the United States sent athletes to compete, it has never won a medal in trampoline jumping and until 2012 had no athlete make it to the final round.
The Chinese and Russians tend to split the prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadians the prices for the women.
Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.
Trampoline jumping has a certain outsider charm, partly because it sounds more appropriate to an unenlightened ear for a clown school than for the Olympics.
At this point, I should admit that I am not an expert, but just a grounded enthusiast.
It has the humor potential - the cartoonish trembling of its never-ending impact - but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, the two sports that essentially unite it.
The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish El Trampolin, which means "jumpboard".
Aspiring winners jump on a giant trampoline, shoot up to nearly 30 feet into the air, and must make a series of falling movements (spins, stitches, and saltos) before landing on their feet.
They are graded according to the official Olympic programme by execution, difficulty and "flight time".
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio.
The most common Olympic vector is straight.
Medal hopefuls must go on, faster, up and over, sometimes to the finish, sometimes back and forth, up and down the playing field, in their pursuit of gold.
They are not only chasing the finish line or the starting wall, but also another derogatory goal on television: the world or Olympic record.
The purposeful pursuit is noble, admirable, even fanatical - and it is enough to move even an onlooker to tears.
But it's also what I find a little tiresome even watching these games.
The trampoline offers a respite from that.
The trampoliner's vector is up.
Moving forward is not the goal.
He or she bounces off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly back up.
Here too, there is competition, not without difficulty, of course, but during the exercise there is no frantic attack on the target, no wolf in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant elimination of time and gravity.
It's as Zen as competition at the Olympics can be.
The women's qualifying and final rounds will be held on Friday afternoon, streaming at 1pm Eastern Time; the men's on Saturday, also at 1pm.
NBC will air the finals as part of an afternoon block on both days beginning at 2 p.m.
Amid the Olympic mania, they promise a quiet, pleasant moment, one that will probably be overlooked in the general tumult.
If the only way to raise awareness is to target and objectify male athletes, as the Wall Street Journal recently suggested, then Mr. Dooley is expecting his air-struggling new fan base.
"A generation protesting" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the US
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Protesters demanding political change in Ethiopia have encountered violent government opposition.
Witnesses say dozens of protesters were killed in gun battles during clashes with police.
Is Ethiopia on the verge of collapse?
In the last decade, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy.
But in recent months, anti-government protests have rocked the country and spread to more and more areas.
Last week, thousands of people took to the streets demanding fundamental political change.
The government's response was ruthless, according to human rights organizations.
Witnesses said police shot and killed dozens of unarmed protesters.
Videos circulating about the protests, which are believed to date from late or early this year, show security personnel beating young people with sticks while they were forced to stand hand in hand against a wall.
The head of the UN human rights office is now demanding a thorough investigation.
"It has always been difficult to hold this country together and it will be even harder in the future", said Rashid Abdi, the Horn of Africa project manager of the International Crisis Group, a research group.
Ethiopia is the second most populous country in Africa after Nigeria and its stability is appreciated by the West.
U.S. military and intelligence agencies are working closely with the Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats beyond the region, particularly in Somalia.
Ethiopia's economy expanded at a remarkable pace.
Its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa.
The streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
Although Ethiopia has been far from a model of democracy - human rights groups have consistently led the government's crackdown - opposition in the country has been curbed, with dissent effectively silenced.
Many were exiled or imprisoned, killed, or driven into the wilderness.
But that could change.
"If you oppress people and they have no other option but to protest, it breaks out", said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopia.
The whole youth is protesting.
A generation is protesting.
There are numerous complaints, covering everything from land use to the stranglehold on power of the ruling coalition.
After a widely criticized election last year, the ruling party and its allies won the last opposition seat and now control 100 percent of parliament.
At the same time, tensions are rising along the border with Eritrea, where a battle over the jagged, disputed line claimed hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatists like the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, which have been more or less defeated in recent years, could take advantage of the turmoil and rearm.
Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness after years of limping are now exploding beneath the surface.
The first one seems harmless: smartphones.
It was only in recent years that many Ethiopians were able to communicate through social media as cheaper smartphones became more common and Internet services improved.
Even when the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, which it does at regular intervals, especially during protests, many people can still communicate through Internet proxies that hide their whereabouts.
Several young Ethiopians said they gathered to protest.
The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromo and Amhara, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
The Oromo and Amhara are not natural enemies.
For eons, the Amharas, who come from Ethiopia's predominantly Christian highlands, have thrived politically and economically while exploiting the Oromos, many of whom are Muslims and live in lowland areas.
But that's changing, too.
"We are in the process of coordinating under one umbrella", said Mulatu Gemechu, an Oromo leader.
The largest protests took place in Amhara and Oromo areas.
Many Amharas and Oromos feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the Tigray ethnic group, which makes up about 6 percent of the population and is dominant in the military, intelligence, commerce and politics.
The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Meles, a former rebel leader, was Ethiopia's prime minister for 17 years until his death from an undisclosed illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could think of corners.
Analysts say he was particularly adept at spotting early signs of discontent and using special agents to process opponents and render them harmless.
"The current regime lacks this basic skill", said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst.
Ethiopia's new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively unclear reasons to take the place of Mr Meles.
Unlike Mr Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say he is not trusted by the Tigray-controlled security services.
Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such a riot was in 2005, after thousands protested against elections that analysts said were apparently foiled and then stolen by the government.
During the subsequent raids many protesters were killed, although fewer than in the previous months and this period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, and for their measurable progress in poverty alleviation.
But obviously this has not prevented the intensification of internal resentment in the Ethiopian government.
And it's taking on a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, protesters in Gondar, an Amharic city, attacked Tigray-run businesses, and hatred of Tigrayans is becoming more common on social media.
Analysts say the protests put the United States and other Western allies in a strange position.
The US government used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights over neighboring Somalia, although it recently announced that it was closing that base.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it does not want its ally to collapse in an already volatile area.
"This", said Mr. Abdi, "is a very thin ridge walk".
Donald Trump says his claim that Obama founded ISIS was "sarcasm"
Donald J. Trump tried on Friday to defuse the latest controversy surrounding his campaign by saying that his repeated claims that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the Islamic State terrorist group were not serious.
This clarification raised new questions about the communications skills of the Republican presidential candidate, whether he was able to communicate clearly and intelligibly with the American public.
It also puts his fellow soldiers, who are trying to protect him during an eventful period, in the peculiar position of having to explain statements he might not have meant.
After making the suggestion at a campaign event on Wednesday night, Mr. Trump backtracked on the claim on Thursday, insisting in interviews that he really didn't intend to imply that the president and Mrs. Clinton created ISIS.
But in an early morning tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was simply being sarcastic.
The tweet was in contrast to the previous day, when Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews that he was taking the accusation completely seriously.
When conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt tried to help Mr. Trump tone down the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate didn't want to know about it.
The latest storm of criticism is pouring down on Mr. Trump as he tries to shift the focus of his campaign to the economy because of falling poll numbers.
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton gave speeches about the economic situation in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Mr. Trump tried to return to this topic again.
He tweeted that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring.
Mr. Trump has already used sarcasm in his defense.
In late July, he drew heavy criticism when he suggested that the Russians hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but later said, "Of course I meant that sarcastically".
This method allows Mr. Trump to push the linguistic boundaries in politics and then paddle back as needed.
"I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages are received by his fans, how they arrive, and then, if necessary, 'clarify' based on how the response is". said Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who observes the language of both candidates.
But I also think he's smart enough to keep his statements vague enough that they can be interpreted in different ways.
Instead of defusing the tone for the presidential election, Mr. Trump has adopted an even more disgusting tone as his poll numbers have fallen further.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll released Friday showed a big lead in North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.
While Mr. Trump generally tries not to apologize for his provocative remarks, he often accuses his critics of distorting his statements or misrepresenting his humor.
But while he's increasingly the focus of attention in the final months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump's pranks have put his loyal supporters in the uncomfortable position of having to stand by him, no matter how provocative his statements may be.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trump's most prominent advocates, went to great lengths to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview Thursday.
"I think what he's saying is legitimate, political commentary", said Mr. Giuliani, so when asked about the veracity of Mr. Trump's statement, whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton founded the Islamic State.
It's true in that sense that before Obama, ISIS was a little little little organization that was almost unknown, he called them backbenchers, completely wrong, and that's why it happened because he pulled the troops out of Iraq.
Most mainstream Republicans try to argue that the Obama administration, under which Mrs. Clinton served as Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to spread by failing to aggressively control the situation in the Middle East.
Ahead of the Pennsylvania campaign rallies on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media, accusing them of twisting his every word and being biased against him.
He mocked the "poor, pathetic" television experts who tried to understand him and said, "You can't!"
Some of the Democrats scoffed at Mr. Trump's apology as just another proof that he was unfit for the presidency.
Once pushed out of the market for above-price, Café is back in Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a seedy cash-only coffee shop in Williamsburg that didn't have Wi-Fi, but still served good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, the prices were pushed out of his Bedford Avenue storefront.
The Soap Cherie store, which replaced Verb in the summer of 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.
Locals mourned it as the last loss in a gentrifying city.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know New York is change, but I still can't believe CBGB is dead, except for the Chelsea Hotel and Verb is now a soap shop".
But if New York is change, it's also reinvention.
A revitalized Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere.
The coffee's still good.
The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the old café, who is the owner and manager of the new café.
He started working at Verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end.
When a client offered to provide funds for a new branch, he said, he was excited to do so.
Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot of things.
Verb used the same distributor for the bagels, bought the same espresso machine model.
It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.
But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment, too.
He introduced new ingredients.
The menu includes bacon and cheese sandwiches and garnishes like capers and pickled onions.
There are nature bowls.
The cafe doesn't serve beer anymore, they serve fresh juices instead.
After nine months, Rodriguez said he noticed a steady stream of old regulars.
"Many old customers have also been displaced by prices from Williamsburg", he said.
One such customer was Rebecca Oliveira on a recent Sunday.
Oliveira, 34, used to live in Williamsburg and was a regular at the verb.
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she was gonna take the road.
After the verb was closed, she said, she stopped drinking coffee for a while.
"I realized that it was the coffee and the culture in the verb that I liked", she said.
Now she's drinking coffee again, even though she ordered a blended chai tea that day instead of her usual iced coffee, which is another new addition.
Tom Rosenthal has been another long-standing and loyal customer since the beginning of the Verb in 2003.
He went there before work and inevitably ordered the same thing.
"I came in at quarter to seven every day like a Swiss watch, and they make my everything bagel with butter", he said.
Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu.
These days, Rosenthal still gets his usual order, but sometimes he changes his Everything bagel for bacon, egg and cheese.
Rodriguez said he didn't hold a grudge that the soap shop had taken over the old business.
In fact, the owners of the Soap Cherie offered to make a special soap for Verb using the cafe's cold brew coffee as an ingredient.
"I think we'll still accept their offer", said Rodriguez.
And the traditional, Polish residents of Greenpoints have accepted the cafe as well.
A new customer has translated the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez said he plans to put it out soon so his new neighbors feel welcome.
The location has other advantages.
A local juice bar wants to bottle and sell the cold brew coffee.
There's a chance the cafe will expand into a neighboring building.
For many customers, a new verb is enough to get their old favorites.
Joseph Witt was a regular customer and said he was devastated when the cafe closed.
When the new café opened, Whitt said that walking into the place and ordering a new coffee felt like coming home.
"I had to smell it", he said.
The depressing eating of the economic crisis in "a rich meal"
In March 1933, shortly after he assumed the presidency, Franklin Delano Roosevelt was having lunch in the Oval Office.
As a gourmet, President Roosevelt had a penchant for refined Fifth Avenue delicacies like foie gras and Maryland water turtle soup.
His menu that day was a little more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes, and a plum pudding for dessert.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with people who were suffering", said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added, "It was also a message to Americans about how to eat".
The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.
Coe's latest book, "Chop Suey", was about Chinese cuisine in the United States, while Ziegelman's book, "97 Orchard", is about living in a Lower East Side apartment building from a food perspective.
Her latest collaboration, "A Decent Meal", which will be published by Harper on Tuesday, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.
They showed culinary solidarity when they met with a reporter for dinner at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a small, no-frills diner in the Flatiron District that's been in business since the 1929 stock market crash.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive slices, while Coe, 57, ate turkey with mashed potatoes and vegetable mixture.
When the reporter ordered roast beef, the couple found it appropriate for a discussion about food in the Great Depression era.
"Fruit-rich foods were very popular", said Ziegelman.
There was peanut bread, liver cheese and bean bread.
They were made from an ingredient and something cheap that stretches the ingredient.
Imagine eating so many peanuts that they serve as dinner.
Coe was grinning.
"It must have settled in his stomach like lead", he said.
In the years before the Great Depression, the table in an American household, especially in rural areas, was an all-you-can-eat buffet.
Teams of women cooked for male field workers and served freshly baked pies for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during World War I. "A Square Meal" documents the ways the country coped with not being the Monkey Country anymore.
"It was a time when food became a central, tense topic for Americans", Coe began why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
The new budgetary diet was just as tense: Mysterious foods like bread and casseroles became staples, and casseroles became "a wonderful way to recycle leftovers", noted Ziegelman, because chefs could hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
Meat, which for years was the centerpiece of American cuisine, became a rarely served luxury.
Peculiar blends were tried, since a high-calorie and nutritious satisfaction took precedence over taste or even common sense.
While researching the book, which includes recipes, Ziegelman prepared a dish from that era, baked onions with peanut butter.
"It was not a popular lunch item", says Coe.
"It was surreal", says Brickman.
Peanut butter and baked onions don't go together.
It was typical of many of the housekeeping recipes.
Never before or since have housekeepers - including Louise Stanley, director of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - pushed the nation's eating habits in this way.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "budgetary policymakers" and to rise to the challenge of turning pumpkin into delicious meals like creamy spaghetti with carrots.
A Square Meal is a celebration of historic treats.
Particularly tasty are the reports of the government's response to the starving citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's "let me eat cake" attitude.
While he was publicly praising the simple Iowa farmhouse cuisine of his kitchen, he dined like the millionaire man of the world he's become.
"He liked continental cuisine like fish with cucumber sauce", said Coe.
He ate in a dining room almost gilded and wore a tuxedo.
He was a wonderful stranger to reality.
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor hadn't urged him to make an example of his stomach.
As the book describes, Mrs. Roosevelt's hiring of a housekeeper with no interest in taste led to the White House producing the most boring meal in Washington, but also one of the most desolate".
Many of the Great Depression-era ways of handling food were discarded as soon as the country got back on its feet.
The legacy lies in our continued focus on calories and nutrition, Ziegelman said, as well as how science has been applied to food.
The couple claimed that when writing the book, they had a better understanding of Ziegelman's mother-in-law's eating habits - for example, how she could not throw food away.
"She was really afraid of wasting food", Coe said.
"She actually made people sick", recalled Ziegelman.
That's when the windbag incident happened.
After the plates were cleared at Eisenberg's, she and Coe brought out a dessert they had made at home: the plum dessert President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
"It's called the Plum Whip", said Brickman, adding that it was a common trick to give modest recipes a fancy name.
There was no whipped cream, just plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone dipped a spoon into the tough, brown slime, somewhat reluctantly.
Surprisingly, it wasn't bad.
Coe got a refill three times.
Like a can-do budgeter, he said to his wife, "A couple of chopped walnuts would help".
Killed in a bombing attack: he was the hero of Aleppo
He risked his own life to help others: Khaled Omar.
He was the hero of Aleppo: Khaled Omar dedicated his life to the people of Syria.
He risked everything to save other people's lives.
Now the 30-year-old himself has died in a barrel bomb attack by the Assad regime.
Omar was a member of the White Helmets, a civil protection group that has saved nearly 60,000 lives so far, according to Bild newspaper.
2,900 volunteers risk their lives to pull people out of bombed-out homes and provide first aid in war zones.
They are the heroes of the war in Syria.
Omar was the face of the group: a video of the civil defence worker rescuing an infant from the rubble of a house in 11 hours went viral in 2014.
It made the Syrian a shining symbol of the horrors of war.
Never seeing himself as a hero, he said, according to the image: "For me, this is the real jihad".
"If I die saving lives, I think God sees me as a martyr".
Shortly before Omar himself was killed in an attack, he had spoken in a video about the latest bombings in Syria.
The helicopters dropped four barrel bombs over the Alzadia district, one filled with chlorine gas.
A woman and two children died, seven people suffered respiratory distress.
"We are now removing the toxic remnants of the bomb so that children do not play with it", the image quotes his last words before he died.
The Assad regime's lethal bomb was meant to hit terrorists.
Greenland shark: The oldest vertebrate is nearly 400 years old
It's a rare sight.
Greenland sharks usually only come to the surface in winter.
This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an examination on board the research vessel Sanna.
Born in 1624, he swims at over a mile an hour across the North Atlantic - to this day.
Greenland sharks don't give birth until they're 150 years old.
Slowly, the Greenland shark swims along the bottom of the North Atlantic, averaging just 4,000 feet [1,220 m] in an hour.
Only when it comes to its own use can the 15-foot-long [5.0 m] animal accelerate to a whopping eight miles per hour - and at that top speed, it is half as fast as a seal.
But this slow-moving lifestyle seems to be a recipe for old age.
Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal Science that a Greenland shark may be 392 years old.
"It's crazy", says Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock, Germany, about the life span, which is a world record for vertebrates.
Although the evolutionary biologist had long suspected that Greenland sharks would turn to stone.
Only the evidence was missing.
Greenland sharks are difficult to spot, since they live mainly in the icy seas off the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.
Because they prefer water temperatures of about six degrees Celsius, they usually only surface in winter.
Researchers know relatively little about the lifestyle of Greenland sharks.
They measured their speed by equipping six animals with a transmitter outside Spitsbergen.
Still, these sharks prey: In the stomach of one, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear.
They may hunt sleeping animals or patrol the bottom of the sea ice, looking for carcasses tumbling down from higher water.
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now studied 28 Greenland sharks that fishermen caught off Greenland or Svalbard as bycatch from the depths of the North Atlantic between 2010 and 2013.
The smallest shark was just two feet [81 cm] long, while the largest measured two feet [502 cm].
To determine the age of the animals, they used the carbon-14 method to analyze the shark's lens cores.
This center of the eye lens is formed before the shark is born, and the proteins contained therein are not renewed later.
The two smallest sharks had remarkably high levels of carbon-14 in their lens cores.
It should therefore have been born after the early 1960's, when nuclear weapons tests released greater amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.
The third smallest animal, measuring 220 centimeters [2.2 feet] in length, had a small surplus of carbon-14 from nuclear weapons tests in its lens core, which was supposed to have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012.
All the larger Greenland sharks, on the other hand, had normal levels of carbon-14 in their lens cores, which is produced by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.
In fact, the carbon-14 clock for a two-foot-long [493 cm] Greenland shark showed an age of 335 years, while the record-breaking two-foot-long [502 cm] shark may have been as old as 392 years.
It was known that female Greenland sharks did not give birth until they were over four meters long.
Now the researchers were able to assign an age to the height.
Since one of the animals, measuring about two feet [392 cm], was probably on the threshold of sexual maturity and was found to be 156 years old, it is obvious that the Greenland shark will take at least a century and a half to reproduce.
This is also a world record for vertebrates.
It is no accident that such methusoma live mainly in icy waters.
The previous record holder, a 211-year-old Greenland whale with a 120-year-old harpoon tip stuck in its neck, was also caught off Alaska.
The low temperatures often cause the organism of the animals living there to burn out.
So they mature later - and age more slowly.
To keep warm in the cold water, the animals often grow to be extra large.
Because the volume grows much faster than the surface, which causes the animal to lose heat.
The heat loss of a gram of mouse is therefore much greater than that of a gram of elephant.
Another advantage is that you have fewer enemies.
"A smaller animal is more dangerous and should focus on having as many offspring as possible at an early age", explains evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein.
A very large animal, on the other hand, should be more likely to invest its resources in a long life.
Ground in the double pack
The Council of the municipality has focused on building issues in the recent meeting.
The committee was relieved to hear Mayor Robert Putz announce that "the marketing of the newly designated housing units can finally begin".
After the land, subdivision and development issues were settled and the applications for survey were submitted, there is no longer any obstacle to the sale of the land in the residential areas of Straßlweg and Schönau-West (Binderstraße area - expansion section 1) to interested parties.
The local council is convinced that the building sites in the rural and quiet residential community of Schönau appeal to young families and elderly people with a disability.
As it was said, building volunteers can now register at the town hall, the allocation of the plots will be discussed by the municipal council in its September meeting.
In order to accommodate the demands for the establishment of new industrial establishments, which are linked to job creation, the municipal council decided to amend the new land use plan, which was drawn up only in the spring of this year, in parts.
In the area of Unterzeitlarn, the industrial area already designated there will be extended by two plots towards State Road 2112.
Frankfurt benefits from Brexit
The city on the Main thus has the best chance of attracting jobs and firms relocated from London, in competition with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg.
"It is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Brexit vote", says Michael Voigtländer, head of the IW's Financial and Real Estate Markets Competence Unit.
Following the Brexit referendum, it is uncertain whether money houses will be allowed to continue to operate from London to finance transactions across the EU.
The so-called EU passport is currently only available to those who have been admitted to the UK.
That's what big U.S. banks are using right now.
Several banks have already announced job transfers.
The lobby group Frankfurt Main Finance expects to create 10,000 new jobs on the Main within five years.
The IW said Frankfurt was represented by the headquarters of the European Central Bank (ECB), which has responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the eurozone's largest banks, as well as other key authorities such as the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) and the European System of Risk Board (ESRB).
The OECD is headquartered in Paris, but is less important to the financial sector than the ECB.
"The proximity to the central bank is important for banks, as it allows them to communicate directly with the supervisory authorities", says IW professor Voigtländer.
Luxembourg is home to a large fund industry, but it is worse off in infrastructure, as is Dublin.
The Commission notes that the large airport makes it much easier to reach Frankfurt.
The city also scores high on the list of easily available commercial properties.
"It is not easy to find high-quality offices in Paris", says Voigtländer.
The rent for first-class commercial properties on the Seine is also 50 percent higher than on the Main.
Frankfurt also offers a higher quality of life than its competitors, thanks to good healthcare and infrastructure, and lower crime.
In a ranking by Mercer, the city is ranked seventh, Luxembourg 19th, Dublin 33rd and Paris 37th.
Although quality of life is a matter of preference, "Frankfurt, with its already strong position as a financial hub for the European single market, could attract more banks and investors", the IW concludes.
London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe despite the Brexit vote, according to economists.
The labour force ratio also speaks for itself: according to figures from Landesbank Helaba, at the end of 2015 there were around 144 000 people working in the banking sector in London, while in Frankfurt there were 62 500.
Gilead receives legal fees from the hepatitis C patent dispute with Merck
A U.S. magistrate judge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc. should be entitled to recover its costs arising from the hepatitis C litigation with the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co. Inc.
In June, Gilead was cleared of a $200 million damages award for infringement of two Merck patents related to Gilead's blockbuster drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni, after a U.S. judge uncovered a pattern of misconduct by Merck, including perjury and other unethical acts.
U.S. District Judge Beth Labson Freeman said Thursday that Gilead is entitled to recover costs incurred in defending the case.
Merck is trying to match Gilead, which dominates the market for a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure more than 90 percent of patients with liver disease.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other and claimed ownership of laboratory work that was based on Sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in Gilead's drugs.
US-backed forces say they have regained full control of Manbij from Islamic State
US-backed forces have regained full control of the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last IS fighters in the city left, a spokesman for the group said on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are currently combing the city after the withdrawal of the remaining group of fighters who have buried themselves inside the city.
They have freed over 2,000 civilians held hostage by the militants, Sharfan Darwish of the DKS-allied Manbij Military Council told Reuters.
"The city is now under complete control, but we are currently cleaning up", he told Reuters.
The Clintons make $10.75 million in 2015 and pay 34.2% in federal taxes.
Hillary Clinton released her 2015 tax return on Friday, which reported an income of $10.75 million for the Democratic presidential candidate and her husband and an effective federal tax rate of 34.2%.
In 2015, the Clintons donated $1 million to charitable causes, primarily to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton earned nearly $5.3 million in speaking honors; the former Secretary of State reported an income of $3 million from Simon & Schuster for her book about her tenure at the State Department.
Clinton's vice presidential candidate, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, and his wife, Anne Holton, release their tax returns for the past decade.
You paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3% in 2015.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set standards for financial transparency", Clinton campaign aide Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
In stark contrast, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and backtracking on his previous promises to release his tax returns.
It is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax returns, although they are not required to do so by law.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers cited a tax audit by the IRS as the reason for his refusal.
"They're on the move", Clinton campaign aide Ian Sams wrote on Twitter, referring to the release of the Democratic presidential nominee.
On Thursday, Michael Cohen, Trump's special adviser, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish anything until the tax audits are complete.
Trump's critics, including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, have already said that his refusal raises questions about his assets, his donations to charities, his business practices and various other ties, especially with Russia.
Clinton has already taken to the issue, posting a video online Friday in which senior Republicans urge Trump to release his tax returns.
On Thursday, she also addressed the subject during a speech on the economy in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what every other presidential candidate has done in the last decades and release his tax returns", she told the crowd.
Politico reported that Trump paid no or very little tax for two years during the 1990s, and a business reporter for the New York Times quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax advisers on Friday as suggesting that this may still be the case.
Federal taxes have become a campaign issue.
Clinton supports a scheme named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett that would ensure that individuals earning more than $1 million pay a tax rate of at least 30%.
President Obama supports the proposal as well.
During a campaign event for Hillary Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway industrial conglomerate is based here, asked Trump to meet with him to exchange their tax returns.
Buffett said he was also subjected to a tax audit by the IRS and Trump was "afraid" of the voters and not the tax authorities.
Clinton's campaign has released tax returns going back to 2007.
The Clintons, who now live in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average effective federal tax rate of about 32% between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 40.5%.
The Clintons' 2015 tax returns showed that they only received $100 of their income as wages, unlike most other Americans.
Their main investment was a low-cost index fund, from which the Clintons taxed $109,000 in dividends and income.

Condoms with chili powder, fireworks promote elephant conservation in Tanzania
Conservationists in Tanzania use an unorthodox method to keep elephants from entering human settlements - they throw condoms filled with chili powder at them.
The method has proven effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which had the idea years ago, has been working with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to scale up its support by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a nonviolent four-step method to protect their homes and crops without harming animals.
Before, many people used spears to defend themselves.
Friday is World Elephant Day, dedicated to animal welfare.
"Since we developed the ... toolkit, we have seen a change in attitude within these communities, with them being much more confident that they can keep the elephants out of their fields without harming the elephant", Honeyguide's CEO Damian Bell said in a statement.
The first two steps involve lighting the elephant with a torch and blowing a horn.
If he's not deterred, a so-called "chilli cloud" is thrown.
Chili powder mixed with earth is wrapped together with a firework into a condom, the end of which is turned up to the spark plug.
When ignited, the condom bursts open with a bang, spraying fine dust of chili powder into the air.
A breath quite usually enough to drive the elephant away.
A final possibility is a shooter who shoots a gold-plated firecracker into the air, causing a loud, bright explosion.
The city council unanimously decides no kiosk building on the Rhine bank of St. Goar
The St. Goarers usually accept investment projects from businessmen with a kiss of good cheer - the retail trade in the city centre is considered particularly viable.
The request for the construction of a new sales kiosk on the banks of the Rhine in the immediate vicinity of the Rhine Balkon, which is under construction, was now unanimously rejected by the city council.
"We generally welcome new businessmen, but in this exposed location on the banks of the Rhine, this kiosk is not suitable", said Michael Hubrath for the CDU Group.
Jewish filmmaker smashes Berlin hotel because Israeli prefix was removed at "Arab" request - RT News
A French filmmaker with Jewish roots sparked a media outcry after revealing that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not list an Israeli prefix because Arab guests "requested" it, according to an employee.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentary "Shoah", vented his anger at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his last stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the hotel's country list.
However, the country was not listed among the countries that can be called directly from a hotel room.
How is it possible that in 2016, in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, Israel has been eliminated and erased?
The Commission has not yet adopted a decision.
Instead, Kempinksi Bristol offers a way to call Israel through its own call center.
The director went to the hotel reception to seek an explanation.
The answer he received there "shocked him", as Lanzmann wrote.
The hotel employee said the measure was a "deliberate decision by the management of Kempinski Hotels".
The reason behind it made the director even more angry.
"Most of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the prefix be deleted", the Lanzmann employee was quoted as saying.
The Israeli ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas-Hendelsman, called this a "great shame", reports the Süddeutsche Zeitung.
We were horrified and dismayed by this event.
This is really very embarrassing.
The fact that this has happened in Germany in this very hotel chain is even more shameful.
It doesn't need an explanation.
We expect the hotel to "draw the right conclusions", the official said.
The incident caused quite a big response on the Internet, where people called the whole thing a scandal.
Some suggested that the Kempinski Hotel had "ceded" to the alleged demands of Arab guests.
"Shame on you", said another post, noting that the hotel, located on the upscale Kurfürstendamm, is near a synagogue.
The hotel quickly denied all allegations, calling the incident a "miscarriage" and "apologizing" to Lanzmann, Der Spiegel reports.
"There was never a direct order not to include Israel on the shortlist", quoted a spokesman for the Kempinski Hotel by the Süddeutsche Zeitung.
It adds that the country code has now been added.
Police use tear gas and rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students
Students clashed with police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo on Thursday as they gathered to protest against the government's reforms to the public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the protesters.
The problems began when police officers tried to disperse the students, which led to the police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstrations to express their dismay at the plans.
According to the proposal of the governor of the state of Sao Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, just under 100 public schools will be closed while 300,000 students will be implemented to save money.
Some of the protesters were seen spraying graffiti against interim President Michel Temer on walls.
The latest protests came days after protesters took to the streets in large numbers to support suspended President Dilma Rousseff, who was removed from office by a Senate vote to impeach her.
Trade between Russia and Iran suddenly rises to 71 percent - RT Business
With the lifting of sanctions, according to the Russian ambassador to Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan, trade between Moscow and Tehran grew by 70.9 percent year on year.
Since the lifting of international sanctions against Iran, interest in doing business in the country has grown sharply among Russian companies, the ambassador said.
Russian companies are opening up existing links with Iran, while new companies are ready to gain access to the market.
Of course, further trade expansion is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran", Dzhagaryan said.
He noted that trade turnover between Russia and Iran in the first five months of 2016 increased by 70.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $856 million.
In particular, Russian imports into Iran jumped 91.5 percent to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $158 million.
The trade boost was achieved by the supply of machinery, land vehicles and weapons", the ambassador said.
Dzhagaryan expects a record number of Iranian tourists to Russia this year.
Last year, the Russian Embassy abroad issued some 35,000 visas, primarily travel visas, to Iranian citizens.
Iran also reached the top 20 countries in terms of tourist arrivals in Russia.
You could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia from last year, are being broken", he said.
At the same time, relatively few Russians visit Iran, something the ambassador hopes will change.
"I personally recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, which have preserved the monuments of the ancient Persian civilization in good condition", he said.
Witness wanted: liquor store in forest bröl robbed
A robbery was committed on Thursday evening at the Rewe XXL liquor market on Waldbröler Gerberstraße.
With a gun in their hands, three dark-clad men, masked, demanded cash from the liquor store clerk and fled, first on foot and then, presumably in a silver VW Golf.
The police are not saying how much money was taken.
The perpetrators were said to be between five and six feet tall, so relatively small.
The beverage market is directly accessible from the parking deck of the Rewe market and is poorly visible.
The perpetrators must have run towards Gerberstraße, Friedrich-Engelbert-Weg after the robbery and fled from the gravel parking lot opposite the parking garage with the silver car, possibly in the direction of B 256 (Schladernring).
Anyone who made any observations at the time of the robbery (around 7:45 p.m.) should immediately report to the police.
Nagold: Play and fun during summer break
Eight beautiful and happy days were spent by the children and young people of the social education day group/social group work of the Children's Protection Association Nagold with their carers on their summer holiday in Nussdorf, near Mühlacker.
The lively group was housed in the quiet Hardtwäldle recreation centre during the first week of school holidays.
Several day-long excursions were on the program.
One was the board game of visiting the pet zoo.
The other was to Maulbronn, where a special children's tour was held in the world-famous monastery.
The third trip led to Pforzheim.
At the Celtic Museum in Hochdorf, the group learned a lot about the everyday life and food of the Celts.
On hot days, the group enjoyed themselves at the deep lake in Maulbronn, which invited them to jump, swim and plank.
Culinary children and carers were pampered with their own prepared meals such as sour spätzle, Seebronner Pfannel, Iselshauser-Bloff, English breakfast and Tübingen Bolognese.
Workshops were held to make beads, beautiful jewelry made of pearls and stones, or a Roman mill game made of wood.
Other highlights of the day included fishing in a nearby pond, evening fires, and the final "blue evening".
On the day of the journey home, the sun smiled and the children and youths returned home satisfied.
Pilgrims to the Gate of Mercy
The ministers from the Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna parish were on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.
Four stages were completed together.
In order to bridge the time until the next pilgrimage of all ministers to Rome in two years' time, the St. Anna Ministerial Round has decided to prepare and carry out a multi-day pilgrimage.
Various pilgrimage destinations were examined and the bishopric city of Freiburg was finally chosen, where a special pilgrimage destination was offered this year on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy with the open door of Mercy at the Freiburg Münster.
16 miniatures from Bittle Bronze, Gruol, Haigerloch and the Holy Chambers set off.
The night before, Father Storost sent the pilgrims out in a small ceremony at St. Anna's, blessed the pilgrim crosses and blessed the pilgrims.
From Horb, the train was driven to the starting point Villingen, where a monastery of Our Lady stands and the pilgrimage route from the monastery was started.
Each day's tours were framed by a brief impulse of different prayers, songs, and scriptures in the morning and evening.
But even on the way, the minions would stop at crusades, chapels, or churches to sing a song from a pilgrim's songbook they had prepared.
The accommodation was provided by the parishes of the local parishes.
At the finish line, Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller provided a tasty and invigorating dinner and breakfast.
On the second day, we continued on to Furtwangen and Gütenbach.
The next day, we started the St. Peter's stage, which was the most difficult part of the journey, as we had to descend about 500 meters in the blazing heat and climb again.
The reward was a barbecue at the bathhouse.
After the morning impulse on the fourth pilgrimage day in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter, the final stage to Freiburg was underway.
Visibly relieved and happy, the Mini arrived at the Freiburg Monastery later in the afternoon and entered through the Gate of Mercy.
With a little impulse, we thanked God here.
The mini-pilgrims arrived at the pilgrimage destination at the evening mass in Münster and were welcomed by cooperator Markus Obert.
After the service, the pilgrims were able to visit the sacristy and high altar.
The next day, there was still time for the Breisgaum-Metropolis.
In the afternoon we took the train back to Horb.
In the end, all participants agreed that the days were marked by spirituality and a strong community experience.
Scottish Callum Skinner storms home as Britain wins gold in cycling
Scotland's Callum Skinner raced to fame last night in the men's team sprint at the Rio Velodrome as the British team defended the title at London 2012.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow took on the anchor role that his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy had earned, making the youngster a legend as he stormed home to take a win over favourite New Zealand.
England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic gold medals.
They repeated the trick after finishing a modest sixth place at the World Track Championships in London in March despite Hoys's retirement.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of driver Jamie Staff.
They did this in time for Hinds to show up.
Hoy's retirement created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton were trying to fill.
Skinner was the man they stuck with when they saw potential in the Scot who was now unfolding.
Hindes, Kenny - who won with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner set an Olympic record in the qualifying rounds, but in the standard rounds, the New Zealanders won in the first round.
And the British trio won the gold medal match.
Hindes was just behind after his lap, but Kenny was leading the team and Skinner was holding it.
A change in strategy was a big part of the transformation, with Hindes driving in a higher gear to slow him down and allow Kenny and especially Skinner to keep up.
Hoy was watching from his position as a BBC pundit and noticed Skinner, Kenny and Hindes as they climbed onto the podium.
The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said: "It's a flattering comparison".
I'm just here to do my best and make a name for myself.
We set an Olympic record in the final round and beat the world champions.
It was just incredible.
There's no better way to win this.
After the 2012 triumph at the side of Kenny and Hoys, Hindes admitted that he fell on the track on purpose after a weak start.
He later retracted his statement and there was no objection from England's rivals.
With such a resounding victory, there was no such problem this time.
Hindes said, "It feels like London with all the British flags on the grandstand".
We've been working together as a team for the last three months.
We've been so bad at so many world titles, it was incredible to win again at the Olympics.
This is an event, a gold medal for the nation, having won seven of 10 titles in both Beijing and London.
If this is a barometer of our progress over the last five months, we're looking at five successful days in the velodrome.
With Kenny's form, it's within the realm of possibility that he'll repeat Hoys' three Olympic gold medals in a single event.
This would mean a haul of six gold medals and one silver medal for Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (an apparently holy date for British sport; Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were also born on that date).
The one from Hoy would be right here.
Kenny's next race is the sprint, which starts today and will run for three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said: "I'm just enjoying this for the moment".
The team event is always the best.
You can win with your colleagues.
It feels a little lonely winning alone.
Hindes said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be knighted".
It was the only medal race of the day, but there was more good news for England.
Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-kilometer race.
They finished in 3:51.942.
The world record, which won gold in London in 2012, was 3:51.659.
The first and final round (22.42) will take place today on the second day of the competition, where Wiggins will certainly be the focus.
He had a fight with a supervisor yesterday before qualifying when officials called him in to measure his height.
In the women's competition, which continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie advanced in a world record time of 4:13.260.
Team GB is relying on its strong track cycling team to dominate the mid-season Olympics and pick up a slew of medals.
After a truly extraordinary display of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, expectations for Rio were dashed.
There was drama playing out in the background, such as the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April amid accusations of sexism and bullying, and the retirement of greats like Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
But if you look at the first night of the Velodrome, it looks like the now legendary reputation of GB, which reached its peak at the perfect moment, could be repeated.
The future of Portland smelter is in question because of the cancellation of the energy contract
The future of Portland's aluminum smelter in Victoria - and hundreds of workers' jobs - are at stake as the plant operator cancels the power supply contract, ending all supply contracts, the power company said.
This follows the decision of the Victorian Government earlier this year to no longer grant subsidies to operate the plant.
A 20-year grant expires in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs at Alcoa's Portland plant are at stake.
The Commission has already taken a number of measures to ensure that the Community's energy supply is not affected by the crisis.
In addition, the melting plant could cause a domino effect, consuming about 10 percent of Victoria's total electricity.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry smelter, which led to the closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
Alcoa's Portland smelter is losing money and risking closure.
The move follows years of speculation about the future of the plant, initially as a result of the strong Australian dollar and most recently due to the electricity price for the plant.
AGL, which supplies the large aluminium smelter with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, said that it expects three other owners to terminate their contracts.
The plant is majority owned by a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, with smaller shares held by CITIC of China and Marubeni Corp of Japan.
'AGL expects the Portland plant to continue to operate, which will mean additional physical demand for electricity from the smelter,' the company said.
The Commission also notes that the Commission has not provided any information on the existence of any other aid measures.
The contracts have a 12-month notice period, which will end in 2017.
The Commission therefore concludes that the aid was granted in breach of Article 107 (1) TFEU.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet established the existence of any significant market failure in the aggregates market.
AGL said that it had already written off the value of the contracts in its annual accounts of $187 million 'pending termination'.
Alcoa said that the decision to cancel the contracts did not affect 'Alcoa's ability to operate the smelter or to provide electricity to the smelter'.
The US company said it signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which was supposed to take effect in November this year, although it still owes an explanation for why it withdrew from the contract.
Analysts warn of the possible closure of the Portland smelter in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the industry's poor economic conditions.
Referring to analysts' statements earlier this week, Chief Operating Officer Stephen Mikkelsen said Portland consumes about 600 megawatts of electricity annually and Tomago about 900 megawatts.
If both plants were to disappear from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the [electricity market].
And for us as power producers, that would not be good", he said.
More than just a Kardashian reality TV star, Kendall is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue.
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of Kardashian-Jenner clan manager Kris Jenner is on the cover of the coveted September issue of US Vogue.
Kendall, who is the brand ambassador for Estee Lauder and has been featured at the Milan, Paris and New York Fashion Weeks, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
"In a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover made me cry", Kendall wrote.
The cover was followed by a bizarre (or simply Keeping Up with the Kardashians-like?), scripted reality video showing the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (except for troubled Rob and Caitlyn and in the presence of the ever-popular showbiz uncle and producer of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest) forgetting their sister's cover and ending with a classic twist: they've all planned a surprise party.
This is the clichéd plot of almost every birthday episode of a children's show (Seacrest used the phrase, "Did you think we forgot you?" with the honesty of a cartoon rabbit on a broadcast platform at 8am), but Kris had to somehow get her other girls to participate in this publicity.
With the September edition of Vogue, a new era for the Kardashians has certainly begun.
Kendall's older sister Kim may have beaten her in Vogue coverage (she and her husband Kanye West were featured on it in April 2014), but the cover of the magazine's September issue is a league of its own.
The September issue is Vogue's best-selling issue of the year.
With a size more like a picture book than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a large number of advertisers (according to Fashionista, 615 of the 832 pages of the roll were advertising).
The cover star's unveiling is so eagerly awaited that for the past two years, images of the magazine have been leaking before the official announcement.
Women who have already been on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have been clearly more "celebrity models" than "models who are celebrities" on the cover.
Oscar winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga was honored.
But even on the slim chance that Ms. Jenner - described by the magazine as the "breakthrough model" of her generation - falls into the earlier category, she is in good company.
These celebrities are not related to celebrities or reality stars or today's teens who know how to make a good Snapchat video (even if all of that applies to Jenner).
They're really talented women who excel in the entertainment industry.
Beyonce, who was on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lemonade.
Of course, not everyone likes Jenner's success.
With her reality TV story, Jenner's position in the fashion world has always been a little strained.
In June, former Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid were criticized as "the bitches of the moment".
Those feelings boiled over again when news broke of Jenner's appearance on the cover of Vogue.
But riding around in resentment seems to miss the point.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue.
She's a supermodel in the truest sense of the word.
She's running for Marc Jacobs.
She's advertising your Estee Lauder foundation.
She and all her sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their respective paywall apps.
She sells pictures she made of Cindy Crawford's daughter to Love magazine.
And in her spare time, she's on reality TV, probably just to see her sister Kourtney and her kids.
Community law centres reject 160,000 people a year
More than 160,000 of the country's most vulnerable are turned away from community legal centers each year as the industry grapples with the impact of further cuts on already overburdened transactions.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly older people, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and those without the means to unjustly evict and the like - are already rejected for free legal advice and assistance.
The legal services of the municipality, already overloaded, are preparing for further cuts.
As of June next year, it's projected that these law centers will lose another 30 percent of their federal funding.
Queensland Community Law Centre Director James Farrell said the latest survey by the National Association of Community Law Centres showed that thousands of people are already turned away each year.
Farrell said that the situation would only get worse without a reversal of the federal government's decision.
"Queensland's community justice centres are chronically underfunded, which means thousands of people are being turned away from essential services they need", he said.
People leaving abusive relationships, people with unmanageable and overwhelming debt, families going through separations, workers who have been unfairly fired -- all these people have legal problems, and this survey shows that they can't get the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by 30 percent starting in June 2017, which means that thousands of more disadvantaged people in Queensland will be forced to deal with their legal problems without any help.
We call on the Attorney General and Attorney General and Senator George Brandis of Queensland to immediately lift these cuts so that people can get the help they need in legal matters.
Last year, the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise legal aid funding to the national average.
It is now time to look at the needs of community law centres and their client communities and for the Palaszczuk government to invest in this important work.
Donald Trump campaign indicted after allegedly pulling a gun on staff
New York: Donald Trump's campaign has been accused of alleged inaction after it was told that its campaign manager for North Carolina pointed a gun at an employee while riding in a jeep in February.
The incident is described in a charge sheet filed Wednesday in Charlotte County Court by Vincent Bordini, a former software programmer for the campaign in that state.
Bordini said he waited for months for the matter to be settled internally before realizing that "it wasn't going to happen".
The campaign manager, Earl Philip, "pulls a gun, puts his right index finger on the trigger, and strikes the barrel into Vincent's kneecap", Bordini said in his indictment.
After complaining to local and regional campaign management, Bordini found that at least four other people had already had the same experience with Phillip, he said in the indictment.
"Weapons do not have to be fired to cause damage", Bordini said.
The indictment comes just two days after the Republican presidential candidate sparked a riot when he told a crowd in North Carolina that "Second Amendment people" - gun owners and gun lovers - should take action if his rival Hillary Clinton is elected and appoints a judge.
Trump's campaign made it clear that the media had taken his words out of context and that he would not incite violence.
Bordini's complaint is seeking damages from the campaign for breach of duty of care and from Philip for bodily harm and permanent psychological harm.
Trump's press secretary, Hope Hicks, was not available for comment.
Attempts to contact Philip have also failed.
WCCB, a local news station in Charlotte, reports that Phillip is no longer a campaign employee.
Calls to his consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services, went unanswered.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has so far run a controversial campaign.
The case is Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, Superior Court, County of Mecklenburg, Charlotte.
Berlin/Schwerin: Poll before state elections: SPD and CDU lose
The upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (4 September) and Berlin (18 September) are showing significant losses for the governing parties SPD and CDU.
This was shown by representative surveys carried out by the opinion research institute INSA for the Bild newspaper (Friday).
While the red-black government coalition could barely continue to rule in the north, polling in Berlin shows that this is not possible.
In both countries, however, the SPD would be the strongest party and would have a good chance of continuing to be the head of government.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the SPD fell from 35.6 percent five years ago to 24 percent.
The party is thus only slightly ahead of the CDU, which could again reach 23 percent.
The third place is disputed between the Left and the AfD.
The Left would be represented by 19 percent (previously 18.4 percent), while the AfD would be represented by 19 percent for the first time in the Landtag.
The Greens are back in the Schwerin parliament with 6 percent (previously 8.7 percent) despite slight losses.
The NPD and FDP would not be represented in the Landtag with 3 percent each.
The SPD's share of the vote in the Berlin parliamentary elections was only 23 percent (2011 election: 28.3 percent).
The CDU was down to 18 percent after 23.4 percent.
It is still behind the Greens with 19 percent (2011: 17.6 percent), but ahead of the Leftists with 15 percent (previously 11.7 percent).
The AfD would be represented in the Chamber of Deputies for the first time with 14 percent.
With 5 percent, the FDP could hope for a return, but the pirates would miss the entrance, unlike in 2011.
Nokia 9000 Communicator: The first smartphone
E-mail and the Internet in slow motion: 20 years ago, the Nokia Communicator came on the market.
The successors now dominate the world - its manufacturer experienced a disaster.
The device weighed almost a pound and was more than four times the weight of an iPhone 5.
It was thicker and bigger, so it didn't fit well in the hand.
On the contrary, it was rather clunky.
The built-in memory was initially eight megabytes, which would be enough for about two high-resolution selfies today.
An iPhone now ships with at least 16 gigabytes.
The Nokia 9000 Communicator went on sale exactly 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996, and it was the first smartphone.
For a few euros, lovers can still buy the devices online, but they are somehow from the Stone Age of the Internet.
But 20 years ago, the Communicator was a sensation.
The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the Cebit computer fair in Hanover as a "pocket-sized office".
In fact, the new mobile phone could do a lot for the standards of the time: SMS and e-mails could be sent and received, even by fax the communicator could be reached.
Even accessing web pages was possible through an HTML browser, albeit agonizingly slowly.
A calculator was available, along with a digital address book and an electronic calendar.
There was a small antenna, and the phone could be folded up like a laptop.
Then there was a small keyboard and a black and white screen.
The price was quite proud: 2700 D-marks, or about 1400 euros.
The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany in 2015 was 392 euros.
No one could have imagined in August 1996 that the Communicator would be the beginning of the smartphone era.
Everything's changed since then.
Smart phones are a success story, although not for Nokia.
The Finnish mobile phone business suffered an unprecedented disaster, was eventually sold to Microsoft and liquidated.
The market is now dominated by vendors who all came much later than Nokia.
Being online anytime, anywhere is a part of everyday life for many people today.
In 2015, there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide.
Some 1.4 billion devices were sold, of which Samsung and Apple alone account for 555 million.
The worldwide turnover of the equipment is around 400 billion euros.
In addition, the business of countless app providers and telecommunications companies is doing well.
A whole industry has now emerged around the smartphone.
The breakthrough to the mass market came only in early 2007, when Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced the introduction of the iPhone at Mac World.
He promised three devices in one: a music player, a phone, and an Internet communicator, all easily operated via touch screen.
Apple's triumphal march began, and today the iPhone is still the company's most important product.
Nokia, Motorola and Blackberry, which dominated the market, had the rear end.
They finally disappeared, Blackberry's struggling.
Apple and Asian vendors like Samsung are now in charge.
The smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after its invention.
On average, every German now checks his cell phone 88 times a day.
"We all need to learn to put away our smartphones", said Janina Kugel, Siemens' board member for human resources.
Permanent accessibility is now considered a curse and a blessing at the same time.
England must lead the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity not only to our local communities and to all of London, but to the entire country.
For me, that was the biggest attraction at Heathrow, just like back in 2012 in London, when we went to a lot of trouble to make sure that all our nations and regions benefited from the Games.
The Olympics brought great benefits to Stratford and the East End.
And we will do that again by creating new opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
We are already creating 10,000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs for our local communities alone and ending youth unemployment in the airport area.
Just as they did in London in 2012, there will be those who think that the challenge of Heathrow's expansion is too great.
I was told that England would never be ready for the Games and that we would be embarrassed on the world stage.
The skeptics were wrong in 2012, and they'll be wrong at Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers every question asked of him.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for many, not just for some.
Expansion is a way to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion in economic growth and leave a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and across the UK.
We have a great team at Heathrow who have implemented an £11 billion infrastructure investment programme on time and on budget, from T5 - which has been voted the world's best airport terminal for five years in a row - to T2 which was built in the middle of the world's two busiest runways.
Now they are ready to deliver a third runway, backed by £16 billion of private investment.
The London 2012 Games were a great success for Britain and I am confident that the expansion of Heathrow will be one too.
It is time we steered that Olympic spirit and expanded Heathrow, while securing our future trade and creating a legacy of skills and jobs that England can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is chairman of the Heathrow Board and former Commercial Secretary to the Treasury
Adblock Plus, Facebook in the "cat and mouse game" when it comes to ad blocking
For businesses that make money from online advertising, one software company says that trying to bypass ad blocking is "like a cat and mouse game".
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced it would block ad blocking on its desktop page, Adblock Plus published a blog post announcing that users could update their filters in the program to block ads on the social network again.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that its desktop page would change the coding for its ads to make it harder for ad blockers to detect which part of the page is advertising.
But Adblock announced that it had found a new way to bypass the new codes.
In a blog post, Adblock spokesman Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of back-and-forth battle between the ad-blocking open source community and the bystanders has been going on since the invention of ad-blockers", and that it's possible that Facebook will soon come up with a new solution.
The fact that the world's largest social media company has gotten into the fight is a strong indication of how worrying ad blockers have become for the industry.
Worldwide, according to a study last year by Pagefair and Adobe, about 200 million people use ad blockers, almost four times as many as in 2013.
With 1.03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook through their mobile devices, mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of Facebook's advertising revenue.
The company is targeting ad blockers on desktop PCs because mobile ad blockers have no effect on Facebook's mobile app for the social network and Instagram, a spokesperson said.
Advertising on desktop PCs accounts for a large enough share of revenue that Facebook seems to be worth the investment.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that it would update its "ad preference tool" to give people more control over advertising that targets them.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblock's new filters were worrying because they would also block content on the page that is not advertising.
"This is not a positive experience for users, so we plan to address the issue", a Facebook spokesperson said in an email.
Ad blockers are a blunt tool, so we've instead focused on developer tools like Ad Preferences to put more control in people's hands.
Woman killed in suspected suicide on Swiss highway
The victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are calling witnesses after a woman was hit by multiple vehicles on a highway in the early hours of Thursday morning in a suspected suicide.
The incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight.
A woman lay down in the dark "in an act of desperation" on the road and was hit by several cars, police in Vaud said.
It is obvious that a 49-year-old Swiss woman who was hit by several vehicles, including a truck, was trying to kill herself.
She died on the spot.
Several drivers have been questioned, but some are still unidentified, police said, urging them and any witnesses to report.
An investigation has been opened, which is a "logical" step in such a situation, Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneve.
It remains to be seen, however, whether any of the drivers will be indicated.
Was a collision avoidable?
This is something the prosecutor has to decide", Hofstetter said.
Two similar cases in the last five years show that drivers are not held accountable.
In each of the two cases - where a person was walking on the highway in the dark - it was decided that the drivers did not have to assume that a pedestrian was walking on the highway in the middle of the night, as the newspaper put it.
Last year, a female police officer was acquitted of negligent homicide after she hit and killed a man lying on the A1 near Payerne one night in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had been drinking and passed out on the street, the court heard.
The court found that the policewoman - who had responded to an emergency call - was driving in a justified manner and that the presence of a man on the street was a "completely extraordinary and unpredictable situation", the judge said.
Anyone with any further information about the incident that occurred Thursday morning should contact the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was once habitable
Venus was probably once habitable, according to projections from a new NASA climate model.
Scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies have developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus, with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere, could have once had Earth-like conditions.
Scientists have previously suggested that Venus' slow rotation could be explained by its dense atmosphere.
But the latest simulations suggest that Venus may have had a thin, Earth-like atmosphere and yet was slowly expanding.
The model also shed light on the topography of early Venus.
The planet probably had more dry areas than Earth, but it once had enough water and geographic variability to support life and protect it from rapid evaporation.
Early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent matter.
"In the GISS model simulation, Venus' slow rotation exposes its day side to the sun for almost two months", explained GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release.
This heats the surface and produces rain, which creates a thick layer of clouds, acting like an umbrella to shield the surface from much of the sun's heat.
The result is average temperatures that are several degrees cooler than Earth's today.
The model produced a history of Venus that is similar to the evolution previously assumed by planetary scientists.
Although it was probably habitable at one time, Venus was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light over the course of billions of years.
Their oceans evaporated and their water vapor was burned away by ultraviolet light.
When they escaped the hydrogen, all that was left was a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus we know today.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy is stepping down as Avalanche coach.
Patrick Roy resigned as coach and vice president of hockey operations of the Colorado Avalanche on Thursday, citing a lack of say in the team's decision-making process.
Alternate president/general manager of the Colorado Joe Sakic confirmed this decision and noted that the club will immediately look for a new coach.
"For the past three years, I have performed my duties as head coach and vice president of hockey operations for the Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination", Roy, 50, said in a statement.
I've spent a long, long time over the summer thinking about how I could improve this team, give it more depth, what it needs, and take it to a higher level.
To achieve this, the vision of the coach and Vice President of Hockey Operations must be perfectly aligned with that of the organization.
He also needs to have a say in decisions that affect the team's performance.
These conditions are not currently met.
Sakic, who had hired Roy on 23 May 2013, thanked him for his contributions to the team.
"Patrick informed me today of this decision", Sakic said.
We all appreciate what he has done for our organization and wish him all the best for the future.
Roy was named the winner of the Jack Adams Award as the league's top coach during his debut season with the Avalanches in 2013-14.
He led the club to 112 points and first place in the Central Vision, but Colorado was defeated in the first round of the playoffs by Minnesota and missed the postseason in each of the last two years.
The Avalanches posted a 39-39-4 record in the 2015-16 season, falling behind the Wild for a second wildcard spot in the Western Conference by five points.
As a Hall of Fame goalie, Roy won four Stanley Cups -- two with the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers resume talks, strike out
Labour disputes over pay for North Sea oil workers will be suspended while all parties to the dispute sit down for a new round of talks, negotiators said.
Strikes against the oilfield service provider Wood Group have been sporadically carried out on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group and the Unite and RMT unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the process of settling the current dispute", a joint statement said.
We will be holding a number of full-day meetings in the coming weeks, starting early next year, to re-address the problems.
The unions said their latest strike, the first in more than 25 years, was a protest against possible pay cuts of up to 30 percent.
Wood Group has cut rates to its contractors in the North Sea by about 9 percent this year due to negative market pressure.
The company's rate reduction follows a 10% decrease for onshore contractors in 2014.
The company said that additional cuts give the company the space it needs to get through the market downturn.
Shell, for its part, has laid off thousands of people and announced plans to abandon its oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries as it streamlines its operations as a result of its mega-merger with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure from lower crude oil prices, an economic situation that was exacerbated by the British decision to leave the European Union in June.
Scottish MP Dave Anderson met with labour leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labour disputes to take place in the North Sea in a generation.
The North Sea is important for the regional economy, he said.
"In the North Sea and across the country, we need an economy that works for many and not just a few", he said in a statement.
In 2016, less than $1.4 billion is expected to be spent on new projects in the North Sea, compared to an average of around $7 billion over the past five years.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of stars in the Pleiades
The latest Kepler space telescope mission has helped astronomers to compile the most complete catalogue of rotation rates among the stars of the Pleiades.
The new data help astronomers to understand why stars in clusters rotate at different rates and how rotation periods are related to planet formation.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other star clusters, we can learn more about the relationship between a star's mass, its age, and even the history of its solar system", said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a news release.
The Pleiades star cluster is 445 light-years from Earth.
Many stars in this cluster, which formed about 125 million years ago, are now reaching adulthood.
They're spinning fastest now.
At peak rotation rates, these maturing stars emit large amounts of stellar winds.
Because these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a slowing effect on the stars.
When a star ages, its rate of rotation begins to slow.
Kepler measures the rate of rotation of each star by detecting the time between the appearance of a noticeable star spot -- like a sunspot.
The latest catalog of rotation rates suggests that more massive stars rotate more slowly than less massive stars.
Rebull compares the stars to dancers, with larger stars spinning slower than smaller ones.
"In the 'ballet' of the Pleiades, we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive, whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright stars", Rebull said.
Because the Pleiades are so close, they serve as an ideal cosmic laboratory for comparing stellar qualities, such as rotation rates.
"The Pleiades cluster provides an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions, younger and older", Rebull said.
There's still a lot we want to learn about, like how, when and why stars slow down their rotation rates and hang up their dancing shoes, so to speak.
Rebull and her colleagues have reported extensively on their latest analysis of the rotation rates of the Pleiades in three newspaper reports, which will soon appear in the Astronomical Journal.
A controversial baseball star is stepping down
Tears ran faster on Alex Rodriguez than the American baseball star in his prime from base to base.
After his emotional announcement of his retirement, the 41-year-old pro will wear his New York Yankees jersey for the last time on August 12 against the Tampa Bay Rays.
"I love this game and I love this team".
"I say goodbye to both of them", said the 14-time Major League Baseball (MLB) All-Star.
Rodriguez was named the league's Most Valuable Player three times, and he won the World Series with the Yankees in 2009.
His signing of a ten-year contract earned him $27 million annually since 2007.
He will continue to act as a consultant and youth coach until the end of his contract on 31 December 2017 - with full salary.
As a player, Rodriguez paid it off with performance for a long time.
He has 696 home runs, 3114 hits and 2021 runs batted in for the Seattle Mariners (1994 to 2000), Texas Rangers (2001 to 2004), and Yankees since 2005.
With Hall of Famers Hank Aaron and Willie Mays, only two other baseball players have similar scores in the major statistics.
But the 41-year-old is not expected to be inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame.
Because as successful as Rodriguez - nicknamed "A-Rod" - was on the field, so controversial is his performance off the field.
Back in 2009, the superstar admitted to ESPN that he took banned steroids between 2001 and 2003.
In August 2013, he was suspended for 211 games until the end of 2014 due to his involvement in the so-called Biogenesis scandal.
Rodriguez is considered the prime suspect in the years of performance-enhancing drugs being administered through an anti-aging clinic in South Florida.
After a court battle, the ban was reduced to 162 meetings.
"The league might have even done me a favor for 2014, because I played 20 years without a break", Rodriguez said then smugly.
His farewell days are not silent either.
While many baseball legends are getting back on the big stage in their final games, Rodriguez has had to sit on the bench a lot.
"My job doesn't include a farewell tour".
"My job is to try to win every game", said Yankees coach Joe Girardi.
After all, Rodriguez, who was married to actress Cameron Diaz and is said to have had affairs with pop star Madonna and actress Kate Hudson, got sympathy from fans of Yankee rival Boston Red Sox.
"We want A-Rod", the fans sang in the 4-9 loss to the Rodriguez team.
2016 Olympics: Chen Xinyi, Silwia Danekova and Adrian Zielinski are the first doping cases
Caught: Positive doping test prevents weightlifter Adrian Zielinski from Poland from competing in Rio.
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympics are being overshadowed by the first official doping cases.
A caught athlete would have almost won a medal.
Before the seventh day of competition, the first official doping cases have become known the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 3000-meter hurdler Silwia Danekowa from Bulgaria and Polish weightlifter Adrian Zielinski tested positive and were banned from Brazil - just before the start of the critically-watched athletics competitions.
Chen had already been tested last Sunday for the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide, which is used as a masking agent for doping substances.
The International Court of Justice (CAS) confirmed their exclusion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon.
On Sunday, the 18-year-old had taken fourth place in the final of the 100 m butterfly, missing the bronze medal by only 0.09 seconds.
On Friday, Chen was supposed to compete in the 50m freestyle.
Chen has requested the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to open the B-test and hold a hearing.
The national federation "takes the matter very seriously and demands Chen's full cooperation in the investigation", Xinhua quoted a statement as saying: "We will cooperate with the International Court of Justice CAS and will accept the verdict".
For the first time in history, the IOC is no longer responsible for sanctioning athletes with positive cases, but the CAS.
Also on the night of Rio, news of Danekova's positive test leaked out, putting the 33-year-old on the offensive herself.
"I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive", she said, "an incredible shock", she told Bulgarian TV station BNT.
She was innocent, "the only explanation could be supplements", the athlete explained.
The report says that the banned substance is the blood-doping agent EPO.
Danekova has been provisionally suspended. BNT says the B-sample is positive.
Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borisov immediately spoke out against the athlete.
"I don't understand why the athletes don't draw the right conclusions", he said. "We Bulgarians are under observation, so many have already been excluded".
For example, all weightlifters from the nation with chronic doping problems are not allowed to compete in Rio.
On Friday, the case of Adrian Zielinski, the London Olympic champion in the under 85kg weight class, was also announced. He tested positive for the anabolic steroid nandrolone, like his brother Tomasz, three days earlier.
Both deny taking it, but neither can start in the 94kg class.
Before the athletes start, the Danekova case in particular is another blow to the reputation of the sport as a whole.
The IAAF World Federation had banned the entire Russian team from the race, with one exception, for systematic doping, and the runner nation of Kenya produced many bad news in Rio.
In swimming, past offenses in China have also caused violent clashes between athletes.
So the Frenchman Camille Lacourt attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang harshly.
"Sun Yang is peeing purple".
"When I see the 200m freestyle podium, I want to vomit", Lacourt told French radio.
Sun was also at the centre of a dispute with Mack Horton of Australia.
"I have no time for doping cheaters and no respect for them", he said.
Sun tested positive for the stimulant trimetazidine at the 2014 Chinese Championships, but only had to serve a three-month ban.
How treacherous hackers extort ransom
Blackmail malware developers are now targeting companies - and succeeding.
According to a recent survey of 540 companies in North America, the United Kingdom, and Germany, conducted by malware protection specialist Malwarebytes, 40 percent of the companies surveyed were victims of a ransomware attack at least once, sometimes repeatedly, in the past 12 months.
In Germany, almost 20 percent of companies have been the target of ransomware extortion.
Forty percent of the victims willingly paid the ransom demanded by the perpetrators in order to regain access to the systems and data that were compromised.
The perpetrators are increasingly specializing their blackmail software in attacks on corporate networks, according to Malwarebytes' observations.
If they succeed, the potential ransom to be extorted is significantly higher than for private users.
"We are currently witnessing an alarmingly rapid evolution of malware", explains Malwarebytes CEO Marcin Kleczynski in an interview with Welt.
In 2008, most malware programs were still designed to send ads.
Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for themselves.
First, the target was private users, but the shift to corporate attacks has been alarmingly rapid in recent months.
Ransomware works in a simple pattern: Once active on a victim's computer, it specifically searches for recently modified files, such as Word, Excel, or database files, as well as archives of images and videos.
These files are encrypted by the ransomware and the originals are permanently deleted.
The software then presents the demands of the blackmailers.
To get the final encryption code to the files, the victims have to transfer money - usually in the form of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin.
But whereas private users are concerned with personal photo databases, companies are concerned with sensitive customer or project databases, without which production stops.
Accordingly, the damage is higher when a ransomware attacks.
22 percent of the German companies affected reported loss of revenue due to ransomware, 13 percent even had to completely cease business operations, in one case people's lives were in danger.
In Germany, hospitals have already been the victims of attacks on several occasions, where patients may be at acute risk of losing their medical records.
"We always tell the victims: Don't pay, you're only contributing to the problem", Kleczynski explains.
But 80 to 90 percent of the companies that pay get their data back.
It is difficult for managers to refuse the demands of the perpetrators in the face of a shutdown.
Hackers, in turn, know this and try everything to build a good reputation.
In a recent study, security researchers at F-Secure looked at user interfaces and contact with blackmailers and concluded that the attackers were actually trying to build some kind of customer service to make more money.
They explain to their victims in chat how to pay with Bitcoin, set up open support websites, or decrypt sample files for free.
And if individuals are redeemed after paying a few hundred euros, companies sometimes have to negotiate hard and pay five-figure sums to get their data back unencrypted.
Given the high and relatively low-risk potential of ransomware extortion, hackers are becoming more professional and sharing the work, explains security expert Chester Wisniewski of antivirus company Sophos: "A single person can write a ransomware within about a week".
However, it is more likely that it is three or four people.
The programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software kit to the actual blackmailers.
The malware kits that we've seen so far have been created by buying the malware itself, consulting and additional tools for a one-time, fixed price of between $1,000 and $10,000.
"A customization tool is included, so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed", says Wisniewski.
The blackmailers then look for more hackers to distribute the newly purchased software to the victims.
We live in a service economy.
So you log into one of the underground forums, buy the kit from one criminal, and then you have another one install the software on as many computers as possible.
Payment is per infected computer.
"Usually, the criminals then hire spammers to distribute it", explains Wisniewski.
The risk of ransomware is now known to many companies who are better at securing their data.
Over 50 percent of enterprise IT leaders in the Malwarebytes survey trust that file backups and scanner software can help prevent ransomware.
Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.
"When encryption alone is no longer a sufficient threat to successful hacking, attackers threaten to release sensitive data, such as customer lists or price lists", explains Malwarebytes CEO Marcin Kleczynski.
This means that the potential for damage is many times higher than before, depending on the type of data.
In the future, criminals could also target entirely new targets in the Internet of Things.
At the Defcon hacker conference, security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the Internet under their control.
In the middle of winter, unlocking a blocked heater could be worth the ransom for many victims.
If criminals then block an entire production line in a factory in the future instead of heating, ransomware could also become an issue in Industry 4.0.
One for all the cases
The Honda HR-V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
In the small HR-V, Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupe and also the versatility of a minivan.
Sounds pretty overwhelming, but the HR-V, built on the same new platform as the new Jazz, actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday use.
Although the HR-V is only 1.60 metres high and appears rather small, there is plenty of room for passengers in both the front and back row, and it does not seem cramped anywhere.
The materials of the interior are well-made and look pleasant, except for the cockpit top that falls off a little.
The HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles in terms of storage space.
Not only is there a 453 litre luggage compartment for upright and 1026 litres for folded backs, but there are the "Magic Seats".
It's not as magical as it sounds: The back seat folds up like a movie chair, giving storage space that's four feet high from floor to ceiling.
The boot is well loaded, but the loading height is slightly higher at 650 mm than the comparable 2008 Peugeot.
The tested 1.6-litre diesel engine with 88 kW/120 hp accelerates the HR-V very powerfully thanks to a torque of up to 300 Nm over wide speed ranges.
He should, however, do his work a little quieter.
The daily consumption of 4.7 l/100 km is satisfactory.
There is another engine: a 1.5-litre petrol engine with 96 kW/130 hp.
All-wheel drive is not offered.
The driving behaviour is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort.
The steering should be a little more direct.
The equipment is unprecedented in the top-of-the-range executive variant tested.
The safety systems include the City Emergency Brake Assist (up to 32 rpm), the Collision Warning System and the Lane Stop Assist.
The collision warning system sometimes becomes irritating because it rates many obstacles as "approaching objects" when ranking.
The remote light assistant works very reliably.
And the intelligent timing device responds to the traffic sign recognition and reduces speed when necessary.
But full connectivity is only available for the top-of-the-line hardware: 7-inch touchscreen, navigation, app integration and more.
Two USB and one HDMI sockets are located under the armrest and are therefore somewhat cumbersome to reach.
The roughly 29,000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are fine.
If you don't want to spend that much, you can get a petrol engine from 20000 euros, a diesel from 23000 euros.
The engines comply with the Euro 6 emission standard.
The HR-V is a versatile and everyday car.
The airline is not liable for the fall on the passenger deck.
An airline is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the flight deck.
The Oberlandesgericht Düsseldorf argued that liability was only conceivable in the case of hazards typical of air transport (Az.: 18 U 124/14).
The plaintiff had broken his kneecap in the fall.
However, the accident could have happened anywhere - it is a general risk to life, the court said.
The airline did not have to pay the man any compensation.
In case of illness: when will the organiser pay?
The Commission has also proposed that the Commission should be given the opportunity to submit proposals for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to ionising radiation.
This is only the case if more than 10 percent of the guests have been shown to have the same symptoms.
In the case at hand, a family was seriously ill with diarrhoea and vomiting on the second day of their holiday in Turkey.
She spent almost the entire holiday in the room.
The illness was attributed to a faulty sewage treatment plant that allegedly contaminated the seawater.
The family felt that the trip was flawed - and filed a complaint against the organizer.
The plaintiffs were unsuccessful in court.
The sewage treatment plant was indeed broken.
However, the organizer only learned about it shortly before the plaintiffs left.
He had to assume that the seawater was fine by then.
The Court held that he had not breached his duty to provide information.
Especially since the water samples were clean.
The disease of several hotel guests - possibly from contagion among themselves - is a general life risk.
Of the 691 guests, only 38 became ill.
De Maizière said that after the violence perpetrated by refugees in Würzburg and Ansbach in July, many people were worried about further attacks.
The State must respond to terrorist threats with both prudence and determination.
What is certain is that our country will not respond to the violence of the perpetrators with hatred and division.
We will not allow terrorists to win this victory.
But if criminals were to be forced to leave the country more quickly, it would increase security and also increase public support for refugee policy.
De Maizière wants to see the proposals implemented by the 2017 federal election.
He also announced a further increase in the security forces' personnel, "on a medium four-digit scale over several years".
The Commission has also proposed that the European Parliament should be consulted on the draft directive.
The Commission is proposing to improve video surveillance and amend the gun law to make it more difficult to buy guns on the Internet.
The recent high-profile medical confidentiality agreement is to be maintained, de Maiziere said.
The Commission is also proposing to increase the number of EU-funded projects in the field of education and training.
The Minister considers that better social care is necessary to counteract the radicalisation of refugees.
Teachers should be better prepared to deal with traumatized people.
To pursue criminals in specific areas of the Internet (darknet), de Maizière plans to use undercover investigators.
SPD leader Gabriel said: "The SPD is ready to talk about anything that helps to further increase security".
It is important that the Minister of the Interior has spoken out against activism.
"This was a slap in the face to the sharp-faced in the CDU/CSU", Gabriel told the newspapers of the Funke Mediengruppe (Friday).
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to ionising radiation.
The Commission has also proposed that the Council should adopt a decision on the conclusion of the agreement.
You can't ban everything you refuse, and I refuse to wear the burqa.
You can talk about traffic rules or about witnesses in court.
The Green Party leader Simone Peter accused the minister of trying to simulate force and capacity for action with ever new anti-terrorism packages.
The European Parliament has also been asked to vote on the draft resolution on the situation in the former Yugoslavia.
Improved traffic flow on the motorway
It's a regular traffic jam on the bypass road -- this is a November photo.
But that will change: the right of appeal will be extended.
This is good news for all drivers who are stuck on the motorway every evening when they cross the motorway junction (A43).
The Landbetrieb Straßenbau will extend the right-of-way by 700 metres on Tuesday and Wednesday (16/17 August) in the area between Hammer Straße and the exit Weseler Straße.
Drivers can then turn right from Hammer Road.
The major advantage is that traffic is split up earlier, which improves overall flow on the busy section of the 51st Federal Road.
The idea of the extended exit was the idea of the CDU group in the Münster-West district council.
The narrowing of the road on the roadbed is particularly annoying to drivers between 5 and 7 p.m.
On weekdays, the backlog reaches up to the bridge over the Alberslohweg and sometimes beyond.
The reason is the needle hole on the B51 just before the exit Weseler Straße.
From here, traffic is only directed one lane over the highway bridge.
The second track had to be rebuilt about three quarters of a century ago.
The reason was that static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer had the necessary load capacity to handle heavy goods traffic, especially on two tracks.
The competent national company cannot say how long this bottleneck and the associated congestion will last.
However, it will take years, as the bridge has an official end-of-life until 2034.
The national authorities have deliberately chosen the less congested period during school holidays to extend the right-of-way, as they expect to encounter obstacles.
Traffic will pass the site on Tuesdays and Wednesdays on a single track.
Intercultural travel: cultural activities for schools
The international class of the forest school visited the play "The Invisible House".
Nima's Association and Young Theatre are planning a musical project.
The Nima's Association enables young people with a migrant and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster.
The "International Class" of the Waldschule Kinderhaus attended a performance of the award-winning play "Das unsichtbare Haus" by the Junge Theater Münster.
In the context of the "Intercultural Journey" initiated by Nima's Association, 19 students between 11 and 15 years of age attended the production in the Little House.
Since the beginning of the year, the association, which aims to promote the cultural integration of young people from migrant and refugee backgrounds, has been offering schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project.
Most of the students in the class had come to Münster from Afghanistan, Iran, Serbia and Syria, among other countries, between September 2015 and March 2016 and spoke little German.
The choreography, the scenic images and the video animations made it possible for them to follow the action, according to the press release of the Young Theater Münster.
The Nima's Association, founded by Dr. Tannaz Westerberg from Sprakel, and the Junge Theater will work together in the coming season in a musical theatre project.
From October to December, young people between 14 and 20 years of age, with and without a refugee or migrant background, will have the opportunity to attend vocationally-guided courses in singing, dancing, acting and music.
The programme is designed to provide children and families with theatre and theatre language training.
The project "Intercultural Travel" is continuing.
In view of the increasing number of refugees, the association expects many classes to participate.
Rain instead of starbursts: Hope for better weather
The weather has taken a toll on the stargazers in southwestern Germany on Friday night - but there is hope.
The night was not a good one to watch the spectacle because of clouds and rain, said the head of the Welzheim Observatory, Hans-Ulrich Keller, on Friday morning.
Our hope lies in the night before Saturday.
The weather should be nice, then we'll probably see a lot of shooting stars in the sky.
The shooting stars are Perseids, which are among the fastest shooting stars at 216,000 kilometers per hour.
They got their name because they seem to come from the constellation Perseus, which rises in the northeast.
A restful night: Tips for sleeping disorders
At night you roll around forever, at night you lie awake for hours, in the morning you are long gone from sleep before the alarm.
This is far from relaxing.
After all, such problems are not uncommon. According to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults have sleep problems, and more than 10 percent often or permanently find their sleep unrestful.
How do sleep problems or sleep disorders manifest themselves?
There are several forms of sleep disorders, and they can have a variety of causes, emphasizes Hans- Günter Weeß, a board member of the German Society for Sleep Research and Sleep Medicine.
But what is commonly understood is insomnia, a sleep disorder.
Sleeping through is what many people find unsatisfying or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, a board member of the German Association of Family Physicians who practices in Varel, Lower Saxony.
What causes sleep disorders?
The causes of sleep disorders are complex.
This may be due to organic, psychological, or behavioral factors, as well as medications.
Often, the sleep disorder is a manifestation of another illness.
"Waking up too early is especially common in depression", says Weeß.
And it may be that different factors are causing each other.
For example, someone with a herniated disc may lie unwell, wake up every two to three hours, and may begin to dwell on everyday problems and worries, explains Weiss.
This creates tension, and sleep is no longer possible.
When Should You See a Doctor for Sleep Disorders?
Weiss advises that those who have been sleeping poorly for at least three nights a week for a month and are disturbed during the day should see a doctor.
The disorder can be quite different: you are discouraged, tired, sleep deprived, have trouble paying attention and concentrating, are easily irritable, have mood swings or physical ailments such as stomach or headache.
To alleviate sleep disorders, it is important to find out their causes.
Treatment options include behavioral changes, cognitive behavioral therapy, or medication - conventional sleeping pills only in exceptional cases and for a maximum of two weeks.
There are hardly any established sleep doctors in Germany, emphasizes Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary Sleep Medicine Centre at the Charité Universitaire Berlin.
That is why the first thing to do when you have sleep problems is to see your doctor, advises Weiss.
He can use tests to determine if the problems have a physical cause.
Who's going to the sleep lab, and what happens?
For example, doctors recommend a sleep lab test for snoring with respiratory arrest, for sick daytime tiredness, for sleepwalking, or if the cause of a sleep disorder cannot be found, explains Fietze.
You don't have to prepare for the exam.
You should spend the day normally.
"Please don't take a nap", says Fietze.
After you've wired it, you go to bed at your usual time.
In addition to the electrodes on the body, you wear a pair of goggles, a breast belt, and a finger sensor.
A camera on the ceiling also records the sleeping.
How can those affected cope?
There are quite a few screws you can use to get better sleep.
The key is to get regular bedtimes, to stay in bed, to stay awake during the day, to watch television when you fall asleep, to avoid alcohol and to avoid looking at the clock at night.
What Jungle Camp Has to Do With Missing Medals in Swimming
Former German swimmer Markus Deibler has commented on Facebook on the disappointing performance of the DSV team at Olympis.
In December 2014, he won his first gold medal at the short track world championships in Doha, setting his first world record.
Now, former DSV athlete Markus Deibler has taken a stand on Facebook to protect himself from his critically-reviewed former teammates.
"In a country where an Olympic winner gets a €20,000 prize and a jungle king €150,000, no one should be surprised by missing medals", the 26-year-old wrote on his Facebook page on Friday night.
The promotion system in swimming is bad, but the doping controls are very good.
We cannot compete with countries which promote a lot and do not look at or even practice doping.
"I am not saying that controls should be abolished here", he said.
If he wanted to make a comeback, Deibler would have to be registered with the National Anti-Doping Agency of Germany (NADA) nine months before his first start.
That's the way you should think about countries.
"Anyone who cannot be checked by independent WADA/FINA inspectors for a certain period of time before the World Cup/Olympics is not allowed to participate", says the Hamburg-based election official, who now runs an ice cream shop.
Airport: Gang of baggage thieves arrested
Professional thieves at Düsseldorf Airport
Civil investigators from the Düsseldorf police managed to arrest two women and two men aged 50 to 61 on Thursday.
The suspects had committed several bag and purse thefts as a gang.
At about 9:30 p.m., civil servants in the area of Düsseldorf Airport recognized a gang known to the police from past theft offenses.
The two women and two men had committed several offences since mid-July this year, and had acted in a cooperative, work-sharing and particularly professional manner.
The specialists of the Criminal Police Office 34 can prove four things to thieves who entered Germany specifically to commit crimes.
In total, they had taken over 15,000 euros.
Old buildings, a few linden trees, and a remnant of cobblestone pavement in between: Rigaer Straße in Berlin-Friedrichshain may not seem like it at first glance, but the police list it as one of the "Dangerous Places" in the city.
If you walk along the street from east to west, you will pass playgrounds, a newly painted kindergarten and a drugstore.
Someone sprayed "ugly" on the facade of a gray house.
A building is already being built opposite Lidl, which is also soon to be demolished: by 2017 a house with high windows and 133 new rental apartments are to be built here.
However, in recent weeks articles about this "trendy district", as the property company Friedrichshain calls it, have been featuring cars on fire.
The reason is the house with number 94: it was once occupied, now the inhabitants have lease agreements, but the ground floor is still occupied and used for events.
In particular, the Berlin interior senator Henkel had repeatedly spoken out since the beginning of the year in favour of a harsh police action against the project, calling the area a "no-go zone" for police and the 94 as a starting point for autonomous violence.
After the ground floor quarters, the Cadet Forge, were cleared on June 22 with 300 police officers, the police patrolled for three weeks, according to official statements, with 30 to 40 officers and three squad cars on site, blocking parts of the street and preventing visitors from entering the 94 house.
Meanwhile, construction workers were renovating the rooms on behalf of the unknown owners.
On July 13, a Berlin administrative court ruled that the eviction was illegal, and a day later police and construction workers withdrew to cheers from supporters and residents.
On this summer afternoon, the street seems peaceful: parents are walking with their children, people are sitting on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others are talking late.
In the immediate vicinity of the housing projects there is a primary school and kindergartens.
Left-wing violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in the district since 1999, and Jana*, who is raising three children, are especially annoyed by the police presence.
They share the concerns of the residents of the slums about rising rents and gentrification.
It does not sound like a town that was mostly seeking police protection from vandalising leftists.
The trench that the Berlin interior senator and the police are opening between squatters and their neighbors does not seem to exist.
Friedrichshain in eastern Berlin was originally a traditional working class district, which still has a low average income and high risk of poverty compared to the rest of the city.
The occupation of houses and the resulting housing projects have long been part of the Kiez: in 1990 numerous houses in the former GDR were occupied, including almost all of Mainzer Straße, very close to Rigaer.
While Mainz was cleared in a street fight under heavy police action, many of the projects in Riga were legalized and some are still inhabited by the people who occupied them 26 years ago.
At the same time, the district has become an increasing magnet for tourists and voters from all over the world in recent years: residents from the GDR and former squatters now share their quarters with them.
This is also evident in rents, which have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009 in new rentals.
Many of the new buildings in Riga are being attacked as symbols of this development: you can recognize them by the windows that have been thrown in or the freshly painted facades that have been painted with paint bags.
No other street was mentioned so often this year alongside the words "left-wing violence".
One reason why not all neighbors see this as a problem may be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: crimes such as assault are almost exclusively targeted at police officers, according to statistics.
The majority of crimes are property damage, which tends to affect newly built and newly renovated houses.
Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in a rented house next to the controversial 94 for 17 years, is not at all unsure.
As for violence, she is reassuring: the people in 94 are her neighbors, who certainly did not do it.
The famous burning cars have long since disappeared from the Riga area.
For the architect, her street is not a crime scene, on the contrary: "Here you help each other, live together on the street and get more out of each other than anywhere else".
New builder moved to Rigaer Street and stayed.
That's why it was so important to her that the residents get their streets back: from the police, the politicians and the media, who suddenly claimed the supremacy of interpretation over the district in July.
But in the eyes of residents and newcomers alike, the road continues to be taken away from them: by faceless new buildings in former building gaps that displace the old residents.
"These are ultimately condos that are not interesting to many people here - they are more likely to be inhabited by people who are not so well-fed", she says.
"I can't condone violence and destruction in any way".
But what's the point of being listened to?
There is frustration on all sides, including the police and the residents.
Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding of people who are upset about color bombs: the house projects and the left scene were part of the quizz.
Movers should be aware of this - just as someone moving into a bar district may have a bad complaint about noise.
All persons presented by first name only have asked not to be named by their real names
Urbach: Annika Deuschle is the new High Commissioner for Refugees
Annika Deuschle is the contact person for integration and the organiser.
She's also a social worker on the ground.
Since July, Annika Deuschle has been the refugee commissioner for Urbach.
The social educator supports the management team around Achim Grockenberger.
It sees itself as a point of contact for all actors: refugees, the refugee aid workforce, administration, authorities and anyone else involved.
Regine Kunze from the working group suggests that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deuschle is here now, the egg-laying woolly milk owl, which has a problem above all.
This was the view of some - not mockingly but rather aiming at the large number of desirable areas of work - when the administration sought to tender the post.
The aim was to find an administrative professional with a talent for languages and people, combined with many years of experience in social work, a legendary sheep.
But administrative work is not her main area of expertise, says Annika Deuschle.
It is mainly about organisation, working with people on the ground and also behind the scenes and networking.
The 31-year-old has been with the firm for about six weeks.
She's limited a 50 percent job to three years.
"It was high time", says Regine Kunde, that Annika Deuschle supported honorary and principal actors.
There are big and small problems, organizational, human and communication problems.
New containers will soon be on the Wasenstraße
The problem of finding accommodation for the refugees who have been recognised has been a serious one for some time.
The local authorities are responsible for the provision of accommodation.
They must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented accommodation.
The costs of building, renting or renovating these accommodation facilities must be borne by the municipalities themselves.
The responsibility for this shifted from the county council office to the local authority and the job centre.
Problem: There are vacant properties, but not every landlord wants to offer their apartment.
The search has been very difficult for some time.
The administration is not actually finding private housing.
It has not worked so far, and it is dependent on private housing, says Deuschle.
That is why the communal housing must be covered, as they say.
So soon new containers will be placed in the Wasenstraße.
But it's not just housing that's done.
The key word is perspective, Regine Kunde and Annika Deuschle agree.
Apart from a permanent home, traineeships, training places, schools, single euro jobs and support activities for refugees and migrants need to be found or set up.
"More seats would be good", reports Regine Kunde.
Many work in the yard or help housekeepers, doing community service - and doing so motivated and very neatly, as Annika Deuschle reports.
She hopes that the work for the community will have a positive external impact.
It's not occupational therapy.
But activity is not just work.
The day needs a firm structure, say Deuschle and Kunde.
People should develop a sense of belonging.
So it needs services like sports, contact with locals and most importantly language courses.
Professional courses are rare.
So here again, administration and volunteers are stepping in.
It is essential that refugees feel welcome and wanted in Germany.
The long duration of the proceedings is a problem.
You have to explain to the refugees that it takes time and that they can use that time in a meaningful way, for example, with language lessons.
If you ever feel that you can't help anyone in Urbach, that you can't work and that you're useless, you'll never integrate.
The clear majority is motivated.
But there are also problems, says Kunte honestly, "people who can't do anything".
He said it was all a "mammoth task".
A difficult question: are the two afraid of radicalization after the recent events, even in a small community like Urbach?
"No", says Regine Kunde very clearly, "what some might call naive". A residual risk could and did not want to exclude it.
The Commission has already taken a number of measures to ensure that the situation is not affected.
These incidents are also a problem for refugees.
They're afraid the assassins will completely discredit them.
"They want to show that they have nothing to do with it", says Regine Kunde.
Many people would like to stay in Urbach.

They always have in mind that soon a new wave of refugees and migrants could come to Urbach.
Does Germany need a ceiling?
The answer to this question is one that politicians are afraid to give.
Actually, it's unfair to put them on the ground.
"We have not yet reached our destination in Urbach", says Annika Deuschle.
No new refugees, that would ease the situation.
Regine Kunde also makes it clear that the Urbachians are already busy integrating the previous people in a reasonable way.
This is currently about 100 people, mostly young men.
But when people are in need, they need help, both women agree.
The political situation in the world is so complicated, there are no easy answers.
