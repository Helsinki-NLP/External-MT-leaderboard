The rapidly increasing incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, 1 January to 15 March 2020
The increasing incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases reflects similar trends in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom which ensures that, although at different stages across countries, the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly across all countries.
Based on the Italian experience, countries, hospitals and critical care units should increase their readiness to receive more COVID-19 patients who will require health care, and especially to care for the critically ill.
On 31 December 2019, a group of people with pneumonia cases of unknown aetiology was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the causative agent is a novel coronavirus now called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease resulting from SARS-CoV-2 has been named coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Evidence to date indicates that 80% of people with COVID-19 have a mild illness, i.e., a respiratory illness that is accompanied or not accompanied by pneumonia, and most of these people recover.
In 14% of cases, COVID-19 progresses to a severe acute illness requiring hospitalization while the remaining 6% of cases develop a severe acute illness requiring intensive care.
The death rate for patients hospitalized due to COVID-19 is 4%.
In this study, we examine trends in the increasing incidence of COVID-19 in each European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) country and the United Kingdom (UK) and compare them with those in Hubei Province, China.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK with that of Italy between 31 January15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK
After China, COVID-19 spread widely by geographical area and the current evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic worldwide follows that of this country.
On 11 March 2020, the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that COVID-19 is a pandemic.
A 5 March 2020 issue of Eurosurveillance, Spiteri et al. reported the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe that matched the WHO definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 from people returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases had been detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (UK), meaning that between 31 December 2019 and that date, 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths had been reported, of which 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths were in Italy alone.
Detecting the increasing number and increasing incidence of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the COVID-19 case statistics for each country worldwide, obtained solely from official sources such as the Ministry of Health of each country, national and regional health authorities and WHO, are updated daily at 8:00 a.m.
This data was used to analyse COVID-19 trends in the EU/EEA and the UK, and compared them to those in Italy.
As a representative of the frequency of ongoing COVID-19 cases, we count the increasingly intermittent incidence of 14-day COVID-19 cases, thus taking into account the natural progression of COVID-19, in each EU/EEA country and the UK, during the period 1 January15 March 2020.
We also presented the increasing number of reported cases for each country on 15 March 2020 8:00 a.m. compared to Italy in the period 31 January15 March 2020.
COVID-19 trends in the EU/EEA and the UK
Trends in the 14-day sustained incidence of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK generally follow those in Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
Overall in the EU/EEA and the UK, the incidence of COVID-19 began to rise around 21 February and peaked on 28 February 2020 (Reference Appendix).
This is largely driven by the rapid increase in the number of reported cases from Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the UK show similar upward trends in the increasing number of COVID-19 cases (Study Appendix).
Figure 2 shows the increasing number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK compared to that in Italy during the period 31 January15 March 2020.
It highlights that, as of 8am on 15 March, the other 15 EU/EEA countries and the UK had already reported a total comparable to that of Italy 3 weeks earlier or less.
Our results show that the number of reported cases of COVID-19 is rising rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The trends noted in the increasing incidence of COVID-19 indicate that the pandemic is progressing at the same pace in all countries.
This is despite countries being at different stages, differences in national public health response, and possibly different definitions of the condition in countries and different protocols for selecting patients to be tested for COVID-19, including follow-up testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in affected regions of Italy described a situation where 10% of COVID-19 patients required intensive care and media sources reported that hospitals and intensive care units in these regions had reached their maximum capacity.
Data on admission of COVID-19 patients to hospital and/or intensive care unit are available at EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% of cases, respectively (data not shown).
It should, however, be compiled in a systematic way so that it is consistent with current surveillance data focusing on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
A 201011 survey showed a large variation in the availability of intensive care and intensive care beds in Europe, from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100,000 population in Portugal.
This means that countries may have more or fewer resources than Italy (12.5 intensive care and average care beds per 100,000 population in 2010).
Simulations of conditions associated with health care overcapacity, providing an estimate for each EU/EEA country and the UK for the increase in hospital admissions due to COVID-19 associated with a >90% risk of overcapacity of critical care beds, are provided in the sixth review of the ECDC's rapid risk assessment for COVID-19.
As cases are concentrated in certain regions in EU/EEA countries and the UK, and hospitals and intensive care units generally serve specific regional populations, information on cases and intensive care beds should be available at the level of the Nomenclature of territorial units for statistics 2 (NUTS-2).
The Italian experience and current trends in other countries indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly growing in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care units should prepare for the scenario of continued SARS-CoV-2 transmission and an increase in COVID-19 patients requiring medical care, and especially intensive care, as experienced in the affected regions in Italy.
As demonstrated in the ECDC's recent rapid risk assessment, a rapid, aggressive and proactive approach is essential to delay the spread of SARS-COV-2, by making the shift from a controlled approach to a mitigating approach, as the expected rapid increase in the number of cases may not give decision makers and hospitals enough time to understand, accept and adapt their response to the correct approach if not implemented in time.
A rapid risk assessment also means public health measures to control the impact of the epidemic.
There is a small window of opportunity where countries can have the opportunity to continuously manage their containment efforts to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the pressure on health care.
Failure to do so, it is likely that the healthcare systems of some EU/EEA countries will face a surge of patients requiring urgent care in the coming days or weeks.
The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has so far killed over 3,000 people and infected over 80,000 people in China and elsewhere in the world, resulting in a catastrophic human population decline.
Similar to its cousin virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 can also be transmitted from bats and cause similar symptoms in a similar manner.
However, COVID-19 has a more severe and fatal nature than SARS but is more transmissible and affects more older people than younger people and more men than women.
As a response to the rapidly increasing number of publications on emerging disease, this article attempts to provide a timely and detailed update on this rapidly developing research topic.
We will cover the basics of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, cause, and prevention of the disease.
Although many questions remain unanswered, we hope that this update will help to understand and eliminate the threat of this disease.
The Spring Festival of January 25, 2020 has become an unparalleled and unforgettable memory for all Chinese who are encouraged to stay indoors for the holiday and for many weeks afterwards due to the outbreak of a new viral disease.
The virus is very similar to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; as a result, it was designated SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on February 11, 2020, and the related disease was named as COVID-19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread across the country and to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
As of March 2, 2020, the virus led to more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients discharged from hospital and more than 3,000 patients who died.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is "the greatest public enemy" and may be more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 papers have been published on COVID-19 covering its virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis, and treatment since the initial report on January 7, 2020 that determined the viral sequence isolated from most patients.
This update attempts to summarize the progress of research on a new and rapidly developing topic.
Whenever possible, we will attempt to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another CoV-borne disease, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, 2012 outbreak).
We will also discuss what we have learned so far about prevention and the cause of the disease as well as other questions that remain but are important.
CoVs are generally considered non-lethal pathogens in humans, mainly responsible for 15% of common influenza 4.
However, in this century, we have twice encountered highly pathogenic human CoVs, namely, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused an epidemic that started in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and quickly spread to other countries causing severe illness and death.
Thus, the current COVID-19 is the third outbreak of CoV in recorded human history.
As indicated in Wafa.Wafa.1,1, clusters of pneumonia of unknown origin were first reported in Wuhan on 31 December 2019 to the China National Health Commission.
Seven days later the sequence of the CoV was released.
On 15 January 2020, the first case of death was reported in Wuhan.
Meanwhile, the epidemic quickly spread to neighboring cities, states, and countries.
On January 20, infections among health workers were reported, suggesting that human-to-human transmission was a possibility.
On January 23, the city of Wuhan was placed under lockdown and all public transportation was suspended.
On 24 January the first clinical investigation of the disease reported that, of 41 confirmed cases, only 21 had direct contact with the seafood market in Wuhan which was considered the site of the first outbreak of the disease from an unknown animal source.
On January 30, WHO declared a global health emergency.
At the time of this report, the disease has spread throughout China and to nearly 50 countries worldwide (Fig. 2).
As the situation changes rapidly, the fate and severity of the epidemic is unknown.
On February 11, 2020, a multi-institutional study of 8,866 patients including 4,021 confirmed positive for COVID-19 showed a more updated picture of the pandemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1HAq2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 has sickened people of all ages, but mainly 30-65 years old.
Almost half (47.7 percent) of the people who were infected were over 50, few were under 20, and only 14 people were under 10.
SARS-CoV-2 has infected more men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 developed in clusters mainly in Hubei and nearby provinces.
COVID-19 took an average of 5 (2-9) days from onset to diagnosis.
The average incubation period is 4.8 days (3.0-7.2).
The average time from conception to death is 9.5 days (4.8-13).
The baseline reproduction number (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), and the modified R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of infections rose rapidly before 23 Jan. 2020, which coincided with the peak of the epidemic before the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality rate for patients with confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%), and the adjusted mortality rate for all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 were gender (men), age (≥60), and severe pneumonia.
CoVs are part of a family of large, secret bacteria containing a single strand of RNA.
It can be divided into four subtypes, namely, alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, i.e. alpha and beta CoVs are not known to infect humans.
The spike (S) of the glycoprotein envelope attaches to the cell receptors for the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, and membrane fusion occurs.
The viral RNA gene is released from the cytoplasm; after replication of the viral gene, the viral RNA gene along with the glycoprotein and nucleocapsid proteins form virion-containing vesicles, which fuse with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on 10 January 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was found to be a novel beta-CoV strain with 99.98% genetic identity among 10 consecutive samples collected at the site of the first outbreak, Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is generally more similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
Using electron transfer microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles were detected in the most exposed portions of the airway epithelium in humans.
Human ACE2 was found to be a SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV receptor.
However, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to human ACE2 much more rapidly than that of SARS-CoV, which is consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less severe infection in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein produced by orf3b and a secretory protein produced by orf8.
SARS-CoV-2 orf3b may play a role in the pathogenicity of the virus and may inhibit IFNβ expression; however, orf8 does not contain any known active domain or motif.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou, et al., reported a cryo-EM structure of human ACE2 with a full length at a resolution of 2.9 Å associated with the amino acid transporter B0AT1.
It was found that this linkage, with open and closed structures, was fused as a dimer and that the ACE2-B0AT1 linkage is able to bind the two S proteins, providing evidence for the detection of the CoV and infection.
B0AT1 may be a potential therapeutic target in drug screening to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Origin and intermediate host
It is known that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated in bats and were transmitted to humans via civet cats and camels, respectively.
By phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, bats were identified as the original host of SARS-CoV-2 as the new virus is 96% identical to two SARS-like CoVs from bats called bat-derived SL-CoVZX45 and bat-derived SL-CoVZX21.
However, which host intervened to help the virus cross the biological barrier to infect humans is unknown, and the route of transmission remains to be determined.
Ji, et al., suggested that snakes may have been the vector of the virus from bats to humans that involved the recombination of the same elements within the S protein.
According to the study, researchers from Guangzhou, China, suggest that pangolins - long-nosed, ant-eating mammals commonly used as traditional Chinese medicine - may be the intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 based on 99% genetic features in the CoV derived from pangolins and SARS-CoV-2.
However, a 1% difference between two genes makes a big difference; therefore, the guaranteed results of strong femininity are still awaited (Fig. 33).
The physicochemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are largely unknown at present.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive without a host for up to 48 hours in dry conditions and up to 5 days at 20 °C and 40%-50% humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar features.
SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to be resistant to ultraviolet radiation and to 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, 75% ethanol, chlorinated disinfectant, peracetic acid, chloroform, and other oil solvents, but not chlorhexidine, can effectively inactivate the virus.
All people generally lack antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and are therefore at risk of new infection.
Currently, no detailed studies have been reported on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to past studies of other CoVs, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Malaria. (Malaria.4).4).
Generally, after a virus has invaded the body, it is first recognized by the body's natural immune system by its pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) which include receptors such as the lectin C receptor, the Toll-like receptor (TLR), the NOD-like receptor (NLR), and the RIG-like receptor (RLR).
Through various pathways, the virus causes the expression of inflammatory traits, the formation of dendritic cells, and the production of interferon type I (IFNs) that inhibit viral proliferation and accelerate macrophage phagocytosis of viral antigens.
However, the N-protein of SARS-CoV can help the virus evade an immune response.
Soon, adaptive immune responses join the battle against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in immunity.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce antibodies specific to the virus, and CD8+ T cells directly kill the infected cells.
T helper cells produce proinflammatory cytokines to help the immune cells.
However, CoV can inhibit T-cell function by inducing apoptosis of T-cells.
Humoral immunity including such agents as C3a and C5a and antibodies is also important in fighting viral infection.
For example, antibodies taken from a recovered patient render MERS-CoV inactivated.
On the other hand, an overreaction of the immune system builds up a large number of local radicals that can cause extensive damage to the lungs and other organs of the body, and, in the worst case, multiple organ failure and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, with the first characteristic as a group, is more likely to infect comorbidly affected adults and pregnant women.
It is common for people who have been exposed to a large number of germs or whose immune system is compromised to be more susceptible to infection than other people.
The average incubation period for SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, in most cases 3-7 days based on a preliminary study of 425 people in Wuhan.
However, a survey of 1,099 people shows that the incubation period was on the average 3 days and had a range of 0 to 24 days.
A recent study, as described above, showed that the incubation period was 4.8 days (3.0-7.2) based on information from 8,866 people.
It is very important for health authorities to adjust the quarantine period based on the accurate incubation period, thereby preventing infected but asymptomatic individuals from transmitting the virus to others.
As a general rule, people who have been exposed to, or infected with, the virus are required to isolate themselves for 14 days.
Should the confinement period be extended to 24 days?
Fever is usually the primary and first indication of COVID-19, which may not be accompanied by other symptoms or signs such as cough without coughing, shortness of breath, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, rhinorrhea, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.
Some patients experienced dyspnea and/ or hypoxemia one week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, patients progressed rapidly to severe respiratory illness, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms and severe fever, even if no abnormalities are seen on lung imaging, should be immunized for initial diagnosis.
A population-based survey conducted in late December 2019 showed the percentage of symptoms being 98% fever, 76% coughing without coughs, 55% dyspnea, and 3% diarrhoea; 8% required ventilation.
Similar findings were reported in two recent studies of family contagion and contagion caused by asymptomatic infection.
In comparison, a 2012 population-based study showed that patients with MERS-CoV also had fever (98%), non-coughing (47%), and dyspnea (55%) as their main symptoms.
However, 80% of them required mechanical ventilation, which is much higher than in patients with COVID-19 and consistent with the much higher mortality rate of MERS than COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also noted in MERS patients.
In patients with SARS, it was shown that fever (99%-100%), non-asphytic cough (29%-75%), dyspnea (40%-42%), diarrhoea (20-25%), and sore throat (13-25%) were the main symptoms and ventilation was required in approximately 14%-20% of patients.
On 14 February, the death rate from COVID-19 was 2% with 66,576 confirmed cases worldwide.
In comparison, deaths from SARS in November 2002 were 10 percent of all confirmed cases, 8,096.
For MERS, based on a population survey in June 2012, mortality was 37% of the 2,494 confirmed cases.
The initial study reported that the R0 of SARS-CoV-2 was as high as 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23, where the R0 of SARS-CoV had a range of 2 to 4.
A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV in terms of their symptoms, mortality, and R0 is represented in Table Table1.1.
The above figures suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a much higher transmissibility than both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but has a much lower lethality than both.
Therefore, it is more challenging to control the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
The origin of the collections is usually within the same family or circle or in a transport object such as a cruise ship.
Patients generally have a history of traveling to or living in Wuhan or other affected areas or contact with infected people or patients in the last two weeks before onset.
However, it has been reported that humans can carry the virus asymptomatically for longer than two weeks and vaccinated patients discharged from hospital can carry the virus again, prompting a warning to extend the quarantine period.
Patients have a normal or reduced number of peripheral white blood cells (especially lymphocytes) in the early stages.
For example, lymphopenia with a white blood cell count of < 4×109/L including a lymphocyte count of < 1×109/L, and elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase and viremia were found in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
Levels of liver and muscle enzymes and myoglobin were high in the blood of some patients, and C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation were high in the blood of most patients.
In critically ill patients, the level of D-dimer, a breakdown product of fibrin present in the blood, was elevated, and the number of lymphocytes was markedly reduced.
Abnormal findings were found in chest radiography of many COVID-19 patients and with features of a double-lined shadow or ground glass opacity in the lungs.
Patients commonly suffer from uncommon pneumonia, severe lung damage, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled swelling, fluid growth, and progressive fibrosis compromise the gas exchange.
Type I and type II pneumocyte dysfunction decreases the level of surfactant and increases surface tension, thereby reducing the lung's ability to expand and increasing the risk of lung collapse.
Therefore, the most severe side effects of radiography are often the same as the most severe form of the disease.
On 18 February 2020, the initial pathological analysis of COVID-19 showed pneumocyte depletion, hyaline membrane formation, and interstitial lymphocyte access, as well as multinucleated syncytial cells in the lungs of a patient who died of the disease, consistent with the pathology of viral infection and ARDS and similar to that of SARS and MERS patients.
RNA detection of SARS-CoV-2 using reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used as the primary diagnostic criteria for COVID-19.
However, due to the high number of false positives, which could hasten the pandemic, clinical detection was introduced for diagnostic use (which did not rely on RT-PCR alone) in China on 13 February 2020.
A similar situation arose when diagnosing SARS.
Therefore, a combination of history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests, and radiological results is and is essential to a successful diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, Feng Zhang's team described a protocol for using a CRISPR-based SHERLOCK method to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detects artificial RNA fragments of SARS-CoV-2 at 20 × 10-18 mol/L to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microliter of the input) using a punch-cutter in less than an hour without the need for complex tools.
We hope that the new approach will significantly improve the sensitivity and benefit if confirmed in clinical samples.
Due to lack of experience with the new CoV, clinicians are primarily unable to provide supportive care to COVID-19 patients, while experimenting with a range of treatments previously used or proposed for the treatment of other CoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other viral infections (Table (Table2).2).
These treatments include current and potential treatment with antibiotics, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from recovered patients, Chinese medicine, and psychological support.
It was even suggested that plasma from recovered patients be used as a treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are competing to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs initially and probably also, to a lesser extent, other ACE2-expressing organs, such as the gastrointestinal system and kidneys.
Nevertheless, dysfunction and respiratory failure are a serious threat to patients and a major cause of death.
Respiratory support is therefore essential to alleviate symptoms and save lives and includes routine oxygen therapy, elevated oxygen flow, ventilation without a ventilator, and ventilation with a ventilator depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should be supported using extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a modified cardiopulmonary surgery procedure used to treat life-threatening heart or respiratory failure.
In addition, maintenance of electrolyte balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infection and septic shock, and functional protection of vital organs are also important in patients with SARS-CoV-2.
It is known that the cytokine storm is the result of an overreaction of the immune system in SARS and MERS patients.
A cytokine storm is a response of the inflammatory system characterized by the release of a chain of cytokines including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
These cytokines stimulate the immune system to release large amounts of free radicals that are the main cause of ARDS and multiple organ failure.
Immunosuppression is important in the treatment of cytokine storms, especially in critically ill patients.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, a monoclonal anti-IL6 agent, have been used to treat cytokine storm.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for cytokine storm include the regulation of immune responses targeted at T cells; inhibition of IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF; inhibition of JAK; blinatumomab; suppressor of cytokine 4 signaling; and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, such as immunosuppressants, are widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, steroids in high doses were of no benefit for severe lung injury in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
Rather, it may cause serious adverse effects, especially avascular osteonecrosis, which significantly impairs prognosis.
However, short-term corticosteroid regimens in low to moderate doses have been recommended for careful use in critically ill COVID-19 patients.
At the time of writing, no effective treatment against the virus has yet been confirmed.
However, intravenous remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue, was found effective in an American patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a new antiviral drug originally developed by Gilead to treat Ebola and Marlburg virus infections.
Later, remdesivir also showed that it could inhibit single-stranded RNA viruses including MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on this, Gilead has provided China with a sample to conduct studies in people with SARS-CoV-2, and the results are being eagerly awaited.
In addition, baricitinb, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin have been suggested as potential treatments for patients with severe respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage, and other serious reactions may occur after treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir combination therapy.
Interactions between these and other medicines used in patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma from injured patients and the development of antibodies
The collection of blood from patients who have recovered from an infectious disease for the treatment of other patients with the same disease or to prevent the infection of healthy individuals has a long history.
In fact, patients who recover from the disease often have a higher level of antibodies to fight the disease in their blood.
Antimicrobials are immunoglobulins (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to fight infection and other harmful substances in the body and are able to detect and directly inactivate cells that are specific to disease.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients recovered from COVID-19 and was injected into 10 critically ill patients.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, which was accompanied by reduced inflammation and viral load and improved oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, confirmation and clarification are needed to recommend a method for widespread use before a particular treatment is developed.
In addition, when considering the effects of treatment, some of the potential side effects associated with plasma must be carefully considered.
For example, the immune system can over stimulate the immune response and cause a disease called cytokine release, which can be life-threatening.
The amount of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and the need for plasma is great for treating critically ill patients.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies quickly enough to fight a global pandemic.
Therefore, it is very important and logical to isolate B cells from recovered patients and to identify the genetic codes containing the active genes or to screen the active antibodies against the important proteins of the virus.
In this way, we can increase the production of antibodies.
TCM has been used to treat a variety of ailments in China for thousands of years.
However, its effects depend largely on the combination of multiple components in a formula that varies from diagnosis to diagnosis based on the TCM concept.
Most of the active components remain unknown or unclear as it is difficult to identify and confirm such components or their best-performing combinations.
Meanwhile, due to the lack of effective and specific treatments for COVID-19, TCM has become one of the main treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms in those who have recovered from the critical stages.
For example, the Shu Feng Jie Du tablets and the Lian Hua Qing Wen tablets were found to be effective in the treatment of COVID-19.
High rates of recovery in the treatment of patients with COVID-19 were noted in several Chinese provinces that used TCM in 87% of their patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%), and Hunan (50%), while Hubei province, which used TCM in about 30% of its COVID-19 patients, had the lowest rate of recovery (13%).
However, this is an inaccurate comparison as other impact factors such as number and severity of patients should be included in the analysis.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and colleagues published a study comparing Western medicine (WM) therapy alone and combined WM and TCM therapy.
They found that the time needed for body temperature to recover, symptoms to subside, and admission to hospital was shorter in the WM+TCM group than in the WM-only group.
Most impressively, the severity of symptoms (from mild to severe) was significantly lower in the WM+TCM group than in the WM only group (7.4% versus 46.2%) and death was much lower in the WM+TCM group than in the WM only group (8.8% versus 39%).
Nevertheless, the efficacy and safety of TCM are still pending well-controlled studies at large scales and in many institutions.
It would also be interesting to note the mechanism of action and clarify the active components of TCM therapy or its combinations where possible.
Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 are often more fearful of the highly contagious and deadly disease, and people in isolation also experience boredom, loneliness, and anger.
In addition, symptoms of infection such as fever, hypoxia, and cough as well as serious side effects of treatment such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids can lead to increased anxiety and depression.
During the initial phase of the SARS outbreak, many psychiatric illnesses including chronic depression, anxiety, panic attacks, motor neuron disorders, symptoms of insanity, delusions, and even suicidal tendencies were reported.
Mandatory contact tracing and isolation, as part of the public health response to the COVID-19 outbreak, may leave many people feeling anxious and guilty about the consequences of infection, isolation, and isolation from their family and friends.
As a result, mental health care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, suspected cases, their contacts and the general public who need it.
Psychological support should include the establishment of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communication with regular and accurate updates on the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and treatment plans, and the use of electronic medical devices and social distancing programs.
Effective vaccines are essential to break the chain of transmission from infected animals and humans to potential hosts and are often complementary to antimicrobial therapy in controlling outbreaks caused by new viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop vaccines based on the S protein to produce long-lasting and potent antibodies and/or immunity against SARS-CoV.
Live-activated vaccines have been tested in animals for SARS.
However, the biological efficacy of these vaccine candidates in adults and models of the lethal strain and their immunity to animal-to-human transmission are yet to be determined before clinical trials can begin.
This is because SARS was eliminated 17 years ago and no new cases of it have been reported since then.
On the other hand, rare cases and clusters of MERS continue to emerge from the Middle East and spread to other regions due to the persistence of animal-to-human transmission in the affected areas.
Vaccines have been developed for MERS using a non-functional virus, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and subunits in a complex protein and some have been tested in animal models.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 in infectious populations is an urgent and critical task in the ongoing control of the pandemic.
However, it is challenging to cope with the difficulty due to the long period (average of 18 months) required to develop a vaccine and the mutant strains of CoVs.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has only recently begun to show its full clinical utility in thousands of patients.
In many cases, patients can recover to a certain extent without the effects of previous illness.
However, like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 has also been associated with a high morbidity and mortality rate in critically ill patients.
Therefore, modeling the cause of a disease is critical for healthcare agencies to prioritize their services, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on clinical trials reported to date, the following factors may influence or be associated with the cause of COVID-19 patients (Table (Table33):
Age: Age was the most important factor in the cause of SARS, which is also true for COVID-19.
COVID-19 occurred primarily in the 30-65 age group and 47.7% of those patients were over 50 in the study of 8,866 patients as described above.
Patients who required intensive care were more likely to develop other complicated illnesses and were significantly older than those without (age 66 versus 51), suggesting that age is a contributing factor in the outcome in COVID-19 patients.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 infected more men than women (0.31/100,000 compared to 0.27/100,000), as described above.
Pre-existing and complicated illnesses: COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care are at higher risk of acute cardiac injury and arrhythmia.
Heart-related events were again the leading cause of death in SARS patients.
It was also reported that SARS-CoV-2 is also able to attach to ACE2-positive cholangiocytes, which may lead to liver dysfunction in patients with COVID-19.
It is worth noting that age and preexisting disease are strongly interrelated and may interfere with each other.
Unusual laboratory results: The level of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood indicates the severity of inflammation or tissue damage and has been suggested as a possible factor in disease, response to treatment, and overall recovery.
A link between CRP levels and severity and the cause of COVID-19 has also been established.
In addition, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and creatine kinase (CK) may also help predict the outcome.
These enzymes are widely expressed in many organs, especially in the heart and liver, and are released during muscle injury.
As a result, they are common symptoms of heart or liver failure.
Major clinical symptoms: Chest radiography and the transient progression of clinical symptoms should be considered along with other prognostic and complication problems of COVID-19.
Steroid use: As described above, steroids are immunosuppressant agents that are commonly used as adjunctive therapy for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
As high doses of corticosteroids were widely administered to patients with severe SARS, most of the survivors suffered from avascular osteonecrosis with lifelong disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used in low doses and for a short time in COVID-19 patients.
Depression: As mentioned above, during the COVID-19 outbreak many patients suffered from severe depression as they had to endure long periods of isolation and extreme uncertainty and witnessed the deaths of close family members and fellow patients.
Long-term counseling and support are essential to help these patients recover from depression and return to a normal life.
According to human knowledge studies to date, COVID-19 appears to have different epidemiological features to SARS.
In addition to replicating in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 is able to replicate easily in the upper respiratory tract and cause few or no symptoms in the initial stage of infection, in the same way as CoVs cause common flu.
Therefore, patients infected in the initial stage or incubation period can produce large amounts of the virus during daily activities, which causes great difficulties in controlling the epidemic.
However, SARS-CoV infection was thought to occur when patients were critically ill, whereas most infections did not occur in the early stages.
As a result, the COVID-19 outbreak is more severe and difficult to control than the SARS outbreak.
There are several ongoing efforts currently underway in China including the lockdown of Wuhan and surrounding cities and the ongoing lockdown of the entire population in hopes of slowing transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
While these measures have severely damaged the country's economy and other sectors, the number of new cases is declining, reflecting the slowing of the epidemic.
The most promising estimate is that the eruption will end in March and the contraction phase will continue for 3-4 months.
However, some scholars do not hold such a hope.
Paul Hunter, et al., estimate that COVID-19, which appears to be more contagious than SARS, will not disappear by 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., developed a model to predict the outcome of the pandemic and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the global population.
The Canadian team reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in both mid-turbinate and throat swabs from patients who recovered and were discharged from hospital two weeks earlier, indicating that the newly identified virus may be a recurrent episode similar to influenza.
However, promising signs have emerged in China based on a declining number of new cases, suggesting that current strategies may be working.
It was originally predicted that Ebola would infect one million people and kill half a million.
However, thanks to strict quarantine and isolation, the disease was eventually brought under control.
It is possible, like SARS-CoV, that SARS-CoV-2 may become weakened and eventually become extinct or become a less virulent virus capable of coexisting with humans.
A comparison of the COVID-19 pandemic and that of SARS and MERS is given below (Fig. 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is mainly transmitted through coughing or sneezing, and possibly through direct contact with infected objects.
The virus was also found in the saliva, opening up a new window of opportunity for saliva-to-mouth transmission.
A recent study of 138 patients reported that 41% of patients may have been infected in hospitals, including 17 patients with pre-existing conditions and 40 health care providers.
Therefore, extreme precautions must be taken to protect people, especially health - care providers, social workers, family members, co - workers, and even people who are in close proximity to patients or infected people.
The first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is the wearing of face masks; both the use of surgical masks and N95 respirator masks (series # 1860s) help control the spread of germs.
Surgical face masks prevent the fluid from a potentially infected person from escaping through the air and sticking to the surface of objects, where it can be transmitted to other people.
However, only N95 masks (series # 1860s) can protect against absorbing virions that are smaller at 10 to 80 nm, while only 5% of virions are able to pass completely; SARS-CoV-2 is the same size as SARS-CoV both at about 85 nm.
Since particles can pass through five surgical masks that are connected, health care providers who work directly with patients must wear N95 masks (series # 1860s) not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health care providers should wear properly fitting protective gowns to further reduce exposure to germs.
Bacteria can enter a person through the eyes.
On 22 January 2020, a doctor became infected with SARS-CoV-2 despite wearing an N95 mask; the virus may have entered his body through his swollen eyes.
As a result, health care providers should also wear non-reflective face masks or goggles while working with patients.
For the general public in affected or potentially affected areas, it is highly recommended that everyone wash their hands with bleach more often than usual, try to stay indoors to isolate themselves and limit contact with people who may be infected.
Three feet is considered the appropriate distance for people to keep away from sick people.
These are effective ways to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 arrived as a new virus in the human world, its similarity to SARS-CoV as reported on 7 January 2020 should have been a warning to China as it still remembered the 2003 SARS outbreak.
However, it was not until 19 January 2020 that the director of the Center of Disease Control in Wuhan assured the residents that the new virus has low transmissibility and low replication when transmitted from person to person and that it is not a problem to prevent and control the disease.
The message put the public off alert, especially as the whole country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and missed the critical time to control the virus before it spread further to Wuhan.
Chinese disease control agencies may learn from this critical lesson and make important advances in the future.
For example, these agencies should (1) be more careful in making public announcements as each word is important to citizens and can change their attitudes and decisions; (2) be more sensitive and responsive to unusual information from the clinic rather than waiting for authorized reports from doctors or officials; (3) be more proactive in controlling a potential epidemic during its early stages rather than trying to reassure the public; and (4) make frequent targeted and effective drills to improve public surveillance of newly diagnosed diseases and to control and manage the public response system from time to time.
The COVID-19 outbreak caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus in late December 2019.
In less than two months, it has spread throughout China and to some 50 other countries around the world at the time of this writing.
As the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms are also similar between COVID-19 and SARS, the COVID-19 outbreak has created the feeling that SARS is recurring.
However, there are significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are important for controlling the epidemic and treating patients.
COVID-19 affects more elderly people than young people and more men than women, and the incidence and mortality rate are also higher in older people than in young people.
SARS has a higher mortality rate than COVID-19 (10.91% compared to 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients transmit the virus even when they are asymptomatic, whereas SARS patients transmit it when they are severely ill, which poses a greater problem to control the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This partly explains why SARS-CoV-2 has spread much more rapidly and widely than SARS-CoV.
A general analysis of SARS-CoV-2 RNA may be negative in some patients with COVID-19.
On the other hand, vaccinated patients may also be positive when tested for the virus.
These findings greatly increase the risk of the virus spreading.
With the rapid progress in COVID-19 research, there are a few critical problems that need to be addressed, including:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although a 96% similarity in genetic structure was found between SARS-CoV-2 and the two SARS-like bat CoVs, it cannot be concluded that SARS-CoV-2 originated from bats.
What animal in the middle of the spectrum transmitted the virus from the original host, say, bats, to humans?
If we don't know the answers to #1 and 2, we can't successfully cut the transmission, and the breakdown could get worse at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical analysis have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, how does the virus actually enter the cells of the respiratory tract and cause the resulting disease-causing mutations?
Does the virus also attach to ACE2-expressing cells in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot access rapid and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic continue?
How do the genes of a bacterium change during human contagion?
Will it be a global pandemic, will it end like SARS or will it be more severe in some cases like the flu?
It is worthwhile but may take some time to search for the answers to the above questions and many others.
However, whatever the cost, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and to get our lives back to normal.
Animal to human origins of human coronaviruses
Mutation and adaptation have fueled the co-evolution of coronaviruses (CoVs) and their hosts, including humans, for thousands of years.
Prior to 2003, two human CoVs (HCoVs) were known to cause mild illness, such as common influenza.
The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) has changed the landscape to show how devastating and life-threatening HCoV infection can be.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China in late 2019 again put CoVs on the scene and surprised us with a higher infectivity but with reduced pathogenicity compared to its sister SARS-CoV.
HCoV disease is a zoonosis and understanding the zoonotic origins of HCoVs may help us.
Most HCoVs originate from bats and do not cause disease in them.
The intermediate hosts of other HCoVs are also known.
Identifying pet hosts has direct implications for the prevention of human diseases.
Studying the interaction of the CoV host with animals may provide important insights into the structure of CoVs in humans.
In this review, we present a summary of the existing knowledge about seven HCoVs, and will focus on the history of their discovery and their zoonotic origin and transmission from various organisms.
More importantly, it compares and classifies different HCoVs from the point of view of viral mutation and genetic recombination.
The current 2019 coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) is discussed in this context.
In addition, the requirements for successful host switching and the consequences of viral switching on disease severity are also highlighted.
Coronaviruses (CoVs) are part of the family Coronaviridae, which is composed of a closed, sensory-responsive, single-stranded RNA group of viruses.
These viruses contain the largest genome of 26 to 32 kilobases among RNA viruses called ama-CoV due to their crown-like morphology under the electron microscope.
Structurally, CoVs with unbranched genomes have a similar sequence.
Approximately three segments of the genome have two large open reading frames that are fused (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated to replicase polyproteins of pp1a and pp1ab.
The polyproteins are further processed to form an additional 16 structurally deficient proteins, called nsp1~16.
The remainder of the genome contains the ORFs of structural proteins, including the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleoprotein (N).
A number of lineage-specific accessory proteins also code for various lineages of CoVs.
Based on differences in protein sequences, CoVs are classified into four subtypes (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV), with the beta-CoV subtype containing the majority of HCoVs and divided into four subtypes (A, B, C and D).
Phylogenetic evidence has shown that bats and mice are the genetic source of alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, while birds are the source of gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs.
For thousands of years, CoVs have steadily crossed biological boundaries and many of them have become important human pathogens.
To date, seven human CoVs (HCoVs) have been identified.
Among these are HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 alpha-CoVs.
The other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 generally cause mild symptoms, such as common cold and/or diarrhoea.
On the other hand, the newly identified SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are causing severe disease, causing severe lower respiratory tract infection in many patients with a higher risk of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and other extrapulmonary infections.
The first HCoV-229E strain, B814, was isolated from nasal secretions of patients with the common cold in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more information has been gained through detailed studies of HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which cause isolated symptoms.
In fact, it was accepted that the infection with HCoVs was generally safe until the SARS outbreak.
The SARS outbreak of 2003 was one of the most devastating in recent history, infecting over 8,000 people and having a death rate of nearly 10 percent.
Ten years later, the outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) resulted in an ongoing epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula with sporadic outbreaks in other parts of the world.
The 2019 novel HCoV (2019-nCoV), subsequently named SARS-CoV-2, is the causative agent of the ongoing pandemic of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which has killed more than 3,120 people and infected more than 91,000 people as of March 3, 2020.
The alarm has been sounded and the world must prepare for the coming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven HCoVs have zoonotic origins from bats, mice or domestic animals.
A large body of evidence supports the evolutionary origin of all HCoVs from bats, where the viruses have adapted well and do not cause disease but exhibit high genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 pandemic has posed major medical, scientific, social and ethical challenges to China and the world.
Tracing the zoonotic origins of HCoVs provides a framework for understanding the natural history, dynamics and limiting factors of organism jumps.
This may also guide or assist in the identification of the cause, intermediate and host-animal replication of SARS-CoV-2, which will have important implications for the prevention of future transmission.
In this review we present a summary of the zoonotic origins, the different organisms' infection and the pathogenesis of HCoVs.
In particular, we highlight and discuss the common theme that the parent viruses of HCoVs generally do not cause disease in their natural host but cause disease after a different organism is infected with a new host.
We also review the evolutionary trend of HCoVs where increased infectivity often accompanies decreased pathogenicity.
The implications of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak are also discussed in this context.
Animal CoVs have been known since the late 1930s.
Prior to the initial isolation of the HCoV-229E strain B814 from nasal swabs of patients who had contracted influenza, isolated CoVs were isolated from a variety of infected animals, including turkey, mouse, cow, pig, cat and dog.
Over the past decades, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of the discovery of HCoVs in their sequence (Table 1) may be useful and informative.
The first HCoV-229E strain was isolated from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in 1966, and was adapted to grow in the WI-38 pulmonary cell lines.
Patients with HCoV-229E had symptoms of the common cold, including headache, sneezing, malaise and sore throat, and fever and cough were observed in 10~20% of cases.
Later in 1967, HCoV-OC43 isolated from the spleen and the subsequent sequence in the brain of mammals.
The clinical features of HCoV-OC43 disease appear to be similar to those caused by HCoV-229E, which was not differentiated in symptoms from infections with other respiratory tract diseases such as influenza A viruses and rhinoviruses.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are globally distributed, and are most commonly infected during the winter season in mild weather.
Generally, the incubation period for these two viruses is less than a week, followed by about 2 weeks of illness.
According to a study of human volunteers, healthy people infected with HCoV-229E experienced a mild flu-like reaction.
Only a few patients with suppressed immune systems showed severe lower respiratory tract disease.
SARS, also known as serious pneumonia, was the first HCoV-induced pandemic recorded in human history and is the causative agent of SARS-CoV, the third HCoV identified.
The first outbreak of SARS can be traced back to late 2002 in China's Guangdong Province.
The SARS epidemic led to a reported 8,096 cases and 774 deaths, spread across many countries and continents.
Apart from the main infectious agents, it was estimated that each case could cause up to two other cases, with an incubation period of 4 to 7 days and a peak viral load occurring on the 10th day of illness.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially appeared to have myalgia, headache, fever, malaise and fever, followed by dyspnea, cough and respiratory distress as later symptoms.
Lymphopenia, poor liver function tests, and elevated creatine kinase are among the laboratory abnormalities commonly associated with SARS.
A proliferation of alveolar damage, epithelial cell fracture and macrophage proliferation has been noted in SARS patients.
About 20-30% of patients require intensive care and ventilation.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, many body organs including the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidneys can also be infected in these critical conditions, often accompanied by a cytokine storm, which can be fatal especially in patients with compromised immune systems.
The virus was first isolated in the open-lung operation of a relative of the first patient who travelled to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, a great deal of effort has been made in relation to HCoV research.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old child in the Netherlands in late 2004.
It was first discovered to be common in young children, the elderly, and vulnerable immunocompromised patients with respiratory diseases.
The presence of coryza, conjunctivitis, fever, and bronchiolitis is common in infections caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus from the nasal tissue of an eight-month-old boy with pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it was discovered in the Netherlands, it has actually spread worldwide.
It has been estimated that HCoV-NL63 represents approximately 4.7% of common respiratory infections, and its highest incidence occurs in early summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also known as croup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who was hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to community-acquired pneumonia and bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 has been reported to be associated with acute asthmatic exacerbation.
Similar to HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 was detected globally, causing minor respiratory illness.
All of these HCoVs found in the community have adapted well to humans and are generally less likely to mutate into highly pathogenic diseases, although accidents occur due to unknown reasons such as in the rare case of the highly lethal subtype HCoV-NL63, which has been reported to cause severe lower respiratory tract disease in China.
Generally, when these HCoVs acquire the ability to easily infect and maintain a sustained form in humans, they also become less lethal or pathogenic.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 in the lungs of a 60-year-old patient with severe pneumonia and renal failure in Saudi Arabia.
While most laboratory-confirmed cases are from the Middle East, imported cases are spread to close contacts reported in various European countries and Tunisia.
A second outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of MERS are similar to those of SARS, which is characterized by severe progressive pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, most patients with MERS suffered severe renal failure, which is currently a distinct feature of MERS among HCoV-related diseases.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of 14 February 2020, more than 2500 laboratory confirmed cases were reported with a mortality rate of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most dangerous viruses in humans.
From mid- to late December 2019, a large number of patients with pneumonia known to be associated with SARS-CoV-2 disease were detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization designated the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 lower respiratory tract disease as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern and named the disease COVID-19.
As of 3 March 2020, there were 90,053 confirmed cases reported worldwide, with a mortality rate of 3.4%.
Significantly, the death rate in Hubei, China, is 4.2%, while the other outside it is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory illness similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which have been introduced as fever, cough and dyspnea.
Patients also suffer from diarrhea.
Pneumonia is one of the most serious symptoms and can quickly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to the same high nucleotide sequence composition of 82%, there are separate groups in the branches of the phylogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 appears to be less pathogenic but more transmissible compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Asymptomatic cases of SARS-CoV-2 have been reported and may contribute to its rapid global spread.
Comparing and isolating SARS-CoV-2 with six other HCoVs reveals some very interesting similarities and differences.
First, the incubation period and duration of HCoV infection are very similar.
In this respect, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six HCoVs.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is between SARS-CoV and the four HCoVs found in the community (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the other hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibits features commonly seen during community-acquired HCoV infections, including no obvious symptoms, mild symptoms or no symptoms at all.
On the other hand, a small subset of COVID-19 critical cases can also be identified as in the case of SARS-CoV, although the incidence is slightly lower.
Third, SARS-CoV-2 infection also exhibits interesting patterns that are characteristic of both community-acquired HCoVs and SARS-CoV.
On the other hand, transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is as high as that of HCoVs found in the community.
On the other hand, it remains to be confirmed whether transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to humans is decreasing as in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, similar to other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in wild samples.
Whether oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays a significant role when it comes to SARS-CoV under certain conditions is yet to be clarified by future studies.
It is also of great interest to see whether SARS-CoV-2 will show seasonal emergence as is the case with HCoVs found in the community.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 including its infectivity, pathogenicity and sustained transmissibility after transmission to humans will influence the final outcome of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak.
All community-acquired HCoVs that cause mild symptoms have adapted well to humans.
According to one hypothesis, it may also be true that humans have adapted well to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both may have survived the ancient HCoV pandemic.
HCoVs cause severe disease in humans and people with severe HCoV infections are no longer infected.
For this to happen, HCoVs must replicate in humans at a sufficient rate to allow the development of adaptive mutations that counter the limiting factors of the host.
In this way, if the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak persists and infects more people, there will be a greater chance that it will become more adaptive to humans.
If it adapts too well, its transmission to humans can be difficult to prevent by isolation or other means of infection control.
Over the years, four CoVs have been found in the community circulating in the human population, causing a common cold in people with an immune response.
These viruses do not require an animal source.
In contrast, SARS-CoV and highly pathogenic MERS-CoV have not yet fully adapted to humans and their intra-human transmission cannot be sustained.
They need to keep themselves in shape and grow from their zoonotic source and seek an opportunity to move on to susceptible prey, probably via one or more intermediate hosts and foster hosts.
SARS-CoV-2 has similarities with both SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and the four HCoVs found in the community.
It is as highly infectious as HCoVs found in the community, at least in the primate.
However, it is more pathogenic than HCoVs found in the community and has less pathogenicity than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
Whether it will fully adapt to humans and circulate without a well or a central animal host remains to be seen.
Before discussing the animal origins of HCoVs, it will be helpful to discuss the definitions and characteristics of the mutant hosts, the natural, the source, the intermediate and the promoter of HCoVs.
An animal becomes a host of an HCoV mutation if it hosts a closely related ancestor with whom it shares high homology at the nucleotide sequence level.
The ancestral virus usually adapts well and does not cause disease in the host.
Similarly, the source host hosts contain HCoV continuously and for a long time.
In both cases, the hosts are naturally infected and are natural hosts of the HCoV or its parent virus.
Conversely, if HCoV is reintroduced to the mid-range host earlier or near introduction to humans, it has not adapted well to the new host and often causes illness.
This intermediate host may be a zoonotic source of human infection and play the role of host propagator allowing the virus to temporarily replicate and be transmitted to humans to increase the rate of human infection.
HCoVs can undergo terminal infection if they cannot maintain their infectivity within the central host.
In contrast, HCoVs are able to adapt to the central host and even establish long-term endemicity.
In this case, the average host becomes the natural host.
Epidemiological data showed that in retrospective examination the SARS-indicated patient had a history of contact with predators.
Subsequent seroprevalence studies showed that animal traders had higher IgG resistance to SARS-CoV compared to the general population.
Masked palm civet (paguma larvata) and raccoon dog in live animal markets were found to carry SARS-CoV-like viruses that are almost identical to SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly supported by the fact that no additional SARS was reported after the killing of all civets in the markets.
However, it has been reported that wild or farmed masked palm civets that have not been exposed to live animal markets were positive for SARS-CoV, suggesting that masked palm civets may be a medium-sized reproductive host but not a natural source of SARS-CoV.
Significantly, with 80% of the animal varieties in the markets in Guangzhou having antibodies against SARS-CoV, we cannot ignore the possibility that many mammals may be hosts of SARS-CoV intermediate hosts.
All of these appear to be the final hosts of SARS-CoV.
Subsequent studies of the natural host of SARS-CoV identified a bat-related CoV, called SARS-related Rhinolophus bat CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), found in Chinese horseshoe bats.
These bats are superb at protecting against SARS-CoV and the SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 gene sequence.
This and other bat CoVs share 88-92% of nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV.
These studies have led to the development of a new theory that bats harbor new human pathogens.
SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoVs) have been identified in bats, but none other than the so-called WIV1 have been identified as a living virus.
Human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known to be a SARS-CoV receptor.
WIV1 extracted from a bat stool sample was shown to use bat, civet and human ACE2 as a cell entry response.
Interestingly, the serum of patients who recovered from SARS was able to kill WIV1.
To date, WIV1 represents the closely related ancestor of SARS-CoV in bats, sharing 95% of the nucleotide sequence homology.
Although there is high homology between the two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not a close parent virus of SARS-CoV and the bats are not close host hosts of SARS-CoV.
The phylogenetic analysis includes MERS-CoV with the same genotype as bat-CoV HKU4 and bat-CoV HKU5.
Bat-CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV use the same host receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), in the transmission of the virus.
The RNA polymerase sequence of MERS-CoV is phylogenetically close to that of bat-type beta-CoV counterparts found in Europe and Africa.
To date, no living MERS-CoV has been found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and its close relative bat-typeCoV-HKU25 share only 87% of nucleotide sequence homology.
As a result, bats may not be a close source host of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that dromedary camels are seropositive to antibodies that kill MERS-CoV directly, similar to camels that originated in the Middle East in many African countries.
A live MERS-CoV similar to the virus found in humans was isolated from nasal swabs of dromedary camels, which further demonstrated that camels are the host species of the original source of MERS-CoV.
It is also noteworthy that generally mild symptoms but high viral release were observed in MERS-CoV infected camels according to the study.
Significantly, infected camels not only shed the virus through the respiratory tract but also through the mucous membrane, which is also the main route of transmission from bats.
However, questions remain as many MERS cases have no history of contact with camels before the onset of symptoms, it is possible that human-to-human transmission or unknown transmission pathways involve unknown animal hosts of MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% nucleotide homology with the bat-derived CoV RaTG13 isolated from bats of the Rhinolophus affinis.
As with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence variance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too large to infer parental relationship.
That is, bats may not be a close host source of SARS-CoV-2 unless near-similar bat-like CoVs are detected in the future.
Presumably, the hosts of the SARS-CoV-2 intermediate host should be among the wild animals being traded and slaughtered at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, most of which were related to the original COVID-19 infection, indicating that there may have been an animal-to-human transmission event.
A few recent studies based on metagenomic sequencing have suggested that a group of small mammals known as pangolins (Manis javanica) may have hosted older beta-CoVs related to SARS-CoV-2.
These new pangolin CoV genomes share 85-92% of the nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are equally closely related to RaTG13 with an identity of approximately 90% at the nucleotide sequence level.
They combine into two sub-lists of viruses that are approximately similar to SARS-CoV-2 in the phylogenetic tree, one of which shares a very similar receptor binding domain (RBD) with SARS-CoV-2, and a 97.4% amino acid sequence similarity.
In a major difference, the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are highly differentiated, although there is a high degree of genome-wide sequence homology.
Previous studies of diseased pangolins reported the detection of viral contigs in lung samples, which appear to be similarly related to SARS-CoV-2.
The study used various design techniques and manual editing to create a partial genome sequence that comprises approximately 86.3% of the total bacterial genome length.
We cannot rule out the possibility that pangolin are one of the closest host animals to SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence to support that pangolin is the direct origin of SARS-CoV-2 due to sequence variation between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin-related SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoVs.
Furthermore, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even shorter than between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin-related SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoVs.
The evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals has yet to be identified.
While high sequence homology has been found in RBDs between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin, the related SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoVs, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 share high genome-wide sequence homology.
There are high suspicions that the high degree of similarity between the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 related pangolin beta-CoVs and SARS-CoV-2 is driven by selective binding evolution.
Another proposal recommends the inter-subject recombination of SARS-CoV-2 pangolin-related beta-CoV and RaTG13 in a third wild animal.
As a driving force of evolution, recombination is widespread among beta-CoVs.
Conclusions have not yet been reached regarding the nearest zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoVs, the zoonotic origin of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 has also been investigated.
Phylogenetic evidence has shown that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may have originated in bat CoVs, while the parent viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 were found in mice.
It was reported that a bat-derived CoV called ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) found in a North American tricolor bat showed close affinity to HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E was genetically related to another bat-type CoV, named Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was detected in Ghana, while camels were suspected to be its closest host.
For clarity, current information on the animal origin of known HCoVs is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence of the occurrence of HCoV-like organisms in history.
When HCoV-OC43 was transmitted from animal to human via domestic animals around 1890, a respiratory disease epidemic was recorded.
The history of infection of the HCoV-229E variant is not very clear.
The presence of the related bat alpha-CoV-HCoV-229E has been detected.
Among them is the alpaca alpha-CoV.
There is little evidence to support direct transmission of the virus from bats to humans.
For one thing, humans, not alpacas, may have had contact with bats in the same environment.
Rather, humans are closely related to alpacas.
Second, the bat-related alpha-CoVs of HCoV-229E are heterogeneous and do not cause disease in bats, whereas the alpaca-alpha-CoV caused an outbreak of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, the alpaca alpha-CoV has not been detected in wildlife.
As a result, we cannot discount the possibility that alpacas may have contracted an alpha-CoV related to HCoV-229E in humans.
In fact, bats are a direct source of pathogens that cause human disease, including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus, and Hendra virus.
It is therefore not surprising that bats may transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
On the other hand, when bat alpha-CoVs act as a cluster of HCoV-229E genes, alpaca and dromedary camels may be the intermediate host that transmits the virus to humans, as is the case with MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is a good example of cross-species transmission from bats to dromedary camels to humans.
The origin of the MERS-CoV mutation from bats is known from its initial diagnosis and has been confirmed by subsequent findings.
Apparently, bats provide a variety of bacteria with the opportunity to exchange genetic material between different animals and to cross-breed.
Long life spans, dense colonies, close social contact and strong flight capacity all provide the conditions for bats to be effective 'parasites' spreaders.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been introduced to dromedary camels for centuries.
It is well adapted to these camels that have transformed from being an average host to a stable and resourceful host.
MERS-CoV causes little illness and has a low mutation rate in these animals.
Its infection in humans is erroneous and humans remain the final host of MERS-CoV as its transmission cannot be sustained.
Unlike the role of camels in the transmission of MERS-CoV, the role of pangolins, if any, in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is unique.
In particular, pangolin beta-CoVs are the most common cause of disease in pangolins.
It may be the terminal host of SARS-CoV-2 related beta-CoVs, similar to civets in the case of SARS-CoV.
The limited possibility of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from animals to humans should be considered or not in future studies.
First, bats may be the host host for a SARS-CoV-2 related virus that is almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans may play a role similar to that of bats by biting animals or mining coal.
Second, pangolins may be the intermediate host where a SARS-CoV-2 related virus has recently been introduced.
People contracted the virus through surgery and by eating poached meat.
It is possible that many mammals including domestic animals could be exposed to SARS-CoV-2.
A study of the immune systems of domestic and wild animals is needed.
Third, as mentioned above, recombination and adaptation to SARS-CoV-2 may occur in a tertiary animal that is associated with both bats and pangolins.
The search for the SARS-CoV-2 host is ongoing.
In addition to the various types of host animals, there are three main aspects of the virus that are important in making CoVs cross the species boundary.
First, their high rate of change in RNA replication.
Compared to other single-stranded RNA viruses, the mutation rate of CoVs can be considered minimal to maximal with a mutation rate of ~10-4 per year per 2nd station, depending on the stage of adaptation of the CoV to the new host.
CoVs have a fault-finding exoribonuclease, the removal of which results in extreme mutation and decreased potency or inability to grow normally.
Interestingly, the nucleotide analogue Remdesivir is known to suppress CoV replication by inhibition of this exoribonuclease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising agents against SARS-CoV-2 to be evaluated in clinical trials.
However, the mutation rates of CoVs are about one million higher than those of their hosts.
Furthermore, the rate of mutation tends to be high if the CoVs are not well matched to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV with a high mutation rate, the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 appears to be low, suggesting a high degree of human adaptation.
Presumably, it may already have been reconciled with another friendly host.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to dromedary camels.
It is thought that it is almost unlikely that a genetic mutation could cause vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 to become ineffective immediately.
Second, the large RNA genome in the CoVs uses additional flexibility for genome modification to alter and recombine, thus increasing the chance of diverse co-evolution, which is beneficial for the emergence of new CoVs when conditions are right.
This is supported by many distinct open reading frames and the function of the protein produced by the 3′ end of the genome.
Third, CoVs often change their template randomly during RNA replication in a distinct copying-selective manner.
In the host that serves as the mixing vessel, the change of species occurs frequently during the transcription of the CoV RNA.
Highly homologous RNAs with full length and subgenomic sequences may recombine to form novel CoVs.
Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination has been found in both HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-OC43, and animal CoVs such as bat-CoV and bat-CoV-HKU9.
Interaction of the bacterium and the host in relation to infection
Besides the three viral features mentioned above, the interaction of the bacterium with the host is another major factor influencing the transmission of infection between different organisms.
Here, SARS-CoV recombination is considered a typical example, which demonstrated evidence of selective selection during infection events of different organisms.
Based on comparative analysis between isolated humans and SARS-CoV in civets, it is hypothesized that SARS-CoV undergoes rapid adaptation to different hosts, mainly through changes in the RBD of the S protein.
In general, RBD in the S protein of the CoV interacts with the cell receptor and is strongly selective for the host immune response.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is a 318-to-510 amino acid in the S1 segment, which binds to human ACE2 and its coreceptors to enter the virus.
SARS-CoV RBD is able to detect ACE2 receptors from different animals, including bats, civets, mice and raccoon dogs, allowing for cross-species infection.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues were identified as different from the human and civet isolate in RBD of which 4 were found in the receptor-binding motif to interact with the ACE2 receptor.
SARS-CoV of civet has K479N and S487T mutations in its RBD, which may increase the rate of interaction of the spike protein with the human ACE2 receptor.
In other words, this two-amino acid shift may be important for bacterial synthesis in humans.
It is noteworthy that SARS-CoV-2 has the same cellular response as SARS-CoV.
The 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of S protein means that the interaction rate of S protein with human ACE2 may have changed.
In fact, cryo-EM studies show a 10-20-fold higher rate of this coagulation than that between human ACE2 and the S protein of SARS-CoV.
It will also be interesting to determine whether another coreceptor is required for SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 also binds to ACE2 but with a different S-terminus.
There are other HCoV reagents, such as the N-aminopeptidases of HCoV-229E, and 9-O-acetylated sialic acid of HCoV-OC43.
They may also be considered as the reason for successful adaptation of CoVs to humans after infection by different organisms from their animal hosts.
In addition to intracellular responses, the effect of cross-species infection with HCoVs is also controlled by interspecies dependence and limiting factors.
Differences in host proteins between humans and natural hosts of HCoVs such as bats, dromedary camels and mice may create a barrier to cross-species transmission.
HCoVs must take on the host-dependent characteristics and disrupt the host-inhibitory characteristics for successful interspecies infection.
In this regard, the molecular targets in this critical interface with the host of the virus are yet to be identified and characterized.
A broad-based unbiased genome sequencing of host-dependent and restriction factors for SARS-CoV-2 using modern CRISPR technology could be useful.
The emergence of new HCoVs: back to the beginning
The variation of bat CoVs provides a high probability of the emergence of new HCoVs.
In this sense, bat CoVs act as a collection of HCoV genes.
Furthermore, rapid mutation and recombination also drive HCoV evolution and serve as two important steps in the process.
For example, the addition or loss of genes that encode a new protein has the potential to dramatically alter the phenotype of a virus.
Among the auxiliary proteins of SARS-CoV, ORF8 is thought to be important for human adaptation, as SARS-CoV-related bat viruses were isolated but found to produce distinct ORF8 proteins.
The 29-nucleotide deletion factor for SARS-CoVs was found in isolated strains early in the human epidemic.
This deletion splits ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is thought to be an adaptive mutation that promotes host switching.
In addition, SARS-CoV may have a history of recombination with alpha and gamma strains of CoVs, where a large number of small recombination sites were identified in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Rearrangement sites were also found in nsp9, in most of nsp10, and in parts of nsp14.
Similarly, it has been shown that the MERS-CoV pandemic experienced episodes of recombination between different lineages, which occurred in dromedary camels in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events have been observed in other HCoVs, where HCoVs recombine with other animal-derived CoVs in their structurally deficient genes.
It should also be noted that artificial selection may contribute to unintended changes in viral genomes, which may be the result of releasing the bacteria from the selective pressures exerted, such as those of host immune systems.
An example of these effects is the loss of full-length ORF4 in the prototype strain HCoV-229E, due to double-nucleotide deletion.
While complete ORF4 was seen in bat and camel viruses related to HCoV-229E, alpaca alpha-CoV exhibits single nucleotide deposition, resulting in a frame change.
Last but not least, the evolution of new HCoVs is also driven by selection pressure on their source hosts.
There were no or only mild symptoms detected when bats were infected with CoVs, indicating a similarity between CoVs and bats.
Bats appear to be well adapted to CoVs in terms of structure and function.
For example, disruption of the inflammatory response in bats readily reduces the pathology caused by CoVs.
Besides, the activity of the natural killer cell in bats is suppressed due to increased response of the natural killer cell inhibitor NKG2/CD94 and a low expression rate of the class I complex histocompatibility molecules.
In addition, the high level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) formed by the higher digestive activity of bats may affect both the suppression of CoV replication and affect the detection of defects by exoribonuclease, thus providing selective pressure for the development of highly pathogenic bacterial strains when introduced to a new host.
Highly pathogenic CoV strains may also mutate by recombination, leading to the discovery of new proteins or host-synchronized protein features.
As a result, it is no accident that three new HCoVs have emerged in the past two decades.
CoVs do not infect or cause minor symptoms in their main hosts such as bats and camels.
They are rapidly replicated without stimulating a vigorous immune response.
Here are the secrets of why asymptomatic carriers are detected and what causes the critical conditions in human disease.
Severe symptoms are mainly caused by an over-activation of the immune system and a cyclo-toxin storm in which there is a strong immune response, the lung damage being too severe.
In contrast, in those who do not show symptoms of disease, the immune response has been bifurcated to a repeat of the CoV.
A similar strategy for isolating immune responses may have useful effects in treatment against SARS-CoV-2.
The interferon response is particularly strong in bats.
Therefore, the use of type I interferon at least in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans should be beneficial.
Furthermore, the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in bats is ineffective.
According to this hypothesis, blocking the NLRP3 inflammasome with MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows a common pattern of emergence of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Although a bat-type beta-CoV has been identified that shares 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV, there is also a bat-type CoV that shares 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Although civets and other market animals have been found to harbor viruses similar to SARS-CoV, the immediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 have not been identified.
Pangolin beta-CoVs have been identified that have a structure similar to SARS-CoV-2, indicating that pangolins may be intermediate hosts or pangolin beta-CoVs may be contributing to the genetic components of the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was intentionally or accidentally engineered by humans.
CoVs have returned to the mainstream due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
The study of CoVs in bats and other primates has significantly altered our view of the importance of zoonotic origins and animal sources of HCoVs in human infection.
The widespread evidence suggests that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are of bat origin and are transmitted to humans by intermediate hosts.
Since SARS-CoV infection is from human-to-human contact with civets in markets, closing live animal markets and killing civets could have ended the SARS epidemic.
In the same vein, pangolins should be excluded from organic markets to prevent zoonotic infection, given the discovery of multiple lines of pangolin beta-CoVs closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, whether and how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans by pangolins and other mammals is yet to be clarified in future studies.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been present in dromedary camels for a long time.
These camels are an important means of transportation and the main source of meat, honey, leather, and wool products for the local people.
They are widespread in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore unlikely that all camels will be killed to control MERS, as is the case in wildlife markets in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To prevent recurrent outbreaks of MERS, a comprehensive approach should be used to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV in camels, in conjunction with other disease control measures.
Since we cannot eliminate these viruses, new genotypes may emerge to cause outbreaks.
A variety of a-zoonotic CoVs circulate in the wild.
In particular, bat CoVs are highly zoonotically diverse.
There is a high probability that these zoonotic CoVs will mutate and recombine, resulting in new CoVs that are more infectious and/or lethal to humans in the future.
The practice of eating wild animals in some areas of China should be stopped in order to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With the SARS, MERS and COVID-19 cases, there should be a better preparedness and response system.
In fact, many germs have existed on earth for a long time.
They remain in their natural habitat until they have a chance to get out.
Although bats have many features that promote the spread of germs, the likelihood of humans coming into contact with bats and other wildlife can be reduced if people are educated to be more aware of them.
Continued surveillance of mammals is necessary to better understand the ecology of CoVs and their natural hosts, which will be helpful in preventing animal-to-human transmission and future outbreaks.
In conclusion, the best way to prevent zoonosis is for people to stay away from the natural sources of zoonotic bacteria.
A few pieces of the puzzle of the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 have not been found.
First, if bats transmit the SARS-CoV-2 ancestor virus to pangolins, it will be useful to see under what conditions bats and pangolins can share environmental commonalities.
Second, if bats play a more direct role in infecting humans, how humans interact with bats needs to be determined.
Third, if a mammal acts as a true intermediary host, its interactions with a variety of creatures including humans, bats, and pangolins must be explained.
Finally, as many mammals including domestic animals may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both surveillance and research infection should be undertaken.
If it is a bat, pangolin or other mammal, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its closely related parent viruses will be detected in its natural host in the future.
Ongoing research in this area will clarify the evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
Review of the diagnostic criteria for 'suspected' and 'confirmed' COVID-19 is required
On 6 February 2020, our team had published a guide for immediate advice on the diagnosis and treatment of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection, and this guide provided our experience and made a relevant reference for fighting this global pandemic.
However, the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a new disease, our vigilance and understanding is increasing based on ongoing research and experience of treatment procedures; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are continuously being updated.
In this letter, we responded to one comment on our guide and provided a new diagnostic criteria for those with "suspected" and "confirmed" illness in accordance with the Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 (seventh edition) issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the novel coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) had caused an outbreak, now officially called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO referred to COVID-19 as a pandemic.
To combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a rapid response guide and it was published online in Military Medical Research on 06 February 2020.
It has received much attention since its publication.
Note, however, that COVID-19 is a new disease, the surveillance and knowledge of which is increasing based on new research findings and medical experience; therefore, diagnosis and treatment strategies are constantly being updated.
For example, the Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, has issued seven volumes with some significant changes.
Our guide received comments from Zhou et al., presenting a simple suggestion of points based on their experience.
Their work adds new evidence to our guide and makes an important reference to the pandemic worldwide.
We commend their important work and express our gratitude.
However, their work needs to be revised in line with the latest Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 (7th edition of the study) and the latest research.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to confirm suspected disease it is necessary to combine either one of the elements of the epidemiological history and two elements of the clinical presentation to make a comprehensive analysis, or it is necessary to meet the three elements of the clinical presentation that do not have a clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological history: (1) history of visiting or staying in Wuhan city and surrounding areas, or other communities where COVID-19 disease was reported in the past 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (2) history of contact with people infected with SARS-CoV-2 (via positive nucleic acid assay); (3) history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms in Wuhan city and surrounding areas, or other communities where COVID-19 was reported in the past 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (4) history of contact with multiple confirmed patients (≥2 patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms occurred within 2 weeks in small areas, such as home, classroom, office, etc.).
Clinical manifestation: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) with characteristics of COVID-19 infection pattern; (3) total white blood cell count showing normal, decreased, or reduced lymphocyte count in the first stage.
Confirmed diagnosis should be based on suspected disease with one of the following pathogenic or serological evidence: (1) positive real-time PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2; (2) viral whole genome sequencing showing high homogeneity to known viruses in novel coronavirus; (3) positive positive positive IgM and IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in serum assay; or positive IgG antibody to SARS-CoV-2 in serum, or tter-transfer ≥4 times above the critical phase of the test.
We note that real-time PCR testing for nucleic acid in respiratory tract or blood samples has been added to the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) schedules.
Pathogenic detection of blood sample was added to the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) schedules; and serological evidence was included in the seventh schedule.
These improvements were based on the ongoing work of researchers to search for a high-nucleic acid rapid diagnostic kit, and respiratory tract samples including a blood sample, which increased the detectability of various tissues, and supported the delivery of a positive result of a specific antibody to a confirmed subject.
Besides, there is more evidence to remind us to be careful about patients with unusual symptoms and those without symptoms.
Therefore, the flow chart of Zhou et al. should be revised, as it refers to a person without clinical symptoms as low risk.
The scoring system also needs to be validated at work and in continuing medical studies.
In conclusion, we hope that there is more evidence to come and we ask the readers to comment.
For the diagnosis of suspected illness and confirmed illness, we recommend that new national guidelines be followed and adhered to at home.
Our team will also review our guide to provide assistance.
Bangladesh has reported five new deaths from COVID-19, the highest daily number
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths caused by COVID-19 on the same day.
This is the highest daily number ever recorded for the virus.
As of yesterday, Bangladesh's Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported that the number of reported cases is 114 and 33 are recovering from home confinement.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
In an online news forum, the director of the IEDCR, Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, said the dead included four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two were over 60, two were between 51 and 60, and one was between 41-50.
He also said that two were from Dhaka.
COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March.
A hospital official told Anadolu Agency, a local news source, that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, the director of the Bengal Anti-Corruption Commission, who was being treated at Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in an online video announcement, Bangladesh's Minister of Road Transport Obaidul Quader said public transport would be closed for longer than planned, until next Saturday.
This public transport ban had started on March 26 and was scheduled to end on Saturday, April 4.
The transport of essential goods -- medical supplies, fuel and food -- is still prohibited.
The first recorded cases of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh were on 8 March, in two people returning from Italy and the wife of one of them.
By March 19, the three had recovered.
The number of SARS-CoV-2 cases exceeds 1 million worldwide
On Thursday, the total number of people infected with the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus exceeded one million worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University data.
At least 52 thousand deaths were linked to COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.
This occurred on the same day that Malawi confirmed its first coronavirus-related illness and Zambia had its first coronavirus-related death.
North Korea said that, as of Thursday, it is one of the few countries that has no coronavirus infection.
Yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases in the 24 hours before 10 a.m. Central European (0800 UTC) on April 4.
In the United States, more than 244,000 coronavirus-related illnesses have been recorded, with nearly 5,900 deaths associated.
CBS News reported, citing data from Johns Hopkins University, that there were more than 1,000 deaths in the US on Wednesday from coronavirus infections.
Worldwide, countries have announced strict measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, the mayor of Moscow, extended the city's lockdown until May 1.
Worldwide, President Vladimir Putin has announced that Russians will continue to be placed on a work-free curfew until April 30.
The Portuguese parliament voted to extend the national emergency for 15 days; the vote was passed with 215 votes in favour, 10 against, and one abstention.
Saudi Arabia extended the curfew in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina to run all day; previously, it was between 3 p.m. and 6 a.m.
Thailand plans to implement a curfew between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine announced that the state has extended its stay-at-home order until May 1.
Stores in Australia have lowered limits on the purchase of small household paper per purchase
On Sunday and Saturday nights, the Australian supermarket chain Woolworths and Coles cut their toilet paper purchase limit to two and one pack per purchase nationwide, respectively.
ALDI also introduces a one-pack limit on Mondays.
These restrictions are posted as messages at the exit, and on the store's Facebook page.
Consumers were still buying in bulk due to fear of COVID-19 in case they needed to isolate themselves.
On Wednesday, Woolworths again restricted the purchase of toilet paper to those who are delivered home to one pack per order.
These changes follow the previous four-pack limit on purchases introduced by Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5.
" Coles, in its March 8 press release, reported that with the four-pack limit set, ""many stores are still out of stock about an hour after delivery"", and called the demand ""unprecedented"", while ALDI, in its Facebook post on Tuesday, called it ""unexpected"""."
"Sales have ""surged"" in the past week, according to a Woolworths spokesperson".
Costco's store in Canberra also cut the limit to two pies last week.
To address the shortage, Coles ordered very large packages from suppliers and announced increased deliveries, Woolworths ordered additional stock, while ALDI made stocks for the scheduled Wednesday special available as soon as possible.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said that dealers are trying to increase inventory, but local council restrictions on delivery times for trucks make things difficult.
He expects production costs to rise, as suppliers try to meet demand, with fewer special offers.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that due to the rapid release of stock, some stores cannot continue with the Wednesday special.
In a News.com.au report, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a marketing specialist at the Queensland University of Technology, said that stores are stocking up every night.
Small-scale paper, he noted, is a heavy material, resulting in a low stock value in terms of numbers, and, when it is out, it leaves a large gap open, reinforcing the sense that it is crumbling.
Coles and Woolworths are of the opinion [that] if there were more stuff on the shelves, if products like toilet rolls and sanitary towels could be [purchased] and there was more of it, you could probably reduce the fear", Russell Zimmerman said according to ABC News.
The manufacturer of recycled toilet paper Who Gives a Crap said on Wednesday they were out of stock.
Kimberly-Clark, which makes Kleenex Toilet Tissue, and Solaris Paper which makes Sorbent, stressed that they are working 24/7 to keep the product afloat, according to a News.com.au report.
Domain.com, a real estate website, reported that some real estate agents are giving away free paper to the first bidder at auctions in Melbourne, where few auctions are held because buyers have time off for the long Labor Day weekend.
The Thursday edition of NT News, Darwin's daily newspaper, included a nine-page appendix intended to be cut and used as toilet paper.
The stores were initially reluctant to impose restrictions, according to a report by ABC Australia on 3 March when they said they had no plans to introduce purchase restrictions.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products are also in high demand, including masks, sanitary towels, dry foods, laundry detergent and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, on Sunday night the British online supermarket Ocado was seen limiting the purchase of Andres toilet paper to two for a 12-roll pack.
The World Health Organization is declaring COVID-19 a pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) called the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19  a disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2  a pandemic.
"Although the term ""pandemic"" refers to the extent to which the disease has spread, not to the extent to which specific examples are dangerous, WHO has shown concern for the need to drive governments to action:"
Not all countries are able to reverse the course of the epidemic.
If countries investigate, monitor, classify, track and respond by controlling the movement of people, said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO's Executive Director.
We are very concerned about both the alarming and severe spread and the alarming lack of movement.
"According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the United States' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic ""has no precedent"."
"He said, in comments broadcast on CNN in February, ""except for influenza, no other respiratory virus has been traced from its emergence to its worldwide spread""".
"Ghebreyesus expressed a similar view, saying ""we have never seen before a pandemic wiped out by the coronavirus spark".""
"He continued, ""and we have never seen a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time before".""
The new pandemic situation follows the WHO's decision in January to declare measles a global public health emergency.
"The director of the United States' National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease's, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said of the outbreak, ""what's left, it's going to get worse".
As of Thursday, The Associated Press reported that there have been at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.
The 201920 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January 2020, and was declared a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, 1.61 million positive cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in 97,000 confirmed deaths.
Some 364,000 people have recovered.
The number of fatalities has been estimated at 4% in China, while globally ranging from 13.04% in Algeria to 0.08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The period of exposure to the symptomatic is usually five days, but it can range from two to fourteen.
There is no known cure or treatment that can conquer the virus.
The recommended prevention measures include washing hands, covering the mouth when coughing, maintaining social distance, and monitoring and isolating from people who suspect they may be infected.
Authorities around the world have responded by imposing travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, workplace risk control measures, and closures.
The pandemic has led to severe economic and social disruption worldwide, postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, and widespread shortages of essential goods that have been overtaken by a rush.
Schools including boarding schools have been closed nationwide or in 193 countries, affecting precisely 99.4 percent of the global student population.
Misinformation about the virus has spread online, and there have been instances of racial and ethnic discrimination against Chinese, other people from East Asian countries with North Asian ancestry and appearance, and others from countries with high levels of the virus.
With reduced transportation and the closure of large factories, there has been a decrease in air pollution and carbon emissions.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei province) reported a series of pneumonia cases of unknown origin on 31 December 2019, and an investigation was opened in early January 2020.
Most of the cases were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market so the virus is thought to have originated from animal cloning.
The virus that caused the outbreak was known as SARS-CoV-2, an emerging virus closely related to bat coronaviruses, pangolin coronaviruses, and SARS-CoV. The first known person to exhibit symptoms was later found to have started ill on 1 December 2019, and that person had no apparent connection to the wet market chain.
In the first batch of samples reported in December 2019, three components were found to connect to the market.
On 13 March 2020, an unconfirmed report from the South China Morning Post suggested that a case traced back to 17 November 2019, of a 55-year-old man from Hubei province, may be the first.On 26 February 2020, the WHO reported that, as new cases were reported to be decreasing in China but increasing rapidly in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China had already surpassed the number of new cases in China for the first time.
There may be underreporting in some cases, especially among those with mild symptoms.
By 26 February, a small number of cases had been reported among young people, with those aged 19 and under making up 2.4% of the global sample.The United Kingdom's chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, estimated 60% of the British population would need to be infected for effective herd immunity to be achieved.
Examples refer to the number of people tested positive for COVID-19, and their testing confirming the confirmation in accordance with the legal process.
As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries had laws that prevented testing of those with only mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland.
A study published on 16 March found that in China, as of 23 January, an estimated 86% of COVID-19 infections were undetectable, and these undocumented infections were the source of 79% of documented cases of the disease.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March estimated that the number of infections in Italy is much higher than the reported cases.
The initial estimate of the relative reproductive rate (R0) for COVID-19 was 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that it could be 5.7.
Many people with COVID-19 recover.
For those who do not, the time from the onset of symptoms to death is between 6 and 41 days, most commonly 14 days.
As of 10 April 2020, at least 97,000 deaths were attributed to COVID-19.
In China, as of 5 February, approximately 80% of the deaths were in those over 60, and 75% already had pre-existing health conditions including heart disease and diabetes.Official death figures from the COVID-19 pandemic generally refer to people who have died who were tested and confirmed for COVID according to the legal process.
The actual death toll from COVID-19 is likely to be much higher, as it does not include everyone who dies without testing - e.g. at home, in a nursing home, etc.
Partial data from Italy found that the number of overdose deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official COVID death toll by 4-5x.
"A spokesperson for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledged ""We know that [the death toll] is underestimated"", a statement that is consistent with anecdotal reports of underestimated numbers in the U.S. Such underestimates typically occur during epidemics, such as the 2009 H1N1 swine flu outbreak.The first confirmed death was in Wuhan on 9 January 2020".
The first death outside mainland China itself occurred on 1 February in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia occurred in France on 14 February.
On February 28, besides mainland China itself, more than a dozen deaths were recorded in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
By 13 March, more than forty countries and territories had reported deaths, on all continents except Antarctica.There are several measures commonly used to calculate the death rate.
These numbers vary by region and over time, and are influenced by the size of the study, the nature of the health care process, the types of treatment, the time since the onset of the outbreak, and social factors such as age, gender, and overall health. The death-to-case ratio shows the number of deaths divided by the number of samples tested during a specific time interval.
Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death-to-case ratio is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) as of 10 April 2020.
The number varies from place to place.
In China, the estimated death-to-case ratio decreased from 17.3% (for those with symptoms as of 1-10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for those with symptoms as of 1 February 2020). Other measures include case fatality rate (CFR), which indicates the percentage of tested people who die from the disease, and infection fatality rate (IFR), which indicates the percentage of infected (tested and untested) who die from the disease.
These numbers are independent of time and follow the number of individuals from infection to sample solution.
A number of scholars have tried to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The University of Oxford's Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine estimates that the infection fatality rate of the pandemic as a whole is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The higher estimates of this range are consistent with the results from a randomized COVID-19 test in Germany, and statistical studies that analyze the results of the CFR-estimated test.
WHO maintains that the epidemic can be controlled.
The actual extent and duration of the outbreak is uncertain and may vary by location.
"If left unchecked, the contagious outbreak is slowing down and starting to subside as the disease becomes unattended", said Maciej Boni of Penn State University.
"But it is almost impossible to make any precise predictions at present as to when that will be""."
"Chinese government chief medical adviser Zhong Nanshan said ""it could be over by June"" if all countries make a concerted effort to follow the WHO's ad-hoc measures to stop the spread of the virus".
"On 17 March, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine commented that SARS-CoV-2 ""will circulate, strongly for a year or two"""."
"According to an Imperial College study led by Neil Ferguson, physical isolation and other measures will be required ""until a cure is found (by bathing for 18 months or more) ""."
"William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said, ""I think it is unlikely that this coronavirus will disappear forever"" and may ""become a seasonal disease, recurring every year""".
The return strategy depends on the strength of the herd's defenses and the degree of their adaptation
COVID-19 symptoms may be vague and infected people may not show any symptoms.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, drooling and phlegm, loss of smell, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, colds, vomiting, hemoptysis, diarrhea, or cyanosis.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has a list of emergency symptoms such as difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or distress, dizziness, difficulty waking up, and brown face or lips; immediate medical attention is recommended if these symptoms are present. Progression of the disease in this setting can lead to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, septic shock and death.
Some of those infected may not have symptoms, have no clinical signs but their test results confirm infection, so researchers have issued a recommendation that those who have had close contact with those who have been confirmed should be closely monitored and screened to ensure absence of disease.
China's estimates of the asymptomatic ratio range from a few to 44%.
The normal incubation period (the period between infection and the onset of symptoms) ranges from one to 14 days; it is usually five days.To give an example of uncertainty, the estimated proportion of people with COVID-19 who lost their sense of smell was initially 30% and later dropped to 15%.
More details of how the disease is spread are still being worked out.
The disease is believed to spread primarily through close contact and through small droplets formed when you cough, sneeze, or speak; when a close contact is about 1 to 2 feet (3 to 6 feet) away.
Studies have found that uncovered coughing can cause droplets to travel a distance of up to 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some have suggested that the virus may be transmitted through persistent airborne droplets, which may occur during speech. Respiratory bronchitis may also form during exhalation, including during speech, although the virus is not normally airborne.
Drops may be deposited on the lips or noses of people nearby or may be sucked into the lungs.
Other treatments such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may cause the respiratory tract to become inflamed and result in airway obstruction.
It can also spread when someone touches an infected area, including the skin, and then touches the eyes, nose, or mouth.
Although there is concern that it could spread through the skin, the risk is believed to be low.
The Chinese government has denied the possibility of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 virus through oral contact after contact with feces.The virus is most contagious during the first three days after symptoms appear although transmission is possible before symptoms appear and in the later stages of the disease.
People were tested for the virus up to three days before the onset of symptoms indicating that transmission is possible before the development of key symptoms.
Only a few reports of asymptomatic cases confirmed by the laboratory are indicative, but asymptomatic transmission has been identified in some countries during contact tracing investigations.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that while it is not clear how easily a disease spreads, one person usually infects two or three others. The virus continues to live for hours to days on surfaces.
Specifically, the virus has been detected for up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and 304 on stainless steel, one day on cardboard, and up to four hours on foam.
This, however, varies with climate and temperature. Pets and other animals have been found to be positively infected with COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, although British authorities recommend hand washing after touching animals, as well as after touching surfaces that infected people may have touched.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel virus, first isolated from three people with pneumonia in connection with a series of respiratory illness cases in Wuhan.
All symptoms of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus occur in a manner related to the biology of coronaviruses.Outside the human body, the virus dies by domestic exposure, as it dissolves its external defence.SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
It is caused by a zoonotic source.
Genetic studies have shown that the coronavirus is genetically related to the Betacoronavirus strain, both sub-strains of the Sarbecovirus (lineage B) and strains from bats.
It is 96% identical across the molecular weight of the other samples (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there is one amino acid that is substantially different in some parts of the genetic sequence between bacteria from pangolins and those from humans.
All genetic comparisons to date have found that approximately 92% of the actual genetic material between pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 is transcriptal, which is not enough to prove that pangolins are intermediate hosts.
Infection with the virus may be detected by observing symptoms, although the final determination is by modifying the transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of the infected specimen or by CT scanning.
A comparative study of PCR and CT in Wuhan suggested that CT is much more sensitive than PCR, although its accuracy is lower, as many of its images override other pneumonic processes and diseases.
"As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that ""CT should not be used for screening or as a primary screening procedure for COVID-19"""."
WHO has published several RNA testing guidelines for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was issued on 17 January.
The test uses real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
Testing may be done with breath samples or blood.
Results are usually available in a period of a few hours to days.
The test is usually done with a nasopharyngeal swab although a throat swab can also be used.A number of laboratories and companies are developing tests for natural, antibody-sensitive swelling.
As of 6 April 2020, none of these have emerged as being sufficiently accurate to be authorized for universal use.
In the US a natural process test developed by Cellex has been approved for emergency use by certified laboratories only.
Imaging characteristics on radiographs and computed tomography (CT) scans of people with symptoms include asymmetric peripheral ground glass opacities and absent pleural effusions.
The Italian Radiological Society is putting together an online database of worldwide findings from the images of confirmed specimens.
Due to the prevalence of other infections such as adenovirus, imaging without PCR confirmation is limited in accurately identifying COVID-19.
A large study in China compared the results of CT and PCR for asthma and showed that although the image has a low impact in determining infection, it is fast and highly sensitive, which suggests consideration as a diagnostic tool in epidemic areas.
Convolutional neural networks based on artificial intelligence have been developed to investigate the characteristics of viral images by both radiographs and CT scans.
Strategies to prevent transmission of the virus include strict personal hygiene, hand hygiene, avoiding contact with the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands, and coughing or sneezing with tissue paper and then placing the tissue paper directly in the trash.
Those who may have been infected are encouraged to wear a face covering in public.
Physical distancing measures have also been recommended to prevent transmission.Many governments have restricted or warned against non-essential travel to or from countries affected by the epidemic.
Yet, the virus has reached the point of extinction in communities throughout the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within communities, and some members of the community do not know where or how they are infected. Healthcare providers caring for someone who may be infected are encouraged to use standard surveillance, contact monitoring, and eye protection. Tracing affected individuals is an important way for health authorities to identify the source of infection and prevent further transmission.
The government's use of location data from mobile phones for this purpose has removed concerns about privacy rights, with Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issuing a statement calling for limits on this form of surveillance.
Various mobile apps have been installed or suggested for optional use, and as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen teams of experts were working on privacy-related solutions, such as using Bluetooth to log user proximity to other mobile devices.
Users can now receive a message if they come into contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19.There are misconceptions about the prevention of infection; for example, nasal and mouthwash are not effective.
There is no cure for COVID-19, although many organizations are working on developing one.
Handwashing is encouraged to prevent the spread of disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands regularly with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after going to the bathroom or when the hands appear dirty; before eating; and after sneezing, coughing, or sneezing.
The reason for this is that outside the human body, the bacterium is killed by household soap, for it blows its protective bubble.
The CDC also recommends the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol by volume if soap and water are not immediately available.
WHO recommends that people avoid touching their eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
The surfaces can be decontaminated with a few solutions (within one minute of exposure to disinfectant on a stainless steel surface), including 6271% ethanol, 50100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.27.5% povidone-iodine.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and crohexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if a case of COVID is suspected or confirmed in an area such as an office or a nursery, all areas such as offices, restrooms, common areas, public devices such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATM machines that have been used by sick people, must be disinfected.
Health organizations recommend that people cover their mouth and nose with a cloth or tissue when they cough, or when they sneeze, and then discard any tissue immediately.
Breathing masks are recommended for those who may be infected, as wearing a mask limits the amount and range of air droplets that come out of the lungs when speaking, sneezing, and coughing.
WHO has issued guidelines on when and how to use masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "Wearing a mask can reduce the tendency [for] people to touch their faces, which is the main source of infection without proper hand hygiene. ""Masks are also recommended for use by those who are caring for someone who may be infected".
WHO has recommended that non-patients wear masks only if they are at high risk, such as those caring for someone with COVID-19, although they also acknowledge that wearing masks can help people avoid touching their faces.
Many countries have begun to promote the mandatory use of face masks by members of the public.
In the United States, the CDC recommends wearing cloth masks instead of medical masks.China has specifically encouraged non-sick members of the public to use disposable medical masks, especially when in close contact within 1 meter (3 ft) or less of other people.
Hong Kong recommends wearing a face mask when taking public transport or sitting in crowded areas.
Health workers in Thailand's encourage people to make cloth masks at home and clean them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have officially banned going out in public without wearing a mask or a face covering.
On 16 March, Vietnam asked everyone to wear a mask when going into public areas to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has made it mandatory for everyone entering a grocery store to wear a face mask.
Israel has asked all citizens to wear face masks in public.
Taiwan, which has been producing 10 million masks a day since mid-March, has asked passengers on trains and city buses to wear face masks on 1 April.
Panama has made it mandatory to wear a face mask whenever you go out, while at the same time encouraging home-made face masks for those who cannot afford to buy face masks.
Face masks were widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore.
Residential isolation (also known as physical isolation) involves infection control measures intended to slow the spread of disease by limiting close contact with people.
The measures include quarantine; travel restrictions; and closures of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theaters, and shopping malls.
Individuals may be able to use self - isolation measures by staying at home, limiting visitation, avoiding crowded places, greeting without contact, and physically isolating themselves from others.
Many governments are now enforcing or promoting social distancing in those areas affected by the pandemic.
The maximum number of people in a circle recommended by US government branches and health agencies was abruptly reduced from 250 people (if there was no local spread of COVID-19) to 50 people, and later to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany officially banned public gatherings of more than two people.Older adults and those with pre-existing health conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, influenza, and declining immune systems are at risk of severe illness and complications and the CDC has warned them to stay at home as much as possible in public areas with epidemics.In late March 2020, the WHO and other health agencies began using the term 'physical isolation' instead of 'social isolation', to make clear that the intention is to reduce physical contact while limiting social, online or physical contact.
"The use of the term ""social isolation"" then leads to the conclusion that people should participate fully in social isolation, rather than encouraging them to continue contact in other ways.Some authorities have issued sexual health guidelines that may be used during the pandemic".
These include encouragement to have sex only with a live- in partner, who is free of the virus or symptoms.
Isolation by home isolation is recommended for those who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and those who suspect that they may be infected.
Health authorities have issued detailed instructions for proper home isolation. Many governments have imposed or encouraged quarantine for everyone living in affected areas.
The most stringent guidelines for confinement have been passed on by those in high-risk groups.
Those who may have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 and those who have recently visited a country or region with widespread transmission are encouraged to self-isolate for 14 days from the time of the last possible exposure.
Epidemic control strategies are containment or suppression, and mitigation.
The lockdown is followed in the early stages of an outbreak and the aim is to trace and isolate those infected and introduce other infection control and treatment measures to prevent the disease from spreading to other populations.
When it is no longer possible to stem the spread of disease, efforts then move to the phase of mitigation: measures are taken to slow the spread and reduce its impact on health care and society.
Pairing both the prevention and reduction steps may be followed simultaneously.
Suppression requires the most drastic measures to slow the epidemic by reducing the simple birth rate to less than 1.Part of managing an outbreak of an infectious disease is to try to slow the peak of the epidemic, known as curbing the epidemic line.
This reduces the risk of health services being found to be frustrated and gives more time for medicines and solutions to be developed.
Non-pharmacological interventions that can control the outbreak include personal protective measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing a face mask, self-quarantine, public measures aimed at physical isolation such as closing schools and cancelling public gatherings; engaging in public outreach to embrace and participate in such outbreaks; as well as environmental measures such as cleaning.
Other countries have also adopted different measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea introduced mass surveillance and implemented geographic quarantines, and issued warnings about the movement of those infected.
Singapore provided financial support to those infected who locked themselves away and imposed a hefty fine on those who failed to do so.
Taiwan has increased production of face masks and imposed a moratorium on medical supplies.The United Kingdom and the United States' model shows that containment (slowing but not stopping the spread of the epidemic) and containment (delaying the spread of the epidemic) have major challenges.
Basic mitigation policies could reduce the burden of health care by two-thirds and deaths by half, but the end result is hundreds of thousands of deaths and the frustration of health systems.
Suppression may be better but needs to be maintained as long as the virus continues to circulate in the human community (or until a cure is found, if that comes first), as transmission jumps rapidly when the measures are relaxed.
Long-term interventions to contain an epidemic incur social and economic costs.
There is no specifically authorised treatment for COVID-19, but efforts are underway to develop one, including testing existing treatments.
Taking over-the-counter medications, fluids, and rest may help to relieve symptoms.
Depending on the severity, treatment of the airway, intake fluids, and respiratory support may be required.
The use of steroids may also have a negative effect.
Many compounds that have been approved for use in other growing diseases are being investigated for use in treating COVID-19.
"WHO also suggested that some ""traditional and home remedies"" could provide relief from the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19."
Improving capacity and adapting healthcare to the needs of COVID-19 patients is recommended by WHO as a critical response to the pandemic.
The ECDC and the WHO's European regional office have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary care providers on shifting resources in different stages, including focusing laboratory activities on COVID-19 testing, cancelling preferred procedures where possible, screening and isolating confirmed COVID-19 patients, and increasing critical care capacity by recruiting staff and increasing the number of respirators and beds.
There are differing opinions as to where the first specimen (called the egg patient) came from.
The first known case of the new coronavirus dates back to 1 December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
In about a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei rose slightly.
These were closely linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which also sells live animals, and the theory is that the virus originated from one of these species; or, in other words, has an animal-transplant origin.A strain of pneumonia of unknown origin was observed on 26 December and treated by Dr. Zhang Jixian at Hubei Provincial Hospital, who reported to the Wuhan Jianghan CDC on 27 December.
"On 30 December, a team of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues about a""SARS-like coronavirus""".
Eight doctors, including Li Wenliang, were reprimanded by the police for spreading false rumors, and another, Ai Fen, was reprimanded by his superiors for sounding an alarm.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission later issued a public notice on 31 December and reported it to WHO.
Sufficient cases of unknown pneumonia had been reported to the Wuhan health authorities to clear the investigation in early January.In the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled at least every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other provinces in China, aided by transportation due to Chinese New Year and the fact that Wuhan is a hub for transportation and exchange on major railways.
On 20 January, China reported about 140 cases in a single day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Official data later showed that 6,174 people were showing symptoms by 20 January 2020.As of 26 March, the United States has surpassed China and Italy as the highest number of confirmed cases in the world.As of 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million cases have been reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people have died and more than 364,000 have recovered.

COVID-19 was confirmed to have spread to South Korea on 20 January 2020 from China.
The country's health representatives reported a notable rise in confirmed cases on 20 February, largely attributed to the Daegu outbreak of a new religious group known as the Shincheonji Church of Jesus.

Monitoring methods include mandatory self-reporting of symptoms to those from foreign countries through the use of a mobile phone system, vehicle-by-vehicle testing where the results are available the next day, and increased testing capacity that will allow 20,000 people to be tested daily.
South Korea's program is considered a success in controlling the pandemic despite not completely shutting down cities.The South Korean public was divided in opinion when President Moon Jae-in initially responded to the crisis.

Shia religious shrines in Qom remained open until 16 March 2020.In February Iran became the centre of the virus outbreak, second only to China.
Allegations that Iran had reduced the actual number of cases to pass on a false image prompted more than ten countries with cases to investigate the source of the disease. They found that the disease was present in Iran on 28 February, the date the Iranian government reported only 388 cases, which would mean that the number was much higher than reported.
On 3 March, the Iranian Parliament was closed after 23 of its 290 members were found to be infected with the virus.

The UK's response to the first outbreak was less rapid than in other affected countries, and until 18 March 2020, the British government had not introduced social distancing or quarantine measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
As a result, people have criticized the government for not taking the issue seriously and for the way it has responded to public concerns.On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson issued an announcement regarding unnecessary travel and contact, urging people to work from home if possible and avoiding places such as bars, restaurants and public sports and cinemas.

Despite these measures, the United States delayed the launch of testing programs for the virus, which made it unclear how far the disease had spread.
The detection of the disease was hampered by the lack of effective testing equipment as those sent by the government office in February were dead, the lack of government approval for the use of testing equipment from private organizations (such as research and educational institutions, companies and hospitals) until the end of February and the results of the testing of people until the beginning of March (after which a doctor's note was required).

"On 23 January, in response to the decision of the central authorities to impose a travel ban in Wuhan, WHO representative Gauden Galea noted that while this is ""not at all WHO recommendation"", it is at the same time ""the most important commitment decision to contain the epidemic in the area where it is concentrated"" and called it ""unprecedented in the history of public health"".On 30 January, following the confirmation of human-to-human transmission outside China and the rise in the number of cases in other countries, the WHO declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), the sixth PHEIC since the outbreak of swine flu began in 2009".
"WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom said PHEIC was due to the reason for ""the risk of global spread, especially in low and middle income countries with no robust health system"".
"In response to the imposition of travel restrictions, Tedros issued a statement that ""there is no reason for measures that affect international travel and trade unnecessarily"" and that ""WHO does not recommend imposing restrictions on trade and movement"".""

The group stressed that a lack of energy or health insurance should never serve as a reason to discriminate against a particular group.
Experts focus on the right of access to health care for everyone, including people with disabilities, from minority groups, the elderly, internally displaced persons, the homeless, those living in extreme poverty, people in prison, as well as refugees and other undefined groups in need of government assistance.

The Chinese government has been heavily criticized by the United States, UK Cabinet Minister Michael Gove, and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro's son Eduardo Bolsonaro for their handling of the epidemic, which began in China's Hubei province.
A number of provincial-level Communist Party of China (CPC) officials were fired over their handling of detention efforts in Central China, a sign of dissatisfaction with the way the political branch responded to the outbreak in those areas.
Some commentators believe that this move was intended to protect Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping from public outrage over the coronavirus outbreak.
Some Chinese officials, e.g. Zhao Lijian initially refused to accept the coronavirus outbreak originating in Wuhan, preferring conspiracy theories about COVID-19 as originating in the U.S. or Italy.
"The U.S. administration of Donald Trump has called the coronavirus ""the Chinese virus"" and the ""Wuhan virus"" a policy of China ""to covertly disrupt the virus that has now become a global pandemic"", which has been criticized by some critics as discriminatory and ""[a] disruption to his administration's ability to contain the disease""."
"The Daily Beast reached out to the U.S. State Department detailing a communication strategy that apparently originated from the National Security Council, a strategy summarized as ""Everything is about China".
"We are told to try to get the message out in any way possible, including press conferences and TV appearances. ""Media outlets such as Politico, Foreign Policy, and Bloomberg have reported that China's efforts to send aid to countries affected by the virus are part of a propaganda effort to reach out and influence the world".
"EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned that there is a ""local political spark that combines the struggle for influence through manipulation with the 'politics of generosity'""."
"Borrell also said ""China is pushing the message strongly that, unlike the US, it is a responsible and trusted partner""".
China also commented that the US has raised its sanctions on Syria, Venezuela and Iran, although it is reportedly sending aid to the latter two countries.
Jack Ma's donation of 100,000 masks to Cuba was blocked by US sanctions on 3 April.
US authorities have also been accused of diverting aid intended for other nations into their own country.
There have also been reports of mask strikes between other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland, as well as the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey seized hundreds of ventilators that had been bound for Spain.
In early March, the Italian government criticized the European Union for lacking unity with Italy and being hit by the coronavirus.
" Maurizio Massari, Italy's ambassador to the EU, said ""China was the only country that responded positively. ""
"This is certainly not a good sign for European unity"""
On March 22, after a telephone conversation with the Italian prime minister, Russian president Vladimir Putin arranged for the Russian military to send military medics, special disinfecting vehicles and other medical equipment to Italy.
"The Italian newspaper La Stampa quoted a ""highly political source"" that 80% of Russian aid ""was of little or no benefit to Italy"""
" The source accused Russia of conducting a campaign of " politically " appealing to the US. "
The president of Lombardy, Attilio Fontana, and the Italian Foreign Minister, Luigi Di Maio, have cancelled the press reports and expressed their appreciation.
Russia once again sent a cargo plane to the United States with only medical supplies.
" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said ""if we hand over the aid to our US partners, [Putin] assumes that US manufacturers of medical devices will be able to do the same for us if necessary"""
" The planned NATO military exercises ""Defender 2020"" in Germany, Poland, and the Baltic states, which are the largest NATO military exercises since the end of the Cold War, will be conducted on a reduced scale. "
" The Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament's Secretary General Kate Hudson has criticized the Defender 2020 trial: ""In the midst of a public health crisis, it puts at risk not only the lives of soldiers from the US and other European partner countries but also citizens of the countries where they operate. ""The Iranian government is under severe strain from the virus, with as many as 24 sitting parliamentarians and 15 current or former politicians".
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani wrote to world leaders on 14 March 2020, calling for help as his country struggles to combat the crisis due to the lack of access to international markets caused by the US sanctions against Iran. The crisis has led to recommendations that the United States adopt more inclusive social policies like other wealthy nations, universal health care, childcare, paid family leave and high-quality public health care.
Political analysts expect it could negatively affect Donald Trump's chances of winning the 2020 presidential election.Political relations between Japan and South Korea have become strained by the pandemic.
"South Korea has criticized Japan for its "fake detention efforts" after Japan announced that anyone from South Korea would be held for two weeks in detention centers designated by the government".
Earlier, the South Korean public was very divided on the reaction of president Moon Jae-in to the tragedy.
Many Koreans have signed petitions to oust Moon or advocate his response. The pandemic has allowed countries to respond by passing disaster laws.
Some commentators have expressed concern that it could allow governments to tighten the grip on power.
In Hungary, the parliament voted to give prime minister Viktor Orban an indefinite mandate, with the power to suspend parliament and elections and punish those who allegedly spread false information about the virus and the government's handling of it.
The coronavirus outbreak is blamed for shortages of certain supplies due to the increased use of machinery to combat the epidemic, over-selling and disruption in production and logistics.
The United States Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings about shortages of legal drugs and medical equipment due to high consumer demand and disruption to vendors.
A few quarters have seen overspending leading to rapid depletion of basic commodities such as food, toilet paper and water purchases causing shortages of essential goods.
The technology industry has been warning about the delays in the transport of electrical goods.
According to WHO Director- General Tedros Adhanom, the demand for personal protective equipment has increased 100-fold.
This demand has led to an increase in prices by up to twenty times the normal purchase price and has created delays in medical supplies by four to six months.
It has also created a global shortage of personal protective equipment, with WHO warning that this is endangering the lives of medical workers.
In Australia, the pandemic has created a new opportunity for daigou buyers to sell Australian products to China.
The occurrence of this will cause a shortage of baby bottle food in some supermarkets and the Australian government has closed them.Despite the high level of Covid-19 infection in Northern Italy and the Wuhan region and the subsequent high demand for food, both areas have not experienced a severe food shortage.
China and Italy's measures against the hoarding and trafficking of vital commodities have been successful and prevented the anticipated food shortages in Europe and North America
Northern Italy and its abundant agriculture have not seen a major decline, but according to industry representatives, prices may rise.
Shelves were empty for a while even in the city of Wuhan, and in China, government officials released pork that had been stockpiled to ensure the nutrition of citizens.
Similar laws exist in Italy that require those who serve food to save for emergencies.
The global economic damage was felt in China, according to media reports on 16 March 2020, the Chinese economy suffered a severe blow in the first two months of 2020 due to government measures to curb the spread of the virus, with retail sales falling by 20.5%.
With China as the economic and industrial powerhouse, the virus outbreak is seen as a threat to global economic stability
Agathe Demarais of the Economist Intelligence Unit predicted that markets will remain volatile until a clear picture of the possible outcomes emerges.
In January 2020, some analysts suggested that the economic impact of the pandemic on global economic growth could now exceed that of the 2002-2004 SARS epidemic.
One estimate from a scholar at Washington University in St. Louis gave a two-year impact of more than $300 billion on the supply chain.

Tourism is among the industries most affected by travel restrictions, closures of public and tourist areas as well as government advisories against travel worldwide.
According to the results, airlines have canceled flights due to a decline in demand including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas and British airline Flybe went bankrupt.
The impact on the cruise industry was at an unprecedented level.
Some train and ferry terminals are being closed.
The epidemic occurred during the Chunyu, the high- tourist season associated with the Chinese New Year.
Many events that attract large crowds have been canceled by international and regional governments including New Year celebrations and private companies are also closing stores and tourist attractions such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Several Lunar ceremonies and tourist sites are also closed to prevent mass gatherings including the Forbidden City in Beijing and the traditional Temple ceremonies.
In 24 of China's 31 provinces, municipalities, and regions, authorities extended the New Year holiday to 10 February, telling all workplaces not to open until that date.
These regions account for 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of its exports.
Hong Kong has raised the infectious disease alert to a level that has now been marked by a state of emergency, with schools closed until March and the celebration of the new year cancelled. The retail industry has been disrupted worldwide and there has been a decline in hours spent in stores or their temporary closure.
Shopping in Europe and Latin America fell by 40%
North America and the Middle East saw a 50-60% decline
This has resulted in a drop of 33 to 43% in the number of people visiting supermarkets in March compared to February.
Shopping mall owners around the world have set new standards, such as drinking water purification and the installation of thermal scanners to monitor temperature of consumers and the removal of waste. According to the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America the economic downturn caused by the pandemic could leave 14 to 22 million people worse off than they would have been without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, during the height of the epidemic in Wuhan, 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
The majority of the estimated 300 million migrant workers are either stuck in their homes in the interior provinces or stuck in Hubei Province.In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and appealed for government assistance.
The coronavirus pandemic may have cost 47 million jobs in the United States and the unemployment rate could be as high as 32% according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis. The lockdown in India has left tens of millions of Indian seasonal day-wage workers without work. A study by the Angus Rei Institute found that 44% of Canadian households have been affected by unemployment. Nearly 900,000 workers in Spain have lost their jobs since the country's lockdown began in mid-March 2020.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers signed up for short- term grants and 1 million British workers signed up for the universal credit scheme. About half a million companies in Germany have brought workers into the government's reduced-time working program called Kurzarbeit.
This German system of reduced hours has been adopted by France and Britain.
The arts and culture industries have been significantly affected by the pandemic and disrupted the functioning of organizations and individuals - both employed and self-employed - worldwide
Art and cultural organisations have tried to run their own programmes, often government-funded, to open up spaces to the public and to keep their staff and the public safe and to support celebrities.
Then in March 2020, worldwide and at different levels, museums, libraries, theatres and cultural venues were closed indefinitely, festivals and concerts were cancelled or postponed.
Efforts were made to meet the needs through technological means. Also new and more immediate was the cancellation of religious, sports and other civic events such as festivals and concerts and technology and fashion conferences.
The video game industry has been disrupted. The Vatican has announced that the celebration of Holy Week in Rome, which takes place during the last week of the Christian month of Lent, has been cancelled.
Dioceses have encouraged older Christians to stay at home instead of going to church on Sundays. Some churches have made their programs available through mail, live streaming or television.
With the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rome shutting down its churches and St Peter's Square evacuating all pilgrims other organizations have canceled plans or held limited gatherings at churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gurdwaras.
The Ministry of Health in Iran announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in the areas affected by the epidemic and the closure of places of worship, while in Saudi Arabia, foreign believers and local residents were barred from entering the holy buildings in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused the greatest disruption to international sporting programs since World War II.
Many major sporting events have been postponed or abandoned altogether, including the 2019-2020 UEFA Champions League, the 2019-2020 Premier League, the 2020 UEFA Euro, the 2019-2020 NBA Season and the 2019-2020 NHL season.
"The outbreak has disrupted the 2020 Summer Olympics which were originally scheduled to begin in late July; the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that the games ""will be rescheduled for a later date than 2020 but no later than the summer of 2021"".Casinos and other sports venues around the world have been closed and live poker tournaments have been postponed or cancelled".
This has led to gamblers going online, many gambling sites reporting a huge increase in sign-ups.The entertainment industry has also been affected, with bands cancelling or cancelling concert tours.
Many theatrical productions such as those on Broadway have a full-time production.
"Some artists have explored ways to continue recording and sharing their work via the internet instead of live performance as usual, such as live streaming of concerts or creating web based ""events"" for artists to perform, broadcast and promote their work".
Many memes about the coronavirus have been circulating online as many turn to humor and distractions during times of uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, high levels of discrimination, racism and racial profiling have been observed against people of non-Chinese and East Asian origin and against people from certain areas of Europe, the United States and other countries.
Incidents of fear, suspicion and hostility have been reported in many countries especially in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
Reports in February, when most of the cases were still within China's borders, noted racial sentiments being expressed by various groups around the world that the Chinese people either deserved the virus or got what they called the retaliation they deserved.
Some African countries have seen a rise in anti-Chinese sentiment.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei reported being discriminated against because of their places of origin
There has been support from the Chinese both on social media and in real life for those in the affected areas.
Following the spread of the outbreak to other countries, Italians, the first European country to have a serious outbreak of Covid-19, may face accusations and racial discrimination. Citizens of countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea have begun signing petitions in conjunction with campaigns to prevent Chinese people from entering their countries in an attempt to curb the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan has become popular on Twitter.
Chinese and other Asians in the United Kingdom and the United States have reported increasing rates of racial abuse and physical assault.
"U.S. President Donald Trump has faced criticism for referring to the coronavirus as the ""Chinese Virus"", a term that critics see as racist and anti-Chinese".
Protesters in Ukraine stormed buses carrying Ukrainians and foreigners who were returned from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhary.
Students from Northeast India, which borders China and who study in major Indian cities, have reportedly been subjected to harassment related to the coronavirus outbreak.
"The president of The Bharatiya Janata Party in West Bengal Dilip Ghosh said the Chinese had killed nature and ""that is why the gods have taken their revenge"""
"These claims have been condemned by the Chinese embassy in Kolkata, calling them ""false"".In China, racism and discrimination against non-Chinese have been given a boost by the pandemic, foreigners have been labeled ""foreign trash"" and scheduled for ""disposal""".
Many paid-for newspapers have withdrawn some coverage or stopped entirely in regards to coronavirus-related stories.
Many scientific publishers have made scientific papers on this outbreak freely available.
Some scientists have chosen to share their results with others immediately on preprint servers such as bioRxiv.

Testing for respiratory coronavirus disease 2019 Covid-19 and related SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods to detect the presence of the virus and those that detect antibodies that develop as a result of infection.
The presence of viruses in samples is confirmed by RT-PCR detection of the presence of coronavirus RNA.
This study is specifically designed to test the RNA of the SARS-Cov-2 virus.
It is used to confirm the recent or existing diagnosis of disease.
Antibody testing, serology, can be used for both human disease testing and for the identification of a host.
Antibody tests indicate how many people have had the disease and also those whose symptoms were too mild to be reported or who had no symptoms at all.
The precise mortality rate and the infection rate of the population can be derived from the results of these tests.
Due to the limited number of tests, as of March 2020, no countries had reliable statistics on the spread of the virus in their population.
As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population and there is a wide variation in the number of tests done between countries.
These variations may have a significant impact on reported death rates that may be exaggerated by some countries.
Using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, rRt-PCR, this assay can be performed on respiratory samples obtained by various methods, including nasopharyngeal swab or sputum sample.
Results are usually obtained within 2 hours to 2 days.
A test called an RT-PCR scan with throat swabs can be reliable only in the first week of infection.
In the future, the virus may disappear from the throat but continue to multiply in the lungs.
For infected people tested at week two, additional sample material may be removed from the depth of the respiratory tract with a suction catheter or by coughing up the material, sputum, is not used.
Some of the first PCR assays were developed at the Charite in Berlin in January 2020 using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ,irRT-PCR, forming the basis for the distribution of 250,000 kits by the World Health Organization, WHO.
The United Kingdom had also developed a test method on 23 January 2020.The South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a PCR-based SARSCoV-2 clinical-grade test kit on 28 January 2020.
"It detects the same ""E gene"" for all beta coronaviruses and the RdRp gene found only in SARS-CoV-2.In China, BGI Group was one of the companies that received emergency approval from the National Products Administration of China to use a PCR-based test kit for SARS-CoV-2.In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, is distributing the 2019 Novel Coronavirus, 2019-Novel, Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel to clinical trial centers using the International Reagent Resource".
Three of the genetic tests in the old test kit models caused unclear results due to poor reagents and testing overcrowding at the CDC in Atlanta, this resulted in an average of less than 100 samples per day being successful throughout February 2020.
The two-part test was not found to be reliable until 28 February 2020 and it was not until then that state and local testing centres were allowed to start testing.
The test method was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under an Emergency Use Authorization.The independent testing facilities began testing in early March 2020.
5 March 2020 LabCorp announced the nationwide availability of COVID-19 tests based on RT-PCR
Quest Diagnostics has also made the COVID-19 test available as of 9 March 2020
No statistical estimates were announced, and the collection and digestion of specimens should be done according to CDC requirements.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR
On 11 February 2020 this test method was registered with the Federal Service for Surveillance in Healthcare.On 12 March 2020, it was reported that Mayo Clinic had developed a test for the management of COVID-19.On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for a test model that could be performed within 3.5 hours thus allowing one machine to perform 4128 tests in a 24-hour period.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA issued Abbott Laboratories with an emergency use authorization, EUA, to test with the Abbott m2000 system, the FDA had previously granted similar authorizations to Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Cepheid also received an EUA from the FDA for a clinical trial lasting approximately 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved a type of test that uses isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology instead of PCR.
Because this one does not require a series of cold-and-hot cycles, this type can give positive results in as little as five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 machines in the U.S. and Abbott expects to increase production to test 50,000 per day.A test that uses a monoclonal antibody specifically attached to the nucleocapsid protein, N protein, of the novel coronavirus is being developed in Taiwan with the hope that it can provide results in 15 to 20 minutes similar to those of an influenza test.
A March 2020 literature review concluded that "thoracic radiographs are of little benefit in the early stages and that CT, computed tomography, may be present before symptoms begin to appear".
Common features of CT include bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacifities with peripheral, asymetricand posterior distribution.
Subpleural dominance, crazy paving and consolidation increase as the disease mutates.
A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan at the outbreak's epicenter suggested that CT is more sensitive than PCR but lacked data, with many features being consistent with other pneumonia and disease processes.
"As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that ""CT be used for screening or testing for COVID-19 for the first time"" As of March 2020, the CDC recommends PCR in the first screening"""
Part of the immune response to infection is the production of antibodies including -Igm and IgG.
These can be used to test for the presence of disease from 7 days or more after the onset of symptoms, for infection and community surveillance.Assays can be performed by primary testing centers, CLTs, or by point-of-care testing, PoCT.
High-performance automated systems in many medical laboratories will be able to run assays but their availability will depend on the speed of production of each.
With CLT, only one peripheral blood sample is normally used, although serial specimens can be used for immune responses.
In PoCT, a single blood sample is usually detected by skin scanning.
Unlike PCR methods, the pre-assay stain is not required.On 26 March 2020, the FDA introduced the names of 29 agents that it reported to the agency as required and are now able to distribute their antibody tests.
As of 7 April 2020, only one test method has been approved by the FDA under emergency authorization.In late March 2020, Euroiminium Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitome Diagnostics received approval for their European test kits that can detect the presence of IgG and IgA antibodies against the virus in blood samples.
The test volume is a few hundred samples per hour so it is much faster than the conventional PCR assay for Viral RNA.
The presence of antibodies is usually tested after 14 days of diagnosis. In April, the UK found that none of the antibody test kits it had purchased could be put to any useful use.
"Hong Kong has introduced a system where suspected patients can stay at home, ""an emergency medicine that will give the patient a specimen tube"", to spit in, return it and receive the results after a short time.The British NHS has announced that it is launching a home testing system to eliminate the threat of a patient infecting others when going to the clinic or the need to flush disinfecting patient vehicles if any have been used.For those who are diagnosed with COVID-19 in the testing rooms before they get out of the car, the health officer will use the samples to take the appropriate precautions".
In Germany, the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians spoke on 2 March, saying it had capacity to handle about 12,000 tests per day through the induction program and 10,700 tests had been done in the previous week.
The cost is covered by health insurance when the examination is ordered by a doctor.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has the capacity to handle 160,000 tests a week.
From 19 March a driving-by-pass test was offered in most major cities.
As of 26 March 2020 the total number of tests performed by Germany was unknown, as only accurate results are reported.
" The initial laboratory survey showed that as of the calendar week 12/2020 a total of at least 483,295 samples were tested up to and including the week 12/2020 and 33,491 samples (6.9%) when the test confirmed SARS-CoV-2.In Israel, researchers at the Technion and Rambam Hospital built and tested a test system to test samples from 64 patients at once, by combining samples with additional tests when the combined sample showed confirmation.In Wuhan, a 2000 sq-meter emergency lab lab lab called ""Huo-Yan"" (Chinese text: 火眼, or ""eye of fire"" in English) was only tested by the BGI on 5 February 2020, testing more than 10,000 samples per day".
As the facility was managed by BGI founder Wang Jian and took 5 days, simulations show that the samples in Hubei would have been 47% higher and the cost of meeting the quarantine would have been doubled if the containment capacity for the test had not been available in time.
The Wuhan lab is soon followed by the Huo-Yan labs in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, a total of 12 cities across China.
As of 4 March 2020 the total daily transmission was 50,000 tests per day. The open source, sophisticated algorithms released by Origami Assays are open to enable testing of many patient samples up to 1122 for COVID19 using only 93 assays. These algorithms can be run in small labs without the need for fluid handling robots.
Since March, the shortage and insufficient amount of reagent has become a major issue in most tests between the EU and the UK and the US.
This has led some authors to explore sample preparation procedures involving heating samples to 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release further RNA elements for testing. On 31 March it was announced that the United Arab Emirates was now testing more of its population for Coronavirus per capita than any other country, and was moving at a good pace to break the testing standard to reach a larger proportion of the population.
"This was a combination of carrying pass-through power, and purchasing a population-scale mass-throughput laboratory from Group 42 and BGI (based on the ""Huo-Yan"" emergency detection laboratories in China)".
Built in 14 days, the lab is capable of running tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests a day and is the first in the world of this operational standard outside of China.
Different methods of testing the cognition of different members of the coronavirus genome were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States.
The World Health Organization preferred the German process for manufacturing kits for export to poorer countries that do not have the resources to produce their own.
The German protocol was published on 17 January 2020; the policy established by the United States Centers for Disease Control was not available until 28 January, delaying the testing available in the U.S. China and the United States faced test kit reliability issues early in the outbreak, and these countries and Australia were unable to build and ship enough kits to meet the need and motivation of health professionals.
In contrast, experts say the widespread availability of testing in South Korea has helped to reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
The capacity to carry out testing, especially in private laboratories, was built up over many years by the South Korean government.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization called for the strengthening of testing protocols as the best way to slow the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.The high demand for testing due to the breadth of the virus spread caused a labor shortage of hundreds of thousands in U.S. private laboratories, and the release of swabs and chemical reagents was suppressed.
In March 2020 China reported problems with the accuracy of its test kits.
"In the United States, CDC-designed test kits were found to be ""flawed;"" the government removed legal barriers that prevented private testing. Spain purchased kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the results were inaccurate".
The company explained that the erroneous results may have been caused by judgments about the collection of samples or the correct use of kits.
The Spanish ministry said it would remove the test kits that had given false results, and replace them with the different ones provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy.Eighty percent of the test kits the Czech Republic bought from China gave false results.Slovakia bought 1.2 million test kits from China that were found to be inaccurate.
"Prime Minister Matovič suggested that they be disposed of by being placed in the Danube.Ateş Kara of the Turkish Health Ministry said that the Turkish test kits purchased in China were found to have a ""high rate of error"" and were not ""used"."The UK purchased 3.5 million test kits from China but in early April 2020 declared them unusable".
The testing, followed by the detention of those found to be positive at the time of testing and followed by those who had contact with people who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, also had positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vò, the site of the first COVID-19 death in Italy, conducted two rounds of surveys of a total population of 3,400 people, at least ten days apart.
At least half of the test subjects were asymptomatic, and all the samples were sealed.
Since visits are restricted, this eliminates completely new contacts.
With active tracking of those affected, restricted inbound travel, testing, and quarantine, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore has progressed more slowly than in other developed countries, but without severe restrictions such as forcing the closure of food and other retail outlets.
Many events have been cancelled, and Singapore began advising residents to stay at home on 28 March, but schools reopened in time for the holiday break on 23 March.
Several countries have also managed to manage the pandemic with active contact tracing, domestic travel restrictions, screening, and quarantine, but to a lesser extent with lockdowns, such as Iceland and South Korea.
Statistical studies have found that countries that do more testing, compared to the number of deaths, have lower mortality rates, which may be due to the fact that they are in a better position to investigate those with mild or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries that do not have the capacity to carry out testing and have national laboratories with limited experience with COVID-19 send five primary and ten secondary positive samples of COVID-19 to one of WHO's 16 trusted laboratories that will certify testing.
Of the 16 trusted laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America, and 1 in Australia.
In the following chart, the column Confirming % of testing is influenced by the country's testing policy.
A country that tests only people admitted to hospitals will have more confirmed cases with a % of testing than a country that tests all of its citizens, whether they show symptoms or not, other things being equal.
Handwashing, also known as hand hygiene, is the act of cleaning hands with the intention of removing dirt, grease, small objects, or unwanted touches.
Regular hand washing with soap at those "critical times" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, for example, diarrhea and cholera, which are spread through the oral system.
People can also contract respiratory diseases such as the common cold or flu, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth (i.e., the areas that are still shrinking).
The five critical times during the day when handwashing with soap is important include: before and after defecation, after cleaning a baby's poop or changing diapers, before feeding a baby, before eating and before and after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish, or poultry.
If water and soap are not available, hands may be washed with ash.
Before, during, and after preparing food.
Before and after caring for a sick person.
After changing the diaper or cleaning the child who has used the toilet.
After sneezing, coughing, or sneezing.
After touching an animal, animal feed, or animal waste.
Medical hand hygiene refers to hygiene practices related to medical procedures.
Handwashing before administering medicine or medical care can prevent or reduce the spread of disease.
The primary medical purpose of hand sanitizing is to sanitize hands with pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause injury or disease.
This is especially important for those who handle food or work in the medical field, but it is an important procedure even for the general public.
Handwashing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus, and other infectious diseases; preventing the transmission of diarrhoea; reducing respiratory illness;
and reducing the infant mortality rate in home birth.
A 2013 study found that a high hand-washing routine may lead to a reduced developmental rate in children under five years of age.
In developing countries, the death rate among young people related to respiratory diseases and diarrhea can be reduced by introducing simple behavioral changes, such as hand washing with soap.
A simple act could reduce the death rate from these diseases by about 50 percent.
Interventions that promote handwashing with soap can reduce diarrhea by a third, and this can be compared to providing clean water to economically deprived areas.
A 48% reduction in diarrhea episodes can be associated with handwashing with soap. Handwashing with soap is one of the most effective and cost-effective ways to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (ARI), as a common behavioral practice that occurs in homes, schools, and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, the major A.R.I., is the single leading cause of death in infants under five years of age, claiming the lives of an estimated 1.8 million children a year.
Diarrhea and pneumonia are both responsible for the deaths of some 3.5 million infants a year.
According to UNICEF, making hand washing with soap before eating and after using the toilet a firm habit can save more lives than any single treatment or medical intervention, deciding deaths from diarrhea by almost half and deaths from respiratory diseases by one half.
Hand hygiene is often combined with other waste management interventions as part of water, waste and sanitation (WASH) systems.
Handwashing also protects against the transmission of impetigo from direct contact.
A minor risk associated with frequent hand washing is skin damage caused by dry skin.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing can result in a skin condition known as hand eczema or hand dermatitis, which is more common among healthcare workers.
Frequent hand washing is also seen as one of the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
The five critical times during the day when handwashing with soap is important to reduce the transmission of disease via the oral-to-oral route are: after using the toilet (urinating, defecating), after cleaning the baby's bowels (changing the diaphragm), before feeding the baby, before eating or before/after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish, or poultry.
Other times when proper hand hygiene procedures should be followed to avoid transmission include before and after handling a cut or wound; after sneezing, coughing, or sneezing; after touching animal waste or handling animals; and after handling litter.
In many countries, there is a low level of hand-washing with soap.
A 2015 handwashing study in 54 countries found that, on average, 38.7% of households follow a handwashing routine with soap. A 2014 study showed that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate of 97 percent; the United States was near the middle at 77 percent; and China had the lowest rate at 23 percent. Few practices are now in place to prevent the adoption of handwashing with soap during emergencies.
The "Essential Health Care Program" initiated by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of a statistical action to promote children's health and education.
Twice-yearly hand-washing, coupled with regular hand-washing with soap and daily fluoride scrubbing, is a cornerstone of the national program.
It has also been successfully introduced in Indonesia.
Removing microorganisms from the skin is best done by applying a soap or detergent to the water.
The main function of soap and detergent is to reduce the blockage of the solution, and increase solubility.
Water alone is not enough to cleanse the skin because fats and proteins, which are the building blocks of soil, are not easily soluble in water.
But cleaning is aided by the flowing water in proportion.
A soap that is a liquid, because it is able to recycle, may retain the remaining bacteria from the previous activity.
A small number of studies looking at transmission from a contaminated nerve to a person with a cleft palate have concluded that it is not possible as the bacteria are washed away as well as the mold.
The CDC still maintains that "liquid soap and hands-free control are better".
Antibacterial soaps have been heavily promoted by members of the health-conscious community.
To date, there is no evidence that the use of the proposed antiseptics or disinfectants favors naturally occurring antibiotic-resistant organisms.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, which has a long list of resistant strains of organisms.
Thus, even if antibiotic-resistant strains are not selected in the antibacterial soap, they may not be as effective as those marketed to them.
Besides a surfactant and a skin-protective agent, the complex structures may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as pH control, antimicrobially active benzoic acid and other skin excipients (aloe verae, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts).Extensive studies from the University of Oregon School of Public Health showed that empty soaps are just as effective as consumer-grade anti-bacterial soaps containing triclosan in preventing infection and feeding bacteria.
Hot water that cannot be used to wash hands is not hot enough to kill germs.
Bacteria grow most when the temperature of the pond is >37 °C.
However, warm, soapy water is more effective than cold, soapy water in removing natural greases that trap soil and germs.
Contrary to popular belief, however, scientific research has shown that using warm water does not contribute to reducing the microbial load on the hands.
Hand sanitizer or hand antiseptic is a waterless hand sanitizer.
In the late 1990's and early part of the 21st century, alcohol-based hand sanitizers (also known as alcohol-based hand rubs, antiseptic hand rubs, or hand sanitizers) began to gain popularity.
Many are based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol which has been mixed with an abrasive agent such as Carbomer (a polymer of acrylic acid) to form a gel, or a humectant such as glycerin to form a liquid, or a foam to facilitate use and reduce the dryness of the alcohol.
The addition of liquid hydrogen peroxide enhances the antimicrobial activity even more. Hand sanitizers with 60 to 95% alcohol are effective in killing bacteria.
Alcohol rub sanitizer kills germs, multidrug-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis, and other viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccinia, influenza, and hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcohol rub sanitizers with 70% alcohol kill 99.97% (3.5 log per decrease, equivalent to 35 decibel decrease) of bacteria on the hands within 30 seconds after application and 99.99% to 99.999% (4 to 5 log per decrease) of bacteria on the hands 1 minute after application.Hand sanitizers are effective against bacteria and less effective against certain bacteria.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are almost completely ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk) strain bacteria, the main cause of infectious gastroenteritis. Sufficient hand antiseptic or alcohol rub should be used to completely soften or cover both hands.
The front and back of both hands and the inside and the ends of the fingers are rubbed for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam, or gel is dry.
The US Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand washing instead of hand sanitizer, especially if the hands are obviously dirty.
The rise in the use of these agents is due to their simple action and quick killing of micro-organisms; however, they should be used to replace proper hand washing unless soap and water are unavailable.
Regular use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers can cause dry skin unless emollients and/or skin moisturizers are added to the mixture.
The dehydration process of alcohol can be slowed or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or emollients to the mixture.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers with emollients produced better skin irritation and dryness than soap or antimicrobial-based cleansers.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives in alcohol hand rubs are uncommon.
The low incidence of irritant contact dermatitis is attractive compared to handwashing with soap and water.
Whatever their function, waterless detergents do not clean hands of natural contaminants, but they simply kill bacteria.
It is for this reason that hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of most pathogens, as pathogens remain on the hands.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand sanitizers is highly dependent on the ingredients and the composition, and they are historically more effective than alcohol and alcohol rubs.
Recently, combinations using benzalkonium chloride have shown persistence and increased antimicrobial activity after application, unlike alcohol, which has been shown to decrease the level of activity after repeated application, possibly causing a persistent skin reaction.
Many people in economically deprived communities cannot afford soap and use ashes or soil instead.
Ash or soil may be more effective than water alone, but less effective than soap.
One concern is that if soil or ashes are contaminated with microorganisms, they may increase the spread of disease rather than slow it down.
Like soap, ashes are also a disinfectant because when mixed with water, an alkaline mixture is formed.
WHO recommends ash or sand as a substitute for soap if soap is not available.
Proper hand hygiene recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control for prevention of transmission of disease includes the following steps:
Rinse your hands with running warm or cold water.
Flowing water is encouraged because standing water may have impurities, and the temperature of the water does not seem to make a difference.
Rub your hands with a sufficient amount of soap, including the back of the hands, between the fingers, and under the fingernails.
Soap absorbs bacteria from the skin, and studies show that people wash their hands more effectively when soap is present than when they use only water.
Stir for at least 20 seconds.
Rubbing causes heat, which helps to remove bacteria from the skin, and prolonged rubbing removes additional bacteria.
Rinse thoroughly under running water.
Washing a basin may contaminate the hands
Dry with a clean towel or let air dry.
Wet and damp hands easily absorb dirt. The easy-to-remember areas are the thumb, the forefinger, the areas between the fingers, and under the nails.
Artificial nails and worn nail polish can harbor microorganisms.
Moisturizing lotion is often recommended to keep hands dry; dry skin can lead to skin lesions that can raise the risk of infection.
Alternatively, inexpensive alternatives can be implemented to address hand sanitization where tap water and/or soap is not available e.g. pouring water by hanging a basin or drum with suitable holes and/or using ashtrays if necessary in developing countries.In situations with limited water (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions to water conservation, such as "tippy-taps" and other forms of cost savings.
The tippy-tap is a simple technique that uses a drum tied to a string, and a foot-operated lever that pours a little water on the hands and a handful of soap.
Effective hand drying is an important part of the hand hygiene process, but there is controversy about the most effective method of drying in public lavatories.
A growing body of research suggests that paper towels are better for cleaning than the electric blow dryers found in laundries.
In 2008, a study led by the University of Westminster, London, and funded by the European Tissue Symposium, a paper towel industry, compared the hygiene levels found in paper towels, hot air hand dryers, and the latest instant air hand dryers.
After washing and drying hands with a hot air dryer, the total bacterial count was found to rise on average in finger pads by 19% and in hand soles by 254%.
Rapid air drying was successful in increasing the total number of bacteria in the finger pads by 42% and in the hand pads by 15%.
After washing and drying hands with a paper towel, the total bacterial count decreased on average in finger pads by 76% and hand hand pads by up to 77%.The scientists also conducted a study that could reveal if there is a possibility of infection in washing and laundry room users as a result of each drying method.
The quick air dryer, which blows air out of it at a specified speed of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), successfully blew micro-organisms from the hand and on it and almost infected other users and the cleaning area some 2 meters away.
The use of hot air has spread micro-organisms up to 0.25 metres from the dryer.
Paper towels did not show any significant spread of micro-organisms.In 2005, a study coordinated by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt, different hand drying methods were tested.
The following changes in the bacterial count after hand drying were observed:
There are many manufacturers of hand dryers, and hand dryers have been compared to paper towels.
Hand sanitizing with a laxative is another option when traveling without soap and water.
An alcohol-based hand sanitizer must contain at least 60% alcohol.
Medical hand hygiene was enforced long after Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (1846) in preventing disease in a hospital setting.
Electronic devices provide a signal that reminds hospital staff to wash their hands if they forget.
One study found a reduction in disease rates through their use.
Medical handwashing is 15 seconds, using a large amount of soap and water or gel to lubricate or massage each hand.
The hands must be rubbed together by interlocking the fingers.
If there is dirt under the nails, a bristle brush can be used to remove it.
Since germs can live in water on the hands, it is important to clean the hands thoroughly and wipe the hands with a clean towel.
After drying, the paper towel should be sealed (and any exit door opened if possible).
This avoids further contamination of the hands in those areas.
The purpose of hand sanitization in a healthcare setting is to remove pathogenic microorganisms ("germs") and to avoid their transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that laxity continues at unacceptable levels in many medical settings, with a growing number of doctors and nurses continuing to forget to wash their hands before touching patients, thus transmitting microorganisms.
One study showed that hand washing and other simple procedures can reduce the rate of catheter-related bloodstream infections by 66 percent. The World Health Organization has published a sheet that outlines the hand washing and rubbing policy in the health care field.
The organization's updated hand hygiene guidelines can be found on its website for public comment.
A proper review was supervised by Whitby et al.
Store-bought devices can measure and verify hand hygiene, if demonstration and compliance is required.
The World Health Organization has "five times" to wash your hands:
after exposure to blood/blood fluid
prior to aseptic work, and
The administration of cold-pressed chemicals ("antibacterial" or "anti-microbial") to the nerve gives the hand sanitizer a lethal effect.
Such lethal force may be needed before surgery or in situations where antibiotic-resistant organisms are abundant. To 'rub' someone's hands for the purpose of surgery, it is necessary to have a faucet that can be opened and closed without being touched by hands, chlorhexidine or iodine wash, sterile towels to dry hands after washing, and a sterile rubbing brush and another sterile instrument to clean under the nails.
All jewelry must be removed.
This procedure requires washing of the hands and arms up to the elbow, usually for 2-6 minutes.
Long periods of massage (10 minutes) are not necessary.
When moving, the water in the arms must be prevented from leaking back into the hands.
After finishing the hand wash, the hands are wiped with a sterile cloth or surgical cloth.
To reduce the spread of the virus, it is best to wash or disinfect hands before and after caring for a sick person.
To control staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it has been found that the greatest benefit from clean hands comes from the first 20% of cleaning, and that very little additional benefit is achieved when repeated hand washing is increased above 35%.
Comparing hand-rubbing with alcohol-based solution and hand-washing with antibacterial soap for a median time of 30 seconds each showed that the alcohol hand-rubbing reduced bacterial contamination 26% more than the antibacterial soap.
But soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based hand rubs in reducing H1N1 influenza A virus and Clostridium difficile spores on the hands. Interventions to improve hand hygiene in health care settings may include educating staff on hand hygiene, increasing the availability of alcohol-based hand rubs, and written and verbal reminders to staff.
There is a need for further research to investigate which of these interventions works best in different health care settings.
In developing countries, handwashing with soap is recognized as an economical, essential tool for achieving good health, even physical nutrition.
However, the lack of reliable water, soap or handwashing facilities in people's homes, schools and workplaces makes it a challenge to achieve global handwashing standards.
For example, in many rural areas of Africa, hand-washing taps near private or public toilets are scarce, even though inexpensive methods of hand-washing facilities are available.
However, poor hand washing levels may be the cause of more entrenched habits than lack of soap or water.
Advertising and promoting handwashing with soap can influence policy decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of handwashing and lead to a change in lifelong social practices.
For this to work, monitoring and tracking are essential.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based approaches are effective in promoting handwashing in LMICs, while social advertising campaigns are less effective.One example of handwashing advertising in schools is UNICEF's "Three-Star Method" which encourages schools to take simple, cost-effective steps to ensure students wash their hands with soap, among other hygiene requirements.
When the lower levels are reached, schools may move from one star and eventually to three stars.
Hand-washing facilities can be part of public-safety campaigns to reduce disease and infant mortality.
World Handwashing Day is one example of campaigns raising awareness that are trying to reach a change of behavior.As a result of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF promoted the widespread use of handwashing emojis.
A few studies have considered the overall cost of hand sanitizing in developing countries and the relationship to DALYs prevention.
However, one review suggests that advertising hand washing with soap is more cost-effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of hand hygiene to human health  especially to people under vulnerable conditions such as new mothers who have just given birth or wounded soldiers in hospitals  was first recognized in the mid-19th century by two pioneers of hand hygiene: Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria and Florence Nightingale, the English "founder of modern nursing".
At that time many people still believed that the unpleasant odors called miasmas caused illness.
In the 1980's, foodborne and medical outbreaks led the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to further promote hand-washing as an important way to prevent the spread of disease.
The 2009 swine flu outbreak and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic have led to increased awareness in many countries about the importance of hand washing with soap to protect against these types of infectious diseases.
For example, posters with the words "proper hand-washing procedures" are hung near hand-washing basins in public restrooms and in private restrooms in office buildings and airports in Germany.
The expression "cleanse your hands" of something, implies that you do not want someone else to take responsibility for or to be involved in something.
Its origin is the Biblical passage in Matthew where Pontius Pilate washes his hands of the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but it has become a phrase widely used in other English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, the young woman Macbeth first forces herself to wash her hands in an attempt to cleanse herself of the supposed filth, representing a guilty conscience about the crimes she had committed and persuaded her husband to commit them.
It was also found that people, after remembering or contemplating inappropriate actions, tend to wash their hands more often than others, and tend to appreciate the importance of hand sanitizers more.
Furthermore, when they are not allowed to wash their hands afterward, they are less likely to engage in any regrettable "cleaning" activities, such as volunteering.
The religious emphasis on hand washing is both purely hygienic and symbolic. The symbolic hand washing, using water but not soap to wash hands, is part of the hand washing process found in many religions, including the Bahá'í Faith, Hinduism, the tevilah and netilat yadayim in Judaism, Lavabo in Christianity, and Wudhu in Islam. Religions also encourage hand washing, especially after certain practices.
Hinduism, Judaism, and Islam all require hand washing after using the toilet.
Also, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism, and Islam require hand washing before and after eating.
Workplace controls for the risk of COVID-19
COVID-19 workplace risk controls are the use of occupational safety and health risk control procedures to prevent 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Proper workplace hazard controls depend on the workplace and type of work, with support from risk assessment of exposure sources, severity of disease in the community, and hazard factors for individual workers who may be vulnerable to COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk occupations have a low level of contact with the public and other workers, for which simple safety precautions are recommended, including hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home if ill, good breathing practices, and maintaining workplace sanitation and disinfection protocols.
Activities with intermediate risk exposure include those that require frequent and close contact with people who are unknown or suspected to have COVID-19, but may have been exposed to the virus due to ongoing community transmission or travel abroad.
This includes workers with contact with the general public such as schools, crowded workplaces, and crowded retail environments.
Risk controls in this group, in addition to simple virus prevention measures, include ventilation using high-efficiency air filters, sneeze guards, and having personal protective equipment available in cases where a person is found to have COVID-19.
OSHA considers healthcare and pharmacy workers who are exposed to people known or suspected to have COVID-19 to be at high risk of exposure, resulting in a significantly higher risk of exposure if workers perform aerosol-generating procedures, or collect or handle specimens from people known or suspected to have COVID-19.
Suitable hazard controls for these workers include building controls such as negative pressure ventilation rooms, and appropriate workplace personal protective equipment.
The COVID-19 outbreak can have severe consequences within the workplace.
Workers may be absent from work because of illness, the need to care for others, or because of fear of exposure.
Retail patterns may change, both in the type of goods required, and in the means of obtaining these goods (such as off-peak or delivery shopping or drive-through services).
Finally, the delivery of supplies from areas heavily affected by COVID-19 may be disrupted.
The programmes consider the levels of risk involved in different workplaces and types of work, including the type of exposure, hazardous factors arising at home or in community settings, and individual employee hazard factors such as advanced age or chronic disease conditions.
They also specify the appropriate controls to address those risks, and the following scenarios for situations that may arise as a result of an outbreak.
Preparedness for infectious disease and response plans may depend on the recommendation of national or provincial legislation.
The goals of outbreak response include reducing friction among employees, protecting people at high risk of serious health problems, maintaining business operations, and mitigating adverse impacts on other businesses and suppliers.
The severity of the disease in the community in which the business is located affects the response measures taken.
Risk control ladders is a widely used framework in occupational safety and health to link risk controls to outcomes.
When COVID-19 risks are not eliminated, the most effective control is building control, followed by handling control, and finally personal protective equipment.
Construction controls involve isolating workers from work-related hazards without relying on worker habit, and can be a very cost-effective measure when installed.
Controls to manage changes to employment law or procedures that require action by the employee or employer
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered to be less effective than building control and management control, but it can help to avoid some exposure.
All types of PPE must be selected based on the worker's risk, worn appropriately as appropriate (e.g., respirators), worn regularly and in an appropriate manner, inspected regularly, stored, and replaced, as necessary, and properly removed, cleaned, and stored or disposed of to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), jobs with low exposure have little social contact with other peer workers.
Simple prevention measures that are being promoted in all workplaces include frequent and thorough hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home if sick, good respiratory habits including covering coughs and sneezes, providing tissues and container ingredients, preparing to work at home or alternate shifts as needed, encouraging workers to avoid using other tools and equipment, and maintaining a workplace cleaning and disinfection process.
Early detection and isolation of potentially infected individuals is an important step in protecting employees, customers, employers, and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that workers with symptoms of acute respiratory illness should stay home until they are no longer feverish, with other symptoms for at least 24 hours without using antipyretic or symptom-modifying medication, that sick-day policies be flexible, allow workers to stay home to care for a sick family member, and that employees know these rules.
According to OSHA, medium exposure activities include those activities that require frequent or close contact within six feet (1.8 m) of people who are suspected to be COVID-19 patients, to have SARS-CoV-2 infection due to ongoing exposure in the community near the workplace, or for the reason that someone has recently returned from a foreign country where there is an outbreak of COVID-19 transmission.
These include workers with contact with the general public such as schools, high-crowded workplaces, and high-risk retail environments. Developing controls for these high-risk groups include installing high-performance air filters, increasing ventilation levels, installing barriers such as spark-gap shock monitors, and installing a drive-through window for customer service. Managing this high-exposure workforce includes encouraging sick workers to stay home, introducing a virtual communication system to establish a state-of-the-art public meeting space, initiating a clean-up program, and providing essential public-access services that may require COVID-19 exposure, including personal hygiene practices including employee-responsibility training, personal hygiene, employee access to COVID-19 vaccines, personal protective equipment, and COVID-19 prevention, employee safety measures, and employee safety, and employee access to COVID-19 vaccines, personal protective equipment, and personal protective equipment, and personal protective equipment.
Workers in this exposure group rarely need to use respirators.
If a person becomes ill on board, appropriate control measures for staff and other passengers include isolating the sick person from others for a distance of six hours, assigning one crew member to care for the sick person, and giving a face mask to the sick person or asking the sick person to cover his mouth and nose with tissue when coughing or sneezing.
The cabin crew must wear gloves when caring for a sick passenger or touching body fluids or potentially contaminated areas, and possibly additional protective equipment if the patient has a fever, persistent cough, and difficulty breathing.
Gloves and other disposable items should be disposed of with a biohazard bag, and contaminated areas should be cleaned and disinfected later. For commercial vessels, including cruise and other passenger ships, the control of mosquitoes includes postponing a voyage if you are ill, and isolating yourself and notifying the medical facility immediately if someone develops a fever or other symptoms while on board.
If possible, medical follow-up should take place in the quarantined person's cabin.In school and kindergarten areas, the CDC recommends temporary closures for cleaning and disinfection if an infected person has been inside the school premises regardless of the spread.
If there is a low to medium infection in the community, isolation strategies may be implemented such as cancelling field trips, meetings, and other large gatherings such as environmental education, choir classes or lunches, increasing the space between desks, arriving at half-hour and return times, segregating non-essential visitors, and using a separate health office space for children with flu-like symptoms.
When the virus is spreading significantly in the community, despite efforts to social distancing, extended school closures may be considered. For law enforcement personnel performing routine tasks, the health risk is then considered low by the CDC.
Law enforcement personnel who must contact confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients are encouraged to follow the same guidelines as emergency health workers, including appropriate personal protective equipment.
In the event of a close contact when a person is found, workers should clean and disinfect their workbelts and clothing before reusing them with a spray or household cleaning cloth, and follow standard procedures for preventing the spread of the virus and disposal of used PPE and for storing and washing clothes.
OSHA considers that certain medical and radiation workers are at a greater or even a greater risk of exposure to the disease.
The occupations of the most at risk include medical supplies, relief supplies, laboratory workers, and medical personnel exposed to patients known or suspected to have COVID-19.
These become the most significant risks of exposure if the workers perform procedures that establish aerosol, or collect or handle samples, from patients known or suspected to have COVID-19.
Procedures that establish aerosols include tubing, coughing procedures, bronchoscopies, certain dental procedures and examinations, or the collection of body samples.
High-risk exposure laboratory work includes workers involved in the preparation of cadavers of people with known or suspected COVID-19 infections at the time of death; these become the highest risk when examining cadavers. Additional engineering controls for these risk groups include isolation rooms for known or suspected COVID-19 patients, including when performing aerosol spraying procedures.
Special ventilation at a gravitational pressure may be appropriate for some medical and refrigeration settings.
Samples should be handled with Biosafety Level 3 safety guidelines.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that incoming patients be isolated and placed in separate waiting areas depending on whether they are suspected to have COVID-19.In addition to other PPE, OSHA recommends respirators for those working within 6 feet of known, or suspected, SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, and those who undergo aerosol-developing procedures.
In the United States, N95 respirators that are NIOSH-approved or better must be used as part of a complete respiratory protection system, including a physical fitness check, exercise, and medical examination.
Some types of respirators can provide greater protection and improve worker comfort. WHO does not recommend coveralls, because COVID-19 is a respiratory illness and is not transmitted through bodily fluids.
WHO recommends only surgical masks for personnel filtering at entry points.
For those collecting breath samples, caring for, or transporting COVID-19 patients without aerosol detection procedures, WHO recommends surgical masks, goggles, or face shields, gowns, and gloves.
If an aerosol injection procedure is performed, the N95 or FFP2 respirator is substituted for the surgical mask.
Because of the global shortage of PPE, WHO is promoting the reduction of the need for PPE through teleconferencing, physical barriers such as sliding windows, allowing only those directly involved in treatment to enter a COVID-19 patient's room, use only the required PPE for a specific task, continue to use the same respirator without removing it while caring for multiple patients with the same disease, monitor and control PPE availability, and prohibit the use of masks for people with no symptoms of the disease.

PATHELENE: [Covid-19] Reducing the burden and preparing for the future
The following pages link to the "Date/Time of Uploading: 14 March, 2020, 00:24 UTC"
CC0: No rights reserved
We find ourselves in a remarkable position this month.
The COVID-19 pandemic is a reminder of how interconnected the world is and of our responsibility to one another.
We have never faced challenges like this one, but we know that the way we respond depends on the kind of empathy in the world, the kind of cooperation, and the kind of community building that is the backbone of this organization.
The cooperation and mutual concern we have seen from all our employees through e-mails, phone calls, and conversations is a remarkable indication that we have the best people we are fortunate to work with.
I am truly happy and proud to be working with you.
Last week, someone told me how much he appreciated our work.
It reminded me of how meaningful it is for the world to be able to open Wikipedia right now, and this is a powerful symbol of this important resource to stay online and available to everyone.
Your work makes this happen, whether you keep our sites open or our employees are paid or our communities are safe.
The world needs the information found on Wikipedia, now more than ever.
This is a time when not only what we do, but how we do it, will have a profound impact on the world.
In view of the importance of this work and your role in it, we are making a major change in the way we deal with one another, starting next week.
Changes in our work and schedule
As Robyn mentioned earlier, the c-team met last night to discuss how we will work with our schedule for the coming days and months.
In that discussion, we considered what we felt would be the best response to what we are facing and how best to keep the organization going during this time.
We unexpectedly wanted to take the stress off and support our long-term goal.
If you need to call again, that's fine.
For all employees, contractors and contract workers:
our expected daily work will be about 4 hours a day, or 20 hours a week until the change is announced.
We do not call for a holiday - if you can work regular overtime, the company may employ you.
However, things are uncertain in the world today, and whether you have to care for loved ones, buy food, or go to the doctor, your health comes first.
We do not track your hours.
If you are sick, do not work.
We don't really need to say this, but we will.
You don't need to include sick days or PTO - you'll simply tell your manager and help your co-workers rearrange calendars and schedules to ensure that key parts of the work are being done.
(If you have been diagnosed with the COVID-19 virus, please inform Bryan within T&C Ops so that T&C can assist with support and ensure that your condition is properly managed by the management).
Hourly workers will be paid in full.
We have already said, and we are reluctant to fulfill our obligations to our contract and hourly employees.
Each person will be paid according to his normal hours worked under normal circumstances.
This includes when you are sick and unable to work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use work as a way to bring their stress into harmony with the world around us.
Our efforts can be rewarded in a unique way, especially at times like these.
Again, it is important that you take care of yourself.
We invite you to contact your manager, so that we can determine what we can expect and make arrangements accordingly.
Some work is considered essential.
There are things we must continue to do.
The SRE, HR Ops, Trust & Safety, and Fundraising (among others) teams are doing a critical job that may require additional support.
We will initiate a process with all departments to review current goals and shift our focus to supporting those that are important to our mission.
There is much for all of us to do, and all of us will simply focus on the most important projects.
Slowing down now will not hurt us later.
We are not planning to work double shifts to keep to a schedule once the epidemic is over.
You will not be expected to work overtime to complete the task at the current unusual time.
We accept that circumstances have changed, and we will work to set new goals and times where appropriate.
What happened to the APP (Annual Planning)?
In order to adapt to our new circumstances and the expected daily work hours, we intend to change the submission period of our 2020-2021 Annual Plan.
Our intention is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 program that allows for more time to budget to allow employees to do critical tasks first, take care of themselves, and care for loved ones while also helping those who need or wish to work a reduced schedule in the next few weeks.
This extension of the work period greatly reduces the work now scheduled and the pressure on the entire organization.
We will present our proposals to the Board next week and review the representatives and teams on the next steps as soon as we have confirmation.
We thank the APP team for taking the lead in this.
Office layout, exposure, and cleaning
Last week, we learned that one of our SF workers may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, out of great concern, we dispatched a disinfection team to disinfect all the office premises in San Francisco.
Use hospital-grade disinfectant soap to disinfect every area, including the reception area and the elevator bays that access the area.
The building uses its own maintenance protocol through the use of products that support the safety of its tenants.
We feel reassured that the office will be ready when we decide to return.
Our DC office is in WeWork, which has shared its COVID-19 protocol with us and all the DC staff.
As of last week, our DC office has moved to a remote location that is completely set in accordance with the direction given to San Francisco.
As some of our NYC employees know, we have been in discussions about renting space in Brooklyn.
These discussions are ongoing but may take time.
Some of our employees are working remotely for the first time.
Our long-time remote workers know that it could be a big change, and they want to give you some advice:
Reduce the length of the meetings to at least an hour or two.
If longer sessions are needed, consider how to divide it over several days.
Make clear what the meeting is about, have an agenda, and send in the material to be studied ahead of time.
Do it regularly with video, with tools like Google Docs and Zoom to work and communicate live.
Have someone take the lead in preparing all the meetings, someone to look over the questions in the discussions and keep track of the list of speakers, and someone to help write notes (or take notes with you).
Email tech support if you need a suitable headset.
Use your welfare funds to buy chewing gum.
Join the #remoties channel on Slack to discuss your work-related assignments with colleagues
The HR Operations team seeks guidance in online seminars on effective working methods to support the increase in the work delivered across the Company.
This past week we asked all community grantees to cancel Wikimedia-sponsored public events, such as editathons, until the WHO declares the pandemic over.
We will inform them that we have understood that our cancellation request and other restrictions may make it impossible to complete their agreed upon line-of-payment obligations and that no one will be penalized for delaying or changing those terms.
This coming week we will follow up with more guidance on Wikimania and other provincial and regional public conferences.
The general feeling of the world community seems to be discouragement over the disruption but relief over the clarification and opportunities to focus on their communities, Wikimedia and so on.
In the meantime, the CRT is working to set up a page on Meta-Wiki to provide a public space to monitor the contributions and follow our discussions with them.
Staying in touch with COVID-19 related news
We will be sending an invitation to your calendars for next Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT for a special staff meeting.
We will use this time to share some updates, answer your questions and spend some time in touch.
We work together and will help you wherever we can.
In the meantime, you can continue to receive information in this email, and all other important COVID-19 related information, on Office Wiki.
The CRT will keep these updated pages and all the information in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular contact with staff living in the currently most affected countries.
If you have any questions about transportation, events, the main work route, the carriage challenge, or anything else you may need help with, please do not hesitate to tell and work with CRT.
We are here to help provide support and liaison when needed.
If you have a confidential or sensitive matter, please email Bryan Judan - Director of HR International Global Operations.
None of these changes should be viewed as a waiver of our duties and responsibilities.
Rather, it is a recognition that at this time, our work and responsibilities will likely need to be balanced as never before.
These are steps that we believe are necessary to support each other in order to continue the work, to provide our team with the support it needs, and to give the world the service it relies on.
The work we have planned will be waiting for us when the time comes.
Now, it is time to support one another and to create space for the important work that may take place in the coming weeks and months.
We need all of you to make that happen, so we need all of you to take care of yourselves and your families so that you will be fully prepared when the need arises.
Now, please -- wash your hands and don't touch your face!
The other members of the Board of Directors are Catherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S), and the rest of the Board of Directors (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme that resides outside (in the cell membrane) of cells in the lungs, blood vessels, heart, kidneys, and intestines.
ACE2 inhibits the activity of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin-II and increasing Ang (−1-7) making it a promising drug for the treatment of cardiovascular and blood disorders. ACE2 also acts as a cell entry site for certain coronaviruses.
The human form of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a zinc-containing metalloenzyme found on the surface of endothelial and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains an N-terminal peptidase M2 domain and a C-terminal collectrin renal amino acid transporter domain.
ACE2 is a single-pass type I membrane protein, whose domain is activated by enzymes exposed to the cell surface in the lungs and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ACE2 is separated from the transmembrane domain by an enzyme known as sheddase, and the resulting soluble protein is secreted into the bloodstream and eventually out of the urine.
ACE2 is present in many tissues: ACE2 is associated with the cell membrane of mainly alveolar type II cells, small intestinal enterocytes, arterial and venous endothelial cells and arterial smooth tissue cells in many tissues.
ACE2 mRNA is also found in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and brainstem.
The main function of ACE2 is to act as a counterbalance to ACE.
ACE cleaves the angiotensin I hormone into the vasoconstricting angiotensin II.
ACE2 cleaves the carboxyl-terminal amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and cleaves it into the vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH). ACE2 is also known as angiotensin II (ACE2).
ACE2 can also cleave several other peptides including [des-Arg9]-bradykinin, apelin, neurotensin, dynorphin A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane movement of the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and has been implicated in Hartnup's disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 serves as the primary entry point for certain coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
Specifically, the association of the S1 spike protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 to the enzyme domain ACE2 on the cell surface results in endocytosis and the movement of both the virus and the enzyme to the intracellular endosomes.
This entry process also requires the activation of S protein by serine protease TMPRSS2, an inhibitor that is under current research as a potential cure for the disease.This has led some to conclude that lowering ACE2 levels in cells, could help in fighting the virus.
However, many leading organizations and professional bodies have encouraged the continuation of conventional ACE inhibitor and ARB therapy.
"A systematic review and analysis published on July 11, 2012, found that ""the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a significant 34% reduction in risk of pneumonia compared to controls""".
"Furthermore, the risk of pneumonia has been reduced in patients treated with ACE inhibitors who were at high risk of pneumonia, especially those with stroke and heart disease".
"The use of ACE inhibitors has also been associated with a decrease in pneumonia mortality, although the effects were not as severe as the damage that pneumonia can cause".
Human compound ACE2 (rhACE2) is thought to be a novel treatment for severe lung injury, and appears to improve pulmonary hemodynamics in oxygen depletion in pigs with lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is 10 hours and starts 30 minutes after the 24-hour period.
Some studies suggest that rhACE2 may be an appropriate drug for those who cannot take common renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or for diseases in which angiotensin II-predicting factor is elevated.The supplementation of rhACE2 has been tested in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
"The b'COVID-19 apps are mobile software applications designed to help you obtain statistics about the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, as a means of identifying people (""contacts") who may have come into contact with an infected person".
Several programs have been developed or considered, with governmental legislative support in some places.
Frameworks have been developed for building touch-sensitive apps.
Privacy concerns have been raised, particularly about systems based on location tracking of app users.
Other methods that do not require confidential information include the use of Bluetooth signals to record the user's location on other mobile phones.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple announced that they would develop a way to support such Bluetooth apps directly on Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, in partnership with Alipay, has developed an app that allows citizens to check if they have been in contact with people with COVID-19.
It is used in over 200 cities in China.In Singapore, an app called TraceTogether is used.
"The app was developed by local IT staff, released as an open call and will be provided by the government. "StopKorona!" was released in North Macedonia, a Bluetooth-enabled app to track exposure in people who may be infected and provide quick response to health authorities".
The app was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of 14 April 2020, the app was pending approval by the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
"On 12 April, the government said a human-tracking app was in advanced development stages, and would be available for release in a few weeks. A similar app is being developed in Ireland, and France (""StopCovid"")".
Both Australia and New Zealand are considering apps based on Singapore's TraceTogether app and BlueTrace protocol.Russia is planning to develop a border crossing detection app for COVID-19 patients living in Moscow, designed to ensure that they do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at Cambridge University, has listed several potential problems with app systems, including misleading alerts and the possibility of missing an alert if the app's capabilities are limited to a small number of people.
"To address concerns about the spread of deceptive or harmful ""coronavirus"" apps, Apple has restricted the types of organizations that can upload coronavirus apps to its App Store, stating that only ""legitimate"" or trusted organizations can do so".
Google and Amazon have established similar restrictions.
Privacy advocates have expressed concerns about the problems of crowd-sourced tracking using coronavirus apps, specifically about the fact that the tracking system created to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will be deprecated once the threat has passed.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement restricting this kind of tracking.
These organizations have set nine criteria for government projects:
"the search must be ""legal, necessary and appropriate"";"
the extension of the surveillance and tracing period shall be subject to a sunset condition;
the use of data will have to be limited to COVID-19 purposes;
data security and anonymity will need to be protected and demonstrated as evidence-based protection;
digital testing will have to avoid downplaying prejudice and downplaying the importance of things;
any sharing of data with others will be required to be legally disclosed;
there should be vigilance against abuse and the rights of citizens to react to abuse;
" meaningful participation by all "" stakeholders "" will be required, including public health professionals and small groups.The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter ohne Grenzen) (RSF) have also issued checklists".
The proposed Google/Apple system aims to fix the problem of constant tracking by removing the tracking function from the device's OS when it is no longer needed.
Some countries were using network-based location tracking instead of apps, eliminating both the need to download an app and avoid being tracked.
In Israel, network-based tracking was authorized.
Network-based solutions with access to unfiltered local data can have significant privacy concerns.
However, not all systems with large servers need to gain access to a person's location data; a number of privacy-protecting systems have been developed that use large servers only for communication (see section below).
In South Korea, an app-based system was used to track a person.
Instead of using a designated app, the system collects tracking information from various sources including mobile device tracking data and credit card data, and combines this to send notifications via text message to people who may be infected.
In addition to using this information to alert people who may have been infected, the government has also made the location information available to the public, which is allowed due to a number of changes to privacy laws after the MERS outbreak in the country.
This information is available to the public through apps and websites. Countries including Germany have considered using both large and private systems.
As of 6 April 2020, no details have been released.
Privacy-protected tracking is a well-developed approach, with numerous research publications dating back to at least 2013. As of 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups have been looking for privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to synchronize a user with other mobile devices.
However, PEPP-PT is a linking effort that includes both large and diverse pathways, and is not a single protocol. Various protocols include Decentralized Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (DP-PPT/DP-3T), Temporary Contact Numbers (TCN, FKA Contact Event Numbers, CEN), Privacy Sensitive Protocols and Mechanisms for Mobile Contact Tracing (CTPA) and others.
For these protocols, the physical person's data never leaves the device, and all matching takes place on the device.
The Privacy Group at MIT Media Lab has been developing SafePaths, a platform for applying privacy protection strategies when accumulating and using location or short-track data to track the spread of COVID-19.
"Based on research from the white paper ""Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic"" released in March 2020. Another similar effort is the SafeTrace platform of Enigma MPC, a privacy technology startup originally founded at the MIT Media Lab".
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technology to allow users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and law enforcement, without compromising the privacy of that data.
On 5 April 2020, the global TCN Coalition was formed by groups united by what were common protocols and widely differing protocols, with the goal of reducing fragmentation, and allowing the global availability of tracking and alerting apps, a key element in widespread adoption.
On 9 April 2020, the Singapore government announced that it was making an invitation for the BlueTrace protocol used by its official government app.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple, the companies that control the Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced a new person tracking system, and claimed that it would protect privacy, based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy technology and cryptography to protect privacy.
They also published the technical features used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system is intended to be released in three phases:
release of tools to allow governments to build official coronavirus tracking apps that protect privacy
the installation of this feature directly on iOS and Android systems from Google and Apple to fix startup problems and continuous monitoring by first sending the system with OS updates, and then removing it in the same way when the threat has passed.
b'Drug repositioning (also known as drug reuse, re-profiling, re-tasking or therapeutic switching) is the reuse of a licensed drug to treat a different disease or health condition than the one for which it was developed.
This is the type of scientific research that is currently being done to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other research directions include the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and convalescent plasma transfusion. SARS-CoV-2 has about 66 drug-receptor proteins, each with multiple sites of molecular assembly.
Analysis of these sites together forms a logical project to develop an antiviral drug against COVID-19 proteins.
Of the targeted proteins most important in SARS-CoV-2 are proteases such as papain, RNA-based RNA polymerase, helicase, S protein, and ADP ribophosphatase.
Hussein A. A., and others investigated several potential drugs and then developed and analyzed their structural similarity with similar high-authorization drugs to accelerate the development of a potent SARS-CoV-2 treatment in this pre-clinical study that could be used as a research drug.
Chloroquine is a malaria drug that is also used for certain autoimmune diseases.
On 18 March, WHO announced that chloroquine and its related hydroxychloroquine will be among four medicines being studied as part of a Combined Clinical Trial.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that the New York State investigation of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine would begin on March 24th. On March 28th, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
This treatment is not approved by the FDA's clinical trial process and is authorized under the EUA only as an investigational treatment for emergency use in patients who are hospitalized but cannot accept treatment in a clinical trial.
"The CDC stated that ""the use, dosage, or duration of hydroxychloroquine in prophylaxis or treatment of SARS-CoV-2"" is not yet recommended".
"Doctors said they use the drug when ""there is no other option""".
A Turkish research team in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Massive research is under way at Duke University and the University of Oxford.
NYU Langone Medical School is conducting research on the safety and efficacy of hydroxychloroquine for disease prevention.
"Chinese medical research in Wuhan and Shenzhen says favipiravir appears to ""work really well""".
35 patients in Shenzhen were found to have measles in the test over 4 days, whereas the duration of illness was 11 days in 45 patients who did not get it.
In a study conducted in Wuhan on 240 pneumonia patients, half were given favipiravir and half were given umfenovir.
The Italian Pharmaceutical Agency reminded the public that the evidence to support the drug is limited and preliminary.
On 2 April, Germany announced that it would purchase the drug from Japan, store it, and use troops to ship the drug to university hospitals, where the drug would be used to treat COVID-19 patients.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has presented himself to Trump's cabinet about buying a drug that may not work completely in severe cases of illness where the virus has multiplied.
It may not be safe to use in pregnant women or when trying to conceive.
"One study of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir, concluded that ""no benefit was found""."
These drugs were designed to prevent HIV from replicating by binding to a protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify the drug to find a fluid that will bind to the SARS-CoV-2 protease.There are critics in the scientific community for directing efforts to reuse drugs specifically designed for HIV/AIDS.
WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the global pooled study.
Remdesivir was developed and patented by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus and Marburg disease. Gilead Sciences found that Remdesivir had antiviral activity in vitro against the filo-, pneumo-, paramyxo-, and corona-viruses.
One problem with antibiotic therapy is developing a mutation therapy that can lead to a more severe and contagious disease.
Preliminary studies suggest that remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier to drug inactivity. There are several ongoing clinical trials, including two being conducted at Cleveland University Hospitals; one in people with moderate disease and one in people with severe disease.
There are three ongoing clinical trials of vitamin C injections in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19; two counterfeit drugs (China, Canada) and one uncontrolled drug (Italy).
New York State began a study of the antibiotic azithromycin on 24 March 2020.
Japan's National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) is planning a clinical trial of Teijin's Alvesco (ciclesonide), a prescribed corticosteroid for asthma, for the treatment of asymptomatic patients with the new coronavirus.

Researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently investigating the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and lung problems in patients suffering from mild symptoms of COVID-19.
The study, called COLCORONA, involved 6,000 adults aged 40 and older who had been diagnosed with COVID-19 and had mild symptoms that did not require hospitalization.
Women who are pregnant or breast - feeding or who have no effective method of contraception are not eligible.
Several anticoagulants are being tested in Italy.
Low-molecular-weight heparin is widely used to treat patients, prompting the Italian Medicines Agency to publish guidelines for its use.
A multi-centre study of 300 patients investigating the use of enoxaparin sodium in the prevention and treatment of disease was announced in Italy on April 14.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, scientists have focused on reusing antiviral drugs that were developed for previous epidemics such as MERS, SARS, and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: ribavirin was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to schedule 7 of Chinese guidelines
Umifenovir: umifenovir was proposed for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the 7th edition of Chinese guidelines
Other antibiotics that have been identified as having potential for reuse in the treatment of COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (Anti-IL-6 receptor): It is approved in China.
Also in the study were Italian and Chinese. and see Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
The b'A COVID-19 vaccine is a proposed vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
While no goal has been reached in medical research, there are many ongoing efforts to develop such a goal.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it expected a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, the causative virus, to be available in less than 18 months.
Five vaccine candidates were in Phase I of the safety study in April.
COVID-19 was detected in December 2019.
The pandemic spread worldwide in 2020, leading to a massive fundraising and research effort to establish a target.
Many organizations are using genetics to develop potential vaccines for SARS-CoV-2.
As of April, the key elements of the CEPI's policy-making process are being accelerated, rolled out, produced, and made available on the ground.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms had been researched and developed in early 2020 to develop an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
Major platform activities that progressed to Phase I safety research include:
nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) (founder of Phase I and vaccine candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
viral vector (founder of Phase I and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologics, adenovirus type 5 vector)
As reported to CEPI scientists in April, 115 projects are in the early stages of developing a vaccine, with 78 confirmed as viral projects (79, according to the Milken Institute), and 37 announced, but very little public information available (possibly in planning or being developed).
Phase II studies evaluate pre-use safety and anti-viral resistance, are generally unplanned, placebo-controlled, and are in multiple settings, while more precise, effective doses are considered.
Phase III trials typically involve more participants, including a control group, and the performance of a vaccine trial to prevent disease, while employing critical outcomes at the appropriate dose.
"Of the 79 vaccine candidates that were developed (confirmed as of early April 2020), 74 had not been tested in humans (who were in a ""pre-treatment"" study)".
On 24 January 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it is investigating the use of a molecular clamp vaccine that will genetically modify the viral protein for treatment.

On 12 March 2020, the Health Ministry of India announced that it is working with 11 quarantined individuals, and that even if it is fast it could take at least a year and a half to two years to establish a vaccine.
On 12 March 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company from Quebec City, Quebec, reported that coronavirus-like particles had been developed under a partial grant from the Canadian Institutes for Health Research.
The vaccine schedule is being researched by laboratories, and human trials are scheduled for July or August 2020.
"Earlier in the week, The Guardian reported that US President Donald Trump had given CureVac ""'large sums of money' to get a Covid-19 vaccine"", with the German government objecting".
On 17 March 2020, the US pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a collaboration with the German company BioNTech to jointly develop an mRNA vaccine.
The mRNA vaccine BNT162 is currently being tested for pre-clinical use and clinical trials are expected to begin in April 2020.
In Italy on 17 March 2020, Takis Biotech, a biotechnology company, announced that it would receive the results of pre-clinical trials in April 2020 and its final target could begin human trials in the autumn.
In France on 19 March 2020, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) announced an investment of US$4.9 million in a joint research project to find a COVID-19 vaccine involving the Institut Pasteur, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria), and the University of Pittsburgh, bringing the total investment of CEPI in the development of a COVID-19 vaccine to US$29 million.
Other CEPI's investment partners in the development of the COVID-19 vaccine are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, the University of Oxford, and the University of Queensland.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had begun animal testing for six different vaccines.
Researchers at Imperial College London announced on 20 March 2020 that they were developing an RNA test for self-testing for COVID-19.
The vaccine was developed within 14 days of the first case in China.
In late March, the Canadian government announced C$275 million in funding for 96 research projects on COVID-19 treatments, including several vaccines at Canadian companies and universities, such as the projects at Medicago and the University of Saskatchewan.
"At approximately the same time, the Canadian government announced C$192 million specifically for COVID-19 vaccine development, with plans to establish a national ""vaccine bank"" of several new vaccines that could be used in the event of another coronavirus outbreak".
"On 2 April 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported on the trial of PittCoVacc, a non-dose COVID-19 vaccine in mice, and noted that ""the SARS-CoV-2 S1 MNA vaccines represented a robust disease-modifying effect of [mice] antibody-mediated disease in mice 2 weeks after receiving the vaccine""".
In Canada on 16 April 2020, the University of Waterloo School of Pharmacy announced the development of a DNA-based vaccine that could be a nasal spray.
Using therapeutically targeted viruses, DNA will be made to replicate within the human virus to produce harmless virus-like particles, which may stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the government, industry, and three US universities combined assets to acquire IBM mainframe computers, combined with cloud computing assets from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some targets have biological effects, also called indirect effects.
That means it can have consequences beyond the disease they're preventing.
Another random survey in Australia seeks to enroll 4,170 health - care workers.
The targets set may not be safe or effective.
Initial studies to test the efficacy of the vaccine using animal models of COVID-19, such as a mouse with ACE2 implantation, other laboratory animals, and human models, indicate the need for a 3-valent immunization effort in viral management, and international collaboration to ensure safe universal protocols.
The SARS and MERS vaccines have been tested on non-human animal models.
As of 2020, no cure or vaccine for SARS has been shown to be safe and effective in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the development and development of vaccines and new drugs for the treatment of SARS was a priority for governments and public health agencies worldwide.
When MERS emerged, it was believed that existing SARS research could provide a useful template for developing vaccines and therapies for the MERS-CoV virus.
As of March 2020, there has been one MERS (DNA) vaccine that has completed phase I clinical trials in humans, and three others are being studied, and all are viral-vectored, adenoviral-vectored (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) vaccines, and one MVA-vectored (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media posts promote the idea that the virus that causes COVID-19 is known and that a vaccine is already available.
Patents cited in various social media posts refer to pre-existing patents for the genetic sequences and vaccines of other coronaviruses such as SARS coronavirus.
b'Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious virus caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms of the disease include fever, cough, and nausea.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle aches, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of smell, and abdominal pain.
The time from exposure to the onset of symptoms is usually five days but can range from two to fourteen days.
While most cases result in disease plaques, some result in chronic pneumonia and multiple organ death.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
The virus is primarily spread through contact, usually by small droplets that come out when you cough, sneeze, or speak.
Although these droplets pass through the air, they usually fall to the ground or on objects rather than to bacteria over long distances.
People can also become infected by touching an infected surface and then touching their eyes, nose, or mouth.
The bacteria can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours.
It is most infectious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although it may spread before the onset of symptoms and in later stages of the disease. The most common diagnostic method is reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) with a mouse swab.
The use of masks is recommended for those who suspect they may be infected and their caregivers.
Suggestions for the general public to use masks vary, with some authorities recommending against it, others recommending against it, and others mandating it.
At present, there is no vaccine or specific treatment for the COVID-19 virus.
Transmission of the virus has been detected in many countries in all six WHO zones.
Those infected may have no symptoms of the disease or experience flulike symptoms such as fever, chills, fatigue, and dysentery.
Symptoms of emergency illness include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, confusion, difficulty rising, and facial and lip flushing; it is recommended to seek medical attention immediately if these symptoms become apparent.
Less commonly, symptoms affecting the upper respiratory tract such as sneezing, wheezing, or sore throat may be present.
Mouth-to-thigh symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea have been observed at varying rates.
Some cases in China initially caused only chest stiffness and rapid heartbeat.
In others, the disease can progress to pneumonia, affecting many organs, and be fatal.
This is also called the onset period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 infection is usually five to six days but can range from 2 to 14 days.
97.5% of people who develop symptoms develop them within 11.5 days of infection. Reports indicate that not all infected people develop symptoms of the disease.
The role of asymptomatic individuals in transmitting the virus to others is not fully understood; however, current evidence suggests that they may be contributing to the spread of the virus.
The number of asymptomatic infected people is currently unknown and under investigation, and the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reports that 20% of all infected people have been asymptomatic during hospitalization.
The National Health Commission of China began including asymptomatic cases in its daily counts on 1 April; of the 166 cases on that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic when tested.
Both whooping cough and spit can contain a bacterium.
Speaking out loud releases more droplets than normal speech.
A study in Singapore found that coughing without a mask can lead to consonants that travel about 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is not normally airborne, the National Academy of Science has suggested that it could be transmitted by inhalation and air pools in the hallways outside of the living rooms have yielded some of the virus's RNA.
Certain medical procedures such as tubing and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can cause the production of particles to be released into the air and result in respiratory infection.
Although there is concern that it may be spread through feces, this risk is thought to be low. The virus is most contagious when people are symptomatic; although transmission may occur before symptoms appear, the risk is low.
Although the ease with which the virus spreads is not fully understood, one person usually infects two or three people, says the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).
Specifically, the virus was found to survive for one day on cardboard, for up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and metal (AISI 304), and for up to four hours on 99% of the tissue.
However, this varies with humidity and temperature.
Soap can also be effective if used properly; soap products reduce the protective membrane of bacterial oil, killing it, and removing it from the skin and other areas.
Other soaps, such as benzenium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical disinfectant), are less effective.In the Hong Kong study, saliva samples were collected two days after initial hospital admission.
In five of the six patients, the first sample showed a high viral load, and the sixth patient showed a high viral load on the second day of testing.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, which was first isolated from three people with pneumonia and linked to multiple acute respiratory illnesses in Wuhan.
All features of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus are derived from coronaviruses.
When outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which blows its protective bubble. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the most susceptible organs to COVID-19 because the virus enters the main cells through an enzyme called angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is found in abundance in the type II alveolar cells in the lungs.
"The virus uses a special glycoprotein called a ""spike"" (peplomer) to bind to ACE2 and enter the main cell".
Severe cardiac injury was found in 12% of infected patients hospitalized in Wuhan, China, and is more common in severe cases.
Symptomatic cardiovascular disease levels are elevated, causing systemic inflammation and immune system dysfunction during the progression of the disease, but severe heart attacks may also be associated with ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are expressed primarily in the heart and are involved in cardiac function.
Incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) were found in ICU patients with COVID-19 infection and may be associated with poor prognosis. Diagnosis of people killed by COVID-19 showed diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), and inflammation with lymphocyte in the lungs.
While SARS-COV-2 has tropism of ACE2-expressing epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, pathogenic GM-CSF-secreting T-cells have been shown to be associated with the detection of IL-6-secreting monocytes and the pathogenicity of severe lung disease in COVID-19 patients.
Lymphocytic infiltrates have also been reported in autopsies.
WHO has published several virus testing protocols.
The most common test method is the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
Testing is usually done on breath samples obtained from a nasal swab; however, a nasal swab or a sputum sample may also be used.
The results are usually available within a few hours to two days.
A blood test may be used, but this requires two blood samples taken in two weeks and the results are of little immediate value.
Chinese scientists were able to isolate the coronavirus and publish the genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world could develop their own polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test to detect the virus for disease.
As of 4 April 2020, genetic testing (which can detect active viruses and previous exposure to the virus) was developed, but has not been widely used.
The Chinese findings in the study show that accuracy is only 60 to 70 percent.
The FDA in the United States authorized the first clinical trial on 21 March 2020 which was implemented later that month.Diagnostic guidelines issued by the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University suggested methods for identifying the virus based on treatment characteristics and risk for disease control.
Bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacities spread peripherally, asymmetrically and posteriorly are common in viral infections.
Subpleural dominance, crazy paving (lobular septal thickness with variable alveolar filling), and consolidation may occur as the disease progresses.
There is little data available on microscopic lesions and on the pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main factors identified in the study were:
Macroscopy: pleurisy, pericarditis, lung consolidation and pulmonary oedema are also included.
Four types of pneumonia virus can be identified:
common pneumonia: pulmonary oedema, pneumocyte hyperplasia, large atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocytic infiltration and multinucleated giant cell formation
severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and diffuse alveolar exudates.
DAD is a cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.
curable pneumonia: a combination of exudates from the alveolar cavities and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis
Blood: disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC); leukoerythroblastic reaction
Precautions to reduce the risk of infection include staying indoors, avoiding crowds, washing hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, practicing oral hygiene, and avoiding touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with tissue when coughing or sneezing and recommends using the inside of the elbow if there is no tissue.
Thorough hand washing after coughing or sneezing is recommended.
The CDC recommends the use of face coverings when in public, in part to reduce transmission from people who do not have symptoms of the virus.Social isolation strategies are aimed at reducing contact between infected people and large groups by closing schools and workplaces, restricting movement, and cancelling large gatherings.
The distancing instructions include that people keep at least 6 feet (1.8 meters) apart.
"There is no known effective vaccine to prevent COVID-19.As a vaccine is not expected until at least 2021, the best way to control COVID-19 is to try to reduce the number of those infected, called ""flattening the line"""."
The CDC also recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom or when their hands appear dirty, before eating, and after coughing, coughing, and sneezing.
It also recommends the use of hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol, but only if soap and water are not readily available.In areas where hand sanitizers are not readily available, WHO offers two methods of local manufacturing.
In these, the antimicrobial activity is derived from ethanol or isopropanol.
"Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol; it is not a disinfectant in hand sanitizers".
Glycerol is added to create moisture.
People are treated with care, which may include hydrotherapy, oxygenation, and support for other vital organs affected.
The CDC recommends that those suspected of having the virus wear a standard face mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to solve the problem of respiratory failure, but its benefits are still being debated.
Hygiene, lifestyle, and nutrition have been promoted to prevent infection.
Supplementary therapies may be helpful for those with mild symptoms who have recently been infected.The WHO and the Chinese National Health Commission have published recommendations for the care of hospitalized patients with COVID-19.
Intensivists and pulmonologists in the U.S. have compiled treatment options from various agencies into a free resource, IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no cure for COVID-19.
When symptoms appear, some doctors recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) in place of ibuprofen.
Steps must be taken to reduce the risk of transmission, especially in health care settings where procedures that may produce aerosols, such as intubation or hand ventilation, are performed.
For physicians caring for people with COVID-19, the CDC recommends the retention of individuals in the Airborne Infection Isolation Room (AIIR) in addition to the use of conventional measures, to prevent contact with and inhalation of the virus.The CDC describes guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during an epidemic.
Necessary items: PPE gown, respirator or face mask, eye protection, and medical gloves. Where available, respirators (instead of face masks) are recommended.
N95 respirators are authorized for industrial use but the FDA has authorized masks for use under an Emergency Use Authorisation (EUA).
It is designed to protect against airborne particles such as dust but protection against a specific body agent is not guaranteed in its use.
If masks are not available, the CDC recommends using face shields or, if no other option is available, homemade masks.
Most COVID-19 cases are not severe enough to require mechanical ventilation or other means, but some do.
The type of respiratory support for people with COVID-19-related respiratory distress is still being studied for people in hospital, and there is some evidence that intubation can be prevented with high flow nasal cannula or bi-level positive airway pressure.
Whether these two lead to the same benefit in critically ill patients is unknown.
Some doctors prefer to stay with invasive mechanical ventilation if available because this method reduces the dispersion of inhaled particles compared to high flow nasal cannula.
Many developing countries lack adequate hospital beds, reducing the number of patients who are treated and causing the inability to cope with the unexpected increase in the number of people with severe COVID-19 requiring hospitalization.
One study in China found that 5% were placed in an intensive care unit, 2.3% needed ventilation, and 1.4% died.
In China, approximately 30% of people hospitalized with COVID-19 end up in the ICU.
Ventilation equipment becomes more complex as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) develops in COVID-19 and breathing becomes increasingly difficult.
Ventilators with pressure control modes and high PEEP are needed to increase oxygen supply while reducing the risk of lung injury associated with ventilators and pneumothorax.
PEEP may not be available in older ventilators.
A clinical trial began in January 2020, and several antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.
Remdesivir seems to be the one that works.
While new drugs may be developed as early as 2021, several investigational drugs have already been authorized for other uses or have already advanced in testing.
Antiviral drugs may be tested in people with severe viral infections.
WHO encourages volunteers to participate in research on the efficacy and safety of new medicines. The FDA has provisionally approved convalescent plasma as an investigational treatment for cases of acute illness.
It has not been subjected to the medical research needed to prove its safety and efficacy in treating disease.
In February 2020, a mobile app was launched in China to handle the virus outbreak.
Users are asked to enter a name and ID number.
The app can detect "contact" using tracking data that can be a risk of infection.
All users can view the status of the other three users.
If a potentially dangerous situation is identified, the app not only encourages social isolation, but also alerts health authorities.Huge data analysis through mobile data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and inventory are being used to track people with the virus and their contacts in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government authorized security agencies to track the mobile phone data of people suspected of having the coronavirus.
This is to isolate them from the community and to protect those who may have been in contact with infected residents.
In March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared telephone location data with the German government agency, the Robert Koch Institute, in order to investigate and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia developed facial recognition technology to detect those who violate the quarantine rules.
"Italy's provincial health official Giulio Gallera said he was told by the mobile workers that ""40% of the population is still on the move""".
The German government held a 48-hour computer hacking competition over the weekend for 42,000 participants.
The president of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, has made a national announcement of measures to stop the spread of coronavirus.
Individuals may also suffer from the stress of isolation, restraint, adverse effects of treatment or fear of infection itself.
"The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying, ""Continued social isolation, loneliness, health concerns, depression and economic collapse are a storm that is damaging to people's minds and well-being"."
The virus may have mild effects with few or no symptoms, similar to some common upper respiratory tract diseases such as the common cold.
Common cases usually recover within two weeks, whereas those with a severe or severe infection may take three to six weeks to recover.
Pregnant women may be at increased risk for severe COVID-19 infection based on data from other similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, but data for COVID-19 are scarce.In some people, COVID-19 can affect the lungs and cause pneumonia.
In those who are severely affected, COVID-19 can rapidly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) causing damage to the respiratory tract, septic shock or multiple organ death.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal clotting and damage to the heart, kidneys, and liver.
Clotting abnormalities, specifically prothrombin time elevations, were found in 6% of those hospitalized for COVID-19, while renal dysfunction was seen in 4% of this group.
Approximately 20-30% of people with COVID-19 have elevated liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the average time between the onset of symptoms and death is ten days, with five spent in hospital.
However, patients transferred to the ICU have a seven-day window between hospital admission and death.
In the study of early cases, the average time from the first manifestation of disease to death was 14 days, totalling 6 to 41 days.
In a study by the National Health Commission (NHC) in China, the male mortality rate is 2.8% while the female mortality rate is 1.7%.
Histopathological examinations of lung samples from cadavers showed diffuse alveolar damage and cellular fibromyxoid exudates in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic changes were observed in the pneumocytes.
A lung scan showed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of deaths reported by the National Health Commission in China, cardiac injury was noted in elevated troponin levels or cardiac arrest.
According to data from the United States in March, 89% of those hospitalized had preexisting conditions. The availability of medical supplies and factors affecting local economy and society can contribute to mortality.
Death rates from the virus vary because of such regional variation, but also because of the complexity of the methods used.
A small number of non-serious cases can cause the death rate to be higher than expected.
However, the fact that death is the result of previous exposure to the virus may mean that the mortality rate is now lower.
Smokers are 1.4 times more likely to develop severe COVID-19 symptoms and about 2.4 times more likely to receive intensive care or die compared to non-smokers.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority found a 20% to 30% decrease in lung function in some people who recovered from the virus, with lung masks indicating possible damage.
This can also lead to post-treatment complications after recovery.
As of March 2020, it was unknown whether the previous virus could provide effective and long-term protection for people who recovered from the virus.
Immunity to the virus appears possible, based on other coronaviruses, but cases have been reported where recovery from COVID-19 has been followed by later positive coronavirus testing.
These cases are thought to be viral relapses rather than re-infections.
The virus is thought to be natural and to have originated in an animal, and then to have entered humans.
The exact origin is unknown, but by December 2019 the spread of the virus was almost entirely driven by human-to-human transmission.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, indicated that the first day of the outbreak of symptoms was 1 December 2019.
The WHO's official literature reported that the first symptoms of the disease were present on 8 December 2019.
Several methods of counting deaths are widely used.
These numbers vary by region and over time and depend on the level of testing, quality of the medical system, treatment options, time since the first outbreak and population characteristics such as age, sex and health.
In late 2019, WHO assigned emergency viral codes to ICD-10, U07.1 for laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 and U07.2 for COVID-19 identified by medical and virus analysts without laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 virus.The ratio of deaths to infections shows the number of deaths divided by the number of people identified during the given period.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death rate is 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191) as of 17 April 2020.
Other measures include the case fatality rate (CFR), which indicates the percentage of identified cases that die of the virus, and the infection fatality rate (IFR), which indicates the percentage of infected (identified and unidentified) cases that die of the virus.
These statistics are not time-based and follow the number of individuals from infection to resolution of the case.
While not all infected individuals develop the disease, the presence of disease agents can provide information about how many people are infected.
In the highest infected area in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small area of 4,600, 80 (1.7%) have already died.
In Gangelt, the virus was spread by Carnival gatherings, and entered the youth, causing low death rates, and not all deaths from COVID-19 were officially recognized as having the virus.
Moreover, the German health care system is not yet large in numbers.
In the Netherlands, about 3% may have the disease's components, as determined by blood donors.
69 (0.004% of the total population) were confirmed to have died from COVID-19.
The impact of the epidemic and the death rate differ for men and women.
The death rate is higher for men in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The greatest risk for men is when they are 50, and the gap between men and women closes at only 90.
In China, the average death rate was 2.8 percent for men and 1.7 percent for women.
The exact reasons for this difference are unknown, but genetic and behavioral factors may play a role.
Gender-based differences in infection, lower rates of smoking among women and men who develop other conditions such as hypertension at a younger age than women may contribute to the higher male mortality rate.
In Europe, 57% of people infected are male and 72% of those who died from COVID-19 were male.
As of April 2020, the US government does not track gender-related data for COVID-19 infections.
Studies show that infectious diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza, and SARS affect men and women in different ways.
A high proportion of health-care workers, particularly nurses, are women, and they are more likely to be exposed to the virus.
"The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the virus will be ""COVID-19"""."
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO stands for coronavirus, VI stands for virus, D stands for disease, and 19 stands for the year in which the first outbreak was recorded: 31 December 2019.
The name was chosen so as not to be used as a name for a specific place (such as China), species or population, in line with the suggestion of different countries in the classification intended to prevent bias.The virus that causes COVID-19 is called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
"WHO also uses the terms ""COVID-19 virus"" and ""the virus that causes COVID-19"" in public discussions".
"Both the disease and the virus are often referred to as ""coronavirus"."
"During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were often referred to as ""coronavirus"" and as ""Wuhan coronavirus""".
In January 2020, WHO proposed 2019-nCov and 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease as the names to be used for virus and disease in accordance with 2015 guidelines against the use of spaces in names of diseases and bacteria.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were released on 11 February 2020.
Due to a shortage of manufacturing equipment, some digital manufacturers print medical devices such as swabs and parts for ventilators.
For example, when an Italian hospital urgently needed a ventilator valve, and the supplier was unable to deliver it on time, a local company used its own equipment and printed 100 required valves in one night.
After the initial outbreak of the COVID-19 virus, speculative, false and misleading stories about the origin, spread, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease quickly spread online.
Humans seem to be able to transmit the virus to other animals.
Studies have failed to find evidence of infection in pigs, ducks, and chickens.
There is no approved drug or vaccine for the disease.
International research into COVID-19 vaccines and drugs is being conducted by government agencies, academic groups, and industrial researchers.
"In March, the World Health Organization launched a ""Combined Trial"" to test the therapeutic efficacy of four existing antiviral drugs that have high potential for efficacy".
No vaccine is yet available, but various agencies are working to develop vaccines.
Prior SARS-CoV activity is used because both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use the ACE2 receptor to enter human cells.
Three vaccines are being studied.
First, the researchers plan to develop a vaccine against the virus.
The purpose of using a virus like this, either inactivated or dead, is to establish an immune response against a new COVID-19 virus.
The second approach, subunit vaccines, aims to develop a vaccine that causes the immune system to respond to specific aspects of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus to bind to the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third is nucleic acid (DNA or RNA) -based vaccines, a novel way of building a vaccine.
Vaccines being studied in any of these modalities will have to be tested for safety and efficacy.On 16 March 2020, the first clinical trial of the vaccine began with four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a non-threatening genetic code that is copied from the virus that causes the disease.
There are over 300 clinical trials underway as of April 2020.
Seven studies were testing already approved treatment for malaria, including four studies of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Recycled antiviral drugs make up the bulk of the research in China, and nine phase III trials of remdesivir in several countries will report by the end of April.
A robust review of the medical establishment of the COVID-19 vaccine and potential therapeutic uses had commenced, as of April 2020. Several available antiviral drugs are being investigated for the treatment of COVID-19, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir mixed with interferon beta.
There was no concrete evidence of remdesivir's efficacy, as of March 2020.
There has been a marked improvement in patient care with adequate use of remdesivir.
Phase III clinical trials are being conducted in the US, China and Italy.Chloroquine, previously used in the treatment of malaria, was tested in China in February 2020, with results not yet approved.
However, it is proposed that the results of the study be reviewed.
Health authorities in Korea and China encourage the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, while recommending a daily dose of one gram, notes that twice that dose is too high and can be fatal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of physicians treating people with COVID-19.China's Phase 7 guidelines included interferon, ribavirin or umfenovir for the treatment of COVID-19.
Preliminary data suggest that higher doses of ribavirin are required for in vitro prevention of SARS-CoV-2.
Nitazoxanide has been proposed in an ongoing in vivo study after demonstrating weak inhibition of SARS-CoV-2.The study suggests that the early activation of protein priming by transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is critical for the infection of SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with ACE2 inhibitor.
Research on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin has major limitations that have prevented the medical community from finding this treatment without further research.Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has an unknown role in the treatment of COVID-19.
A cytokine storm may be a problem in the later stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have anti-cytokine storm properties.Tocilizumab has been added to the clinical guidelines by the National Health Commission of China after completion of a limited study.
A phase 2 randomized trial was conducted at a national level in Italy after showing positive results in people with severe disease.
Combined with a serum ferritin blood test to detect cytokine storms, it is designed to prevent the occurrence of these, which is thought to be the cause of death in some affected individuals.
An interleukin-6 receptor antagonist was approved by the FDA based on prior research in the treatment of steroid refractory cytokine release syndrome caused by various agents, CAR T cell therapy, in 2017.
To date, there is no randomized, controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
Transmission of purified and potent pathogens produced by the immune systems of those who recover from COVID-19 to people who need them is being investigated as a way of avoiding immunization of low protection.
This method was tested in SARS and the results are unknown.
Viral neutralization is a potential method used when treatment with a few pathogens can create immunity against SARS-CoV-2.
However other pathways, such as gene-based cellular cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis, are possible.
Other gene therapy techniques, for example, using disease-specific genes, are being developed.
The production of convalescent serum, which contains a liquid fraction of the blood from recovered patients and contains components of the disease associated with the virus, can be increased to be used more quickly.
Coronavirus infections, a group of closely related diseases
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital, who later contracted and died from COVID-19 after helping to raise awareness of the virus's spread.
