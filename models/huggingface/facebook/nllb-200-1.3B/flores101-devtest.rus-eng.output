Not only does this confirm that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, which is already a widely held theory, but it also provides details that you wouldn't normally get from fossil remains, like color and three-dimensional structure.
Scientists say that the feathers of this animal were brownish brown above, and pale below, or had carotenoid pigmentation.
The discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed rod called a rachis, but do have other distinctive features  chin and beard  the researchers concluded that the rachis was likely a later evolutionary development of other distinctive features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature control and demonstration. The researchers suggested that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample represents an adult feather, not a chicken's plumage.
The researchers suggested that although this was a young dinosaur's tail, the specimen had the feathers of an adult, not the fur of a chicken.

The work was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations of the galaxy in Sagittarius.
The effect the team was looking for could be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon pulls the Earth in, causing tides, so does the Milky Way affect the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as normal matter does.
According to this theory, a large part of the dark matter around the galaxy is arranged in the form of a halo and consists of a large number of small particles.

In France, voting is traditionally done in a low-tech fashion: the voter shuts himself in a booth and places a pre-printed sheet of paper indicating the chosen candidate in an envelope.
After the voter's identity is verified by the officials, he or she places the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voter list.
French election laws are quite rigorous in their systematization of procedures.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have had to be transparent so that voters and observers can be sure that there are no envelopes inside at the beginning of voting and that no envelopes have been added to them, except for those people who have been allowed to vote and whose votes have been counted properly.
Candidates can send their representatives to monitor the process, and in the evening, votes are counted by volunteers under strict control in accordance with a special procedure.

However, the driver sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services released the driver of a red Audi TT.
He was initially hospitalized at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was subsequently transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Subsequently, the Edinburgh Sheriff Court charged Adexe with the murder of her son.
She is in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but any testimony may be distorted as her popularity has been widely used by the media.
This is common practice in other parts of the UK, but Scottish justice works differently, and the courts have deemed the publication of photographs as potentially damaging.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee observes that "journalists seem to be really walking the line by publishing photos and other information about suspects".
The Crown Prosecution Service, which is largely responsible for the prosecution, told reporters that no further comment would be made, at least until the indictment is handed down.
The document, according to the leak, will be about a dispute over the borders that Palestine wants to establish based on those that existed prior to the 1967 Six-Day War.
Other topics reportedly touched on include the future state of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan River Valley.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years after the agreement is signed, while the PNA agrees to maintain such a presence for only five years.
The shooters who participated in the additional pest control test were to be under the close supervision of rangers, as this test was under observation and its effectiveness was assessed.
Through the partnership of the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW), the sporting shooters' association's hunting program recruited qualified volunteers.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of parks and heritage conservation for the Wildlife and National Park Service, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation have undergone comprehensive training and safety briefings.
Yesterday, Marteii led the new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (VIS) to the oath of office.
This is Marteaux's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, the presidential commission recommended the previous Provisional Electoral Council to step down as part of a package of measures to move the country to new elections.
The commission was Martelli's response to the mass protests against the state regime that began in October.
These protests, sometimes accompanied by violence, were caused by the failure to hold elections, some of which were due to take place as early as 2011.
About 60 cases of malfunctioning iPod devices overheating were reported, resulting in six fires and four people suffering minor burns.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan (METI) stated that it was aware of 27 clusters associated with these devices.
Last week, the Department of Economy, Labor and Industry announced that Apple had notified it of 34 additional cases of overheating, which the company called "slightly serious".
In response, the ministry called the delay in Apple's report "very regrettable".
At 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday) there was an earthquake in Mariana.
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Agency said there were no reports of damage in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer stole a tourist bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, and took Hong Kong tourists hostage.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued, and at least six have been declared dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and elderly people, were released earlier, as were the Filipino photographers.
Later, photographers took the place of an elderly woman who had gone to the bathroom and was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician-gynecologist and began working at Oakland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
When Liggins worked at the hospital, he started investigating premature births in his spare time.
His research showed that if you inject a hormone, it will increase the maturation of the baby's lungs during the development of the fetus.
According to Xinhua, on Wednesday, state investigators found two onboard self-writing machines, or "black boxes".
The fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to the moon.
Here's what Tommy Dreamer said: "The moon was the first Extreme Queen. She was my first manager. The moon died on the night of the second moon. It's a unique event, just like she is. A strong woman".
Dustin "Goldast" Runnels said, "The moon was as plague as I was... maybe even more plague... I love her and I'll miss her... I hope she's in a better place".
Of 1,400 people polled in the run-up to the 2010 federal election, those who oppose Australia becoming a republic have risen 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard during the 2010 federal election campaign expressed the view that Australia should become a republic after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
34% of those polled share this view and want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
The poll found that 29 percent of respondents believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and 31 percent believe it does not need this form of government.
The Olympic gold medallist was due to compete in the 100 and 200 m freestyle and three relay events at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints his physical form is now in doubt.
He was unable to take the medication needed to relieve the pain, as it is forbidden at the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, on January 25 discovered the largest prime number known to date.
On Tuesday, it was announced that by early February, several people had confirmed the discovery using various hardware and software.
Comets may have been the source of water to Earth, as well as the source of organic matter that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed, because comets have been colliding with the Earth for a long time.
Cuomo, 53, began his tenure as governor earlier this year and signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage last month.
He called the rumors "political chatter and nonsense".
He is expected to run for president in 2016.
NextGen  is a system that the Federal Aviation Administration assures will allow aircraft to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel annually, as well as reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology instead of the old ground-based radar technology, which will allow air traffic controllers to more accurately determine the position of aircraft and give pilots more accurate information.
No additional transport is being run to Wembley, no ground trains will stop there, and there are no parking spaces or intercepting stations on the surface.
Fears about the lack of transportation have prompted speculation that the game may have to be played behind closed doors without fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science describes the emergence of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers at Princeton University (USA) and Uppsala University (Sweden) reported that due to mating of the endemic Darwin's toad (Geospiza fortes) with the migrating cactus toad (Geospiza conirostris), a new species evolved in just two generations, although it was thought that this process would take much longer.
Gold can be shaped into any shape, and it can be rolled into very small shapes.
It can be stretched into thin wire, which can be spun and plated, and it can be checked or rolled into rolls.
It can be made very thin and attached to another metal, and it can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-drawn illustrations in books, called "face manuscript".
This is called the pH of a chemical, and you can make an indicator with the juice of a red cabbage.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical is.
The pH is determined by the degree of hydrogen ion saturation (H in pH) of the chemical compound being studied.
Hydrogen ions are protons from which electrons are separated (hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the new mixture by mixing two dry powders in one container, and then use your wet, clean hands to make a balloon out of the mixture.
The moisture on your hands will react with the top layer, which will be unusual, and then form a shell-like structure.
Nearly every house in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet connected to a complex sewage system.
Fragments of the existing sewerage system were found in the homes of Minoan cities on the islands of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
In ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women bathed together.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you use satellite.
A satellite in space takes a call and almost instantly reflects it back down.
Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts our light and view to some extent.
To launch a satellite or telescope into space, you need a giant rocket over 100 feet high.
The wheel has changed our world in incredible ways. The most important thing the wheel has done for us is give us a much easier and faster means of transportation.
It gave us trains, cars, and many other means of transportation.
Below them are more medium-sized cats, which eat small prey from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, many small cats (including stray cats) eat and hunt many more small animals, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of a niche, a specific job that each species does that keeps it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social cats, living in large groups called pride.
The pride is composed of one to three adult males in a kinship, as well as females and cubs, which may number up to thirty.
Females are usually related to each other and form a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion pride behaves very much like herds of wolves or dogs - animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) and are also very dangerous to their prey.
Being a well-developed athlete, the tiger can climb trees (though not very well), swim, jump long distances, and pull with the strength of five strong men.
The tiger is of the same genus (Panther) as the lion, leopard, and jaguar. These four cats are the only ones that have the ability to roar.
The tiger's roar is not like the full-sounding roar of a lion, but rather like the shouting of sentences from unintelligible words.
The ocelots like to eat small animals, and if they have the chance, they will hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds, and almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than it is.
Scientists believe that the ocelots follow the animal's trail and find their prey by smell, tracking its movement on the ground through their sense of smell.
They are very good at seeing in the dark with their night vision and can move almost imperceptibly, tracking their prey by blending in with their surroundings and then jumping on them.
When a small group of living organisms (a small population) separates from the main population from which they originated (for example, if they cross a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island from which they cannot easily return), they often find themselves in an environment that is different from the one in which they were previously.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or changes from what it had before to become a strong competitor.
The original population hasn't changed at all -- it still needs the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as a new population begins to adapt to a new environment, it begins to look less and less like the rest of the population.
Over time, thousands or even millions of years from now, these two populations will look so different that you can't say they're the same species.
We call this process species formation, which means the emergence of new species, and species formation is an inevitable consequence and a very essential part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen we breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide we exhale.
Plants feed on the sun by photosynthesis, and they also cast a shadow.
We build our houses and we make our clothes out of plants. Most of our food is plants. Without plants, animals wouldn't be able to survive.
The Mosaic was the most formidable predator of its time, so it feared no one but other Mosaics.
His long jaws were dotted with more than 70 sharp teeth, plus an extra row of teeth on the jaw, so that those who met him on the way could not escape.
We don't know for sure, but it's possible that his tongue was split, and he ate turtles, big fish, other mosasaurs, and he could have been a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like the tyrannosaur would not compare with it.
Although most of their food was familiar to us, the Romans had their own strange and unusual dishes served at feasts, such as boar, peacock, snail, and a rodent such as the sunflower.
There was another difference: while poor men and women ate on chairs, the rich liked to have communal feasts, where they ate on their sides.
The diet of the ancient Romans could not include foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
In particular, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a sanctuary for each of the gods, which was considered to be the home of the god.
People sacrificed to the gods, and priests tried to satisfy the gods' desires at ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and an inner sanctuary, which was open only to priests.
Sometimes, as elements of the temple, special towers were built in the shape of pyramids called "zikuratas".
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, a house was not of much importance.
Most of the Jewish family's life was spent outdoors.
Women cooked in the yard, shops were open counters facing the street, and houses were built of stone.
The land of Canaan was not heavily forested, so timber was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated, and the Norse sagas tell of Eric the Red being banished from Iceland for murder, and, moving further west, he discovered Greenland and gave it a name.
But regardless of its discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at the time.
Although each of the countries was Scandinavian, there were many differences between the peoples, rulers, traditions, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie "Treasure of the Nation", you might think that the back of the Declaration of Independence had a treasure map.
Although it says something on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
The back of the Declaration of Independence reads, "The actual Declaration of Independence was signed on July 4, 1776". The text is written at the bottom of the document and upside down.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that early in its existence this large parchment document (29 3⁄4 by 24 1⁄2-inch) was folded up for convenient storage.
So it's likely that the recording was added as a mere note.
As a result of Operation Neptune and subsequent battles, northern France was liberated, but the south was still not.
It was run by the French "Vichist", who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, which they called Operation Dragon.
In just two weeks, the Free French and the Americans liberated southern France and headed for Germany.
Civilization is a distinct culture, which is carried by a large group of people living and working together, a society.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin civilis, which means "civil" and is related to the Latin words civis, meaning "citizen", and civitas, meaning "city" or "city-state", and it also expresses the size of society in a certain way.
Civilized culture involves the transfer of knowledge across generations, the continuous cultural presence and the continuous dissemination.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving a relevant historical record, and therefore cannot be recognized as genuine civilizations.
During the American Revolutionary War, thirteen states, under the Articles of Confederation, for the first time formed a weak central government, with Congress as the sole organ.
Congress lacked any power to impose taxes, and since there was no nationwide executive or judicial power, it relied on the power of the states, which often refused to cooperate and were unwilling to enforce all its acts.
Nor did he have the authority to overturn state tax laws and tariffs.
Amendments to the Articles required the unanimous approval of all the states, but the states were so irresponsible to the central government that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is the second most successful team in the world, along with the German national team, and won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula 1 racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, where Italians compete in international competitions and the Olympics.
Japan has about 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making Japan the seventh largest island in the world!
Japan is often referred to as an archipelago geographically because of its belonging to a cluster/group of islands.
Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when European sailors sailing by wrote down the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or "beautiful island".
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a transformation of aboriginal grain production methods and hiring Chinese workers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and in 1885 declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after defeat in the Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonosek, which ceded Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely the Intihuaatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Three Window Rooms.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a more accurate idea of how they originally looked.
By 1976 30% of Machu Picchu had been restored and restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the most common format for static photography in the world is 35 mm, and that was the dominant film size at the dawn of the analog era.
It's still in production today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio has been inherited from the size of digital camera images.
The 35mm format is actually a bit confusing, it's 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The ratio of the sides of this format (divided by twelve to get the ratio with small integers) is therefore assumed to be 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. the APS family of formats) are equal to or close to these proportions.
The all-too-commonly used and often derided rule of thirds  is a simple recommendation that creates dynamics while maintaining a certain amount of order in the image.
It says that it is best to place the main object at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into three parts vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was the object of intense attention.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity united European states despite differences in language and traditions.
Her all-pervading power touched everyone from the king to the common man.
One of the main tenets of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's money exists for that very purpose.
The center of church power has been Rome for over a thousand years, and such concentration of power and wealth has led many to question whether this dogma is being upheld.
Shortly after the war began, Britain imposed a naval blockade on Germany.
This strategy has proven effective in cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated universally accepted international laws, as set out in several international agreements over the past two hundred years.
Britain mined international waters to prevent ships from entering entire sectors of the ocean, endangering even neutral vessels.
Since the reaction to this tactic was restrained, Germany expected a similar response to its unhindered underwater warfare.
Among most citizens and peoples in the 1920s, such sentiments as pacifism and isolationism prevailed.
After experiencing the horrors of World War I, nations wanted to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States and accepted an offer to work for Edison in New York City.
He came to the United States with four cents in his pocket, a book of poems and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor, who was his boss at his previous job, to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China used a unique way of marking periods of time; each stage of China or each ruling family was a distinct dynasty.
The most famous was the Three Kingdoms era, which lasted 60 years during the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this period, fierce warfare took place between many of the nobles vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms era was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China, with thousands of people dying fighting for the throne in the great palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people, not to a single ruler.
And after the Revolution, the work opportunities opened up for all men, allowing the most ambitious and talented to succeed.
The same is true of the army, because ranks have become based on merit rather than origin.
The French Revolution also inspired many other repressed working-class representatives in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in non-religious subjects, and he often visited the cave that became known as "Hira" on Mount Nur (light) for meditation.
And the cave that survives today gives us a very vivid insight into Muhammad's spiritual aspirations.
The cave is located on a mountain top north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
It's very difficult to detect even if you know it exists, and you're completely isolated in a cave.
There is nothing to see but the clear, beautiful sky above you and the many surrounding mountains.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders of the world that still exists today.
The Great Pyramid was built by the Egyptians in the third century BC and is one of many large pyramidal structures built to honor the memory of the Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or Giza Necropolis, in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, includes several pyramids (the Great Pyramid of Giza being the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of the Pharaoh Cheops, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Cheops' wives and relatives.
The upward motion of the knot looks like a V, and the downward motion of the knot  like a bracket or square without the bottom side.
"Up" means you should start at the tip and take the knot forward, and "down" means you should start where your hand holds the knot and take it back.
The upward movement of the buckle usually produces a softer sound, while the downward movement of the buckle is stronger and more forceful.
You can draw your own line, but remember that the line is printed for musical reasons, and it usually has to be followed.
On October 6, 1789, an angry mob of women from the marketplace forced the terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two young children (11 year old Marie-Thérèse and 4 year old Louis-Charles) and the king's sister, Madame Elizabeth, back to Paris from Versailles.
They returned to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a mob that shouted threats at the king and queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to open the windows wide.
At one point, one of the crowd waved the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles in front of the frightened queen.
The military expenses of American imperialism for the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to pay for most of the expenses and interest on the bond loans transferred on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking offices.
Of course, the surplus profits from the long exploitation of the Filipinos were the main income of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, you have to understand the context that led them to form the order.
The era in which these events took place is called the High Middle Ages, a period of European history that spans the XI, XII and XIII centuries (1000-1300 CE).
The High Middle Ages replaced the earlier Middle Ages and preceded the Late Middle Ages, which, according to the accepted view, ended around 1500.
Technological determinism  is a term that encompasses a wide range of practical ideas, from technical progress or technological imperative to the strict view that human destinies are driven by a fundamental logic related to the laws of science and their manifestation in technology.
Most views on technological determinism share two common ideas: that the direction of technological development is virtually uncontrollable by cultural or political influence, and that, in turn, the "impact" of technologies on society is due to their own properties, not society.
For example, you could say that the car is the inevitable cause of the development of roads.
However, the national road network is economically unprofitable for only a small group of cars, so new production methods are being developed that allow the cost of car ownership to be reduced.
Mass car ownership is also leading to an increase in road accidents, leading to new treatments for injuries in health care.
Romanticism largely included cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Ficht and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped people, and over time, customs and culture that were in harmony with the place of residence of a given society were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is called the fashion capital of the modern world, so Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
It was known as a center of luxury from about 400 B.C. and lasted until about 1100 B.C.
Its status declined throughout the twelfth century mainly because the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were valued higher than the goods offered on the Byzantine markets.
At this point, the title of the Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its heyday between the XI and XIV centuries.
At first, clothing was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, because of slow communication channels, styles in the West can be 25-30 years behind.
The style itself began to develop in Western Europe towards the end of the Middle Ages, and one of the greatest achievements of the time, thanks to the Crusades, was the use of buttons to fasten clothes.
Natural agriculture  is agriculture carried out to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Natural agriculture is a simple, often organic, system of farming that uses seeds from plants growing in a given ecosystem, along with the use of seed rotation and other relatively simple methods of increasing yields.
Historically, most farmers have been engaged in agriculture for food, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel marginalized by society's standards, and allow such people to define themselves.
Subcultures may differ based on age, nationality, social status, place of residence and/or gender of the people they are made up of.
The characteristics that define a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Representatives of a particular subculture often declare their affiliation through a distinctive and symbolic use of style, including fashion, manners, and jargon.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to illustrate several unfortunate cases where children, due to lack of attention, unsuccessful circumstances or deliberate abuse, were not exposed to adults during their adulthood.
Some of these children were isolated by humans (usually their own parents), and in some cases, this was because the parents did not accept their child's serious intellectual or physical shortcomings.
Street children may have experienced severe forms of violence or trauma before fleeing or being abandoned.
Others were said to have been raised by animals; some of them lived in the wild on their own.
If raised entirely by animals instead of humans, a savage child displays behaviors (within physical limits) that are almost in all respects similar to the specific animal that raised it  for example, its fear or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning should be easier and more fun, scaffolding is ahead of many technologies.
Scaffolding  is not a method of learning, but rather a form of helping those who are going through a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real, in other words, teacher  is a form of scaffolding, but it's also what Microsoft Office Scraper is.
The virtual learning aid scaffolding is built into the software and is designed to remind, explain and ask questions about procedures that the learner might find too difficult to handle alone.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, from neglect to abuse to extortion.
Children should never be raised in an environment where they are not nurtured, cared for, and educated, but they do.
We believe the foster care system is safe for children.
Our foster care system should provide safe housing, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
The patronage education should provide all the needs that were missing in the house where they were taken from earlier.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The unique features of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of approach to use and satisfaction.
It is suggested that "learning" and "socialization" are important motivators for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal engagement" and "long-term contacts" were also named by Amy and McCord (1998) as new facets of motivation when they studied how people respond to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the field of interpreting micro-expressions  facial movements of several milliseconds in length.
In particular, it is claimed that one can determine whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting his microexpressions.
In his article "The President's Speech", Oliver Sachs described how people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage can still correctly judge the sincerity of the speaker.
He suggested that animals, such as domestic dogs, might have similar abilities to interpret human behavior.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two types of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation introduces a new genetic variation, while selection removes it from the set of variations that are manifested.
Segregation and recombination with each generation brings variations between the two pools.
In savannahs, primates with digestive systems like humans have a hard time meeting their amino acid needs from available plant resources.
Moreover, failure to do so will lead to serious consequences, such as stunting, malnutrition, and, eventually, death.
The most accessible plant resources would be the proteins found in leaves and beans, but they are poorly absorbed by primates like us if they are not cooked.
On the contrary, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but also a rich source of proteins containing all the essential amino acids.
In light of all of this, it should come as no surprise that our ancestors solved the protein problem in much the same way that chimpanzees do in the savannah today.
Sleep interruption is the process of purposefully waking up during normal sleep and falling back asleep after a short time (1060 minutes).
This can easily be done with a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to your senses without waking you up completely.
If you find yourself resetting the alarm clock in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, which will make you get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options that are based on biological rhythms include taking large amounts of fluid (in particular, water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before bed, which causes a person to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in his body and soul.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force that is present within you, and each person is given the potential to find absolute peace and satisfaction.
The only thing that stands in the way of enlightenment is our own tension and our own negative attitude.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been supplemented by the Mahayana way of love and many of the techniques of Indian yoga.
The principle of Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, it consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of all-embracing love.
The kundalini energy in kundalini yoga is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualization.
The heart of Tibetan meditation is considered to be the Yoga of the Gods. Through visualization of the various deities, energy channels are purified, chakras are triggered, and enlightenment is achieved.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. After the war, the contradictions regarding the system, process and culture led to a rift between the countries.
Two years after the war ended, the former allies became enemies, and the Cold War began.
It was to last for the next 40 years, and it was fought in real terms, using proxy armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, in Cuba, and in many other places around the world.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian plateau.
However, these plans became out of date almost overnight, when about 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Red Army formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian Fronts after capturing eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Accords, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international agreements, bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to transport large numbers of people and cargo across the oceans.
The job of the seamen has traditionally been to ensure the ability of the country to move its people and goods, and also to prevent the enemy's ability to move its people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign during World War II, where the Americans tried to transport people and supplies across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy, using mostly its submarines, tried to stop this movement.
If the anti-Hitler coalition had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain just as the rest of Europe had.
Goats were probably first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to leave them to themselves to have milk, wool, meat and leather at their fingertips.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing places, often overseen by goat herds, usually made up of children or teenagers, which is similar to the more common activity of a shepherd.
Carriageways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the gauge roads were only parallel bars of wood, they allowed horses to carry larger loads at higher speeds than on the slightly more bumpy roads of the time.
The use of shovels began long ago to keep the rails in place, but it later became clear that the paths were more efficient with the iron strips on top.
This became common practice, but iron led to more wear on wooden wagon wheels.
In 1767, the first rails made entirely of iron appeared.
The first known form of transport was by foot, and people began walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus.
For their Australopithecus ancestors, walking upright was not as common.
Bipedal specialization is found in the remains of Australopithecines from the 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although it is possible that the sahelanthropus walked on two legs as early as 7 million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally consciously, we can become part of the environmental movement, and we can even be activists to alleviate further suffering.
It's like treating symptoms, and if we don't want a temporary solution, we need to find the root of the problem and fix it.
Clearly, the world has changed dramatically as a result of human scientific and technological progress, and overpopulation and extravagant lifestyles have increased the problems.
After being passed by Congress on July 4, the manuscript, signed by Congressman John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent within a few blocks to John Dunlap's printing workshop.
Overnight, 150 to 200 copies were made, now known as "Danlap's flyers".
The first public reading of this document was made by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
On July 6, one copy was sent to George Washington, who ordered it read to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap leaflets known to date are the oldest surviving copies of the document.
Today, many paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived to the present day, and we call them birds.
They're often not considered dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there's a lot more to say about birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have scaly paws and claws, they lay eggs and walk on two hind legs like T-Rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on information processing, which is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1. These numbers are called "binary numbers" or "bits" if you use computer jargon.
It can be difficult to detect oral poisoning right away, and symptoms like vomiting are too common to make a quick diagnosis.
The best sign of internal poisoning may be an open container of a drug or toxic household chemical.
Read the label for specific first-aid instructions for poisoning with this particular poison.
The term "buck" is used by entomologists formally to refer to a group of insects.
This concept comes from bed bugs, known since ancient times, which are insects that are perfectly adapted to parasitize humans.
Both predators and bed bugs are nesting species, adapted to live in the nest or home of their host.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making MS the leading neurological disease among youth and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Studies have shown that twice as many women as men suffer from multiple sclerosis.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their child.
These couples can choose to create an adoption plan for their child.
In adoption, the biological parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can adopt the child.
The main purpose of science is to find out how the world is organized by applying the scientific method, which is actually the basis of most scientific research.
Scientific research is also guided by experimentation (an experiment is a test used to rule out one or more possible hypotheses), by asking questions, and by observation.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on ancient texts and especially on the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views were adopted in all scientific questions, including psychology.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West became cut off from its philosophical and scientific Greek roots.
Many of the observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend to a large extent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by means of biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply a response to external periodic stimuli, are found in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
The biological clock is a self-sustaining oscillator that will continue to cycle autonomously over a period of time, even in the absence of external stimuli.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the first to suggest that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase implanted their DNA into the bacteria using phages, or viruses.
They did two experiments, marking the DNA of phage with radioactive phosphorus and the protein of phage with radioactive gray.
Mutations can cause a wide variety of outcomes, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether the mutated cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in the germline cells can be passed on to the children, while mutations elsewhere can lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism is interesting for those who like to go out into nature to enjoy the landscape, including wildlife and plants.
Examples of active recreation at the facility include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
One example is the visit, photography, and study of the orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns in the countryside to go to their workplace, and those who work in the place they just left pass by.
In this active transportation, everyone is connected to and supports the transportation system based on personal cars.
Now, science indicates that the huge hydrocarbon economy has influenced one of the stable states of the biosphere that has sustained human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone is a member of society and uses transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear such complaints about water quality or falling bridges.
Why do we get so many complaints about transportation systems, why do they break down every day? Are transportation engineers just incompetent? Or are there more fundamental reasons for this?
The study of the movement of individual drivers and cars between two points and their interaction with each other is carried out within the framework of the study of transport flows.
Unfortunately, it's difficult to study the intensity of traffic because you can't predict the behavior of a driver with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, driver behavior is often quite systematic; thus, traffic flows generally have some degree of systematicity and can be roughly described mathematically.
To better represent the flow of transport, the relationships between three basic quantities were established: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity.
These relationships help in the planning, design and operation of railway facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly, and their ability to fly helped them to elude enemies, find food, and find mates.
Most insects have the ability to fold their wings along their body, which gives them an advantage.
This gives them more places to hide from predators.
The ostrich and the hedgehog are the only insects that cannot fold their wings back.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Many believed that he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars).
That seems like a reasonable idea, because we don't feel the Earth moving, do we?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the first largest river on Earth, carrying more than eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes reaching six miles in width.
The Amazon is responsible for 20 percent of the water that flows from our rivers into the oceans.
The Amazon River is 6387 km (3980 miles) long and is fed by thousands of smaller rivers.
Although stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, the size and technical perfection of the Giza pyramids never surpassed.
In the new kingdom, the ancient Egyptians admired the monuments built by their predecessors over a thousand years ago.
The Vatican City is the smallest independent country in the world, and the least populous.
The Vatican uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language for most people working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All Vatican citizens are Catholic.
The basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper have been known to man since ancient times, as they can all be found in nature in their pure form and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle believed that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
They were similar to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma, although he also suggested that they transition to a new state to produce what we see.
Alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
You can also make alloys that contain small amounts of nonmetallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
The atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit in the dot at the end of this sentence.
So the pencil became a good friend to many people when it came along.
Sadly, as new writing methods came along, the pencil lost its status and became less common.
People are now texting on computer screens, and they never have to deal with a pinch.
You can only imagine what will happen to the keyboard, with the new technology.
The basic principle of the atomic bomb is that it takes energy to keep many protons and neutrons in one nucleus.
It's like pulling a heavy cart up a hill, and then the nuclear fission releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to break down with little or no impact.
The surface of the moon is made up of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick beneath the oceans and 100 km thick beneath the continents.
It's thinner under the moon's seas and thicker under the mountains.
On the visible side, there may be more lunar seas because the crust is thinner, and the lava would be easier to move to the surface.
Content theories are focused on finding something that makes people act or that might interest them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that accumulate internally as they grow older.
These theories address what makes people want to do what they do, and what makes their environment want to do or not do certain things.
Two popular theories of content are Maslow's Pyramid of Needs and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory of Motivation.
There are two types of behavior that can occur when managers start managing people who were previously their equals in status.
It is difficult for such managers to make unpopular decisions, discipline, evaluate results, allocate responsibilities, and hold employees accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, the individual becomes an unrecognizable individual who feels that he or she must change everything the team has done and take it for themselves.
Because ultimately, the leader is responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behavior often leads to conflict between the leader and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams follow the same standards of skill as regular teams, but there are slight differences.
Virtual team members often act as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They are usually more autonomous than the employees of traditional teams, because their teams can meet in accordance with different time zones, which local management may not always understand.
The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The invisible team is the team of leaders to whom each participant is accountable.
Why do organizations go through the laborious process of creating self-learning organizations? One of the goals of applying the concepts of self-learning organizations in practice is innovation.
When all available resources are used efficiently in all functional divisions of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can be manifested.
As a result, the organization's concerted efforts to overcome the obstacle can lead to a new innovation process that will meet the client's needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, leaders must create a culture of innovation, knowledge sharing, and experience-gathering.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of efficiency.
The neuroscience data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of consciousness, and it narrows the field of study, and it becomes much more precise.
The relationship between brain pathology and behavior is used by scientists in their research.
It's long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, injury, and tumor affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
New technologies are allowing us to see and explore the structures and processes of the brain that we have never seen before.
This gives us a lot of data and material to create simulation models that help us understand the processes that are going on in our minds.
Although AI is strongly associated with science fiction, it forms a very important branch of computer science that looks at behavior and machine learning and the "incrementing" of intelligence into machines.
Research in AI includes creating machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Here are some of the examples that we can give: control, planning and scheduling, responding to diagnoses and customer questions, and recognizing faces, handwriting and voice.
These questions are divided into disciplines that are designed to solve the problems we face in our daily lives.
AI is now widely used in economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, and is embedded in some home computer and video game software.
Study trips are very important for any classroom, and very often teachers want to take their students to places where they can't get to by bus.
The technology offers a solution through virtual tours, where students can explore museum exhibits, visit an aquarium, or enjoy fine art while sitting with their class.
Excursions to virtual spaces for the general public to view are also a great way to refresh the memory of the tour and share your learning with future classes.
For example, every year, students at Bennett High School in North Carolina create a website about their visit to the state capital, and every year that website is updated, but access to the old versions is still preserved  they serve as a memorial album.
Blogging can also improve students' writing skills.Although students often start their blog using sloppy grammar and spelling, this tends to change due to the presence of the audience.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger begins to strive to improve his writing in order to avoid criticism.
Also, blogging "makes students better at understanding the world around them", and encourages students to be smart and interesting by attracting readers' attention (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a collaborative tool that motivates students to spread knowledge far beyond the traditional school day.
Through active feedback on online materials, students can determine their own position in the context of others' work, as well as articulate their own views on specific issues (Oravek, 2002).
Ottawa  is Canada's beautiful bilingual capital with a wealth of art galleries and museums that reveal Canada's past and present.
Further south is Niagara Falls, and the north is the heritage of the unspoiled natural beauty of Muscocks and the surrounding areas.
All of this and more makes Ontario truly Canadian to foreigners.
Larger areas further north are sparsely populated, and some of them are virtually uninhabited grasslands.
A surprising population comparison: there are more African-Americans in the United States than there are citizens in Canada.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is far more diverse and unique in its wildlife.
Almost all the smaller islands are independent states or associated with France and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the region, especially it took root in the Comoros and Mayotte.
The spread of European influence and colonization began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco de Gama discovered a route from Europe to India via the Cape of Good Hope.
The region is bordered by the Sahel in the north, and the Atlantic Ocean in the south and west.
For women: all tourists are advised to say that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It's also good to wear a ring (just not too expensive to look at).
Women should be aware that because of cultural differences, they may feel that they are being harassed, women are often being chased, women are being held by the hand, and so on.
Say no to men firmly and don't be afraid to stand up for yourself (which is not acceptable regardless of cultural differences!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century B.C. It was used by the Romans, Phoenicians, and Merenids as a strategic port, called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, but abandoned it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Ed-Dar-el-Beyda, and Spanish traders who established trading bases there called it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old medina, it's easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods like tachin, pottery, leather goods, calyan and a whole range of other things, but all for tourists.
Goma  is a tourist town in the easternmost part of the Democratic Republic of Congo, on the border with Rwanda.
In 2002, the city of Goma was devastated by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city streets, especially the central part of the city.
Although Goma is a safe place, it is important to check in advance on any trips outside Goma to understand the state of the fighting in North Kivu.
It is also a starting point for climbing Nyiragongo volcano, and one of the cheapest places in Africa to see mountain gorillas in the wild.
You can take a mototaxi to Goma, which is normally 500 CFA for a short trip.
Because of its relative inaccessibility, Timbuktu became a metaphor for the exotic land far away.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, but its reputation as a tourist attraction and an airport is well established.
In 1990 it was added to the list of World Heritage in Danger due to the danger of desert sands.
One of the most important stops in the PBS production of Henry Louis Gates' "The Wonders of the African World" was here.
This city is very different from other cities in the country, as it is dominated by the Arab color, not the African.
Kruger National Park is located in the north-east of South Africa, along the border with Mozambique in the east, with Zimbabwe in the north, its southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park's area is 19 500 km2; it has 14 different ecozones, each of which is a habitat for different wild animals.
It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered the leading among South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, there is a daily fee for its protection and visit.
It may also be advantageous to buy a Wild Card, which allows you to visit South Africa's national parks either selectively or all of them.
The territory of Hong Kong is named after Hong Kong Island, a place that many tourists consider to be the main focus of their attention.
The chain of buildings that make up the skyline of Hong Kong is compared to a glittering column diagram underlined by the waters of Victoria Bay.
To see the most picturesque places in Hong Kong, you must leave the island and head to the coast of the Julon Peninsula, which is opposite.
Most of the urban areas of Hong Kong Island are concentrated on the reclaimed land on the northern shore.
This is the site that the British colonists took over, and if you're looking for evidence of the colonial past of the territory, this is a good place to start.
Sundarbans are the largest belt of coastal mangrove forests, extending from the coast 80 km (50 mi) inland into Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans were declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Part of the forest within the Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
These forests are not just mangrove swamps - they also include some of the last remaining mighty jungles that once covered the Gangetic Plain.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3850 sq. km, of which about a third is covered by water or swamps.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses depart from the Inter-Regional Bus Station (beyond the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and to Jakarta/Bumtang, depart from 06:30 to 07:30.
Since buses are often crowded, it is advisable to buy a ticket several days in advance.
Most areas are served by small Japanese Coaster buses, which are convenient and reliable.
The  route is a quick and convenient way to get to nearby places such as Paro (150 ngultrum) and Punakha (200 ngultrum).
The Oyapoque River Bridge is a suspension bridge that spans the Oyapoque River and connects the cities of Oyapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapoque in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 metres high, and the bridge itself is 378 metres long and has two 3.5 metre wide lanes.
The height of the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
According to the plan, the bridge will be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most significant indigenous group inhabiting the area now occupied by eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced natural agriculture.
The Chaco area was home to various groups of local tribes, such as the Guaicuru and the Payagua, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, which was previously called the "huge province of the East Indies", was created as a result of the Spanish conquest of the indigenous peoples.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has largely managed to retain much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best teams, as well as the best players in the world in a sport like polo.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in December on the polo fields in Las Canitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen at other times of the year.
For news about polo matches and where to buy tickets, visit the Argentine Polo Association website.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is equivalent to one British pound sterling (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on these islands, which is located in Port Stanley across from the FIC West store.
British pounds are generally accepted throughout the islands, and credit cards and U.S. dollars are also often accepted in Stanley.
Credit cards may not be accepted on remote islands, although British and American currency may be accepted; check with the cardholders in advance as to which payment method is acceptable.
Falkland Islands currency is almost impossible to exchange outside the islands, so exchange money before you leave the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it's summer there, winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics. In the summer months, air temperatures above +30°C are common.
Winters can be deceptively cold, with temperatures rarely below zero, but the combination of wind and humidity creates a feeling of colder weather than the thermometer would suggest.
There are no particularly "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of precipitation is approximately the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, nature is still wild, so there is no need to feed or disturb the animals.
Park officials warn: Stay no closer than 100 yards per meter to bears and wolves, and no closer than 25 yards per meter to any other wildlife!
No matter how humble they look, bison, elk, bears, and almost any large animal can attack.
Dozens of visitors are injured every year because they don't keep their distance, and these animals are big, wild, and potentially dangerous, so keep their personal space.
Also, remember that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid cooking or carrying smelly foods, and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on the island of Upolu, and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The bay was the site of a notorious naval confrontation in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to leave the bay.
All but one British cruiser sank, and about 200 American and German sailors were killed.
During the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful assembly in the city led to the assassination of the Tupuá supreme leader Tamesse Lealofi III.
There are many beaches here, because Auckland is situated on the shores of two harbors.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbor area) are washed by the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Most of these beaches are sandy with safe swimming, and many are shaded by trees such as the pohutukava.
In the central part of Oakland, where the prestigious residential suburbs of Mission Bay and St. Helier's are located in Waitemath Bay, Tamaki Drive beaches are sprawling.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a good selection of shops located along the shore.
The most popular local beer is "Number One", which has a simple, pleasant and refreshing taste.
There are many French wines to drink, but New Zealand and Australian wines can be better transported.
Local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but if you're still wary, bottled water is easy to find.
The Australian people don't understand the idea of flat whites. "Little black" is espresso, cappuccino they serve with a high layer of whipped cream (not with foam), and tea without milk.
Hot chocolate meets Belgian standards, and although the fruit juices are expensive, they are of excellent quality.
The reef is heavily travelled year-round, and injuries caused by any of these causes on the reef are rare.
However, follow the advice of the authorities, obey all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
The cuckoo occurs near beaches and estuaries north of the river from October to April, sometimes outside this period.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans, and most sharks are afraid of humans and run away.
The crested crocodiles do not live in the ocean, and their main habitat is the estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance allows travellers to avoid worrying about where to stay when they arrive at their destination.
Tour agents often make deals with specific hotels, but you can also book through a tour agent and other forms of accommodation, such as camping sites.
Tour agents usually sell package deals that include breakfast, airport transfers or even combined packages that include flight and hotel accommodation.
They can also save your reservation if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain other documents for your destination (e.g. visas).
Any changes or requests should be addressed to the tour operator first, not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, the vast majority of participants stay overnight on the festival grounds, and most of them consider it a mandatory part of the program.
If you want to be near the stage, you need to arrive early to find a camping spot near the music.
Remember, even if the music on the main stages may have already ended, there may be sections of the festival where music will continue to play late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you're crossing the northern part of the Baltic Sea in winter, find out about the location of the cabin, as crossing the ice creates a rather creepy noise that can make it difficult for the most sensitive people to sleep.
Cruise to Saint Petersburg includes city walks, cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (please specify conditions).
Usually, casinos make every effort to ensure that visitors spend as much time and money as possible in the establishment.
They usually offer special food, drinks, and entertainment to keep guests in a good mood and in the establishment.
Some establishments offer free alcohol, but drunkenness clouds the mind, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone planning to drive through high latitudes or mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice or frost.
The friction on the ice and snow is low, and you can't drive the same way you would on normal asphalt.
During a thunderstorm, enough snow to get you stuck can fall in a very short period of time.
Visibility may also be limited by snowfall, hail, condensate or ice on the vehicle's glass.
On the other hand, snow and ice weather conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues year-round with almost no interruptions.
Safari is probably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the main event for many travelers.
The term "safari" in everyday usage means a land trip to see the amazing wildlife of Africa, especially the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, often approach the machines, so even with ordinary equipment, you can get a good view.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes cautious, and you'll see them better through binoculars.
A hiking safari (also called a "bush study", "hiking safari", or "walking trip") consists of a trek lasting from a few hours to several days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021, with some events taking place in different locations across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host the Summer Olympics twice, the first time being in 1964.
If you booked your 2020 airline tickets and accommodation before the date was announced, you may be in a difficult situation.
Cancellation rules may vary, but as of late March, most of the coronavirus-related rules do not apply to July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
Most tickets for the events are expected to cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with a standard ticket price of around ¥7,000.
Many hotels rent out a plasterer and a flatter, even if they are not in the room.
If you don't have a strap or you're not thrilled about wearing socks with a braid, you can try a fan, if there is one.
Do not expose the fabric to too high a temperature (which may lead to a seizure or, in very rare cases, to a burn).
There are different ways to purify water, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some places, it takes just a minute to boil water, in others, it takes several minutes.
Filters are effective in many ways, and if you're in doubt, you might want to consider buying water in sealed bottles from a trusted company.
Travelers may encounter pests they have not seen in their native lands.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or worse, cause allergic reactions, poison, or transmit infection.
Infectious diseases themselves or dangerous animals that can cause injury or death to humans are generally not considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to buy goods at certain points without taxes or excise duties.
Travelers to high tax countries can sometimes save a considerable amount, especially on such goods as alcohol and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fermon has the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburg highway, often passing through isolated, deaf and wooded terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be on your guard: steep slopes, narrow alleys, and steep turns are the norm.
The speed limits are significantly lower than the previous and subsequent sections, usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h), and strict adherence to them is even more important than the others.
However, oddly enough, mobile phone connections here are much better than many other sections of the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilderness.
German pastry is quite good. In Bavaria it is very rich and varied and similar to the pastry of their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit baking is common, apple baking is year-round, and cherries and plums appear in the summer.
In German pastries, almonds, fondue and other tree nuts are often used.
If you want small but nutritious flour-based pastries, try what, depending on the region, is called a salad or a doughnut with filling.
Curry is a dish made from herbs and spices, combined with meat or vegetables.
Depending on the liquid content, curry can be "dry" or "wet".
In the interior areas of Pakistan and Northern India, yogurt is used extensively in curry. In Southern India and some coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
Indonesian cuisine, with 17,000 islands to choose from, is a general term used to denote the vast variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
But without specification, the term most often refers to food native to the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
The cuisine of Java, which is now widespread throughout the archipelago, includes a variety of spicy dishes, with the most preferred flavoring being peanuts, chili, sugar (especially coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The strings are the supports for the rider's feet, hanging on either side of the saddle.
They provide the rider with better stability, but there may be safety issues, as there is a chance of getting stuck in the leg.
If the horse has dropped the rider but his leg is stuck in the saddle, the running horse may pull him back.
First, most riders wear riding boots with a heel, which have a smooth and fairly thin sole.
In addition, some saddles, especially English, are equipped with safety arches that allow the leather strap to fall off the saddle if it is pulled back by a falling rider.
The Colchamo Valley is the main destination in Chile for mountaineering. It is known as the Yosemite of South America and has a large number of large granite walls and rocks.
From the top, you can enjoy stunning mountain scenery, with climbers from all over the world constantly creating new routes in its vast potential for mountaineering.
Winter mountain sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve descending over snow-covered terrain on foot-mounted skis or snowboard.
Mountain skiing is the main tourist destination for many skiers (sometimes called "ski-bullshitters"), who plan their holidays entirely around skiing in a certain place.
The idea of skiing is very old: rock paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 B.C.E.!
The sport of mountain skiing dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the Norwegians opened the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Ski tourism is also known as backcountry, skituro, or ski hiking.
This is related, but usually does not include hiking to the top and then descending unprepared slopes, as skiing on the whole requires harder skis and boots.
Imagine that a ski route is a walking route.
Under good conditions, you can cover a few more distances than you would if you were walking, but you can only achieve that speed on skis in the very rare cases when you don't have a heavy backpack and a laid-out ski.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it is made up of many independent states. Normally, travelling through many countries would mean applying for a visa and passing through multiple passport controls.
But the Schengen area in this respect functions as a single country.
Once in this zone, you can usually cross the border without going through the passport control points again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa to each of the Schengen countries separately, which will save you time and money, as well as paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what is considered antique. Some tax authorities define goods that are over 100 years old as antique.
This concept has geographical variations where the age limit in places like North America may be smaller than in Europe.
Craft goods can be defined as antiques, despite the fact that they are younger than similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer herding is an important source of livelihood for the Sámi people, and the culture surrounding this activity is also important for many other professions.
Although this was the tradition, not all Sámi people were involved in the mass breeding of deer; they lived by fishing, hunting and other similar trades, using deer mainly as bearing animals.
Today, many Sámi are employed in modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in the Sámi region of Lapland.
Although the word "Gypsy" is widely used, especially among non-Gypsy people, it is often considered offensive due to associations associated with negative stereotypes and misconceptions about the Gypsy people.
If the country you are planning to visit has a travel advisory that warns you of the dangers of travel, this may affect your travel health insurance or your travel cancellation insurance.
You might want to consult other governments besides your own, but their recommendations are directed to their own citizens.
Here's one example: U.S. citizens in the Middle East may face situations that Europeans or Arabs cannot.
The news reports only briefly describe the political situation in one country.
The opinions expressed are often superficial, vague, and overly simplified in comparison with the more detailed information available everywhere.
Adverse weather conditions is a general term for any hazardous weather event that can cause damage, cause serious social upheavals, or lead to human casualties.
Adverse weather conditions occur all over the world, and they come in different forms depending on geography, terrain, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, heavy rainfall, and wildfires are manifestations and effects of severe weather events, such as storms, tornadoes, water storms, and hurricanes.
Regional and seasonal hazardous weather events include thunderstorms, snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to consider any risks associated with severe weather in their area as it may affect any travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country that could be considered a war zone should undergo professional training.
A search on the Internet for "security course in a hostile environment" might give you the address of a local company.
The course usually covers all the topics covered in greater detail, often with practical training.
The course usually lasts between 2 and 5 days and includes simulation, a large amount of first aid information and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines about survival in the wild are common, but there is little published about war zones.
People planning to undergo sex reassignment surgery abroad should make sure they have valid documents with them for the return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports without gender (X) or updated with the desired name and gender varies from place to place.
The willingness of foreign governments to meet their obligations under these documents also varies greatly.
Checkpoints have also become much more tightly controlled since the events of September 11, 2001.
Transgender people preparing for surgery should not be expected to pass through the scans, and their privacy and dignity should not be compromised.
A buoyant current is a current created by waves that break against a shore, or sometimes a reef or something.
The backflow is concentrated in a few deeper areas where a fast flow can form, going deeper, because of similar underwater topology.
Most deaths are due to fatigue in trying to swim back upstream, which may be impossible.
Once you're out of the current, the return will be no more difficult than usual.
Try to go somewhere where you won't get caught again, or, depending on your skills and whether you've been spotted, you might want to wait for rescue.
The shock of returning to one's home country comes sooner than the culture shock (the shorter romantic period), lasts longer and can be more severe.
Travelers who easily adjust to a new culture may find it especially difficult to adjust to their own culture.
When you return home from abroad, you are adapted to a new culture and have lost some of the habits of your native culture.
When you first went abroad, people were likely to be patient and understanding, knowing that travelers need to adjust to a new country.
It may be surprising to people that patience and understanding are needed even with travelers returning home.
The sound and light show against the backdrop of the pyramid is one of the most interesting activities in the area for children.
The pyramids can be seen in the dark, and you can also see them in the silence before the show.
Usually, you hear the noise of tourists and vendors, and the history of sound and light is like a storybook.
The Sphinx acts as the backdrop and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are shown on the pyramids, and the different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, which were discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries, and are home to the largest number of bases, with 16 in operation as of 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 kilometers from the peninsula. The largest island is named after King George with the settlement of Villa-las-Estrelyas.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception Island, where the flooded caldera of the still active volcano is an impressive natural harbor.
Elsworth Land is a region south of the Antarctic Peninsula, washed by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of this peninsula merge with the plateau, and then rise again to form the 360-kilometer Elsuworth Mountain System, divided in two by the glacier of Minnesota.
In the northern part, the Sentinel ridge, is the highest mountain in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, whose highest point reaches 4,892 m and is called the Vinson Peak.
In remote areas outside the reach of mobile communications, a satellite phone may be your only option.
Generally, a satellite phone is not a replacement for a mobile phone, since you need to be out in the street in direct satellite view to make a call.
The service is often used in navigation, including cruise and high-speed ships, where there is a need for remote data and voice communication.
You can usually find out more about the service by contacting your local telephone operator.
An option that is becoming increasingly popular for those who plan to take an academic year is to travel and study.
This is especially popular among high school graduates, allowing them to take a year off before going to university without jeopardizing their education.
In many cases, taking a course abroad during an academic holiday can actually improve your chances of entering higher education in your home country.
Typically, tuition fees are charged for admission to such programmes.
Finland is a great place for boat tourism. There are also thousands of islands in the lakes and coastal archipelagos of the "land of a thousand lakes".
You can do without a boat when exploring the archipelago or visiting the lakes.
While the coastal archipelago and the largest lakes can indeed accommodate any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks leave a completely different impression.
Boating is a national form of leisure in Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
The situation is similar in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but in other cases it is quite unique (for example, in the Netherlands this value is from one to forty).
Most individual Baltic cruises include an extended stopover in Russia's St. Petersburg.
That means you can spend a few full days in this historic town and spend the night back on the ship.
If you go to the coast only as a tourist by boat, you do not need a separate visa (since 2009).
Some cruise brochures show Berlin, Germany, as you can see on the map above, Berlin is far from the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Air travel can be intimidating for people of any age and social status, especially if it's their first time flying or if they've had some traumatic experience in the past.
There is nothing to be ashamed of: it is no different from the personal dislike and fear of other things that so many people have.
Understanding how an aircraft operates and what happens during flight can help you overcome the fear that comes from the unknown or the inability to control the process.
Freight forwarders are well paid for delivering quickly, and often the speed of delivery of commercial documentation, goods or spare parts for urgent repairs is very important.
On some routes, larger companies have their own planes, but for other routes and smaller companies, this has been a problem.
If they were shipping anything as air cargo, it could take days on some routes to unload and clear customs.
The only way to get it out of the way faster is to ship it as checked baggage, which is why airline regulations don't allow you to ship baggage without a passenger, so we need your input.
The most obvious way to fly first or business class is to extort the privilege (or better yet, to get your company to pay for it).
It's not cheap, though. In a rough approximation, you'll pay four times more than a regular economy class for business and eleven times more for first class!
There's usually no point in even looking for business-class discounts or first-class direct flights from A to B.
The airlines know that there is a certain core group of passengers who are willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of getting anywhere quickly and comfortably, so they charge a fee accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Kishinev. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has been a victim of ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Pridnestrovian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any UN member state.
Despite the failure of political negotiations, economic ties between these two parts of Moldova were restored.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of about 3.7 million, the largest port after Istanbul and an excellent transport hub.
Once an ancient city, Smyrna is now a modern, thriving commercial center, located along a vast bay and surrounded by mountains.
Wide boulevards, buildings with glass facades, modern shopping centers intersect with traditional red-tiled roofs, a market of the XVIII century, old mosques and churches, although the city has more Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
From the village of Haldorsvik, there is a view of the nearby island of Estura, and there is also an unusual octagonal church.
There are interesting marble sculptures of pigeons over some graves in the church cemetery.
It's worth taking half an hour and walking around this unusual village.
Not far to the north is the romantic and charming town of Sintra, which was praised by Lord Byron and subsequently became famous around the world.
Scotturb Bus 403 operates regular services to Sintra and stops at Cape Rock.
To the north, visit the great Fatima Temple (the tomb)  the site of the world-famous apparitions of the Virgin Mary.
Please remember that you are basically standing on a brotherly grave site, and a site that is indescribably important to a large percentage of the world's inhabitants.
There are many more men and women alive who survived their time here, but there are many more people whose loved ones were killed here or worked here to death, whether they were Jews or people of other nationalities.
Please treat this place with all the dignity, seriousness and respect it deserves.
Do not desecrate this place by graffiti or scratching objects around it.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the population prefers to speak Catalan, most understand it, and almost everyone knows Spanish.
However, most signs are only in Catalan, as it is the first official language.
However, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other public places.
The usual announcements in the metro are made only in Catalan, but unplanned interruptions are announced by an automated system in a variety of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians are self-centered, rude and arrogant.
Although this is often just a false stereotype, the best way to succeed in Paris is to behave in the best way possible as a "bien élevé" person.
The unwelcome appearance of the Parisians will vanish in a moment if you show a little elementary courtesy.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, mostly with beech, fir and pine trees, and is a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Due to the combination of microclimates, different soils and altitude variations, it is particularly diverse in plant communities.
The area is rich in a huge number of different species of animals and birds.
Here you can meet rare representatives of the fauna, such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, elk, wild cat and deaf bear, as well as many other common species of animals.
When visiting monasteries, women should wear skirts below the knees and with their shoulders covered.
Most monasteries give clothes to women who come unprepared, but if you take your own, especially brightly colored, the monk or nun at the entrance will smile at you.
Similarly, men should wear pants that cover their knees.
You can also take them at the entrance, but these clothes are not washed after each use, so you may not be comfortable in these skirts.
Majorca's cuisine, like that of similar Mediterranean regions, is based on vegetables, bread, and meat (especially pork), with widespread use of olive oil.
A simple and popular lunch, especially in summer, is Pa-amb-oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes and any filling available, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, and the word "you", are always capitalized, even in the middle of a sentence.
It's important to distinguish between verbs and adjectives.
This also probably simplifies reading, while writing is somewhat complicated by the need to find out whether a verb or adjective is used in a substantiated form.
Pronunciation in Italian is relatively simple, as most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
One should be especially careful with the letters c and g, as their pronunciation changes depending on the subsequent vowel.
Also, remember that r and rr are pronounced differently: caro means "road" and carro  "carriage".
Persian has a relatively easy and mostly regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this Persian grammar textbook will help you to learn a lot of new things and to understand expressions better.
Obviously, if you speak the Romance subgroup, you will find it easier to learn Portuguese.
However, people who know a little Spanish may quickly conclude that Portuguese is similar enough that it cannot be learned separately.
Ancient observatories are generally considered obsolete today and serve as museums or educational institutions.
Because light pollution in their heyday wasn't as much of a problem as it is today, they're usually located in cities or on campuses that are more accessible than those built today.
Most modern research telescopes are huge structures in remote locations with favorable atmospheric conditions.
The sight of sakura blossoms, called "hanami", entered Japanese culture as early as the 8th century.
The idea came from China, where the favorite flower was the plum.
In Japan, the first celebrations of the sakura blossoming were arranged by the emperor only for himself and other members of the aristocracy at the imperial court.
Plants look best in their natural habitat, so do not be tempted to pick up just one.
If you visit a formal garden, collecting "samples" will also lead to you being thrown out without any conversation.
Singapore is generally a very safe place, easy to navigate, and you can buy almost anything once you arrive.
But in the "deep tropics" just a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to deal with both heat (constantly) and intense sun (less often in clear skies).
There are also several buses heading north to Hebron  the legendary burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, as well as their wives.
Make sure the bus you're about to board is headed to Hebron, not just the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good theme for a celebration.
For example, visiting castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley, a cruise on the Danube, or a boat trip along the Erie Canal.
They also define routes for popular walking and cycling routes.
Christmas  is one of the most important holidays in Christianity, and it is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Many traditions associated with this holiday have also been adopted by non-Christians in Christendom and by non-Christians throughout the world.
It's a tradition to spend Easter night up in the open, to watch the sunrise.
Of course, this tradition has a Christian theological explanation, but it may well be a pre-Christian ritual of spring and fertility.
More traditional churches often hold Easter Sunday services on Saturday evenings during Easter weekends, with parishioners usually beginning at midnight to celebrate the Resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally came to these islands came here by swimming, flying, or being swept away by the current.
Because of the great distance from the mainland, mammals could not reach it, making the giant tortoise the primary herbivore on the Galapagos Islands.
Since the arrival of man, many mammals have been introduced to the Galapagos Islands, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic in winter, you'll learn what it's like on the polar night when the sun doesn't rise above the horizon.
This is a good opportunity to see the northern lights, because the sky will be more or less dark all day.
Since these areas are sparsely populated, and as a result, light pollution is often not a problem, you can also enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners are used to.
Suits are standard business attire, and colleagues refer to each other by surname or by position.
Harmony in the workplace is extremely important, and the results of group work are valued above individual achievements.
Employees usually have to get permission from their boss before making any decisions and are obliged to follow his orders without reservation.
