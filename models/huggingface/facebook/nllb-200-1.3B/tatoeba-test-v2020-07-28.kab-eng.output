These are new.

You are finished!
Tom knows better.
Read to us.

She hated him.
There were guns.
Tom and I are of the same mind.
Does Tom believe that?
No one knows what will happen in the future.
I'm a writer.

Tom was poor, though he could have been rich.
Come here now.
Can you find him?
I think it is true what the musician Jean-Louis Aubert said: "If you have joy in your heart, it is easier to feel happiness". So, the traveler, whatever happens, you will find him not happy at all; he will be a little disappointed. This is called the adventure.
Are you mad?
Were you surprised to see her?
We are old.
I'm not Tom's mother.
Do you know someone named Mr. Green?

As another friend has said, translation is not the substitution of one language for another. It is a means of elevating it to the international stage of knowledge, of increasing its prestige and reaching its full potential.

I don't know where Tom lives.
No one knows what tomorrow will bring.
Have you read?
Tom's family begged him to stay.
I like to sleep.
I know who left early.
Where do you not want to go?
Modern Hebrew is easier than old Hebrew.
Get your feet out of here!
It is increasingly apparent that we do not live in the same world.
This is a bird.
I thought he would come.
Follow your dreams.
Tom is close.
Are you a student?
Someone is trying to make fun of you.
Someone tore two pages out of this book.
I wasn't told.
Did you come back from Tibet?
Tom is cooking dinner.
I should have cheated you!
He is asleep.
Give me some time.
I forgot his name.
Tom is going to Australia on Monday.
Can you stop screaming?
The kingdom is ruled by Satan, and the poor are the ones who make it so.
He came out of the river.
I need a car to get out.
You should eat now.
Thank you for always helping me.
How many books have you read?
Are you serious?
He is a bit of a jerk.
You can't leave me like this.
No one died.
Something is missing.
Thank you for inviting me here.
Are you cheating on someone?
Who is sick?
Will she go?
You are absolutely wrong.
I drank a cup of coffee.
Are you writing a letter?
I cut my hair every month.
Tom needs me.
Let the dogs roar.
You can now consider Layla your daughter.
It's too much!
How many times?
Who else uses Tatoeba at your desk?
Tom volunteered to help Mary.
I'm tired of your complaint.
Tom changed places.
Tom and I just went to the party.
Oh my God, no one saw you do this.
I want to go to Boston in the spring.
Make me a sandwich.
Which do you like best, meat or fish?
Someone might want her.
Who is the winner?
Shouldn't I be working tomorrow?
When did you return from Boston?
Are you all right?
Now that I'm older, I think about other things.
I want you to lock the door when you leave.
I don't know what else to say.
Get out of here!
I don't want to grow up.
Once again I will not accept your mistakes.
Shut it down.
How many books do you have?
You must learn from your mistakes.
Bring her home.
Do you watch TV every day?
How's your coffee?
You have a lot of cavities in your teeth.
I haven't seen him since.
We are not going to be in a hurry.
I hope to be back on October 20th.
The rain is already here.
I wonder where she is.
Tom never returned his money.
I often walk.
Tell me something about it.
Please don't die.
Tom pretended not to hear what Mary said about him.
I think we can help.
My dear...
Shut up!
Tom stayed.
Someone stole it from me.
Did Tom really say that he planned to stay in Australia?
If I were you, I'd go home and get some rest.
Some of what you say is false.
Tom and I went to the party together.
Do you believe those stories?
He will remain silent.
Did your religion come into being peacefully?
Aren't you hungry?
Look at yourself.
Is there anyone here who can help me?
Tom couldn't save Mary.
Tom lives with his mother in Australia.
There is a God.
You obviously missed them.
Tom is lying.
Who will take his place?
You're better than Tom.
I have my own.
Tom and Mary are helping each other.
Give Tom a break!
Someone has planned to kill you.
They all agreed.
I already told you that I didn't do it.
I was overwhelmed.
Are you a Catholic?
Don't worry about it.
Champagne, please.
Where are these children?
The world is a small village.
Was there anything else?
You should ask someone else.
I hope no one saw us.
Plants are growing.
Sami plays Farid's guitar.
When are you leaving?
I hope no one saw you like this.
I want to know more about your country.
I hate French.
Tom was fired in October.
Oh my God, no one saw you.
Please don't bother me.
Tom answered deeply.
Tom will be late again today.
The congregation has ten members.
Do you think Tom loves me?
Have a good night, mother.
Do you like chicken?
Do you want to stay longer?
Have you ever milked a cow?
Tom took the last place.
I'm here to take a drink.
Tom loves you.
I speak ancient Greek.
Tom didn't tell the truth about where he was that day.
Tom is lost.
Hello, my sweet.
There will be no reading on October 20.
Are you kidding me?
You expect much from him.
You are stumbling.
You are part of the problem.
Stop the car!
Sami was playing with Farid's girlfriend.
Tom didn't answer because he didn't know what to say.
Are you a geek?
I heard something.
What's wrong with you?
Any good that is lost is better.
I'm lucky to have met you here.
Read them a Chopin.
Move slowly.
I hope Tom is strong.
Stop being a fool.
Do you know him?
Are you shy?
Dan bought a new computer.
Is there anyone?
Tom doesn't know how to write on a computer.
My winter month is October.
I was in the mountains.
Stephen is dead.
Do you think Tom will forgive me?
Have you checked them?
Please tell me your real name.
I hope no one followed you.
Is there anyone?
I hope nobody followed you.
Tom was with Mary.
Let's go and tell the others.
What is this wine?
Please take this.
Nothing I did was worth it.
Have you seen Tom yet?
I will be a teacher.
Follow the neighborhood.
You have a good book.
Tom knows that I'm not afraid of anyone.
She is reading it.
Did anyone call you?
I didn't think it counted.
He took her home.
They all hate Tom.
Tom and Mary met at the station.
You obviously missed them.
Can I trust you?
Get in here!
I want you to go to your room and clean your clothes.
Let's do something.
It's all right.
Stop worrying.
You are our prisoner.
They blamed him for that.
Welcome to the house.
You're already there.
Are you working tonight?
Stay with me for a while.
Please let me pay.
Tom refused to come in.
I know that Tom is Canadian.
Tom has been in Boston since last October.
Tom will be thirty in October.
Jim looks like his father.
I need you here.
I think there's someone in the front room.
Are you smiling?
Have you become a madwoman?
Tom will tell Mary.
Do you write in French?
Tom stopped following his wife.
Nobody knows.
Clean up!
None of Tom's suggestions are very effective.
You still have life ahead of you.
They all ran away.
We traveled the country by car.
I am Chinese.
Did Tom say anything about his accident?
Tom turned his back on Mary.
Are you sick?
I hope no one saw you come here.
Tom only slept a few hours.
We will all sing.
Sami was talking to his mother.
I let Tom kiss me.
Sami found a leak in the garage.
Wait for him.
Tom said he wanted to be hit by a shark.
Tom is waiting.
Someone is watching us.
I want to show you some of the documents that have been translated for publication.
Stop talking to each other.
Tom didn't tell me he was married.
It is a secret.
Construction began in October.
I brought you something to eat.
It's the end of November!
I was a little surprised to see Tom there.
Choose carefully.
Listen to this!
They built it.
You should never forget that.
I can't see her.
They are dead.
Tom thought Mary might have been brainwashed.
Tom doesn't seem to care about Mary.
Tell me again who will help us.
Tom stopped reading.
You should stay away from them.
Aren't you close to Tom's family?
Sometimes, just a nod will tell you that you've been listening well.
Tom had a party yesterday.
Here, raise your voice a little.
How deep is it?
Good luck to you!
I was in his room.
You are all crazy.
I haven't been in Boston since October.
Someone forgot his umbrella.
Tom doesn't know how to talk to people.
They are all happy.
He went out in October.
Thank you for your conversation.
Can you fix this?
Please be careful! The doors will close now!
Someone must have stopped you.
It's not bad to laugh at a friend.
Omar was just being rude.
Tom is poor.
There is no laughter, only tears.
It smells.
The final date for the draw will be 20 October.
You swim better than me.
Tom said he could speak French.
I'll do everything I can for you.
Swimming is good for your health.
I am a teacher.
Tom didn't raise Mary.
You wash your clothes.
I'm lucky to have met you here.
I was on a trip last summer.
Why is no one speaking?
Eat something!
Did you see a movie or not?
Maybe I should go now.
Tom threw Mary's sunflower out the window.
Can I talk to you alone?
Who is ready to order?
I want to call my lawyer.
I'm very impressed with Tom.
We starved to death here.
Sami will cry like a baby.
Tom and I love each other.
A man I thought was a friend has betrayed me.
We didn't ask Tom to help.
Your eyes are twinkling.
Let me out!
How does that sound to you?
Sami was reading the paper.
I took a leave of absence.
She read to him.
Hey, you!
You are so wrong!
Tom threw three stones at Mary.
Don't worry about food if you don't want to eat.
Tom was angry with Mary.
Someone stole my money.
That's it, wait a minute.
Tom doesn't seem happy.
The computer is new.
Say it right.
People with chronic diseases need chronic treatments.
Tom never asked me.
Are you all dressed up?
When are we going to do it?
Tom needs to buy a ticket for Mary too.
You are wrong.
Is there anyone here?
Can I go home now?
She is a woman, not a girl.
Sami told me that you were in the Navy.
You will be hungry.
I continued working.
Show them.
Someone is following us.
I moved here last October.
Will you come with me?
Tom wants to work.
Tom became friends with Mary when he was living in Boston.
You have no idea.
Tom is much younger than I am.
Finally, I visited Boston last October.
We're looking for Tom!
Please let me out.
Tom is not a Pokémon.
Someone called for you.
Hurry up!
That's the truth.
I forgot everything that belongs to you.
I love you very much.
I know these people.
Everything is fine on your side.
I want to walk with you.
Have you read this one?
Tom doesn't think I'd do that.
Tom and I live together.
Are you all right?
Take this one.
I'm not your friend.
I'm tired of coffee.
She teaches English.
Do you think anyone can see me?
Leave him to us.
He sent me a message.
Get to know yourself!
It makes no sense at all.
Ask someone else for it.
I won't let you pay.
I needed to be alone to think.
Be careful with this.
Does Tom believe that?
These are the ones.
Someone is watching you.
He is English.
Tom is not expected to be here on October 20.
You are all crazy.
Is there something bothering you?
Tom ate a bowl of spaghetti.
Is Tom still crying?
I think that's not true.
Get out of here!
Geoff is a farmer.
They missed the train.
They died.

This is my opinion, not yours.

Please be quiet!

The flowers begin to fall in October.
Keep it up!
Tom was angry at Mary.
Go and change your clothes.
The mountain turned into a lake!
Someone has already done it.
Tom can't help.
Good luck in your new job.
He hates Algerian culture.
Go home now.
What's the problem?
He left.
Is there anyone there?
Can you find her?
You could be a writer.
I saw you in my dreams.
Try it.
Do not make mistakes.
Answer them.
Tom seems to be fine.
I learned that from you!
I still love Tom.
Get up !
I don't know how to answer your question.
I'm afraid Tom won't tell Mary anything.
He is a fool.
Think about it.
Friendship is strength.
Please do as I say.
You are part of the problem.
Are you stupid?
Who is she?
You drank a cup of coffee.
Can you see?
How long have you been reading?
When did you first go to Australia?
Tom is laughing at Ken.
Tom carefully performed an abortion.
Do you think Tom will forgive me?
You stayed at home.
One question is enough.
Tom smiled.
I remember.
Tom likes to see Mary dance.
I failed.
Tom is being watched.
I eat bread.
They answered.
I hurt my ankle.
No matter how tired he was, work was waiting for him.
You're finished with the war.
He only gives it to the clergy.
"The elephant is up to three". is like "The elephant is up to three". says a friend.
She died.
He built it.
Come right now.
Have you read?
Call me tomorrow.
It is snowing.
You'll see Tom soon.
Take this letter by plane.
You'll find Tom agrees.
Someone is coming.
Cars are expensive.
They were all happy.
The first asset of a people is its language.
Let go of me!
Just look at my new car.
Read to us.
Where did you find him?
Tom was sitting under a tree.
You can use my computer if you want.
Do not cry.
Hold on to Tom.
No one understood.
Please help me with my work.
You shouldn't stay here.
Kabyles love their language.
I have no choice.
Where were you?
Tom has a new suit.
You're trying to steal Tom's money.
They all paid attention.
She swims well.
She likes to read.
Tom seems scared.
I'll tell Tom you said that.
He gave us everything we wanted.
Tom hated Mary.
What will you do if it rains?
Our teacher hates being questioned by his students while he's teaching.
Just look at my new car.
What a man!
Nobody knows.
Tom does everything by himself.
He easily smells the cheese.
Did you come back from Tibet?
Walk with your foot.
Stop dreaming about it.
Have you had dinner or not?
She did not stop.
Tom seems happy.
She loves you very much.
Your writing is very bad.
We hope you will come often with us.
I met Tom in October.
Are you gay?
Go and catch!
Are you at home?
I only met her one way.
Please call him.
Did you hear what they were saying?
The Kabyle coat is beautiful.
Tom was in love with Mary in high school.
Is there anyone here?
Just let me in.
Eat plants - Millions of plants eat them.
Stop running!
What are Tom and Mary talking about?
Take it off.
I want to kiss Tom.
Tom and Mary are leaving.
Have you seen the new movie?
I found your bag.
He was fascinated by her beauty.
I play Chopin.
You look well.
He was born rich.
Please pass me some salt and black pepper.
I'll call you tomorrow night.
You should try to meet Tom.
I know Tom is a fool.
Tom needs a dozen eggs.
I was told that Tom is still in Australia.
I'm going to eat at the Chinese restaurant tonight.
Tom speaks French.
Tom is not talking.
Now that I'm a teacher, I think differently.
Mary likes to buy clothes.
I don't know who killed him.
Sami is six years old.
Stop teaching!
You should tell Tom the truth.
Someone killed Tom today.
I want you back today.
Get out of here!
Hold him!
Has anyone spoken my name?
You look like a European.
Someone came to our house.
I want you to tell me the truth.
No, thank you. I left.
Let me explain.
There's this boy.
You fool!
Geoff is stealing jewelry.
Ask one of the children you'll see first.
When was the last time you were busy?
Someone is crying.
Wanting to make his own money, Tom went into the garage and knocked down some bricks.
Throw this one out.
My wife thought I was crazy.
He just talks, not moves.
I can't wait to be at your Halloween party.
Help me out here!
I know this is a long visit.
I got a cold.
Please do it again.
I don't know what you like.
French is not only spoken in France.
Stay still and don't move at all.
Take this table.
She is angry.
Go and warm up.
You're new here, aren't you?
It's a small dog.
What kind of food do you eat?
Someone could stop me.
Close your eyes and be very happy.
Look again.
Tom or someone else said that.
Take a break from work.
Tom seems ready.
You fool!
I didn't know you had a brother.
Speak up!
Clean up!
No one can beat Tom.
Get down!
Where does Tom live?
Buy me a drink!
Have you read this book or not?
Tom almost killed Mary with a knife.
We are overwhelmed.
You're not tired, are you?
Tom won the Nobel Prize in physics.
Tom didn't help Mary.
Is it French here?
Open the door.
I didn't read it well.
Tom didn't want to get married.
You know.
He died?
You are our prisoner.
The meat is good for you.
You saw Tom do that, didn't you?
Tom didn't nod.
None of my parents can speak French.
There is no charge.
Today is October 20th.
My younger brother was raised by his grandmother.
I did.
You are really a genius!
I'll eat it if you eat it too.
Stop yelling at me.
It is worth it.
Is that true?
Tom was forced to resign from his job.
Someone just called.
Tom dressed like a girl for Halloween.
Someone drove Tom to his house last night.
What is your philosophy?
Am I wrong about that?
I won this one.
Where do you live now?
Sami seems to have lost his mind.
Welcome to the house.
I'm ready to write with you.
The truth is above all else.
Your philosophy of life is different from mine.
Someone is following me.
We picked up the eggs and went straight to the market.
Are you all right?
Tom got in front of Mary.
Sami went back to work.
Do not move.
Are you at home too?
It's like she lives under a lake.
Tom came by himself, not Mary.
Keep writing.
Try to find a cure.
You'd better cut your hair.
Yes, please.
I'm not good at swimming.
Kiss, you are so close.
Is Jesus really the Son of God?
They said something.
When did you come to Boston?
From now on, we will only speak French.
Sami feels as if he knows Layla.
I just got out of the bar in Ukfadu.
This is my favorite dish.
I just hope no one saw you come here.
Is that wrong?
You are a bitch to me.
Our food is all cooked.
Do good to those who hate you.
No matter how fast you go on the trail, you'll never get there on time.
Show me exactly where he lives.

Just as I wanted to grow up, my grandson got ahead of me.
Can you fix this?
Tom wasn't here last week.
Where is your aunt?
I believe everything we've been told.
No one laughed.
Let them help you.
We heard the door open.
Are you conscious?
Are we sorry?
There's someone out there.
Sami and Layla are fighting over a three-dollar cake tray.
They want something to write about.
We bought these books.
Are these your parents?
We added another bag.
Tom is a man of secrets.
What should we say?
How many pounds did you earn?
French is difficult.
He is moving fast.
I think they're watching me.
They smoke.
People are very isolated in Australia.
How strong you are!
Tom likes to do things.
You are a problem.
You're a good girl here.
I'm always proud of you.
I think you're being deceived.
Hello! How are you?
Tom has a habit of crying a lot.
Tom said he never planted cabbage.
Are you busy right now?
Where did you buy your clothes?
Be strong! I'm going to kill you!
You should always have a pencil in your hand.
Get your clothes off!
I hope you understand.
We left early.
You are our prison.
Tom has more money to buy Mary what she wants.
Tom agreed.
Tom is shy.
Come on in here!
Sami's car was very nice.
Stop singing.
Love is alive.
Close your eyes.
Is there anyone you want to see?
How can I explain it?
Tom left on October 20.
Are you pissed?
How much?
I want someone to talk to.
I don't want to watch TV this late.
Tom and Mary are helping each other.
Sami was fishing with his bicycle.
I thought it took courage to do that.
Tom and Mary got married in October 2013.
Stay with me a while.
Go and wash yourself with cold water.
October 20, 2013 is Arim.
Tom is a liar.
Show them off.
You look European to me.
This place reminds me of Italy.
It's the third of October.
He is a jerk.
Snow is white, and snow is black.
No one cares who you are.
Your writing is cool.
I am very happy.
Someone stole it from me.
I'll wake you up tomorrow morning.
Who is the best soccer player in the world?
You are the best.
To your health!
You obviously eat a lot.
Fire is the people's waste.
Does anyone in your group speak French?
Are you going to study today?
It's our turn!
We eat meat.
Tom drinks twice as much as Mary.
I want to know who it is.
Do you want something else?
Just talk to them.
You can milk the cows.
Get in the way!
Just put them together.
She was drunk.
My life is in your hands.
I'm following one.
I hope no one sees you like that.
The fairies!
Tom will always remember Mary.
Tom doesn't know Mary.
Tom walked.
You still don't like Tom, do you?
What do you think about what happened?
I'm washing my clothes.
I was hit by a car.
I don't really like chicken.
His father never went abroad.
How many books have you read?
You sound like your mother.
I laughed at Tom.
Are you Ukrainians?
It is of no importance.
It's best to start right now.
What is the tallest building in Boston?
I studied.
When are you eating?
I listen to music.
I'll call you this afternoon.
Someone is lighting a fire.
I'm glad I didn't know.
Tom was kicked out of the house last night.
Tom didn't nod.
I'm not tired today.
Do you like Tom's style?
Tom said he didn't want Mary to win.
You're not going to force Tom to leave early for that.
Put oil on the fire.
Everything is going to change.
Tom fought Mary in front of everyone.
Get another one.
If you need me, call me.
They are not helping.
Stop beating my head off.
Can you fix this?
Tom is lying.
Tell me exactly where he lives.
I think Tom is out.
He leaned hard on her, and she broke.
We got married on October 20th.
I'm sure they're wrong.
I want to eat the cottage cheese.
Tom shouldn't know where Mary lives.
Do you like science fiction films?
They speak French.
It's better if you tell the truth.
Open the window!
She eats these snails.
Tom is the most knowledgeable.
The girl!
Who are you talking to like this?
No one knows what the future holds.
Someone has to do it.
Tom gave the apple to the teacher.
Are you ill?
Tom seems strong.
Everyone was happy that Tom was caught.
Did you learn to cook or something?
The fruit of the vine is a pear.
I wonder where they are.
I was angry.
If I were in such good health, I would do that.
Tom doesn't live in Australia.
You're at home.
Hurry, or you'll miss the train.
I met a man who knew Tom.
Look closely.
I like pop music.
No one said that.
They all smiled.
Yes, this guy is a liar.
Do you go to school by train?
Why do people lie?
One day I'll buy the same machine as my grandfather.
Do you think we will win?
Try again.
There is no one inside.
I wish him a good night.
Tom will stay here.
I think his opinion is valid.
Just look at my new car.
Stop your fooling!
This table is taken.
Water, please.
This will make you stronger.
Sami is quick to respond on Facebook.
Someone broke this plate.
She doesn't study music.
I don't know where he is.
I got caught in the rain.
I know.
What paper do you want?
You are dreaming.
Does Tom work in Australia?
You are ready.
I can't write this right.
Your father is a coward.
Tom sat on the couch next to Mary.
Phrases like "Muslims love Jesus and Moses,... or crucified" are obviously a blur with eyes between where the confusion of these and the strong one is going to increase the tension, the tension that is going to increase in the Orthodox and the Gentiles. It was only when I saw their Trumps are confused between the robes and the crowns that I realized: that's why they agree, if our "drama", if the simplest of things. The ideology has only been a part of USEKCEM for those who have returned to the rule of law and those who have rejected the political and political ideology of Kamasutra.
Where is your grandmother?
My sister is a very beautiful girl.
Are you Anna?
Please find him.
Stay here and wait until Tom comes.
Have you seen your table?
Are you Hungarian?
Look, this child is going to shut up.
My kitchen is here.
The desk is full of books.
Someone just sent for me.
Someone is waiting for you.
Tom ran.
Tom came to visit Mary.
Who was speaking?
I don't have any money left in my car.
The animals were terrified by the noise.
Tom is a workaholic.
You are blinded by love.
Everyone knows her.
Please help me open this door.
Can you get me a wallet?
Get your hands off me.
You expect too much from him.
It might not have been appropriate for me to ask Tom that question.
Stop whining.
You are building.
Are you expecting someone?
This girl is a witch.
Stop fighting.
Get in there!
Hurry up.
This happened on October 20th.
How old are you?
You're a great writer.
I love my brothers and sisters.
Don't use this train in front of the water.
I hope she'll always have fun like this.
It is very difficult to find out what this is.
Stay with us.
Tom abandoned them.
I hope it will always be like this.
Get your feet out of here!
I want you to read this letter.
She is a witch.
Tom is shy.
You heard him, didn't you?
You are dead.
I know that Tom is a student.
We bought a bottle of water.
In your study!
Something has to be done.
Leave it all behind.
I can teach you how to read.
He is one of my father's students.
I'm very hungry.
You should apologize.
Sami had a bad day.
Sami noticed Layla's voice had changed immediately.
Are you eating properly?
Did you greet me?
We are colorful.
Tom is going to clean everything up.
We forgot about it.
Tom is going to Niems tomorrow.
Mary made her children Halloween costumes.
How long are you staying in Boston?
Why does the Qur'an say that non-Muslims should die?
You are the love of my life.
I hate him too.
Tom sat next to his daughter.
Take everything that is there.
You see, these names I gave are from the farms in the village of Isarij.
They are all crying.
I don't want to live with you.
Tom seemed to be looking at me.
Please bring us two cups of coffee.
They sent me a message.
Don't you think you speak French better than me?
The dog knows how to walk.
Let him do it.
Tom likes to read.
I told Tom where I wanted to go.
Tom said he didn't want Mary to win.
Tom was looking for Mary.
They're gone.
She writes poems.
Stop crying!

Close the window!
Why didn't you catch him before our show?
Have you read everything?
This is a joke!

Find the cat.
Have you had tea?
Really? I know.
Leave the car.
What else can you do?
It is not easy because this project requires a lot of money.
You're blowing my mind!

He is slow in walking.
Do you think I'm pretty?
I laughed.
When do you want to eat?
I love you very much.
My back hurts a little.
Where is your God now?
Show me your shoes!
Sami didn't know what was going on there.
I am ready.
I think I can trust you.
Take care of yourselves.
Adultery is forbidden in many religions.
Please forget this matter.
Go and find someone who can help.
I don't think I would do that.
Help us out.
Speak wisely.
Please read it to him on the phone.
Are you really going to eat all this?
You're crazy to keep working in a place like this.
Please be reasonable.
What?
Kabyle is your light.
I don't think Tom did it.
Your older sister will take care of you.
They are all hungry.
What happened to our request?
I love you just the way you are.
Take care of yourselves.

Take him!
He won!
I think I can trust you.
I want to eat now.
If I knew it, I would tell you.
See you later, Sayoko.
Are you sure that the person you saw was Tom?
Do what you can.
I have nothing to say.
They're making fun of you.

Champagne, please.
Who is it?
She laughed.

I feel bad here.
Let me go.
Here's the car.
Can I go home now?
When are we going to do it?
I think Tom saw it.
I saw someone greet Tom.
Can't we talk about it in the morning?
Look at her.
I feel sorry for Tom.
I'm not tired right now, I'm writing a book.
God will protect you.
I was born to love you.
Be courageous.
Come early.
I know you.
I was tired to death.
She's not ready to see him.
I'm sticking your tongue out.
I want her.
You cleaned your room.
He speaks a dozen languages.
No one hates you.

Get the money!
I want someone to help me do that.

You are gone.
Do you think it will last a while?
What book are you reading?
You are very beautiful!
Can we meet later?
Tom went to help Mary.

Please don't cry.
Tom gave Mary a gift.
Have you ever added an article to Wikipedia?
Are you eating here or are you taking it with you?
We believe you.
Tom works at home.
My hands are sore.
Why are you yelling at Tom?
Have you read this?

Why are you here so far?
The price is a poison.
Are you going to have dinner at home today?
Sami studied Arabic in Cairo.
Have courage!
They want to become rich.
Someone is calling for you.
Don't let anyone jump into the fire.
Have you read the book "Moby Dick"?
Who is calling, please?
Stop crying.
Are you afraid?
Have you read this book yet?
That's why Tom didn't do that.
Are you foreigners?
Tom said he wanted to do that, but he didn't.
I was speechless.
It's a shame that we have Tom doing our laundry.

Tom is a stone.
Food is a bargain with you.
I will do my best not to spoil your celebrations.
When did Tom leave?
That is a good question.
"Do you want to be a millionaire?" "Who's against it?"
I do this every day.
We have to do something.
I am Dutch.
Sami came home during lunch break.
You are so cute!
How did we get to this point?
History has shown that the feet are cleaned, although it is never easy.
Slowly.
Tom never talked about you.
I really like playing golf.
Tom will be thirty next October.
Why do people lie?
I didn't know Tom had a lot of friends.
You are idiots!
The bear loves the one who strangles it.
Are you new?

Tom will eat later.
You should be careful.

Give it to someone who needs it.
It's a great show, isn't it, Tom?
How are you?
We have to do something.
She is English.
You are our prisoner.
It is raining.
Tom can't sleep without light.
You should come home.
I need to talk to someone.
Now is the time!
Don't talk to Tom.
By your strength.
Let me know if anything changes.
Please go ahead with the tour.
Tom and I think alike.
What do they want from them?
Tom is Mary's husband.
Tom said he would leave the door open.
Are you there?
You'll find her car registration in her room.
I was told not to do that.
Tom is a good teacher.
Tom will let Mary do that.
I haven't seen Tom since the Halloween party.
People are afraid of war.
They want to come back.
I love you very much.
Are you talking?

The soldiers are dead.
Tell them.
Take care of yourself.

I want to try something else.
Have you read it all?
Please don't die.
Someone has learned.
You have betrayed your country.
Tom showed Mary something.
Look carefully. I'll show you how to do it.
I haven't been to Boston since October.
Tom broke his wrist.
I bought you something to eat.
We can take the test now.
Go and find Tom.
There is no doubt!

Do you think I should do that?

You are Americans.
The police officer shot Tom.
This is you.
You are my eyebrow.
Release the animals from their cages.
I'll get it for you.
I'm sorry for your loss.
I know Tom doesn't want to get involved.
You're throwing me out!
She went to Boston.
Someone is watching us.
He refused, he didn't want to.
Tom didn't know I was hungry.
Tom will be third on October 20.
I like the candy.
I don't think so.
Welcome to the house.
You are a boy.
Who invited you to the wedding?
Where did you forget your umbrella?
What do you think of his new novel?
What a handsome young man!
I don't think I should speak like a native speaker. I just want to be able to speak freely.
Yes, two.
You should read this.
Oh my God, no one sees me like this.
I'm craving the darkness.
I can teach you how to sing.
My father used to be a fighter.
Tom hates Mary.
I'm not your servant!
How does a weakling like you eat so much?
Have you become a monk?
Thank you for your listening.
Just sell my new car.
Where am I?
They are architects.
What paper do you want?
That's where you're wrong.
October is still three months away.
I hope it will always be like this.
Write more.
Tom started to cry.
Stay a while.
You are obviously wrong.
Many houses caught fire.
Why don't they say anything?
Tom stayed with someone.
I'm afraid we won't get there early.
My mother's father is my maternal grandfather.
No one knows.
You're always together.
There is nothing there.
Keep running!
I hope you've learned from your mistakes.
You should write a novel.
Someone called you.
I prefer to sleep at night.
This is Nina, your niece.
Do you play sports?
You are here.
Your word is meaningless.
Are you rich?
Do not forget us!
Are you finished?
We finished it.
Above all, be honest and mature.
This is your slave, isn't it?
I'm afraid to fail.
Someone has to go first.
Sami jumped in Layla's car.
I hope you'll listen to me.
Welcome to the world.
He has a Facebook account.
I bought it.
They don't need anything.
Have a drink.
Tom is angry.
Only a dozen of the stones were burned.
Tom never gave a hat to anyone.
Everyone is talking.
Tom knows you're lying.
What else?
You've been with them, haven't you?
What can I say!
I'll get the lantern in October.
You are a whore.
With your own strength!
Tom didn't see that I was here.
"The catastrophe has not yet arrived", said Titus Livus.
You are all very poor.
You were praying.
It's obvious!
I know you're right.
I'll call you before I go.
I can't go swimming with you today.
She drank a lot of water.
Close your book.
When someone insults you, don't bother him.
Why are you crying?
She is reading.
Tom likes Mary.
He usually gets up early.
Her hair grew.
Look at her.
Tom shot and killed Mary.
You know the way.
What's wrong with me going to Boston?
Write in Spanish.
You should ask someone else.
He was not a geek.
It's too heavy for me to lift.
Please, do not be shy.
The flowers are beautiful!
How come you don't know?
Kabyle culture has always lived in the past even during the Turkish colonization of North Africa.
It seems like we should do that.
Listen to me, children!
Stop the dog.
They have a problem.
Apples are peeled before being eaten.
Tom said he needed to learn French.
Tom is swimming.
They must be asleep.
We are expecting good news at home.
Get your head out of the water!
I breathed something out and it burned.
Stop it!
I want to show you some of the texts translated for the press.
I don't know him.
Tell him I love you.
Did you hear what they said?
I hope no one saw you.
Mine is better than yours.
I said what I had in my heart.
I like the lime sauce.
Get her in!
I'm waiting for Boston on October 20.
I'll buy it for you.
Tom was robbed.
Keep running!
Someone will do it.
Go and get cleaned up.
This rate is reduced by three quarters of a second a day.
Tom is confused.
Make it a small one.
How are you?
Are you cheating on me?
Her fingers are red.
Tom was surprised that Mary didn't do that.
Are you scared?
Tom is angry.
I left my keys in the car!
The door is open.
Do you like my friend?
No one is listening.
I hurt my wrist.
Why doesn't Tom want you here?
The police believe that Tom was stabbed before he cut his throat.
Tom didn't know what Mary was thinking.
No one remembers.
What is your father's nationality?
Nonbelief is a trait. It's a trait that believers choose.
I won't let you go.
As soon as I got home, I went to bed.
These pictures are beautiful.
Can you speak French?
Tom hopes to be in Boston by the end of October.
What are you doing?
Help me with this.
Tom forgot Mary's phone number.
Am I making you happy?
I speak French better than Tom.
Sami follows me on Snapchat.
I saw someone greeting Tom.
Tom sent for me.
He is one of the greatest poets in Japan.
She lied.
Are you cold?
Don't give up without a fight.
Tom is the son of a famous teacher in Boston.
Can we say yes?
I bought some fresh bread.
It's not the crazy ones who are afraid.
Why this shortfall?
You are our prison.
Are you busy right now?
She forgot it.
We're not ready right now.
Where did you get this piece of your hair?
Do you want me to call him?
I want you to stay in Australia, you fool.
I hope to see you in October.
I didn't think Tom needed our help.
Tom doesn't know that I know.
He looks good.
Your father is a coward.
Tom was the last to see Mary alive.
Tom lay down on the table.
Let her go.
That's right.
I missed you so much!
Tom knocked on the door again.
Are you gay?
Tom is going to change soon.
Tom asked for someone to serve him food.
He likes to read books.
He went to visit her when she was living in London.
Someone has gone.
The cat is back.
How are things in Australia?
Tom likes to talk about art.
I need you to do something.
Sami never talked about Layla.
Let me look at what you wrote.
Tom saw her, too.
Keep it warm.
Tom is unmarried.
He was looking for his pen.
They understand.
Bishops will leave after October 20.
I'm going to wait to have a baby.
I can't see well.
Just shut up.
How are you?
I don't have any money in my pocket.
Space stations are a great disgrace to humanity.
They all left.
You made me.
I hope no one saw you come here.
Oh my God, no one saw you come here.
Why didn't we let you do that?
I only have one question.
We don't use a gun as often as we should.
I hope to play guitar.
Hold your breath!
Come with me.
Like Tom and Mary, they don't know how to speak French.
Tom gave Mary a drink.
Read it.
Say hello to him.
How I lied to you!
Someone will pay.
I like watching westerns.
Tom hates Mary.
Please be quiet.
They are lovely.
Tom has a lot of good ideas.
She refused.
I don't have many friends in Boston.
We have nothing to eat.
Are you ready to go?
Sami went into the store.
Laugh at her, please!
I want to travel abroad.
Where do you live now?
Tom said he could come back on October 20th.
Be smart about it.
Call him if you have any questions.
I'll leave now if it's all right.
We've missed you all.
She can go.
What paper do you need?
Follow Tom!
God forbid anyone sees you come here.
Will your father be having dinner with you tonight?
I left Australia on October 20th.
She loves him.
I'm going out to get something to eat.
The bear.
The nose mask showed me that Tom was doing well.
He is showing his father his room.
We need to pass laws against discrimination in the workplace, in society, in education and in social justice. This is what our society and our institutions demand.
When will you come to see me?
The coronavirus is transmitted by mosquitoes.
Just tell her what she wants.
This is easy.
I'll go with you.
Have you lost your mind?
Tom was passing in front of Mary.
Just do what I did!
You are wrong.
Tom built a house that was too small.
Someone stole my money.
Your writing is cool.
I lied when I said I didn't love Tom.
No one answered.
I start work on the first of July.
There is much we can do to help these families.
I do not understand anything.
Tom will be angry with Mary.
Tom pulled out the car.
Mary's sentences are easy to translate.
They're making fun of you.
You speak my language.
I'm happy here.
When Tom and I went to Boston, we visited Mary.
When you have time, read this book.
I'll see him tomorrow.
Try to answer me in words sooner.
Tom is lucky.
What can I say!
Tom asked Mary.
It's a long way.
Try to wash it.
Are you ready?
Someone is following us.
You remind me of someone.
Put your bags back.
We want to get to know you.
Do they all like music?
I was drowsy.
Let the animals out of their cages.
Hurry up and get your clothes off.
So what do you want?
He got up.
Tom and I despise Mary.
It was good!
They all stayed.
Wait for something!
Is she not well?
I found your number.
Hello, what's your name?
Tom and Mary knew they had to do that.
The police are looking for me.
We are so lucky!
Are you a foreigner?
There was a lot of people waiting.
Tom said goodbye to Mary at the meeting.
Follow your dreams.
I'll show you how it's done.
Say goodbye to your friends.
Perhaps not.
Tom is upset.
Tom heard that Mary was following him.
It's too late.
She came after Tom.
Read this book.
Tom said he didn't intend to get hurt.
They're still after us.
What time will you be home?
Has anyone been hurt?
I hope no one saw you come here.
Tom was stunned.
This party is not for you.
You're like the guy who built a house with bricks and mortar.
Everyone knows.
No one wants to be a coward.
I brought you some food.
Tom brought us to sing.
Would you please let us go now?
The river is very deep.
Read this book.
I can't turn it off.
I like it very much.
I heard what happened.
Sami and Layla haven't lived together for six years.
Have you become a fool?
She is fascinated by Algerian culture.
I'm going on a diet.
This is my phone.
I can stay in Boston until October.
Do you care what people think about us?
Muhend Belqasem works a Facebook account every Thursday.
Sami is a villain.
If you want to leave, leave now!
We've been looking for you everywhere.
I think it's a beautiful place.
Tom said he's not talking to you alone.
You are part of the problem.
Have we met before?
She speaks ten languages.
If you eat it, you will die.
It's a race against time.
That's what we have.
I think I understand.
It's a little hot today.
She's Tom's sister, right?
Tom is bored.
Tom always thinks about Mary.
Tom didn't cheat on you.
What beautiful dreams!
Tom said he never drove a truck.
Did anyone see anything?
I know Tom is a billionaire.
She smiled.
This will warm you up.
I hope it was a dream.
You are blinded by love.
You're screwing me!
Who is complaining?
Are you Julius?
Do you have any other options?
Tom wasn't like that.
You'll find someone.
Stop crying.
It is Kabyle.
He didn't look at it.
Are you people?
All my problems are over.
God forbid you come here.
Alice smiled.
Honestly, I'm not a man and a woman.
Please lock the door.
Save the life!
I don't want to go alone.
He said to the stone, "I will fall". The stone replied, "What shall I say?"
God will make you like camels: one will pass the other.
Someone has to do it.
My son became a man.
Do you mind if I ask a question that isn't relevant?
Here is my catch.
Tom saw it.
Are you educated?
I was lost.
He recently sent me a funny poem he wrote about his mother's death.
Shut your faces!
They came.
Tom is a better singer than Mary.
Did you learn to cook or something?
Tom loves to play football.
Sami still has his guitar.
They all love you.
Tom and I can't be right.
Where is your place?
Get out of here!
They were all happy.
If you translate from your second language into your mother tongue rather than using another language, you will feel more likely to avoid errors.
Did you do all this?
Let them help you.
Are you helping him?
Neither of them asked for help, as did Tom or Mary.
There is no happiness where there is no democracy.
He who kills the poor, kills the poor.
Tom and Mary are the same size.
Has anyone died?
No one cared.
Tom turned her down.
Are you lying?
I don't think it will rain tomorrow.
I'm doing the right thing.
Sami read Layla's message.
I want you to get up.
You refused to pay.
Tom continued to read.
Are you kidding me?
Tom liked Mary.
You should do this job.
I think you did it without your will.
She reads English.
Show me your name.
Are you crazy?
They all clapped.
Tom and Mary look like John and Alice.
They are free.
You should talk to Tom.
Who ran away?
Tom's birthday is October 20th.
Forget about it.
A small leaf makes a big pile.
Tom was surprised.
I saw a dog.
I'm very scared.
Help me out here.
The festival will start in October.
Tell me again who will help us.
I can't just leave you here.
Sami doesn't know who this woman is.
What do they call this fruit?
Please take me home.
I hope no one saw you do it.
I like the way you treat me.
Have you finished your work?
What language is that?
You are a bad student.
Is that art?
You'll find someone left it here.
Who are they?
Are you ashamed?
Tom has a lot of good ideas.
Hurry up!
Tom and I followed Mary.
Don't be a fool. It's easy.
Why does Tom need a knife?
Tom is asleep.
Come to us!
If you don't want to read, stop.
Are you crazy?
I bought a bag of peanuts.
We cut through there.
We're going to dance together.
Please.
Someone has to do something.
They fell.
Are you finished?
Is this dog a friend of yours?
Mary knows we believe her.
Change your clothes!
We wanted to hear.
Aren't you happy that she's rich?
Look around. What do you see?
Say what you want, I won't believe you.
Your philosophy of life is different from mine.
Sami was out that night.
Eat this.
They all joke.
Tom thought no one had seen him.
What do you feed your dog?
I'm not your love.
Sami went to the game meeting.
Tom is planning to go to Boston in October.
The moon is still shining.
Thank you for your call.
I saw one.
Thank you for inviting us to dinner.
Tom waited his turn.
Tom said he had stopped smoking altogether.
You're throwing me out!
Kurt Cobain died on April 5, 1994 in Seattle.
I will be back in October.
I have a daughter.
Tom felt uncomfortable.
A regiment visited the army.
She remembers well.
I'll pay by check.
The war is over.
Can you give Tom a drink?
Tom bought this for us.
I don't want to go to the party.
I like to read.
Tom admitted he was abusing Mary.
Give me a pound of tomatoes, please.
Gather your strength.
Sami felt something touch his chest.
Ken is a fool.
You should eat something.
Are we finished?
Take me there.
Why did you write this book?
Tom wants Mary.
Stop reading!
There is no one inside.
Say goodbye to him.
You can't stop us.
My grandfather, who still lives in the old mansion, always complained about how the girls are dressed now.
This is for you.
Don't forget to tell Tom to do that today.
He is crazy!
Did you know that Zindi Zidan is a Kabyle?
Please feed the dog every day.
I have to run after Tom.
You are a hero to me.
Just let me in.
Are you Canadian?
You're making fun of me.
I still have Tom.
The exhibition will run until October 20.
Please.
What you said is true.
I have to go to Australia next week.
Is there anyone you want to read to?
He is crazy!
I could kill you.
Are you making him a sandwich?
Tom told me that he loves you very much.
Clean up everything.
Tea with lime, please.
I feel like I'm ready.
Release the animals from the cage.
They said Tom would be back.
It's late when you call me.
Shut up!
Sami and Layla were kissing.
You look Japanese.
Go to school!
I did not.
Sami taught Layla how to play the guitar.
He's messing with your minds.
I made you coffee.
They yelled at Tom several times.
Tom showed Mary something.
She is very shy.
That's what happens.
Mary told me she was lucky.
Does Tom know much about you?
You're annoying me!
There is no problem at all.
You are joking.
We have to do it again.
Someone knows something.
I regretted kissing Tom.
You are a whisperer.
My new car is just fine.
I was surprised.
You have a fever.
We remember.
Who won?
Read this!
Tom will miss.
I don't know if I have time.
Is that the note you found that Tom owned?
Sami published his Memoirs.
She understood it.
Tom said he wanted you to learn French.
There's someone in the house.
Tom is involved.
Show them off.
Listen to all of you!
Have a good time.
You are fools.
Just follow him.
Tom looked me straight in the eye.
She might come.
I need someone to help me.
What does Tom need me for?
You're a whore!
Are you really going to send me a Japanese girl?
Sami sees Layla once a year.
Come to us!
You don't need to do that at all.
Tom is being bullied.
So, what's his opinion?
He is dead!
Say goodbye to your friends.
The blades are up to the chest.
I did that without anyone's help.
Stop beating my head off.
Tom wasn't sure he'd do that.
Sami doesn't need that.
I can go to your house tomorrow.
I'm not going swimming today.
Your word is meaningless.
Tom seems happy.
I was born in this hospital.
Are you a Ukrainian?
I need you to do something.
Tell me the truth.
Tom has been in Boston since last October.
You have a lot of cavities in your teeth.
Give it to someone who wants it.
Do you have many friends who don't eat meat?
Do you have time to eat?
They are dancing for everyone.
Tom asked us to be quiet.
She died of a stroke.
Don't tell me anything I don't know.
Who signed it?
Marie has to start.
It is true.
Let go of me!
You are not making mistakes.
Bees are making a killing.
I know.
Cut it out!
Are you reading?
You are human.
I saved my life.
They are all waiting.
You are not here to be a fool.
The trees are dry.
Call them.
Is Tom joking?
Meet me there.
Someone must be stopping us.
Someone is stalking Tom.
Stop yelling.
Tell him that.
I laughed.
Tom was working with Mary.
Tom is blowing a whistle.
She was the only one who got drunk at the party.
Do you know me? - No, I don't think so.
Tom can understand Mary.
Greetings to everyone.
God is afraid!
I hope Tom leaves me alone.
Your meat is rotten, my friend.
Do you know how this works?
Follow your sister's footsteps.
I'm worried about him.
I took them all out.
Tom and Mary are as different as black and white.
You never taught Tom how to read or write.
This will make you stronger.
It's your father Tom.
He's not happy about it.
Why don't you want to go to Tom's house?
You look good tonight.
Tom is having lunch right now.
Tom died in October.
The work is going fast.
Tom was right about Mary.
We all hated him.
They bought a bottle of water.
You were expected to do it yesterday.
Is this love?
Is there anything you don't like to eat?
Someone fixed my car.
I did not read.
Tom will fight for us.
The Lebanese journalist and her friends wrote a book.
Tom already planned to leave early.
You did it now.
Tom left the country on October 20.
How do I get British farmers?
She needs to rest.
You already paid.
Tom said it's hard to do.
I've already written in Kabyle on Tatoeba; it's been a long time.
Who were you expecting to win?
Tom likes to eat.
The sport is popular among Japanese teachers.
He said to the stone, "I will fall". The stone replied, "What shall I say?"
I'll show you how it's done.
You knew Tom was going to do that, didn't you?
You are an idiot.
There is water for two days.
Do you have cats?
Tom wanted to help Mary.
Tom is a very shy boy.
Haven't you read this book?
You can't speak French, can you?
You are wrong.
She will stay with him.
When is the next flight to Boston?
I heard you don't eat meat.
I listened to him.
Tom closed his blog in October.
Did you eat all this quickly?
You are really a fool.
Are you Americans?
Meet me the one who is different.
I thought you couldn't read.
Your writing is very good.
Tom almost died.
The chicken is crying, the chicken is bitten by its rooster.
Stop them!
Tom only slept a few hours.
Why are you watching Tom?
Shout louder.
I didn't think Tom would be so tired.
Come whenever you want.
You can use my description.
Tom still wants to go out with you.
Read this now.
Tom found it.
Did you swim yesterday?
Start there!
When was the last time you went to Boston?
Tom told her that he wrote the poem two years ago.
He's been standing here for a while.
I'm afraid of you.
Have you read this?
I laughed.
You are afraid.
You can go home now.
You are a dog.
Some children swim in the river.
How many sandwiches are left?
Thank you all.
Tom is alone.
Being here is a big help to me.
One went to a friend's house; when he came back, he found the girl. Her mother smiled and said, "Are they real?" He replied, "No, I just ate the chicken, I said yes!" "The chicken, then... Your father will be happy, at least!"
Someone is eating.
Everything that a person does, whether it is literature, music, dance, art or anything else, always comes out as a reflection of himself.
How are you?
I like to run.
Where is your grandmother?
Why don't you pay attention to what the teacher says?
How do you want your eggs?
Tom said he wanted to be buried in Australia.
There's a piano in the room.
I used to sneak around in the snow when I was little.
Tom and I are now married.
Someone stole my food.
You are drunk.
What are you looking for, man?
He is.
What's your room number?
I told the truth.
Do you have any friends?
Tom doesn't love me anymore.
Tom is better at singing than Mary.
I assume you like your work.
These books of poetry are not mine.
I made you coffee.
Tom was fired in October.
Hamed is full of anxiety.
Clean your room.
Why don't you go and see Tom?
Tom told me he loved me.
Your philosophy of life is different from mine.
I'm a good friend of Tom's father.
This is bothering you, isn't it?
Has there been any change?
The game is too late.
It has been snowing since morning.
Freedom comes with forgiveness.
Richard Dawkins is a famous philosopher.
Where is your God now?
Are you crazy or not?
I wrote you a note.
They all danced.
Have you checked it out?
This is their last film.
You are a little drunk.
Are you hungry?
Tom didn't know how to explain it exactly.
Can I go home now?
You are lying.
You're not going to get any fun.
Tom called to say he wouldn't come.
So poetry is medicine.
Say it again.
Sami started with this man.
Go on with it!
What do you like best, meat or fish?
Get out of here.
I brought you lunch today.
Tom won't be back until October.
Can you be my door?
Someone is approaching the door.
Tom wanted to forget Mary.
Tom ran to the shed to see what was there.
You're about to find out what this is!
You're not as hurt as you really are.
He can do that.
They sing.
I'm afraid it's going to rain this afternoon.
She never keeps her word.
The computer is broken.
If you have any problems, call me.
They are wrong.
Are you home?
I want to look rich.
You're blowing my mind!
I missed you so much!
We are expecting guests this evening.
We both hated her.
Don't forget the last one.
I speak French.
I don't tell anyone, they're not afraid.
Someone stole my passport.
Are you coming to Montreal this weekend?
Why?
I'll come and help you.
You're foolish to continue working in a place like this.
It is a piece of cake.
Two for one.
Tom was heartbroken by a gas stove.
It seemed like Tom was looking at me with his eyes.
This matter does not concern me.
The snow made a splash in the corner.
They kissed her.
It's getting too hot!
I have forgotten.
Someone should stop you.
Tom was afraid of Mary.
Sami is taking care of my things.
You should talk to Tom.
Write it in French.
Something has happened.
You stay.
Speak thoughtfully.
Tom doesn't like to wait until he's ready to do something.
I talked to Tom.
Tom was murdered.
Remember that!
Please don't die.
Tom will be third on October 20.
Sami is a very good person.
Are you really cheering me on now?
Breathe in and out!
You didn't kill the children.
I think Tom is brave.
You have a very beautiful smile.
Whose book is this?
I'm pretty sure that Tom loves Mary.
Call him.
This car is new.
Your day has come!
They're making fun of you.
Look ahead of you.
What happened then?
She stopped speaking.
I want you to go with Tom.
The child with the disease was closely monitored by doctors.
What is he saying?
Say what you want, I won't believe you.
There is no life without water.
You are so beautiful.
Did you win?
We like to learn music.
Get out of here!
My father doesn't know her.
People speak French here.
Bring the guard.
Tom hopes to be back by the end of October.
Can you leave the door open?
You are a fool!
Watch your step.
Tom is a smart guy, isn't he?
You are dancing.
Someone told Tom something.
I hope no one saw you come here.
He speaks English well.
Tom is completely out of his mind.
You are stupid.
Did you pray?
Thank you for your gift.
Is it wine?
You have it.
We have to think about the worst that can happen.
Are you rich?
Tom was asleep.
I went to school with him.
I want you to work with them.
Explain it to her.
Get off of me!
Tom and Mary went to him.
He is a good writer.
Where is your aunt?
Tom asked for a large plate.
She is blind.
I closed my eyes.
There is no one inside.
I feel lonely lately.
I wish you a light and flowers with chemistry.
I feel bad for him.
I'm going to assume that's not true.
Stay with me.
Which team do you like best?
He was being bullied.
What then?
I will dream of you.
Bring the examples.
Someone might see us.
What are you giving your dog to eat?
Watch what you eat.
We studied English.
I am annoyed.
My computer is broken.
Just take me home.
You'll let me squeal, or I'll say olive!
Look closely!
The sheep laughing in the pasture.
Tom and I both want to go.
Thank you for your concern.
Get out of the way.
Tom said there was no one there.
She got up.
He's at home today.
Please read it again.
Do you mind if I ask a question that isn't important?
Tom started to talk.
Can you wait a minute, please?
Let me remind you of something.
I never tried to do that again.
Can you help me?
How long can you wait?
I'm going to tell you a secret.
I can teach you how to read.
You're too much of a fool!
Someone has to do something.
Tom is getting ready for the party.
Sami didn't get the last message.
Are you here?
Bring me a ticket if you call me early.
The adults think they're the only ones who are right.
Have you read this?
I'll call you on Monday.
No, I don't know your brother.
I'm not running.
What's going on now?
Is that it?
Are you angry with me?
I'm not going to wash your car.
I was born in Boston.
Dinner is ready.
I released the animals from their cages.
I must know them.
Would you like a drink?
You are all happy.
If you ask me, it's a waste of time.
Tom convinced Mary to do that.
A fighter can lose, but a non-fighter has already lost.
You are Americans.
Someone has been planted here.
Take this off.
You continued fighting.
It is snowing.
Are you going to read today?
You refused to pay.
Did he use it?
I haven't said anything yet.
We were friends.
I wrote you a note.
I'll meet you downstairs.
There's a word.
Someone is following you.
Look ahead of you.
I like reading books.
I'm glad you won.
It's early.
How many do you need?
Look at us!
I like to run.
Tom and I were good friends.
Excuse me. Where are the eggs?
Stay in the house.
Tom comes to Boston every weekend to visit Mary.
Tom made a cake.
Are you ashamed?
Tom put his feet on the ground.
Thank you very much.
You can't go in like that.
How beautiful you are!
Look for me.
I just want to get married.
I like to read.
Write it in French.
Would you do that for me?
I thought it was Tom's call.
Tom lives near the beach, but he can't swim.
I don't know how much it will cost.
Ring another bell.
You better not scream.
My friend doesn't know.
Aren't you from here?
Is there someone you're watching?
Tom is being watched.
Tom turned to Mary.
Please read this book.
We'll wait for you here.
Tom nodded.
Tom didn't understand very well.
I told the truth.
Do you have a dog?
Are you busy?
Are you looking for food?
Stop that!
Tom can't trust Mary.
Someone must have seen you.
We studied.
The matter is resolved!
Everyone blames you.
Answer me with a word.
Tom is taking off his clothes.
We must rescue him immediately.
We will send someone.
You must eat a lot.
I'm trying to find another plan.
How much chocolate did you eat?
How is Tom?
This has to stop.
Tom is sick.
Did someone hit Tom?
Tom is in love with Mary.
What are you all afraid of?
Send me one right now.
Bring food.
Which writer do you like?
The dog is barking.
Are you waiting for Tom?
I wish them a year of peace and happiness.
She stopped talking.
Confess again.
You are lucky.
You can change that if you want.
Stop calling me.
Tom only wants a cup of tea.
Try to calm Tom down.
I beg your pardon!
I missed you so much!
You should just call Jean.
In my opinion, you are wrong.
Stop shouting!
You have to make someone else happy.
Tom hated Mary.
Have you read this?
I am very happy for your company.
I feel sorry for Tom.
I hope nothing happened to him.
Go on your way.
A word like "family" has three syllables.
You were in Boston.
I'll call you tomorrow night.
I have something to give you.
Make two dishes.
He likes to eat fish.
Tom can rest as much as he wants.
Sami was reading a message to Layla.
His body was covered with scales.
I know I can trust you.
Who are you?
Shout at Tom!
Welcome to Canada!
She only walked past a dog once.
They live there.
Someone is talking.
I should be there early.
I'll come and help you.
They're all outside.
You should take this into account.
Keep it warm.
Have you eaten well?
You are immortal.
I know you're here, Tom.
She hides her secrets.
Why are you crying?
It's not hard to do.
Send Tom to me.
What are you going to do?
If it changes, the next wave will be worse.
You have it.
Someone made a mistake.
I didn't use a hammer to tie your foot.
Two beers, please.
Tom gave Mary a cup of coffee.
I'm looking forward to seeing you.
Stop laughing.
I went to buy something to eat.
Tom will also come to the party.
I'm going to my room.
Tom did not return.
Do you remember?
Stop fighting each other.
Tom always wanted to go out with you.
Speak up!
Tom wants Mary.
Tom is a cynic.
Tom shouted.
I haven't seen Tom in three days.
Are you brothers?
I'm out of words.
I don't like you anymore.
You don't spend much money on Tom.
I want to know who's coming with us.
Senior officials met to discuss the situation.
Have you answered?
Tom lived with his parents in Australia.
Pass me the salt, will you?
Where is your aunt?
Someone is waiting for you.
Show me your real face.
It is good.
I was in his room.
Keep fishing.
Tom is asleep.
You'll have my car.
Tom soaked in cold water.
He was a coward, and the bouncers followed him.
What do they call you?
Have you read everything?
Sami is speaking with his hands.
I believed everything they told us.
Tom told us a lot about you.
Tom just kept quiet.
Tom is all mine.
Will you leave me?
Have you brushed your teeth?
I think he's mad.
Do you want eggs?
Please do not forget to say hello to your family.
Tom didn't leave Mary.
Can I see what it is, please?
Do you like dogs?
Don't go near that place.
The ground was covered with blood.
I know I can trust you.
He is a Kabyle.
Tom can't go today.
Where are we going to eat?
Your day will come.
They made Mr. White the manager.
You're too tall for him.
You are going fast.
They smiled.
Someone has to do something.
What is your philosophy?
Take off your coat. It's cold outside.
Who's running my computer?
Be honest with yourself.
I really like you.
Go ahead and try.
I don't want to leave you here alone.
It is easier for a man to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God".
Tom didn't go to the same school as Mary.
Tom had no choice but to sit.
Brush your teeth before you go to bed!
Help me out!
Please take it.
Tom is reluctant to go alone.
I'm starting a new life.
The study took place on 20 October 2013.
Aren't you hungry?
I think he's a beautiful man.
I need to know something.
Have you become a fool?
Tom reads carefully.
You rented me your car for free.
Did they get fired?
She sat there in silence.
Someone has to do it.
Are you Swedes?
I live in Australia.
I think Tom is a jerk.
You are joking.
Can you make it easier?
I've been in Boston for three months.
Don't talk about it.
I just need someone to help me.
The first night was stupid.
The car stopped.
Choose carefully.
Tom was released from prison in October.
I know that.
I understand your reason.
Why are you crying?
We want to know you.
You should eat.
The birds and the bees are coming.
They were all crying.
Have you read it yet?
Do you want me to come with you?
I'll never see him again.
Is Tom from Australia?
Have you ever ridden a bicycle to school?
Tom seems to be up to something.
Drop the hat!
Do not cry.
Is he a Japanese boy?
This seminar is good.
When will you consider me your friend?
Can anyone help me?
What do you want from Tom?
Please call him by phone.
Who is she with?
How old were you when you moved to Boston?
I hope no one saw you come here.
What did Tom hate for?
Are you feeling well?
Let's eat now.
I didn't know I loved you.
Some luck!
We went on the 20th of October.
I thought you'd recognize Tom.
Tell him that.
You were not on time.
Please don't be angry with me.
I did that.
Tom and the other cats prayed for rain.
They all love you.
Tom is not our son.
He found you awake.
Someone must stop you.
It is the 20th of October.
Tom was the one who told me a story.
Are you ready?
Put paper in the trash.
I'm sure your father is proud of you.
Tom told me he saw someone give Mary a kiss.
Stop crying!
I was a little unlucky.
You are taller than me.
My mother made me a new dress.
Are you lucky?
I lost my mind.
They know the truth.
I hope you're happy.
I read ten books this month.
I know I'm forgetting something.
We built it.
Tom knocked.
Do you smell anything?
She is very well-dressed.
They were surprised.
Did Moses really hear God speak?
You are dead.
Nobody is helping us.
Go now.
Eat your fill.
Hold your head!
Clean this up.
Tom is smarter than everyone else.
We got married in October.
Tom called me.
You should eat.
Tom is not dead.
Someone was killed.
His idea is better than yours.
Does he have a sister?
Don't come near.
Watch your ears.
Is it cold outside?
Please help.
You seem to like this.
I've been thinking about this all day.
He is clever.
Have you returned to Tibet?
Shut up, shut up, open your mouth!
She is walking.
I haven't studied French in over fifteen years.
You shouldn't call at this hour.
Do you live here?
Do you know what you did?
I believe you.
Close your book.
Why don't you sit down? The seat is empty.
They look very similar to me.
Stop the student!
This place is full of people.
Have you eaten your pizza?
Go with wisdom.
My life is in your hands.
The election will begin on October 20.
Do you still eat meat?
Just talk to them.
They all speak French.
I miss you so much.
Tom tried to convince Mary.
Tom told me you weren't good.
I am your father.
What are these people doing?
If you had listened to me, this wouldn't have happened.
Give me some shoes.
What's new?
Are you tired?
Look at this.
Cut it out!
So why are you here?
Tom is almost drowned.
Nobody knows what tomorrow will bring.
I couldn't do this without your help.
I like life.
Do you see anyone here?
What is the plan?
There were ghosts.
You told the dog to stay, didn't you?
Reading and writing in Kabyle became a norm for us.
You are surprised.
The time is very difficult.
You seem confused.
Like Tom and Mary, they don't speak French well.
I'm going to order some more cookies.
Someone is crying.
They all laughed.
I'd like a red wine, please.
He's got a lot of juice in him.
Tom can't eat for himself.
Tom needed our help.
I was on my bike.
I sell computers.
The accents of languages can vary greatly.
I'm going to Boston with Tom and Mary.
I don't like Tom about this.
They all begged.
Do you need any help, my friend?
She had three brothers.
They are very different.
I'm not your friend.
Tom can show Mary.
Tom is a gardener.
Tom said he wanted to know French.
You can get your money back if you want.
They left early.
Keep listening to me!
Tom was being chased by Mary.
Mary was pregnant.
Are you at home tonight?
Tell me when you'll call me.
I love you as you are.
Excuse me, who are you?
Have you become mad?
Someone could get hurt.
None of these books are useful.
Why are you crying?
Someone is waiting for you.
Tom is better at playing the violin than Mary.
Tom is pretending to be well.
He brought them back.
He is tired.
You are beautiful.
Do you think I will live?
Tom took off his shirt.
It's not the same as it used to be.
You can eat as much as you want today.
Will they come again?
We played drama.
Look behind you.
I'm here for you.
I don't want to hurt you. I want to help you.
Sami has lunch break.
Do you think anyone can see me?
I have nothing to say.
Tom has been joking on the phone for an hour.
You are beautiful.
Tom was angry while he was picking up the pieces.
I hated Tom.
No one is looking.
Tom told me not to go there alone.
What do you want to do?
Come and see me.
You should read this.
Are you gay?
Sami was singing.
Tom and Mary are farmers.
Please read it.
I don't like to eat where people smoke.
I didn't think Tom needed help.
Write to me!
You killed me.
He is running.
Have you spoken to your wife?
Why is he so afraid?
I'm still in Australia, but I'm going home tomorrow.
Tom opened a beer bottle.
I like Australia.
Give it to him.
I'm going to leave.
I burned Tom.
They stopped.
You are alone.
The children are going back to school tomorrow.
He didn't go in or out.
Tom died on October 20, 2013.
Is there anyone there?
We have nothing to be ashamed of.
Someone is staring at Tom.
Tom and Mary separated last week.
You'd better cut your hair.
Who do you think stole your car?
I'm tired of this shit.
I like to read books.
You're a whore!
Please call if you have any questions.
You are idiots!
I often stay inside the bar.
You are a pain.
I called.
Each for himself.
You are fools!
I'm going to Boston in October.
Have you eaten enough?
Stay with me.
His job is better than mine.
The story repeats itself.
Beer will pay for my income.
Bring me a ticket if you're late.
I ate the cookies.
The meat is good for you.
Are you drunk?
Does Tom know much about you?
Are you finished?
Do you think I should do that?
Do you like chicken?
It's a race against time.
I have a fever.
You asked them if they needed one.
Some luck is a long-term success.
I was disappointed in their marriage.
Birds drink water.
He bought us a game.
I didn't think Tom would like Boston.
I didn't know what I was waiting for.
Please answer.
You ran away.
I was surprised to see you.
Don't forget your money.
Did everyone hear that?
Things are falling apart.
Tom doesn't walk much anymore.
Hamed is a musician.
Why are you washing your hands?
I'll take the most expensive ones.
We both killed her.
Tom told Mary that he planned to stay in Boston until October.
Listen to this!
Do you know when the movie "Star Wars" starts?
Sami got lost in the forest.
I did nothing.
Stay where you are.
Do your best.
Find another one.
I understand your reasons.
Sami taught him the work.
They're making fun of you.
Tom became a painter.
Tom is a good writer.
Don't worry about it.
He came back at six.
This is a bee.
We cut the floor.
Tell him tomorrow.
They helped us.
Does Tom care about you much?
I feel like I'm getting old.
Are you teachers?
I'm afraid we have a problem.
Tom and Mary probably do this themselves.
Someone opened the door.
Get up!
I want to go swimming tomorrow.
Tom is dancing.
You don't want Tom to win, do you?
If you don't want to do it, you don't have to!
He's not there.
Bring me some milk, too.
The moon is already shining.
You fools!
Can you please wait a minute?
He solved a problem.
It's your turn!
Take this.
Stop them.
I think you're wrong.
They have a lot of money.
Tell me the truth.
I speak ancient Greek.
You went to school yesterday.
Do you have a home in Australia?
Tom went shopping with Mary.
Tom is a good cook, isn't he?
Why didn't you read to someone else?
Someone stole my suitcase.
Someone is watching you.
Tom sent me a message with a message.
Take this.
I see we're all here.
We won't leave you.
Was everyone being polite?
Tom is there.
I like French.
I walked.
Birds are flying.
Breathe in and out!
Your work is well-done.
Tom called Mary to tell her his grief.
Let the water run.
Sami doesn't like Layla doing that.
Tell me about the Turks in Germany.
Tom started to talk.
I didn't know Tom was dead.
I'm listening to music.
What did you call your dog?
Our dog is black.
Tom is seeing.
Who are you talking to?
I have two Canadian friends.
I want to know who's reading.
That's it!
It was just a joke.
Tom has been in Australia since October.
Can you find him?
I saw a bear.
Tom was worried.
Do you want to try it?
He died on October 20 in Boston.
Stay here.
I thought someone was dead.
I'm going to Boston in October.
I think Tom and Mary are right.
What did you see in Boston?
We're worried about you.
You don't want Tom to win, do you?
Chicken, please.
Someone took my place.
You're all obviously wrong.
Let's look at this more closely.
Tom told us a lot about you.
I don't like to eat meat, so I won't eat it forever.
Have you been to Kyoto before?
Did something happen?
It is wonderful.
I found someone to help me do this.
Just talk to them.
Look behind you.
You are a problem.
We were reading.
Please call him.
Are you drinking?
Tom understands French better than this, but he has a problem with his grammar.
I know the way.
Someone will see us.
Are we finished?
We are!
Are you Ukrainian?
He refused to believe her.
This is Tom's wife.
At school.
They went to Boston on October 20.
Why did you come to me?
So what?
I don't eat much fruit.
You are my friend, Sami.
Don't miss him! His day will come!
Tom has spoken many times.
Are you happy?
He does not give bread to the hungry.
Who's going to pay for this?
I'm here to try something.
I never forgot you.
Are you finished?
I want to marry him, but I haven't made my decision public yet.
I'm sure I can handle it.
You are smiling.
You still don't like Boston, do you?
You are all invited.
Please go.
Do you want to be alone for the rest of your life?
Open your books!
I speak French well.
He is as strong as a horse.
Clean up your room.
Who is against?
My mother died.
I like this one. I'll take it.
Stop complaining!
No one looked.
Turn to the left!
I don't want you to understand.
I hope you're all right.
Don't be afraid of making mistakes.
We hope you will come in large numbers.
Religion has no future.
He speaks French.
Tom is in Australia.
Some people marry just before their wife is married.
Has anyone died?
Do you have any answers?
Have you read this book?
Tom's room isn't very big.
Tom was about to leave Mary.
Stop laughing.
Let me down!
Are you ready?
Yeah, I forgot my keys.
Please stand aside.
Someone is talking.
Someone has already done it.
Jim was very careful not to dance.
Get out of here!
This gift is for you.
Tom danced with Mary.
Let me see what you've written.
Tom may speak French.
They are birds.
I love your son.
Daysha is in love with Akli.
Someone has to stop Tom.
Did you cancel Tom's concert?
Stop crying.
Tom is crazy about Mary.
Are you hot?
Please don't die.
They have a lot of money.
The universe created languages that humans cannot learn all of.
Sami's car doesn't stop here.
How many Canadians work here?
Please talk.
How good!
I can say something.
Hundreds of people eat here every day.
Look behind you.
Do you remember what Tom said?
We are!
Tom seemed worried.
I don't want to leave you.
We met on October 20 last year.
Will you drink?
My father and grandfather's donkey are riding on a donkey!
I heard someone scream.
You continued writing.
Tom came into my house.
Are you Russian?
I never liked biology.
I'm playing.
Who is blind?
I am not a student.
Get out of here!
I like math.
Why does Tom want me to help him?
Is there another one here?
It's a short story, Tom: isn't it?
Tom ate quickly.
Someone tried to kill you.
What time did Tom leave?
Do you write in French?
Tom has to stay, he has no choice.
What do you want then?
I'm glad to be back.
Tom said he wanted to study French.
Have you ever worked with them?
I want you to work with them.
He went to bed early yesterday.
I wonder why the proverb says: "You love a stranger, people treat you like a monster".
Nothing has changed.
If you need help, call me.
Get ready as soon as possible.
Tom spoke.
It is difficult to choose between the right and the wrong.
You are a dog.
Tom cooked potatoes.
He went back to the mountains of Kabul.
They called.
It is beautiful!
Someone wants to scare you.
Where are you in October?
What happened then?
Tom tried to call Mary.
Did anyone call you yesterday?
It's not all right.
"I'm all over it", Tom said, "which I'm not at all sure about".
If he doesn't have money to borrow.
Are you Chinese?
What do you like best, meat or fish?
Is it okay if I visit you today?
My parents just arrived at the station.
Someone stole my suitcase.
Where is your aunt?
Are you thirsty?
Put it on the floor.
Birds are singing.
Why does Tom want to stop?
Help me to work.
I'm going swimming tomorrow.
Have you forgotten anything?
He's already there.
Have you read it?
Are you worried about something?
I heard people speaking French in the bus.
There is no god.
Someone has searched my room.
Sami's car did not crash.
Help me out of here.
I wonder.
Can you fix this?
Someone is stunned.
She was ill.
Nothing will change.
I left Australia three years ago and never returned.
Don't bother!
You are crazy.
I need you here.
Someone must do something.
My life is in your hands.
Do it
Are you a member?
We need someone.
Please listen.
Aren't you coming to my house?
Do you like my friend?
There is little milk in the bowl.
The more painful the sweater.
I saw someone greeting Tom.
I'll stay home when she comes next.
I am sorry for your success.
Is there anyone else you want to see?
So, God forbid you throw him a blue egg, not a red one! He should be a bastard!
I don't know Tom very well.
You should come home.
He's not there.
She is or has been here.
Children learn by example.
Tom seems very happy.
Are you going swimming tonight?
We arrived in Osaka before yesterday.
Please don't go and read what this creature is saying!
They are all happy.
I want a lot of money.
Do you know where he was born?
I'm glad to see you, too.
What are you saying?
Tom suggested someone make him something to eat.
Tom is a jerk.
Tom loves to sing.
Speak up.
I'm out of words.
He played.
Tom is lucky that Mary wasn't there with him.
My job is to wash.
This website contains a guide in Kabyle with lessons and examples and a guide.
I'm doing it wrong.
Tom told you he was going back to the city where he was born.
You are a thief.
Are you all right?
Did someone hit Tom?
Clean the mirror.
What did you do today?
Tom and I talked about many different things.
And what are you doing?
He is in a coma.
We're going to play this game.
Why didn't you call me more often?
Are they new?
It didn't help.
Hold on to it!
He wants to add a cup of coffee.
He put a pin in his nose.
Tom will listen.
It seems I came too early.
Your father will be pleased as soon as you return.
You'll find someone left it here.
There's someone outside.
Someone might hear you.
The truth?
Tom hopes to see you in October.
I was hoping you could show me how to do this.
Do you speak Latin?
I think there's someone in the front room.
Please answer.
Please don't forget to send the letter.
Are you an artist?
I cut your tongue.
I will never forgive you.
Why do you want all this?
Tom always seems to win.
Someone just sent for me.
You are dumb.
Your time has come!
You fooled me.
Mr. West called while you were away.
I haven't changed. You have.
Do you?
By day they are whispering; by night they are whispering. What is it, what is it? It's a doorbell.
They all love the flowers.
How have you been spending your weekend so far?
Tom danced.
Let's dance again.
I did about a week's work in one afternoon.
Where did the money go?
They came all the way to me!
I need to talk to someone.
I want someone to talk to.
I'm from Japan.
You are beautiful.
I don't think you should do that.
I'm angry with Tom.
Tom kissed Mary.
See you again, Tom.
I can't go swimming with you tomorrow.
You're not the only one Tom has cheated on.
Tom made him Mary's shadow.
You can eat now.
You ran for Tom.
Someone has already been here.
What are you doing?
Take this one.
It's a busy day.
Tom kissed Mary.
Do you want me to read it to you?
Sami likes to do that.
I know it takes courage for this.
Something is different.
She takes medication every hour.
I hope Tom doesn't tell me to do that.
I will never forget it.
She doesn't laugh at me anymore.
Tom spoke.
I can't help Tom today.
I met her once on this road.
I am annoyed.
What then?
Stop right there.
He's right, he loves her too.
I'm afraid of you.
Mary is a good girl, but she talks a lot.
Did you buy it in Boston?
These are our unspoken sentences. It's a saying we hear early on in life!
Mary is very pretty, but not very smart.
I may go to Boston in October.
I hope for the truth.
Bring some milk too.
Sami traveled through Egypt by bus.
I want to buy a house in Australia and stay for a year.
How much do you trust him?
I don't see well.
Hello to all of you!
In our house, the old lady told everyone to wash their dishes.
Take this one.
I have to read the book.
I'm a little busy.
Welcome to the club!
Someone can hear you.
I already told you that I didn't do that.
Sami never considered himself a Christian.
Two mountains and a diamond, standing between them, called the Creeps.
Tom told me a story.
I'm not leaving you, Tom.
Do you think anyone can see me?
Are you finished?
I returned from Boston on October 20.
You, too, cannot answer.
Someone is singing.
Eat this tea. It will help you sleep.
I can't remember your name.
Tom doesn't care who looks at him.
Mary made Halloween costumes for the children.
I asked Tom to clean the room.
Hello, Tom can't see you're here.
I can't do that for you now.
That's what you asked for.
Are you lying to me?
Someone heard me.
Are you from Kyoto?
Why don't you tell me what happened last night?
I can do well.
You are a panda.
I saw someone give Tom a coat.
Someone is looking at the stairs.
Will they listen?
Tom's room isn't very big.
Tom did what Mary said.
Try to clean it.
Maybe we should tell someone.
Spring has arrived.
I don't know how much he'll pay.
I was wrong about you.
The talk is over.
Your mother eats herbs.
It's good to tell the truth.
You've had your meal.
They're using you.
From your heart?
Tom made it sound better.
I'll call you this afternoon.
Did Tom really say that he planned to stay in Australia?
Tom visited Australia last summer.
Have you become crazy?
He's here to scare me.
Tom may be in Australia from October.
I like snow.
Are you all so stupid?
Stay with me!
Keep looking!
Are you people?
Remember him.
You're not going to die here.
That's what they all think.
Come on in here.
My legs are wet.
Sami asked Layla to do him a favor.
Isn't that true?
Tell him that.
You will.
Someone is following us.
I went too.
You can now consider Layla your daughter.
Someone gave us poison.
Are you a foreigner?
Many countries have laws against smoking.
Will he come back?
The room is for rent.
I might be able to go to Boston in October.
You were in Boston.
But what is it?
I was hurt.
You are awake.
We have until October to finish our work.
Hello, my sweet.
I know I can't win.
Your business will be good.
I'll meet you there in five minutes.
Tom and I were never close friends.
I'm going to buy three tickets.
I wanted to be a farmer.
Please come here.
It's better to be quiet than to be quiet.
Someone called.
Questions will fall on the audience, and she will have to answer them.
I'm an old friend of Tom's.
Should I smoke?
Are they angry?
You're in for a treat.
I'm used to the heat.
I don't like to eat alone.
Have you seen any of this?
Tom said he wanted to do that.
I came yesterday.
Someone has to talk.
Have you become mad?
Bring them to eat.
They all speak Romanian.
It is impossible to do it.
Something is not right.
They won't tell me how Tom died.
Where are you?
When do you have lunch?
Why don't you go out and play?
You are blinded by love.
Tom was found dead on October 20th.
Please eat this one.
Go with wisdom.
They have guests.
Tom deserves this.
Mary cheated on Tom.
Tom will come with you when he finishes his work.
Is this your last question?
I am unemployed.
I'm a friend of his brother.
What kind of game do you play?
Tom gave us a lot of food.
Turn off the TV.
Sami was fighting with the gymnastics teacher.
Sami is leaving.
If you want to eat this, you can.
There is no father at home.
Tom likes to talk about golf.
What is your goal?
They don't know yet.
Tom is sniffing.
How good is he!
Come to the house.
Stop singing.
What do they call you?
We speak French.
Keep singing!
I won't hurt you.
Don't punish Tom for that.
Tom and Mary are in good health.
How many pounds did you earn?
The servant laid a curse and his son lifted it.
We're not done right now.
He is sick.
Tom said he'd come tomorrow.
Tom was amazed by his beauty.
Why don't you tell me what happened last night?
You are an idiot!
Tom broke up with Mary.
Tom and Mary have an idea.
I love their house.
You can always change.
I wish I could go to Australia in October.
Tom is a man of words.
You gave it to Tom.
Come on over here.
You are idiots!
I like history.
Everyone is lying.
Stop moving!
I guess you like your job.
Don't add cherries to the potatoes, at least!
Do you have any water?
Tom died on October 20th.
You are cold.
I hated him.
She writes well.
We can't cover a house with a hammer.
Tom loves to sing.
I always liked swimming.
Don't you remember what Tom did to Mary?
I can do it myself.
We are teachers.
No one is.
Nobody knows.
I want you to participate.
Tom returned to Boston last October.
Do not open the door.
Are you a little tired?
When did you buy this bag?
Did someone call you?
I want you to come right away.
Are you smiling?
I'm really starting to dislike Australians.
Sami's shoes didn't fit Layla.
Have you finished your work?
This will make you stronger.
I want you to try this.
I know you left early.
He was cold.
You can use this diagram.
Call them.
Look at that!
Why do you want all this?
Sami was there.
Why didn't you come to Boston last summer?
Someone is coming with us.
He likes to walk.
Where is your God now?
I didn't see Tom anywhere.
We met for the last time.
Does that make you happy?
Were you surprised to see her?
We killed a god.
Tom is confused.
They're inside.
Tom can't help us.
Did you get a car if you didn't drive?
I'll be here on Monday.
Tom called Mary.
Don't leave me alone.
No one will find him.
We all cheated on you.
I'm not interested in religious matters.
You shouldn't eat too much sweets.
You should be careful.
My hip is long.
You're new here, aren't you?
Look around here.
Your smile always makes me happy.
Hold this.
The sun is obscured by clouds.
It is good.
Tom and I talked on the phone.
Clean up your room!
We're worried about you.
Your friends are waiting for you.
I'm the one who pays all the bills.
Tom knocked three times on Mary's door.
Don't you swim?
Tom went to Australia.
Tom and I both want to go.
Tom eats when he's worried.

Where will your friends sleep?
You guys are really amazing!
Snow knocked out all the drilling engineers in all parts of the country.
He goes to school early.
Someone is waiting for you.
Tom doesn't remember Mary.
Why didn't you come to Boston last summer?
Have you become a lunatic?
I did this for you.
I'm mad at my own shadow.
Tom wants to stop Mary.
That's my opinion, not yours.
Do you know which room the meeting will be in?
I visited Dubrovnik last year.
I'm afraid there was someone in the front room.
Australia is not a paradise.
Tom and Mary have already kissed.
Tom is a Christian.
What book are you reading?
Tom will forget about Mary.
I learned to drive.
I already told Tom that I wanted to stay in Australia for four weeks.
Neither Tom nor Mary wanted to do that.
I ran into some trouble finding a taxi.
Can I?
My head hurts.
We're on our way.
I need help right now.
Can I talk to you alone?
The project is over.
The woman you were talking to was your sister.
I could be stopped by anyone.
Tom got up.
Tom fell.
You're not used to drinking a lot of water.
Exactly!
Be careful!
The leaves fell.
Are you asleep?
It was snowing and cold at night.
Tom doesn't respect Mary.
Read to me!
You should learn English.
We all love him.
Can you find her?
Do you believe in magic?
Shut up!
I am Tom's mother.
There's nothing there.
What's in your heart is what's in your face.
Someone wants to talk to you.
Do you like Germany?
Tom said he liked it very much.
Don't you know that Tom has decided to go to Boston with Mary?
I haven't smoked in a long time.
Find out what!
Please use a pen!
There is no turning back.
Sami and Layla are looking at each other.
I'm happy for you.
Someone must have stopped you.
Wait! They are ugly!
How long will it take Tom to get to Boston?
Children like to play hide-and-seek.
You have a book and a game.
Someone must have wanted it.
Some of Hans Christian Andersen's stories were translated into Kabyle.
I don't have any children.
How then?
Just look at my new car.
Tom is in a bad way.
Tom is a Russian.
Do you have a dog?
Don't tell anyone.
Change your clothes!
Do you have friends?
Do you remember?
Let the water flow.
Tom made snow.
Leave Tom alone.
I just spoke to him.
This is it!
Maybe you did that with us.
Let's sleep on it.
He shouted his pride.
You should eat breakfast every day.
Listen to this!
Someone has just been born.
We don't believe that to be true.
Alif Al-Daflawen is a Kabyle folk singer.
She is appreciative.
I visited Boston that Friday.
I'll call you today.
You're older than Tom.
You are not going to die.
Do you know where he was born?
Tom is a bit of a jerk.
My mother was sick for two days.
Don't forget to tell Tom that he should do this.
Are you sick?
Please find him.
Tom doesn't get along with Mary.
They were not friends by choice.
I like to be alone.
What time do you eat?
Don't worry. It's easy.
Is there anyone you want to see?
What are we waiting for?
Someone is staring at Tom.
Your computer won't work!
Something has to happen.
Is something bothering you?
Tom has a black car.
Have you checked them?
Someone is watching you.
Fish, please.
I want to know what you like to eat.
It was a great day.
Sami wants to stay home.
Are you alone?
No one died.
Give me your eye!
Have you had dinner or not?
Where did he go?
Tom was hired in October.
Tom has a girl older than him.
"So you believe him?" "Absolutely!"
Tom seems rich.
The non-voter agreed.
You've been through it twice.
You are right.
Please get up.
Tell the truth.
You are wrong.
It was good.
You'd better cut your hair.
Give your money to the poor, and you will find treasure in heaven.
This is obviously art.
I haven't forgotten you at all.
I am a woman.
Have you seen the new movie?
They all begged.
Say it again.
Where is the pen?
I don't eat fruit.
What are you going to eat tomorrow?
When will Tom be back from Boston?
I'm sorry about that.
Give it to whoever wants it.
Tom took Mary's place.
She held my hand.
Why can't we play tennis today?
Have you read?
He was hit by a bullet.
You shouldn't be working.
Did you stop Tom?
I want to eat here this evening.
Did you see the star?
Do you write in French?
Your older sister will be with you.
Two beers, please.
You're better than Tom.
Tom threw the apple at me.
The little cat is sitting on the bed of the barn.
I am a foreigner.
Someone gave us poison.
Everything is where it's supposed to be.
From your heart?
Do you have daughters?
He is a boy who follows the instructions of his parents and teachers.
Hello again!
You have a good face.
Are you kidding me?
If you want something, you can have it.
Switzerland is a country of railways.
Arabic is not my language, and Kabyle is my language.
Are you crazy?
October was difficult.
Have you read this?
Probably not.
There was someone inside.
I don't care if you kiss Tom or not.
I want to read.
Open the door.
Tom and I went to Boston to see Mary.
Tom is your father.
Tom was the first to pass the exam.
This time it's not the same.
I'm sorry about that.
It's raining.
He went to visit her when she was living in London.
Someone is sick right now.
I want you to work with them.
October is a busy month.
We've all been fooled by you.
I have to study.
Take Tom home.
I'll eat here.
The truth is hard.
I ate.
I haven't been in Boston long.
What do you want from us?
Tom wants to marry Mary.
Tom can't drive.
Sami knows where she lives.
Why does Tom need my help?
I shouldn't kiss Tom.
You didn't help me.
I won't be eating at home tonight.
Look at her.
You are happy.
You're not in love with Boston yet, are you?
He picked up a bag and went straight to the market.
Hold this.
When are you leaving?
Sami is tired of Layla.
Why are you crying?
You guys! How do you think they're going to put the brass! I didn't see!
The barriers fell, and people went into their homes.
They all were.
A fire broke out at night.
Why are you alone?
I like to eat eggs.
You should try.
Get your hands off me.
We won't leave you.
Swimming is good for your health.
France is a republic.
Poison yourselves.
Just stay here.
Tom was who he was.
Mary built it.
Tom and Mary are smiling.
Someone is approaching the door.
Sami has a habit of eating raw food.
You'll have your little sister.
Tom is confused.
She lost everything she had.
After you.
Who is standing?
Hold on to Tom.
Tom said he knew who did it.
Tom is rich.
I'm not talking about this with him.
Who knows what it is.
What is your friend's name?
I told you it would work.
You are a witch.
You are blinded by love.
Football is a hot topic in this country.
I'm not going.
I'm getting my clothes off.
She's moving fast!
See you later, Ian.
Don't waste your time.
Stop them.
If I remember correctly, Tom's birthday is October 20th.
Get ready for it!
Are you blind?
Eat all you want.
How long do we have to wait?
Life is beautiful.
The wind is blowing.
It is beautiful!
Why didn't you take him home?
Tom is the one who wants to
This description is not at all accurate.
Did you find anything?
You are not perfect.
Did you teach Tom wrong?
Do not be afraid.
You seem very upset.
They're all outside.
What do you want from Tom?
Why do you want all these things?
Did you see that I was talking about a horse?
If Tom can't do it, no one can.
I really need to eat something.
I've made many mistakes in my life.
Are you hungry?
They have a problem.
Get your clothes off!
Tom is arriving.
Since when has Tom been teaching French?
I play the guitar.
Why not?
I'll ask Tom to do that.
Did you find anything?
I realized that Tom really loves me.
I like to sleep.
Tom and Mary have the same idea.
We all hate you.
Do you know Tom's password?
You can take Tom home tonight.
We know you didn't kill Tom.
Sami is in Tahiti.
You're not going to force Tom to do this.
Tell me who you are!
No one knows why.
Is this love?
Are you crazy?
Tom can see Mary.
One, two, three, go!
Are you feeling better?
I heard someone talking.
Tom thought I was Mary.
Which boy?
We don't have a book.
How many eggs do you eat a week?
Tell Tom what you want.
Someone is talking.
Have you read this?
I'm waiting for the call this morning.
What does all this mean?
You must follow the rules.
Do good to those who hate you.
What do you want?
Stop whining.
It's really sad.
I need someone to talk to.
Say 'ahhh'.
I don't like Tom.
Let me see what you wrote.
Keep laughing.
He burns the paper slowly.
We need more witnesses.
You're not here to be rude.
Is there anyone you want to see?
Come with me.
Be yourself.
You have plenty of time.
However, I just said that: there have always been failures.
Are you Canadians?
I hope I can do it again.
There is no garage in Tom's house.
Someone has to talk.
I respect you.
October 20 is a busy day.
Then, a heavy rain started to fall.
Tom drove faster than Mary.
Write your name.
Someone was killed.
No one said anything.
You can get your money back if you want.
I don't agree with you on this matter.
It's our car.
I believe you.
Do what you like.
I'm tired of watching TV.
No one ate the record.
Can you help me again?
They are all waiting.
You have won your battle.
Which tooth hurt you?
Please tell me if you're interested.
Tom lied.
How many cookies did you eat?
Can I see the list, please?
Be careful!
Tom tried to save Mary.
Tom regretted that they tried to do it.
You need someone like me.
Tom is your father.
I don't think I like that.
Are you angry?
It's all in the bag.
Does Tom drink?
Sami saw Layla come out of Walmart.
What are you going to do with that?
I didn't read it well.
Who invited you to the wedding?
Tom kissed Mary.
They are sleeping.
I don't understand how this could happen.
The pen you're holding right now is mine.
What were you calling her?
Tom and I are going to be neighbors.
How long are you staying in Boston?
Tom loves French.
He stayed at home.
Leave that to you.
What do you hope to tell me?
A year of snow is a year of grain.
Snow, though beautifully cold.
The point!
I have to find a way out of here.
He went to the bar to get some beers.
I think Tom is much older than I am.
Read yourself.
Do we have one?
Please shut up.
Sami believed his mother.
I can't do it any other way.
Hokkaido is in the north of Japan.
Tom was born in Australia.
They are waiting.
Did you hear what they were saying?
I am with child.
Who told you Tom would be here?
Can you take a picture of us?
How will they know?
He saw me right away.
Shoot for Tom!
Are you feeling well?
You look busy.
It seems I came too early.
I've never tried to drive a motorcycle.

I know everything.
I'm cold.
Have you read it?
He is dead.
Tom got home three hours ago.
Tom let his dogs out.
I love you very much.
Come home early!
Tom went into the kitchen.
You are dead.
Obviously they didn't read us.
Apples are big.
I'm out of breath.
They won.
Make it easy for you to use.
You have no heart.
Stay where you are.
You fool!
Someone has to do it.
If I feel like it, I'll let you know.
I've prepared a poem, do you want me to read it to you?
Can you help me, please?
Did she use them?
Thank you for telling us that.
This is my brother's.
They're all dead.
Is that Tom?
Learn from it!
We need a car.
I don't eat fish if it's not good.
Call them.
Please just tell me what's going on.
Tom is scared.
When I come back from the mosque where I pray, I like to have a glass of wine before I go to bed.
She built it.
I will be thirty in October.
Be careful.
Tom is really heavy.
Tom stood up.
It's all right!
It's time to go home.
Come here!
Sami bought two cups on Amazon.
Get out of here!
Are you working?
Does Tom work for you?

You are all crazy.
Sami is scared.
Tom speaks French.
Stop smoking.
Can any of us speak Spanish?
Don't eat that.

Send me over there.
Who is the eldest of your brothers?
This happens sometimes.
Why are you reading?
I keep singing.
Everyone knows it's Tom's car.
Do you smoke?
His voice has changed a lot.
You're crazy to keep working in a place like this.
I understand that.
Tom is screaming.
Tom didn't call Mary.
Tom changed jobs.
It is a bird.
There is no hope for his recovery.
Good day, my light.
Stop whining!
I'm here as a friend.
You'd better not do that while Tom is here.
These girls both like you.
Tom and I have known each other for a short time.
I saw someone give Tom a haircut.
Can you give this to Tom?
I went to see Tom again today.
There is nothing like love.
I'll be in Boston until October 20.
Where did you learn Italian?
Come and try something.
I'll go with you.
Stop crying.
Do you see your sister?
Layla is wearing her glasses.
Look at that!
Tell them the truth.
We won.
I'm not washing your car.
I met a man whose father knew Tom.
I'm not here to hurt you.
You were cheated.
Sami ran on the floor.
The smile.
Someone opened the door.
I thought we were friends.
Are you ready?
I want to eat Chinese food for dinner.
Clean up your room!

Life is good.
Is Adam really a scientist?
I love you as you are.
Tom has been talking about you all day.
Nobody went there.
They left.
You should eat something.
This way.
I asked Mr. Smith.
Your sister is the most kind of student.
You can't go in with that.
It looks good.
The boy stole money from his mother's pocket.
Don't you know that Tom and Mary are still so busy?
Tom was surprised at Mary.
What time was it when you got here?
Look around you.
You are reading.
Please help us.
Who are you?
I feel sorry for him.
Tom didn't know that Mary loved him.
Boys and girls play together.
Your eyes are lying.
No one knows.
I'm listening to music.
I'm with Tom.

You seem to know how to do this.
They are the same age.
No one told me it would be so cold.
You didn't help me.
Here is Rahab back.
I believe him.
October 20 was a hot day.
Nothing is more true.
He thinks like a child.
Tom is a smart boy.
Why did you go there?
Where are your dogs?
Tom was just suspicious.
What are you doing this weekend?
Half of your work is done.
All the money came from religion.
Tom is trying to keep his eyes open.
Keep the ball rolling.
Our dog is black.
Your mother eats herbs.
Mary is a cook.
You taught me something I don't know.
Are you feeling better?
They love their Kabyle culture.
I know you'll find a way to do this.
Someone is following us.
I know who he is.
Wait outside.
He really hurt my feelings.
I want someone else.
Fill the room.
You're hiding something.
Are you here?
Did you know that Tom was thinking of going to Boston with Mary?
Tom wanted to scare Mary.
Cooperation is good when there is agreement.
You're kidding, that's what I should have done!

The country is covered with snow and ice.
Someone has committed suicide.
Tom can do what he likes.
Please, do not be hasty.

Aren't you tired?
Do they all like music?
I was in Boston last year on October 20th.
Go with speed.
I am not your slave.
Why are you alone?
No one answered.
It is true.
I went to the right.
Who knows why Tom turned down the job.
I don't need your work.
Naomi has been very happy since she won the award.
Tom wasn't chasing Mary.
See you at dinner.
Tom did a great job for us.
I wonder if he loves me.
Amaya likes to eat eggs.
Pass me the salt, please.
Tom refused.
How are you, Tom?
Good. No one is stupid.
It's a good life.
I lost my pen.
Who went with you?
Are you ready?
Did you enjoy your trip to Boston?
Tom has been playing since then.
Are you there?
She picked up a bag and went straight to the market.
He started to panic.
Get out of here!
Leave your shoes out before you come in.
This week, it will be two months since I started writing poetry; although it is a little bit, the Kabyle language is waiting for a lot of work. So, what is the point of these?
Please answer.
Is there anyone you want to read to?
The bride was beautiful.
She didn't buy bread.
Tom was in March.
They kissed him.
Can I go home now?
They didn't see anything.
Tom and I haven't seen each other in a long time.
I hate fighting.
Tom continued to read.
I didn't say that Tom wasn't interested.

What Tom said was meaningless.
Mary bought a wedding dress.
Did they know you loved us?
Are you German?
Tom might want to do that, too.
She kissed me.
Someone is coming.

They have wine.
We can!
Are you dying?
She is dying of panic.
Come on over here.
Do you have any answers?
Tom is angry at Mary.
Do you know anything about your family?
They are all alive.
Do you have a brother, Ana?
The wind is strong.
No one knows why.
Are there people who will forgive?
I was trying to get out when the phone rang.
If you want anything.
I won 100 euros a day.
Tom never forgets.
Tom closed the door in anger.
We are the light of the vision.
He wrote her a message.
It's all in the bag.
You know very well how it happened.
Has anyone asked Tom why he did it?
Tom listened.
Let me go!
I heard differently.
This bill was approved last October.
Tom didn't get up early.
Tom and Mary were sitting in the back.
Is it Friday?
Keep going.
Drink your coffee.
They agreed.
Aren't you ashamed of yourselves?
I want to ride with you.
Coffee is bad for your stomach.
You should come with me.
Will anyone forgive me?
I came back to talk to you again.
Someone stole my money.
Did you know Mary before she joined the team?
The sign is yours.
Ask your neighbors.

I stayed awake all night.
To change the subject.
My parents are Kabyle.
Send this letter by plane.
My upper left corner is broken.
We learned French.
How do you spend your time in Boston?
Tom is tired.
We have until October to do that.
Why don't you join me?
Tom hasn't seen them since October.
Eat more!
Do you have anything hot to drink?
I'm glad you won.
Are you gay?
Tom was right.
Sami arrived in Egypt.
You seem surprised.
They should meet face to face later to settle things.
She never smiled at me again.
The leaves are as soft as snow in the sun.
Tom can wait.
That's not true either.
It is a dish.
I have to tell someone.
I'm here for you.
Tom heard the sound of the barley grass.
Mary never kissed her husband in public.
Clean up ahead.
Listen to this!
Tom and I talked about many things.
You are welcome.
Eat up.
Are you afraid of horror movies?
She asked me!
Shortly after graduating from high school, Tom moved to Australia.
Shops are closed on Sundays.
Read the article.
I am in Tel Aviv.
I want you to lock the door when you leave.
This morning, it has no nose. It looks like a spider, but it's bigger than a cat!
Thank you for your concern.
Tell it to Tom.
Give it to Tom!
Let me go!
Brush your teeth as soon as you finish eating.
Don't be mad at me.
Are you Japanese?
Bring the guard.
They are not respected by all.
We'll walk after it rains.
Tom is being stalked.
Are they new?
Do you understand?
It smells like a sponge.
I'm scared of you.
It is wonderful.
I am not your slave.
With his pajamas at home, Brian sat at home in the morning reading.
Love is blind.
Someone is watching you.
You can kill anyone.
Their suitcase is very heavy.
Are you stupid?
Bring her home.
Why do you want me to help you?
I was shocked.
How are you?
Someone called the security forces.
I can't do that for you now.
You came into my room.
I can't tell you the truth.
I asked Tom to forgive me for what I did.
Karl Marx said: Religious prejudice comes from the prejudice of women, and from the struggle against the prejudice of women.

I took this photo in Boston on October 20th.
You didn't hear the children.
He's shopping with me.
What a paella!
Let go of me!
Tom greeted us on Sunday.
Who ordered the pizza?
How can I find him?
Have you studied?
The hardest part is over.
I shouldn't do that.
Turn off the TV.
I have changed.
Do your best.
You've got me all wrapped up!
I was a little nervous.
I read books.
Who were they?
Are you crazy?
She laughed at her.
Why do you want all this?
I followed her.
Have you eaten?
Sami and Layla were friends.
Do you have a bicycle?
They will find them.
Tom must be fine.
The snow is covered by the shores of the freshwater lakes.
The people love freedom.
She has no friends.
This requires a lot of attention.
Who is this speaking?
Religion brings war.
To your health!
This medicine will cure you.
I like to eat sweets.
Hurry up and call.
Keep going.
Are you a witch again?
His body was found on a stage.
Maybe not.
Watch something!

He knows how to play with words.
Call me when you get back.
You are a bitch.
Tom is anxious to return to his home in Boston.
Your sister is a witch.
Don't worry about the bad.

Is there anything we can do?
My little foot is bigger than yours.
I like Korean food.
I'll leave now if that's okay.
He bought it.
Mary was pregnant.
My wife!

This idea is brilliant!
At least give us a face.

You should rest well.
Tom said Mary wouldn't do this alone.
Even children can read this book.
You are too tall!
Tom loves books.
You can read this book.
Sorry about Tom.
Try it!
The flowers are falling.
I stayed at home.
Someone is following you.
Tom refused to eat lunch.
Nobody cares who you are.
I've told them all this before.
Would you do that for me?
Stop singing.
I need someone to talk to.
Are you scared?
You beat Tom.
One said, "I met two hot dogs. I didn't understand anything".
Man invented God so that he would not kill.
Please make me a friend with some beautiful girl.
I need to buy paper and other things I need.
Go and warm up.
Hurry up!
I told them not to tell you.
I like the Catalan language.
Boston was crowded.
I fell asleep like this in the middle of the night.
Read it again.

In your pants!

Tom said he'd still be asleep.
Be careful!
I want to spend time with Tom.
Do you know what you're doing?
I'll tell you the truth.
I don't drink coffee.
Sami was upset about this.
Did you find your letters?
He is reading the newspaper.
Do you know my wife?
Get down!
You were a child.
The name Tunisia comes from the root "ens".
Tom is a smart-ass.
Ask Tom about it!
I would die for you.
Stay outside.
What is your philosophy?
Tom reads a lot.
Should I eat this dish?
No one laughed.
Tom seems like a completely different person when he speaks French.
Answer my questions.
They're cleaning the beach.
I'm going back to Australia on October 20.
I hope no one sees you like that.
Say something!
What a shame!
Tom and Mary always fight.
Did you learn to draw or something?
I was born with a disability.
Drop your bag.
Bring us two egg sandwiches, two cups of coffee, three parts of apples, please.
I don't want him to think I hate him.
I grew up in Australia.
I want to start a family.
Tom eats less than Mary.
Mike smiled.
Have you eaten your biscuits?
I do it because I want to.
You are stupid.
Send me over there.
I have to close this door.
Tom has epilepsy.
Stay in the house.
The snow reminds me of my country.
I'm ready to read as much as I can this year.
Tom wants twelve eggs.
Is that Tom's father?
Who else is there?
I hope no one saw you come here.
Tom is currently visiting Australia.
They smiled.
Get out of here!
I'll call you every morning.
Please read this book.
Can you fix this?
Are you kidding me?
My brothers!
You can change that if you want.
Did you never call them?
Be careful.
Try to convince Tom to do this.
Wait for something!
I hope we didn't bother you.
Grandpa doesn't know what a Muslim is.
There must be someone who will do it.
I was so nervous when I opened the door!
God forbid anyone saw you come here.
It is raining.
Who wrote these stories?
The food is healthy.
I've made her a mess, I've made her a mess; what can I do about it?
I'm not the one who's lying. You are.
Please say hello to your parents.
Where's your key?
They look very much like me.
Marie doesn't like this game.
Does Tom help you in the kitchen?
You see yourself in the mirror.
Nothing has changed.
Answer him.
Tom earned more money than Mary.
Can you get it?
Are you Japanese?
Swimming at night is a hobby.
Finish your apology.
What did he say?
Your luck is not in vain.
Tom and I weren't friends.
Tom hates when we do that.
Tom is as tall as a bird of prey.
Tom didn't want to do that to Mary.
Life is good.
Be cool.
France is my second country.
I can read them.
Please call Tom in.
What time do you want?
Maybe it's better if she comes with us.
Sami's girlfriend was jealous of you.
I've done everything for them.
Take this one.
You have no heart.
We'll wait for you here.
I am not your servant.
I want to go see a movie.
Open your eyes.
Will you come?
It's hard to believe things like that.
Tom is waiting.
Tom knew that Mary did that.
You're on your own.
Can you fix this?
Is there one you want to read?
Just take me home.
I was bitten by a snake.
Can you swim?
Please continue!
I'll ask you something.
Is French easy?
We know.
I want to improve my French.
We met a writer.
You can buy and read the kind of book you want whenever you want.
Are you sure?
Does what I say make sense?
Who answered?
Did you see him?
Someone stole my watch.
Your son is a handsome, handsome young man.
I miss him.
Let's try something.
I hope no one saw you doing this.
Someone has fallen on this bed.
You're not Japanese.
I am not your slave.
Let me go.
I know that Tom is a teacher.
It rained.
He is asleep.
Tom has cheated on Mary.
Tom likes being with Mary.
"The catastrophe has not yet arrived", said Titus Livus.
I like Mary.
I want to know.
Tom saw Mary following him.
Can you make a salad?
Everything is fine around you.
Even if I asked a meaningless question?
Can you take me to see the list, please?
You've been with them, haven't you?
Someone held me in my arms.
I'll give you my car.
Get out of here!
Sami started telling a story.
Tom is always on my mind.
Are you kidding me?
Be proud of yourself!
Tom must have seen something.
Tom and Mary are drunk.
Stop complaining!
Tom opened the door and told Mary John wasn't home.
Nothing happened at all.
Omar is just a fool.
Someone made a mistake.
I learned Latin because it's my favorite language.
Someone heard.
Tom seems very happy.
Why are you reading this?
I'm drinking a glass of rosé.
What kind of games do you like?
Can you read this?
Tom went to Boston last week.
I'm busy on Monday.
Are you stupid?
Are you Germans?
I'll find a way.
Tom didn't eat pizza yesterday.
What time will you eat?
Turn to the left!
Tom is in Boston, but Mary is not.
Someone called the security forces.
Stay back.
Do we not care?
He looks like a jerk.
Everyone is talking.
Open the door.
I received your letter then.
I don't want to eat eggs.
Her suitcase is very heavy.
I have something to give you.
What will you drink?
Move again!
Tom is standing.
I could kill you.
That's good.
They are sleeping.
You are a worthy person.
They want to remain citizens.
Stop them!
Have you read this book or not?
This is your slave, isn't it?
I'll talk about the songs.
Do you see what I mean?
Same as last time.
Do you think I should do that?
It is Thursday.
You are a good girl.
It's going to snow today.
He is a child in his mind.
Tom is not a dick.
Tom's face turned red.
Tom needs someone to meet him.
She takes this medicine every four hours.
I'm really happy to be back in Australia.
Sami knows who we are.
She just wants to have fun.
What a beautiful city!
Tom doesn't always tell the truth.
Someone came into the room.
The snow stopped.
I miss you very much.
I need to know something.
Tom and I are married.
Stop crying!
Try to convince Tom to get up early for this.
She likes food.
Tom saw something.
Can you please wait a minute?
Can I take your picture with us?
This is for you.
Is my answer correct?
The time is up.
Who told you Tom wouldn't win?
What will Tom do tomorrow?
Tom and Mary got married in October.
Are you kidding me?
I'd like a coffee, please.
You still don't like Boston, do you?
Tom seems to want to go with you.
The enemy has returned.
Come to the house.
Play there.
Go and get it.
Tom, you're a fool.
Did Tom ever dislike me?
Are you helping him?
Just talk to them.
I hope no one saw you come here.
I don't understand art.
Get away from me!
Try to find it.
We should go.
Please help me.
Have you become a bitch?
I'm asleep, are you?
You speak English well.
Why don't you call Tom and remind him?
Dream with a smile!
This is Mary's husband.
Tom is a writer.
Bring me a cup of coffee, please.
I bought a bottle of water.
Mary told Tom that she didn't like her job.
It's a bad life! It's a bad world!
This store is open on Mondays.
Tom is very awake.
Do you have any other questions to ask?
You can call me tonight.
Only for the adults.
You'd better not talk to Tom.
Bring Tom.
We talked.
What was in the room?
Tom saw something.
I voted for Ken.
Everyone is dreaming.
I can forgive Tom.
Can anyone tell me why Tom is upset?
This is for you.
Take off your hats.
I finally found a place where we could be alone.
I could kill you.
I apologized.
The snow is melting.
He just hit me with a stick.
Tom will always love Mary.
Spring has arrived.
No one will believe us.
Be honest with yourself.
I hurried home.
Tom didn't want to talk to us.
Someone is calling for you.
Your mother eats herbs.
Then get up, you little shit, who are you mad at, because you're losing your shit?
Why don't you eat the meat?
It's a short story, Tom: isn't it?
It was a dark day.
Say "yes" to that.
Tom passed Mary.
Someone stole my money.
Look at that!
What a friend, Tom!
You speak quickly.
I'm not used to working outdoors.
You don't have any friends, do you?
They all joke.
She's been busy since yesterday.
Finally, the guests left, and the house fell silent.
I could kill you.
We will go one by one, one by one, and take our rights.
They're close to me.
Where does your grandmother live?
Tom is walking his dogs.
Tell them I'm here.
You fools!
Are you a cyclist?
What do you think?
You swim better than me.
Tom killed a bear with his cane.
What is your friend's name?
I answered.
Children like Halloween.
Is French difficult?
Tom said he wanted to learn French.
Is there anything we can do?
This requires a year.
You are teachers.
Tom almost hurt Mary.
His name is Tom.
You understand.
We had a good time in Boston.
Shut up!
Do not stop.
Tom is angry.
Chuck Norris was born in the house he built.
I have a heavy Internet connection.
It's just getting dark.
I'll buy you something to eat.
She's ready to fly.
What time did you get here?
You are both angry.
Get up!
Could you pass me the salt, please?
I've got you.
Nothing lasts forever. Coffee is bitter. Smoke is clear. Time passes and people change.
You are so smart!
Did you have a little nap?
I didn't feel hungry at all.
Am I wrong?
Do you like to lose?
Are you stupid?
Tom wants to answer.
It's going to rain tonight.
I just got out of school.
I don't agree with you on this matter.
Are they busy?
Who helped?
Stop the truck!
Hello, my name is Tom. What is your name?
Do you want to stay longer?
I plan to stay in Boston until October.
Tom felt comfortable.
Tom doesn't care who looks at him.
Tom can rest as much as he wants.
Go where he goes!
Change your clothes!
You should see this.
Stay where he lives!
I can't read without a notebook.
I don't like swimming in this river.
Are you listening to me right now?
Oh my God, no one saw us.
You don't sleep enough.
We're trying to help you.
You know Tom loves beer.
I'm glad you were there.
Where are you going today?
You look Japanese.
Tom told me he left his keys at home.
Did you stop Tom?
No one is a fool.
What are you complaining about Tom?
Open your mouths!
I want to try.
I'll show you how it's done.
My choice of speaker is my wife.
If I were you, I'd go home and get some rest.
I didn't cut your throat.
Tom doesn't seem to eat much.
They were not suspicious.
You all are very nice.
Sami got lost and wanted to ask where his way was.
You were laughing.
You are all stupid.
Your parents love me very much.
Are you from Kyoto?
Don't get carried away here.
Are you scared of someone?
Have you ever played chess with Tom?
I didn't know you didn't know how to do it.
Tom is the only one who needs to know this.
No one can stop them!
I miss Paris very much.
I wish I was in Australia.
I have to learn how to protect myself.
We hate them all.
Have you ever eaten a peanut butter?
He died not long ago.
What are you doing for Halloween?
Stop moving!
This is your slave, isn't it?
When did this start?
She worshipped him.
Let me explain it to him.
I can't decide for myself whether to walk or stay.
Mary knew exactly what she wanted.
Try to bring a dog, cat or chicken.
I know you're here, Tom.
The Meethot uprising was a step in the struggle for freedom and human rights.
I came to see you.
Do you really want to go to Germany?
Sami is upset.
Tom is watching someone.
Tom bought something for Mary.
I love you very much.
Even if I asked a meaningless question?
Where is my computer?
I am not your servant!
Tom can also speak French.
Follow your sister's example.
You know I can't.
I thought I'd talk to you again.
They live outside the city.
The food has arrived.
Why were you wearing a jacket?
God is.
Someone is watching you.
Tom put Mary to bed.
How do I get to the train station?
I'll come and help you.
You should read this.
Why doesn't anyone believe me?
Who is this?
I'll buy it for you.
Tom brought his brother.
I will be back tomorrow.
We saw them.
Are you hurt?
We have to do something.
You speak German well.
Talk to someone.
Let me know if there's any change.
They laughed.
Stop apologizing to me.
Who is lying?
Tom wrote to me from Australia.
Tom held his hand as he closed the door.
When are you leaving?
What else do you want to help me with?
I have another option.
It's work.
Who is speaking?
What makes you sad makes me sad too.
He wants more.
Tom broke his shoes.
Thank you, I don't drink coffee.
These are my books.
Tom turned around.
Someone is crying.
Can we talk about it in the morning?
No need to smoke!
Come on now!
I give you a lot of money every month.
We killed them all.
Hurry home.
She helps him.
Get ready!
I hope no one saw you do it.
Someone killed Tom.
Tom and Mary shouldn't go to Boston.
Tom bought drinks for everyone at the bar.
Why do you want all these units?
Tom is not a good writer.
No one can forgive them.
Call me about your work.
Find someone else.
Is he dead?
Who did they remember?
Come and dance!
Tom doesn't like it.
Tom is not very smart.
Someone was killed.
I like to eat carrots.
Tom wants a child from Mary.
What are you going to talk about then?
Someone has taken my place.
Sami took a piece out of his pillow.
Do you remember what Tom said?
Hurry up.
Tom is married for money.
What do you see?
Tom's brother is a lawyer.
Have you ever driven in Australia?
Tom didn't meet Mary.
I know Tom is a spy.
Are you crazy?
Who is the fool?
Your hands are blood-stained.
Is there one?
There is no magic in breakfast.
Tell him tomorrow.
I heard someone screaming.
Who is it?
He was up early.
Tell me how I can help you.
Tom's birthday is coming up.
Tom knows what you're thinking.
São Paulo is a large city in Brazil.
What do they call your father?
No one sees him as a criminal.
I'm following one.
Tom and Mary have nothing to eat.
Play there.
What brings you here?
They are all waiting.
Can you tell me what Tom did?
I want to see who called.
Please say hello to your parents.
I'm not afraid of death.
Thank you for your help.
Don't you know how to fix it?
She said to him: "Even if I drink, I will run".
My mother was dead for two days.
Tom is hiding something.
Be strong so that you can rule.
Did I tell you what I did last summer in Boston?
The bank has put a negative balance on the financial outlook for the future.
Mary built it.
Come here.
Hello, sir! I was just about to leave.
Do you have a house in Australia?
You saw yourself in the mirror.
He kissed me from the couch.
I didn't go to Boston at all.
Lwennas Meetoub is a John Lennon of the Kabyles.
Don't deny Tom what he asked for.
Someone is hurt.
I don't think Tom will agree to that.
When do you think you'll leave?
Are you talking?
I rented my car to him.
You are lying.
I want more money.
Keep going!
I'm glad to know you.
Someone is setting fire.
Sami made a new friend.
Is there anyone who can picture us?
I can drive.
Can you see?
They are free.
If you eat it, you will die.
I want to talk to someone.
Someone is following us.
I know you don't want to talk about what happened.
I have not forgotten you at all.
I want you to forgive me for everything I said.
You don't like Tom's dog, do you?
Tom, Mary and John are all here.
They ran.
Tom plans to return on October 20.
I heard someone walk away.
Tom hasn't seen Mary since October.
Tom yelled at Mary.
No one went there.
We were both tired.
Can you split my sandwich in half?
I was embarrassed.
The dog is dying.
You are beautiful.
Don't move!
I know you must be brave to do that.
You have your word.
Have you called him yet?
The one who has lived a long time is sorry.
Someone is following you.
Have you already returned?
Tom came.
Answer my questions.
Someone is calling for you.
Tom told me he'd been waiting thirty minutes.
I'll try again.
The dog told the bear why he wasn't tired of eating his food: how come, you're so thin, and I'm so tired?
Tom bought it for Mary.
I was ready for them.
I like to walk.
Someone is planning to kill you.
Who said that?
He won, I won't do it again.
This was Tom's idea.
Oh my God, no one saw you do this.
The modern economy is always in danger.
How long have you been wearing shoes?
A man was killed.
Just go there.
This poor girl.
I want to hold your hand.
Get out of here!
Stop speaking.
This is a bug.
Where is the nearest metro station?
I'll be back in peace.
We will never stop learning.
This is a gift for you.
Get up on your feet!
Sami followed Layla to her wedding.
Tom and Mary's parents are friends.
She won.
I have no other choice.
They didn't come back.
He walks with a cane.
I liked this movie.
Read this now.
It snowed and snowed.
Clean yourself up.
Are you okay?
Beer, please.
I trusted you.
Who stopped?
Just let me go.
I work for Tom.
You're messing with my head!
Sami fought hard.
I didn't want to wait that long.
Someone is calling for a fire.
Tom has to go to school.
It's still good down there.
Someone will see us.
No one ate the record.
I'm reading it.
Did you work with him?
He didn't want to go.
Tom said he could cry.
They all laughed.
Please call me tonight.
Sami and Farid were in prison together.
We did that on October 20th.
Help Tom to get up.
Tom knows he trusts you.
They are expensive.
I think Tom is an artist.
He can speak French.
Take this one.
How much do you have?
I'm very caught up.
Look at me!
I'm sure your father is proud of you.
It is difficult.
I'm sorry about that.
I'll be in Australia until October 20.
Are you going to Copacabana today?
Please.
I saw Tom sitting at his desk, reading a book.
Tell them I'm here.
My new shirt is yellow.
It is not in our hands.
Get out of the way.
You kids should be ashamed of yourselves.
Jim looks like his father.
Franz Kafka, in "When They're Gone", or perhaps Woody Allen, simply said: "Help, long... especially to the end".
How scared I was when I opened the door!
A cup of tea, please.
I'll call you before I come.
I can't wait to see your Halloween costume.
Tom can do that, can't he?
Leave him to us.
I wish Tom had been elected last October.
What is your father's nationality?
Sami saw him again.
I want to sit in the middle.
So, is Tom a good actor?
I'm not short.
You should be careful when crossing the border.
Say it again.
Today is a good day.
At first my father didn't care.
Can I ask a question that is not helpful?
The heart is your own.
I'll tell you how to do it.
Did you see the movie or not?
World peace.
I want someone to help me do that.
It's a shame!
Tom is going to Boston next month.
Have you ever been to New York?
That's not going to happen.
Tom said I couldn't come in.
Do you want white or red wine?
Someone forgot her umbrella.
Can you stop the noise?
Are you at home?
Don't call my back.
What kind of movies do you like to watch?
Try this one.
The compass is thick.
I mistook you.
Eat all you want.
Tom is lost.
I was in Boston when it happened.
Have you read this?
You're behind Tom.
It looks like snow.
Make it what it is.
I think I'd like to do that.
You and I love games.
I wanted to marry Tom.
Men like to eat.
I haven't been there since October.
How did you find me?
Mr. Jones is here to see you.
I like to learn languages.
They all don't know how to pronounce Tom's name.
She lied.
I think you did that without paying attention.
Could you pass the salt, please?
It's Monday.
Tom, Mary, John and Alice were born on 20 October 2013.
Sami broke Layla's house down.
You too.
Talk to someone.
Sami had been here for five or six months.
Are you stupid?
I had lunch with Tom.
Someone broke my painting.
Recognize yourself again.
Clean your room.
They make fun of each other every day.
Tom came to believe Mary.
She died.

You are talking.
Why?

Wipe your tears.

How do you breathe?
Thank you for your gift.
I saw one.
Why are you reading this?

Anza is a gunman who heard the roar of the night, in houses where people were shot or killed with knives.
Tom must have seen something.
I drink coffee with milk.
I hope no one saw you.
You still don't like Tom, do you?
Tom seems to be telling the truth.
I know you're going to Boston in October.
I'm putting on my clothes.
Why didn't he text me back?
I love you very much.
Are you sure you know what needs to be done?
Tom speaks French.
Tom sat and cried.
Can you drink?
There's someone there.
How many pounds did you get?
What a fool!
Please stop.
A red wine, please.

I've made a lot of mistakes in my life.
Speak up!
Tom understood.
When will you come?
The milk is poisonous.
It was good!
Tom went to Boston to look for work.
You're here to help your father.
It took more than two years to wait.
I'm glad to see you, too.

Why do you have all these dogs?
Follow me.

Tom cleaned his car this morning.
I went to a Halloween party dressed as a vampire.
He's been here a long time.

I can't see her.
I see the world differently now.
I see a book.
Have you read this?
I don't understand it very well.
The train is already there.
I don't have a sister below me.
Tom and Mary figured out why they were there.
You have two faces.
I studied art history.
Stop right there!
Maybe we should tell someone.
He was completely unprepared for the danger he faced.
I'll write you when I'm available.

You'll regret this.
It is good.

Tom sent you something.
We apologized.
I'm going to do better this way.
I was studying French when you were studying yesterday.
Get out now.
She is reading.
You don't seem busy.
He really hurt my feelings.
There is no internet connection.
Follow this car.
You can come in.
Tom helped.
Let me have it.
Someone died.
Are you all so stupid?
Give it to me.
I need to talk to someone.
I have something to give you.
Someone gave them poison.
Are you tired?
Tom went through them.
Don't come into my room without a staff.
Your letter made me happy.
I'll show you how it's done.
If you want to go, go now!
Thank you, I understand now.
It's a waste, Tom.
You're not Japanese.
If she can grow, if she can be young.
Stop singing.
Don't wait for me.
Explain it to him.
You like flowers.
Please help me.
Someday someone will win.
Are you hungry?
Is that new?
If Mary were here, she would help us.
Speak up.
Where did I leave their mother?
Have a good day!
Tom doesn't seem happy.
Are you shy?
I can't do what I want.
I can't protect you.
Sami's friend died.
Why did you buy it?

I miss you very much.

They did a lot of things to me.
You better not spend a lot of money on this.
Go on!
Where is the shelter?
I'll tell them about it.
Tom knows that Mary is following him.
Hurry up!
This is not Australia.
We have not yet found a suitable solution.
I didn't see the train.
I regretted not telling Tom the truth.
Yes, please.
He left.
Keep working.
You have insulted your country.
Sami drank Layla's cookies.
Have you eaten?
I need to talk to someone.
They were eating.
Tom was doing nothing.
No one objected.
Follow my advice.
They all sang.
What else do you want to buy?
I'm not your friend.
I think Tom is ready.
Take a little rest.
Tom really loves you.
They want you dead.
I'm a Muslim who believes in Jesus. Is there a problem?

There are some seals on the table.
Have you thought about what you're going to give Tom for his birthday?
You look good.
He walks fast.
Are there any questions?

Something is smelling.
Follow your sister's footsteps.
I tried very hard.
Stop looking!
Tom's room is always screaming.
Keep singing!
You're messing with my head!
I'll be in Australia until October 20.
Give it a rest!
We can work on that now.
Get ready as soon as possible.
I need to eat now.
I'm not breaking anything.
Tom gave me some books.
I'm sorry you lost.
It's going to blow.
Show them off.
Someone is following you.
It's a pity you can't come.
Give him a hug.
Tom lent Mary $300.
I don't know who can swim and who can't.
They left before yesterday.
Tom said he never heard Mary sing.
Nothing has changed.
Let him live as he pleases.
Send me your car, please.
I did that.
Answer if you can.
How did they find Tom?
My uncle calls me every three days.
Tom did not kiss Mary.
Try to calm him down.
Do we really have to go back?
Follow the path.
The next day I was alone.
Tom should buy flowers for Mary.
Tom followed Mary to the house.
Tom will be buried on October 20th.
Tom won't let you go.
Everything has a purpose.
Why do people go to the movies?
Why won't you listen to me?
I bought an old car.
It hurts!
No one understands me.
Sho Tom!
Are you an artist?
Are you convinced?
Tom came.
Tom got out of his dream.
Nothing happened at all.
Go where no one knows you.

What are you waiting for?
I want someone to help me do this.

Honor is rewarded.
I like watching westerns.
I can't see well.
He will come to you tomorrow.
Tom is a liar.
Are you in Australia?
I hope nobody followed you.
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?
Who?
Shum! I'm going to go.
Tom always speaks French to me.
I have no intention of writing it.
I know some of the boys.
Do you mind if I take a break?
He didn't need to see her.
I don't agree with you on this matter.
Please smile!
I will pay.
Tom tried to swim across the river.
Are you kidding me?
Go home.
He needs magic to be a teacher!
Why did they call you back?
What do they call you?
I decided to do that today.
All my problems are over.
I sent her home.
I like it.
I heard someone whistling.
I want you to lock the door when you leave.
Where is Wagadugu?
Someone is following you.
You don't want Tom to win, do you?
Did you get Tom?
How are you?
Why don't you call Tom and remind him?
Someone told Tom something.
Please tell Tom to come in.
They all love you.
May I ask you a question that is not important?
According to science, man evolved from apes.
Tom is not a good witness.
Don't stop me when I'm talking.
Tom was being chased by Mary.
Do something!
Some of the books they gave me were cheap.
She went swimming in the river.
I think you should read this book.
Why are you afraid?
This is new.
Can anyone help me?
Someone is watching us.
You're lucky to continue working in a place like this.
Tom isn't dead yet.
So, we'll build a mountain range.
Tom was being played by someone.
Who is this neighbor?
I'm going to eat now.
Tom bought me a ticket.
Tom became angry again.
Find me the one that's different.
She is a witch.
Why didn't you tell me you were going to Australia?
You are talking.
Did they get fired?
I walked with my dog.
I saw someone kiss Tom.
Maybe we should tell someone.
Today's youth are very busy.
Please don't be angry with me.
Someone is calling you.
He doesn't know what to do now.
Do you have any questions?
Shut up!
Please stand aside.
Shut up!
What is it?
I should have known.
She won't eat it.
What do you feed your dog?
Tom has until October 20th to decide.
I got fired.
Take me home with you.
You should see his film.
You are all lost.
It's cool.
Tom is the tallest in his class.
How are you all doing?
She is a flower.
Maybe you did that with us.
Get your ass out of here, John!
Tom doesn't tell the truth every day.
You're just trying to get my attention.
I left Australia on October 2nd.
I wonder how anyone would want to get involved in this.
Tom said he wanted to be buried in Australia.
You are too busy to continue working in a place like this.
They stole my money.
I know Tom is very busy.
They agreed.
What can you give us, Tom?
I remember doing it again.
I know he'll come.
No one can swim.
I'm looking after her.
Drink some water.
Is there anyone who will help?
You are very welcome.
That's right, son, the rest is written.
I wonder if Tom has a bowling alley or not.
Tom still wants to go out with you.
Tom said he didn't think he'd sing.
I like it very much.
Thank you for decorating my house.
I wish I could get back to being free.
Do me some more work while I'm hot.
What do you think of her new novel?
I could be stopped.
Are you Russian?
Tom said he'd never eaten Thai food.
Tom said he had a day off.
Friedrich Nietzsche was a German philosopher.
Can you remember?
You are all crazy.
When did Tom come?
What did you put in the box?
He became very popular.
I called security.
You danced.
Tom hurt Mary.
This house is small.
We're not ready to ask now.
Get out of here!
Who came up with this idea?
I fed him a dog.
Have some coffee.
I hope you understand.
How did you find me?
I saw that he would solve the problem.
"Where will our Kabyle be written?" "It will be for the good of the people!"
Turn off the computers.
I'm not afraid of anything.
I'm not trying to stop you.
I want to know everything you've done.
Did something happen?
I felt something.
Do you have a son?
Can you speak more slowly, please?
Someone wants to talk to you.
Hold him!
Are you here?
Tom lied.
Tom and Mary are not in Australia right now.
I was not allowed to be discovered!
Tom said he wasn't alone.
Drink this water.
Thank you!
Tom is being watched.
I like the light of the bottles.
Do you like Italian?
Did you find your letters?
I don't like you anymore.
I saw a dog.
What is this fruit called?
What is my problem?
I will never forget that.
I just hope no one saw you come here.
I'm sorry about that.
When did you start doing this?
I'm going to quit my job.
He is finished.
Tom said I should learn French.
He can't finish his dinner.
Go back to the back.
Tom told me that Mary wasn't afraid.
Tom wrote a letter to Mary.
I just can't take it anymore.
Hamed is a comedian.
A cup of tea, please.
Do you write in French?
Call me if anything changes.
Get away from me!
Have you seen Tom yet?
They're playing football tomorrow.
This is John.
How strong you are!
Tom is a bit of a jerk.
Go ahead !
Something happened that they didn't build on.
You don't like Tom's dog, do you?
Monday comes after Sunday.
You'll be in Boston in October.
Did you see that smile?
Will you remember me?
You are right.
You speak quickly.
Are you hungry?
Has anyone left?
One here.
Geoff was drunk last night.
I'm busy at my job.
Tom loves art.
Someone is wandering around.
You never told me you knew Tom.
Monday comes after Sunday.
I am not your servant!
Why doesn't Tom want to stay?
What's your name on Skype?
Someone broke this box.
Play the game!
Go with your foot!
Food is cheap at this restaurant.
I'm almost asleep.
I hate to fail.
Shut it down.
You are sick.
You should write a novel.
The one who loses loses.
I understand that.
Who went with you?
They are the same as the mice.
Keep this.
Help me out here.
You'd better cut your hair.
Tom bought cocaine from Mary.
We threw a lemon on the outside.
Are you sure you know what needs to be done?
I'm staying in Australia now.
Tom went home with Mary.
The bottom of my pants is broken.
You lied.
Tom and Mary are about to return.
I wonder if I like you very much or if I just love you.
The city is covered in snow.
Give me all the money.
We found him alive.
Where are you?
He who touches my eyelids has blinded me.
Someone wants to send a letter.
Did you see his face?
I want you to join.
You will find someone.
You are a bunch of bastards.
I was preparing them.
Did you mistake Tom?
You can drive if you want.
They are joking.
Read it!
You found me awake.
Someone has to do something.
I want to eat something.
Tom is used to drinking beer.
It smells bad.
Did you eat last night?
Don't leave your stuff here.
Tom needs someone to help him.
You are back.
Tom said he'd never eaten sushi.
Someone is singing.
Will she come?
Someone has to stop us.
You were cheated.
I will teach Esperanto in my country.
Someone might see us.
I have not missed Boston at all.
Are these your books or mine?
Tom wasn't sure Mary loved him.
That's what you need.
Bring me my socks.
Get off!
Take this one.
Tom just texted me.
Take it easy.
You can go home now.
Follow me.
I forgot to feed my dog.
You're a pain in the kitchen.
It's cold!
I live in Yerevan.
There's nothing here.
I know you'll find a way to do it.
Tom can be a little bit of a jerk.
Don't be afraid of making mistakes.
They agreed.
Stop crying!
Someone is following Tom.
Take off your clothes!
Give me your hand.
Do you go swimming in the winter?
Tom will never forget Mary.
Please do not forget to say hello to your family.
You are lying.
They shook hands.
Tom misses Mary.
They died.
You can read this book.
I asked him to come with me, and he agreed.
Are you afraid?
I let Tom kiss me.
Let the water flow.
Are you Americans?
You don't know what true love is.
They're making fun of you.
Go all the way.
Get up!
Tom plays guitar.
The eating of insects is both exciting and frightening.
Someone is listening.
Have you seen the new film?
I'm going to Paris tomorrow.
Get away from me!
Who are these people?
What if someone catches us?
That's all there is to it.
Are you lying?
Tom is thinking.
Reading makes the world a better place.
Maybe you should stop.
Have you ever been to New York?
Tom said Mary seemed scared.
You found us.
What do you think, will the weather be better?
Bring some help.
Is there nothing that can be done?
Tom isn't as smart as his brother.
Look behind you.
Open the door with this key.
I didn't leave her alone.
What is a computer?
Why do you want a horse?
Is he famous?
Did you know Mary before she joined the team?
Introduce yourself!
Someone broke this box.
No one went there.
Tom and I are just friends.
Are you lying to me?
A book cannot read itself.
Please teach me how to swear in French.
I already told Tom I didn't want to do that.
Tom and I will always be friends.
Is French a religion?
She prayed.
How salty!
Would you like some food?
I really love you.
Leave your clothes on.
Try to speed it up.
You are one to me.
Tom told me a lot about you.
I'm tired of reading.
How many books have you read?
That's the story.
Tom is angry.
How long?
Someone is singing.
Open your mouth!
How do you spend your time in Boston?
Where did you put them?
Turn off the TV.
Do you need food?
Make yourself at home.

He is a boy with many dreams.
Tom is angry.
He was just a fool.
Why weren't you paying attention?
All the students in the class laughed at Tom's new dress.

Get up!
I want to see your sister.

You're a good writer.
They are different.
Julia is singing.
This is a joke!
Is there anyone?
Sami was poor in a small town.
Tom didn't do what he wanted to do.
Someone saw you.
You are very different from us.
He loves me!
Get back in the car!
A tree that is not planted will not grow.
Mr. Sakaki is here to see you.
Tom started reading then.
Is there a problem?
Tom was not in favor.
Does the TV turn on every day?
I like to smile.
Please take it slowly.
Can you come?
I'll do everything I can for you.
We would like everyone to be busy with his own hair, hair, and hair, so that no one needs to wash it. Whoever wants it, let him do it. Whoever takes your robe and your robe, let him wash his own hair.

I need you to do something.
Will you leave me?
Tom said he had to borrow money.
Now you are free.

You are home.
You missed them.

Have you already done it?
Did you pray?
I already told Tom that he had to do it.
Can I say something?
We may need them.
What is the truth?
Someone is crying.
Did you make him a sandwich?
Which idiot are you looking at?
Can anyone help me?
I gave him the little money I had.
Please help me!
Someone is watching Tom.
A goose is a poor man's cow.
Do you like Italian?
It's good to see you again.

Look again!
One thing leads to another, as the first said.
There was a fire in the house.

Tom looked at Mary.
Today is the second match in October.
Tom said he could help us do that.
Which one do you like?
When did you fly to Boston?
Did Tom tell you why he didn't come to the party?
I came alone.
Did Tom tell you why he didn't come to the party?
Are they new?
You are my only hope.
Don't move!
Protect yourselves.
Tom said Mary wasn't too concerned.
They made French bread.
I've never needed so much money.
They waited.
You should talk to Tom.
Tom went back to the garden and peeked here and there.
Tom is cheering to say he won't come.
I need to talk to someone.
Are you kidding me?
You're lucky to continue working in a place like this.
Are you Russians?
I'll be back in Boston on the 20th of October.
You are too tall for me.
I feel happy.
When did she get her car?
Hold this.
Tom is stunned.
What do they call your friend?
How did Tom get to Australia?
And who are you going to show the movie "The Others"?

They're still after us.
Be careful!
We all cheated on you.
You can go home now.
Thank God for that.
That's my opinion, not yours.
I'll get you out of here.
Everyone is from Australia.
All the sciences have been designed to shine a light on the limit.
Someone is eating.
I thought someone was dead.
What is a bargain?
No one ever listens.
Who is crying?
Tom kissed Mary.
Do you want to lose weight?
Tom was a dancer.
He promised me to come early.
You fools!
It took me hours to do that.
It must be too late.
Stop looking at me!
Stay here and wait until Tom comes.
Tom is honest.
Please don't leave me here with Tom.
You don't know who we'll meet.
Do you remember what Tom said?
Take off your shoes!
How long have you been in Boston?
There was someone outside.
I don't think I like Boston.

Go and get it.
I like to play.

She wants him.
When are you eating?
Are you married?
I guess I'm just tired.
You are a good student.
Please read it again.
Tom bought drinks for everyone at the bar.
Hello, my sweet.
Please come in.
Have you seen your sister?
Did anyone tell him?
I want to talk to someone.
Why are you saying such meaningless words to me?
Red is better.
You can get your money back if you want.
You are very brave.
Don't pay attention to two words.
When I moved to Boston, I was about thirty.
Someone is waiting for Tom.
Throw this away.
Here they are, tell me.

What do you see missing?
Someone else may have been hurt.

We need someone.
You are the liars. I am not.
The book is expensive.
Where is your son?

Have you seen the queen?
This book is not Tom's.
I don't know who you want to see.
Follow your dreams.
Tom spoke to Mary last night.
There may be other reasons.
Someone stole my food.
Let go of me!
They all agreed.
Be strong! I'm going to kill you!
Just buy my new car.
It's still warm.
My son went to Japan.
Have you ever talked to Tom in French?
Will you give this to Tom?
They make fun of others every day.
Where is your God now?
Sami started to lose his mind.
Tom likes to read.
The house!
Tom yelled at Mary.
Tom and Mary are not in Australia right now.
He read it to his sister.
God knows.
We are talking.
Are you Tom?
No one is surprised by you.
Tom loves to sing.
I hope someone will do that now.
Tom might be able to help you on Christmas.
The dog is asleep.
You should get used to it.
All my friends have one.
However, this new strain of the CoVid19 virus, which we did not develop, has passed us by.
We bought this from Australia.
Get out now.
Look at the road.
You told them a story.
Can you talk or not?
Do you know someone named Mr. Green?
The life!
Tom bought something from Mary.
No one understood Omar's rhetoric.
Have you read this?
You found them.
Call me tomorrow.
A bird that is not attached cannot fly.
Put him down.
Choose wisely.
Is he white?
Does God really call Muslims to kill non-Muslims?
She has a gold-digging card.
Tom could have seen something.
Who ran away?
Tom seems very scared.
Tom lied.
Where were you this morning?
Did you get a look?
Lidia, can you make something for Magdalena, Ania, Piotr and Lech?
Tom killed someone.
I'm not the one who's lying. You are.
Did you sleep a little?
I like art.
I'm not your lover.
Be good!
I'll introduce you to some friends who speak German.
Pay attention to your behavior.
I am very happy for you.
They all speak Romanian.
Get to know each other!
My garden is small.
He found them in the shade.
This is not enough.
You found Tom's bag.
They don't care.
Peter bought a cat.
What were you saying to her?
Did you come back from Tibet?
What did you say to Tom?
Tom is wearing his Halloween costume for school.
They all died.
Are you waiting for someone?
Someone is looking around.
The woman said, "Let me go, forest, I'm leaving you alone".
This lion was born in prisons.
Tom started work on October 20th.
We were waiting for them.
Don't tell anyone.
You are talking.
Someone is setting fire.
Open your books!
I think I'll start with a beer.
Tom knows that Mary has gone to Boston.
Get your clothes off!
There's nothing in his way.
He is a fool.
Come by tomorrow.
Hamed is jealous.
I think Tom doesn't speak French every day.
Take care of yourself.
Get up early, you'll find your place.
What are you wearing?
Someone has done it before.
Do it now.
Have you had lunch?
Do you remember what Tom said?
I can't wait to see your Halloween costume.
I'm not breaking anything.
You're too tall for him.
Thank you for your encouragement.
To learn a language, you must know the syllable of the numbers.
He lives!
Who heard?
Mary and Tom are not supposed to be together.
Someone stole my money.
I was surprised to see you.
Give it to him.
Tom nodded.
Stay with me.
Please answer.
Every morning I ask myself why.
I'm watching TV right now.
Someone has to do something.
Have you finished your work?
Could you please leave us alone for just a minute?
She lied.
His head is full of problems.
He's neither right-handed nor left-handed. I'm a bird.
She already knows the answer.
What do you like? What don't you like?
Who has you?
Where are we going? What do you see?
Where is your nephew?
Tom will follow Mary.
So what!
Try to find a cure.
Let go of me!
Tom is already on the bus.
You don't seem busy.
Can I go home now?
Tom nodded his head.
When are you coming to Algeria?
I heard him screaming, not a word to his brother.
You lied.
Tom won't believe me anymore.
What is considered beautiful in one language may not be so in another.
Has anyone been hurt?
It is snowing.
I like to eat out.
Someone stole my passport.
Tom is back.
We found Mary.
Who is the author of this book?
Latvian is a beautiful language, which produces music in a natural way.
Is that Tom's car?
Tom thinks a lot about Mary.
Are you sure you want to leave without saying goodbye?
Tofu goes well with sake.
Why would you think that?
Tom introduced Mary to the devil's church.
Tom is a coward.
She may be gone.
How can you fall in love with a girl who is not obviously innocent?
You took water from the well.
Do you think I look pretty?
Someone stole my food.
Sami sat on a chair.
Tom and I are separated.
Have courage!
I wish I could stay alone.
I'm not going to wash your car.
She had always thought him beautiful.
You can change that if you want.
Stop lying to me.
Is Muhammad a true prophet or not?
Who is there?
Have you gone mad?
Tom's well-being did not last long.
Tom lost everything.
Water, please.
I need someone to talk to.
Tom is good at public speaking.
I was just joking with him.
I don't like to play baseball.
I'll be off work in October.
They have enough money.
Tell everyone.
Are you having a problem?
Tom is dying.
Tom was seen on October 20 in Boston.
Tom is hopeless.
I'm glad to see you again.
Stop the fighting.
You and I love games.
I felt like someone was lying to me.
She loves him.
I'm sure your father is proud of you.
Someone told Tom the truth.
I can teach you how to cook.
Where did you first eat?
Tom has to tell someone again.
Tom is my true friend.
It was snowing.
Mary was a virgin.
Alice is sleeping in her room.
Tom called.
Shut up!
Who knows if this dress is good?
He smiled.
You are coming.
Is there anyone else here?
Tom cheated on Mary.
Please call him.
Sami and Layla were always fighting.
Do you want to read something?
I was the door for Tom.
Is there one you want to read?
Tom wore a Halloween dress.
I held it tight until it came out.
I needed to learn how to protect myself.
We all speak French.
He plays the guitar well.
Do you want your wife to speak in Esperanto?
He married his sister.
Someone is with us.
There's always someone there.
Can you get it to him?
I left you some messages.
Who owns this truck?
I'm a day late today.
You can't drive.
Someone is here.
You have already paid.
Australia is one of the few countries I visited last year.
It's really amazing.
Tom sent you something.
Is there anything you want?
Show me your shoes!
Go and change your clothes.
Is it already October?
You little pigs!
We are brothers.
Be good to people.
Please, can someone open the door?
I live in Azerbaijan.
What did you do today?
Are you crazy?
I'm crazy about you.
My uncle called me every three days.
This book is heavy.
Do you think I look pretty?
Are you dead?
Tom said we should wait here.
Leave it to us.
He was disappointed that he was not invited.
I am very happy for your company.
Tom went to Mary.
Choose one.
Your time has come!
She is talking.
Are you Canadian?
You guys! How do you think they're going to put the brass! I didn't see!
Mary helped Tom.
No one can beat you!
Some plants freeze quickly.
I'm singing all day.
I spent the day by the sea.
You can have whatever you want.
She came!
Listen to your teachers.
Tom is a respected man.
Everyone should leave their trust to themselves.
I know Tom's secret.
Are you all right?
Art is dead.
Aren't you friends of Tom?
He smiled.
This is for you.
Are you a human being?
Are you happy with this?
I called for help.
You like to dance.
Tom believes Mary.
It is a shame.
A person who is sick or injured is said to be awake.
I think so.
You'd be surprised what Tom drinks and beers when he goes out.
Are you expecting someone?
Are you awake?
Please forget this matter.
Tom seems busy this morning.
Follow me.
Take it easy, Tom. You're doing well.
I want you to try this.
Someone stole it from me.
Did you eat it all quickly?
Tom died on October 20, 2013.
Sami is also a painter.
Look at that!
Are you going swimming?
Someone stole my food.
She forgot it.
Are you going to sell your house to Tom?
I like games.
I don't want to tell Tom what happened.
Search that area.
Tom fled to Australia.
Mary was surprised by Tom's answer.
She knows the truth.
I didn't recognize him.
I'll do that too.
Tom was angry at Mary.
Is the wine good?
He's here to kill me.
No one sent me a letter.
I have a better idea.
I can't protect you.
Is he sick or not?
Who went with you?
Tom wants to make a lot of money fast.
Nothing has changed.
I have to meet Tom.
Look at something.
I'll take Tom's place.
Is this paper?
I'm at home.
You can go home now, too.
Where are your sisters?
Honestly, I didn't do what Tom said I would do.
Today, it's worth it!
Everyone paid for themselves.
Read it again.
Someone has gone to pay.
Keep writing.
I don't need your money.
Have the children eaten?
He is crying.
Why do you need a sword?
Tom currently lives in Australia.
I am a nurse.
It's the wind.
Tom and Mary are laughing.
Tom is asleep.
How can you be proud of such a man?
You're the one who's been living where I live.
Tom is deaf.
Are the pirates banned in Australia?
Someone will pay.
Tom forgot how beautiful she was.
We need to find someone who can help us.
It came from the highway.
He is tired.
She likes to fish.
Someone is staring at Tom.
I'm tired of growing up.
We were both tired.
Spring has arrived.
Is there anyone you want to see?
Tom took the keys to Mary's car because she was drunk.
You can't drink here.
Have a car!
Sami and Layla have been together for years.
Two witnesses kissed him.
I agreed.
His idea is better than yours.
Get up!
I hate computers.
Tom gave Mary a cup of coffee.
It was their idea.
They heard about Sofia.
Are you finished?
She stopped him.
Where is the answer?
Help us out.
Sami didn't look at me at all.
We have a guest.
Hit the wall!
Where did Tom learn French?
He was sitting reading a book.
Someone is eating.
Can you give Tom and me a minute?
Layla was dating a bad boy.
You can't prove anything.
Mary came in.
Stop complaining!
Tom can't solve the problem himself.
Sami doesn't know who Layla is.
How many books do you have?
You are idiots.
Nothing has happened.
He is a fool.
Keep reading.
He went to Spain.
We asked for 40 seconds ago.
Where is your son?
Tom complained.
They said nothing.
Someone is in trouble.
Please shut up!
You should eat something.
This is a very good man. And he is a president.
I read books.
Forget about Tom!
You're older than Tom.
I ate it.
Come to the house.
You asked Alex.
I like to swim.
Please protect me!
Once again I will not accept your mistakes.
Tom is dating Mary.
How much can you pay for that?
Why are you afraid?
You're ready to fly.
Mary has what Tom has at his age.
Come into my room.
I have to do this now.
Let the water flow.
It's spring.
Agatu will die on the 20th of October.
Did she give it away?
Dad, give me some vowels!
Please help us.
I was surprised to see you.
You continued to fight.
Does Australia have enough air conditioners?
I don't think it was Tom.
Tom took the wind off his shoulder.
It's old.
I left Australia on October 20.
Have you eaten your biscuits?
I see how you're reading.
Tom is afraid of his father.
Give me a drink!
Hello, this is Nancy.
I left.
I'm going to Paris tomorrow.
I'll take off my clothes tomorrow.
They don't know how to pronounce Tom's name.
Shut up!
I don't usually come to Boston in October.
Sami didn't stop.
She is afraid.
You are a problem.
The praise is filled with jealousy.
Did anyone see anything?
Someone called you.
I need someone to help me.
Just wait, old lady, he'll be back soon
Are you Chinese?
They both met in October in Boston.
Uli Rohde, a beautiful German woman, sings a love song in Kabyle in the land of the Kabyles.
Did you put everything in?
Someone has to do it.
Latin is a dead language.
Tom is the only one who needs to know about this.
You are safe.
How do you feel?
You look sick.
I'll do that, of course.
Tom and Mary seem to be close friends.
It is a miracle.
You want to talk to me, don't you?
I have money.
I love her, and she loves me.
Sami and Layla finally went to the party together.
Love is making you blind.
You are very lucky!
We know.
I know her.
Tom was robbed.
A black cat is eating a white cat.
I will go.
Take off your clothes!
Someone shouted.
She bought a bottle of water.
They were quiet.
We'll ask him for something else.
Are you surprised?
Which team do you like best?
Follow your sister's example.
He's close to my house.
You still don't understand.
Dinner is served!
I asked Tom to leave immediately.
Tom can't reach Mary.
Can you show me a picture, please?
Sami left his guardian angel there.
Are you kidding me?
Is this Japanese?
Did you see anything?
I need you here tomorrow.
Mary is waiting.
Tom seems sad.
Tom shrugged his shoulders.
He is a god.
Tom came back from Australia.
Tom has forgotten.
We talked about Australia.
Tom said he couldn't eat anymore.
He is not a child.
Someone has done it before.
I don't want to live with you.
I speak some French.
Tom told Mary that he was drunk.
I have visited many Asian countries.
My garden is small.
I would die for you.
Your work is limited to one thing.
Tom was hit.
Your work is limited to one thing.
By Uber.
These books are not Tom's.
I want to eat with you.
Take a rest.
Give it to whoever you want.
Can you watch Tom?
What did your mother say?
Tom's wife is Canadian.
I'm going to eat a banana.
You are not joking.
Tom wants to marry me.
I didn't sleep until the sun went down.
Tom thought that one day the deer would protect him from the grass.
She knows how to live.
I was very angry in October.
Can you help me, please?
Soul, get out of here.
Sami is a very difficult person.
The teacher was in my closet.
Please, I want this book.
I like funny stories.
I am a human being.
It's our turn!
Can this happen in Australia?
Call Tom.
October is only three months away.
You are happy.
It is a gem.
Don't make fun of me, Tom.
I'm not a cheat.
I was at your wedding.
What's in it if someone sees it?
The seeker will find.
There's nothing you can do to help.
Sami knows his limits.
Just let me see it.
I don't know why I'm laughing.
He seems fine.
I'm not your servant!
Have you been drinking a lot?
Someone has come.
Words are a feeling, words are a feeling.
Are you still in school?
You are part of the problem.
Someone wants to scare you.
We will discuss this problem in the third section.
My name is Jack.
Come and see us.
Tom can't possibly run.
Tom wants to make a lot of money by playing.
They made the roads.
I'd better tell him.
If you don't want to do it, you don't have to!
The baby with the disease was closely watched by doctors.
What a mess that was!
I like to write texts in my own language.
I'm tired of working.
Keep it to yourself!
Take care of yourself!
No one will find him.
Shouldn't you be working tomorrow?
There is no Nobel Prize in mathematics.
Please stop!
I want to see everything you've done.
Help me clean the garage.
Have you seen your table?
Tom said he'd leave tomorrow.
I am sorry for your success.
I'll see you in October.
It turns out I have a brother.
I'll buy this place if I don't have to take anything down.
Be cool.
I forgot your number.
Are you sleeping?
I'm starting a new life.
I was already thinking about you.
I like to eat pizza.
He who can move mountains can move rivers.
Tom was talking about Mary.
No one knows why.
We just finished eating.
Are you worried?
Do not go!
Take care of yourself.
Someone is lying there.
You'll find Tom very attractive.
We only did it once.
I know French.
You have a fever.
Does this make you happy?
You shouldn't be so afraid of us.
Someone called you.
I want to surprise everyone.
Is that the type you found, Tom?
Put your book down.
See you later, mother.
Tom said he had a day off.
You little shit!
You are a good student.
Someone broke this plate.
I thought I'd talk to you again.
I won't be alone.
Look for another one.
Tom started to laugh.
Which writer do you like?
I already know Tom.
Let her go.
She built it.
Do you want to tell him?
Who is this neighbor?
I'll try to help you.
No one is listening.
I want to learn Esperanto.
Please help me.
No one answered.
Who am I speaking to?
I'll be good to Tom.
My brothers!
I want a new dress.
Tom likes good cows.
This is from Australia.
Tom stopped smoking.
Someone has to stop Tom.
Be a friend.
What kind of girls do you like?
Your day has come!
Try to calm Tom.
Why didn't you take her home?
She is well.
Did you give Tom a birthday present?
Construction should start in October.
Tom is sometimes shy.
Can you speak Spanish?
Are you sick?
Say hello to me!
Do not speak!
I see things the same as you.
There is nothing.
Has anyone ever been in contact with a dog?
The day is beginning to dawn.
Do you have rice?
He loves himself.
Tom wondered why Mary hadn't done that again.
Tom is confused.
Tom is getting closer to Mary.
How much bread have you eaten?
This boy is fine.
You speak French very well.
I think there's someone in the front room.
Finally, it snowed.
He refused to believe her.
Who is this neighbor?
You play the guitar.
I am very happy for you.
I need the truth.
This house is very small.
Don't forget your money.
Enjoy your holidays.
Tom is a rich man.
Someone is watching.
You saved him.
It could be true.
Every question has an answer.
Tom will show you how to do it if you ask him.
Stop whining!
How many of us will be there?
A friend of mine called me last night.
Tom ran outside to see what was going on.
I saw someone kiss Tom.
You can read this book.
Tom loves you.
You should change your ways.
Someone is or has been there.
Are you here alone?
Close your eyes.
Who said that?
It's good for you.
We serve with what we have.
They don't want me to buy them anything.
I haven't said anything yet.
Teaching English is my job.
Tell them I'm here.
I think he ate his own food.
I need someone to help me.
I decided to tell the truth.
Layla heard the noise outside.
Sami was a fool when he was young.
Do Mary and Tom understand French?
Are you at home?
Where are you from?
Tom is being waited on.
They will do as I tell them.
I don't want Tom to stay.
Who said that?
Is this the first?
You are alone.
My wife has a lot of work.
I don't have to say anything.
There's no need to smoke.
You have a very beautiful smile.
He doesn't say anything.
Tom wasn't like that.
Why aren't we coming home?
I want to talk to someone.
I did nothing.
Sami watched the video.
I turned to the right.
Remember last year.
Tom bled.
Let's dance together.
Someone has to do it.
To your health and better days!
You can have whatever you want.
Horses for yourself!
I love you very much.
Tom works for Mary.
This is a gift for you.
Just take me home.
I think Tom deserves that.
Tom Jackson is my favorite writer.
I wanted to kill you.
Nobody knows who killed Tom.
Ask him about it!
She forgot English.
Tom collects old things.
No one listened to the conversation.
I'll take this one.
You have already paid.
Tom misses you.
Look at yourself.
I wish he hadn't told Tom the truth.
Mine is bigger than yours.
It's a good car!
I know Tom is a spy.
Eat all you want.
What sport do you prefer to watch?
Please don't forget to say hello to your family.
Tom was afraid of Mary.
May I ask who you are?
You forgot about me.
Teachers should explain everything in detail, not just call and tell students to go home and read their books.
Tom didn't drive his car today.
Who's the last?
Are you ready?
Are you people?
What we lack makes us stronger.
Have you become a nun?
Most Hollywood films have a happy ending.
That's all for now.
Whose truck is this?
We jumped over there.
Has anyone called the security forces?
We should call Tom.
Do you watch TV every day?
We are expecting guests this evening.
Get out of here!
I don't know what to tell Tom.
We can do it if we want to.
I can ask you to walk with me.
They say that whoever does something will do it again.
He drank Tom.
What a shame!
Are you serious?
Are you drunk?
The famous Kabyle writer Mulud Faraun, who wrote the OAS's dissident manifesto in 1962, once said: "We know what we are only when we become someone else".
I need someone to help me.
He will learn French.
I think it's a beautiful place.
I'm here for you.
I think Tom and Mary are tired.
We didn't stick with Tom.
How long?
Sami doesn't need that.
The path to the bottom is to take it straight ahead.
I hope Tom is upset.
His father didn't help.
I hurried home.
The religion of man is more open than the religion of God.
I didn't hear anything.
Do not go!
I don't eat raw fish.
I eat and drink.
I thought you'd recognize Tom.
Prove that.
Leave it all behind.
I'm not a girl.
Do you like dogs?
Do you like football?
Champagne, please.
I want you to work with them.
Sami didn't like that.
She tried to steal my nose.
Tom is ready to kiss Mary.
Who are you waiting for?
I want to know who's coming with us.
Someone should stop you.
Tom yelled at Mary.
I just want to tell you that I love you.
Who is your brother?
Were you here alone?
Sami has known Layla for many years.
Go on through!
Mine is bigger than yours.
You can kill anyone.
Beauty is bright.
I don't understand what the teacher said.
I can't believe Tom kissed me.
He spent a few months in Scotland.
I'm going to eat the onion.
We are trying.
Your day has come!
Why?
There is no idea.
Have you read the book "The Last Summer of Reason" by Tahir Ja'at?
You fool!
Please call Tom in.
Will you be in Boston next Monday?
Did someone call you?
She can't love you.
Tom lives in Australia.
Tom has spoken many times.
Tom's hair is black.
Don't forget your phone.
It's not a problem at all!
The snake is biting!
Have you seen my sister?
How do I correct typographical errors in Kabyle in LibreOffice?
Why are you alone?
The Muslim god only understands Arabic, but one can pray to other gods in any language you choose.
Your father is a coward.
You need a good wife.
Something is missing.
Show me your car while you're driving.
Some stars began to appear in the night sky.
Add another cup.
What will you have for lunch?
What happened in Boston?
I know Tom is from Australia.
Tell him tomorrow.
He refused to let me sleep.
Why don't you do that?
Let Tom go.
Tom married Mary.
Mistakes were made.
Someone has to do something.
Shut up!
Just talk to them.
I want to see your sister.
What would she know?
I'm going to learn English now.
We'll do it again.
I didn't speak French when I got there.
You are welcome to continue working in a place like this.
What do you want her to do?
Thank you, that's all.
Tom is getting married in October.
Don't you think you can solve this problem yourself?
Is there anyone you want to see?
Sami was trying to get better.
Sami was young.
Both of my parents were born in Boston.
He asked his friend.
She cleaned the whole room.
Tom couldn't get into Harvard.
I don't think you talked to me.
The government was putting a foot on the people.
Grandpa likes to read.
I want to see my son.
Tom loves his job.
Sami is not satisfied.
What did your doctor say?
Open your eyes.
I am a whore.
Do you understand?
You made me laugh!
He knows how to play with words.
I want you to lock the door when you leave.
Close your windows!
He will arrive tonight.
Tom looks tired.
You come to see me sometimes, don't you?
He cheated her!
Are you Japanese?
I'm close.
How I lied to you!
I was in love with her.
Tom is a fool.
Can you do more than that?
Tom took his daughter to school.
It's a shame!
They shouted.
Please take it slowly.
They started singing.
Tom was born on October 20th.
Tell me what I should have done then.
This is for you.
Mary said Tom did it.
Do you know?
Show yourself!
Tom loves both of us.
I want to make her happy.
My father is a doctor.
Tom is sober.
He crashed his car into the garage.
He can talk.
You are all ready.
Why do you want to run?
We should have not done it.
Tom was in Boston on October 20th.
Will you invite me to sleep with you tonight?
They made him a fool with a stick.
Tom has put me to a lot of trouble.
There's someone outside.
You have a white book.
When are you leaving?
Are you worried about something?
Were they fired?
A sentence has how many points.
What time do you want to eat?
Someone killed Tom.
Tom seems to be worried.
Give me your scholarship.
He cleaned the room.
Please cut it.
Do you think I should do that or not?
Cannibal Corpse is an American death metal band.
Tom is waiting for someone.
Mary agreed.
The horse is passing.
They left.
Polish is my mother tongue.
No one listens to the talk.
My arms are empty.
Tom called Mary.
Our work is so exhausting.
I'll go next week.
I heard something.
Tom is a bigot.
Tom said we should wait.
Shut up Tom!
I didn't know you couldn't sing.
There's nothing in it!
I know Tom is grateful.
Someone is poisoning us.
I called my lawyer.
How much do teachers pay?
What do you say?
Tom began to speak.
I'm obvious where I'm going.
The Turks like to talk.
I'll take your suggestion.
I don't think Tom would want to do that.
Will someone tell me what happened here?
I haven't kissed Tom yet.
There is no joke.
I am Russian.
Is there anything you want to see?
We will send someone.
Did someone call you?
Someone is waiting for you.
Tom didn't show up.
I haven't been home since October.
I didn't eat too fast.
Tom cheated on Mary.
Bring it back!
Your work is well done.
I didn't eat the food.
I read.
I don't know.
You're freaking me out!
I was just as lucky as you.
Someone called.
Keep your eyes open.
Is something bothering you?
I've been waiting for hours.
Sami followed Layla on Instagram and she followed him.
Someone died.
We suspected him of being a liar.
Stop it!
Please stay.
You are wrong.
Clean your room.
I smoked when I was young.
Tom was honored.
Thank you, Sherlock.
Someone left his umbrella.
No one is listening.
We'll talk to Tom on October 20.
Can't you eat with us?
Did you pray?
Sami got into Layla's car.
I told Tom that I would never go to the store with him again.
Is that true?
Will he play guitar, then?
Tom talked to the crowd.
I will arrive on October 20.
How many books do you read about bad luck?
You were in Boston.
Tom talks a lot.
Can anyone tell me why Tom is upset?
Do you remember when you did it?
Tom is dying.
Welcome to the club.
You seem to be right.
He found himself.
They stopped.
Call Tom now.
Tom needed someone to help him.
Does this dish have sweet and savory?
How much yogurt did you eat?
It is good.
Tom will stay.
Tom and Mary explained why they were there.
I'm from Australia.
I was told a few days ago.
I wish I was in Australia next summer.
Tom wanted to kiss Mary.
You are really cute!
The last person I met with thought I was a fool.
Here, shake it a little.
Let him do it.
Tom will be here next week.
Tom is here, isn't he?
I like to dream.
Have you eaten well?
You were cheated.
You are a genius!
We don't use force to the point of being forced.
The bell came.
Tom didn't take off his shirt.
Sami went to a football match.
Are you eating?
It is a common practice in the Kabyle Region.
Tom was lying to Mary.
Someone could get hurt.
Well, I have to finish this work by tomorrow.
Ask Alex what he wants.
Stop fighting each other.
I didn't know you had a brother.
No one asked you.
He likes to walk.
No one is listening.
Follow this car.
Get out of here!
Did you see anything?
I love this game.
I fight for my body.
I am not your servant.
He is old.
The children are making a lot of noise.
Read this!
I won't marry you.
Tom studied law.
He speaks five languages.
Try another.
Stay here.
We'll stay with him.
Wait for him.
The crowd laughed.
Write it in French.
Clean up your room.
We hope this will never happen again.
Tom started this week.
Do you remember me?
He dug his own grave.
Tom can't eat himself.
Do you think Tom loves me?
Please go home.
Take it easy.
I am happy.
She refused his help.
Did you clean it?
Stop reading!
I understand you know a lot about Australia.
Tom is the public investigator.
You are a fool!
You're too hard on yourself!
Tom wanted to marry Mary.
We should tell Tom.
You'll find your hand dropped from running to get out of the car.
I've already read this book.
Won't you come to my house?
You are obviously wrong.
He is afraid of death.
Did you see anything?
Poison yourselves.
Not yet.
Get out of here!
The Kabyle eagle loves all the eagles of the world.
Are you resting?
We must respect people's rights.
Sami did not complain.
Can I have a snack?
Where are we now?
He sometimes forgets to put books in the trash.
The class is upstairs.
Tom loved French when he was in school.
A sentence has how many points.
Do you want to eat now?
Close the door.
I'll be leaving soon.
Tom isn't in Boston right now.
Tom told me you weren't good.
Is that the name of the little shop next to where Tom works?
It's almost.
Nothing hurts like the truth.
She took him to court.
Are you a foreigner?
Someone called.
Go see if anyone can help.
Where did you make them?
Run along!
No one hates you.
I know we're different.
Did you enjoy your trip to Boston?
I forgave the chicken and added her milk.
You sound like your mother.
Why didn't Tom text me back?
Tom has been in prison since October.
If you eat it, you will die.
I hope you had a good day.
What is this?
Did you learn to play guitar?
What do they call you?
Tom is only looking for beautiful girls.
Someone held me by the arm.
Don't swim here.
Are you writing a letter?
He told me a story that was unbelievable.
Layla's sisters were her friends.
I'm sorry I won't be staying long in Boston.
Please go.
Do you have a house in Australia?
They are angry.
Tom is worried.
Is there anyone else you want to see?
It's just a matter of luck.
Are you sad?
Tom brought his brother.
I hate my computer.
Do you want food?
Did you hear me?
The one who tells the truth will slit the throat.
Tom lives in Australia with his family.
Sami started eating.
So why are you here?
Do you know my wife?
Are you happy being in Portugal?
They have water.
I was eating something.
Do you have any friends?
You have a good job.
Tom has a sister in Australia.
They made their way to the library.
Stop being a dreamer.
What are you most afraid of?
I was a police officer.
Is your stomach running?
Tom didn't like him but he liked him.
I hope no one saw you do it.
I want to go with you.
Do you think Tom committed suicide?
Keep searching!
You won't pay.
Tom was surprised that Mary didn't do that.
I like wine.
Why are you laughing?
You made mistakes.
It's cold outside.
I wonder what it is.
I need some light.
Please don't forget what we said.
We are so excited about this beautiful weather.
The time is passing.
I can help Tom.
What is holding them all back?
I think you want the job.
Did something happen?
You should sleep.
Don't tell anyone.
Who stole the computers?
Tom was confused.
I fell.
You're scared of Tom.
Follow your sister's example.
I don't want to stay at home.
They'll listen to me.
Nobody likes that.
Tom knows where you live.
It's just a bubble here.
No one knew.
Please be reasonable.
The world is full of idiots.
Tom was arrested.
We'll start sending people to work in October.
Do you have a minute?
I'm going to Australia.
Hello, what's your name?
Do not move.
I'm sorry for you.
They died.
Call us when you get there.
What are you wearing?
Leave me the truck.
Tom said he didn't feel well.
I got a ticket.
I ate a book.
I'm eating a shrimp.
I haven't read any of his novels.
Finish your bag!
You are all sick.
You'd better go.
When do you want me to call you?
You wash your clothes.
Why did you go there?
They are the same age.
You should stay away from them.
The man I thought was my friend read me.
Tom was born in the 90s.
Sami was reading his Bible.
Maybe you should stop.
No one knows why.
What else?
Can you read this?
Tom saw everything.
I don't want to be disturbed.
The Kabyles respect all races.
Tell him that.
Has anyone been hurt?
He likes to walk.
You are the best.
I saw someone kiss Tom.
That's not what I'm saying.
Someone is following you.
You're off your dress.
We watched the movie together.
Women are all about the breaking up.
Gather your strength.
Do you understand?
You are a judge.
Will you pass the exam?
Please don't forget what we said.
How many books do you have?
Does Tom have to stay home today?
Sami still has Layla's pictures.
Someone stole my watch.
I want to die.
Give up the dream.
You are sick.
This is Nina, your granddaughter.
Are you alone?
Nobody cares about him.
I know Tom can win.
They ate bitter pepper.
I hope you're right.
Go on !
You should come with me.
Call me now!
Can you take Tom home?
She speaks Portuguese.
When did you return from Germany?
You should be careful.
Can you help me?
You shouldn't go to work.
Can you help me, please?
What's your name?
Are you new?
The room is heating up.
Get up!
Who are you waiting for?
Try to hurry it.
How could Tom not love me?
Hello to all of you.
We should go.
Will you leave me?
Paul was born in Rome.
He can sing.
Have you read this book yet?
Stop moving!
What were you doing when I called you this morning?
It is impossible.
You're wearing a suit properly.
Don't make up your mind.
I hope no one saw you come here.
The soldier refused to fight!
Do you want to eat?
I think you ate a pie!
I don't know what to tell you.
Are you Canadians?
I want you out of town.
No one is sorry.
Today is October twenty.
Aren't you happy that he's rich?
Tom got there before Mary.
Tom has a guitar.
I like the dress Mary is wearing.
Will they be sorry?
This is going to work.
Have you read this?
I never tried to dress up to do that.
I'm sure you'll like it.
She is a liar.
Tom is angry, isn't he?
You should come with me.
Tom lived with his uncle in Australia when he was a university student.
Tom's hands are heavy.
Your day has come!
Is there anyone here?
Tom is a snitch.
Tom is smoking.
Sami was trying to calm Layla down.
Tom and Mary were sitting in the back.
I believe you.
Tom is a bad boy.
October is still three months away.
You are Korean.
Tom doesn't like Mary.
The birds and the bees are falling.
How far did you give them?
Where is your nephew?
I am an American citizen.
Layla was being tortured.
Wait for something.
You need to rest.
He asked about you.
Computers make people stupid.
Sami is a friend of Farid.
He's a white man.
How long can I stay here?
Did someone call you?
Don't eat the food.
Don't throw him a knife in the face.
I felt like I was being played.
There was no moon.
You should go.
Tom doesn't marry anyone at home.
When did you go?
I thought you'd recognize Tom.
Tom is better than anyone.
You speak quickly.
They want to learn English.
Tom didn't say anything.
I love you, Tom.
Please go!
There is no doubt.
You are lying.
I just got back from school.
This is very good.
What is your friend's name?
Do you know how Tom looks at you?
They cut the tree.
Don't worry about food if you don't like it.
Take care of yourself.
Are you angry?
Then, different dreams came true.
Are you teachers?
Are you lost?
Is there nothing you can do?
Someone has taken my place.
Let's sleep on it.
Try to find Tom a job.
I will never forgive you.
It was a very good day.
I'm waiting for a phone call.
You know the way.
I know Tom isn't Canadian.
Writing is good for you.
I'm going to smoke!
I don't care about this story.
Are you going to Boston tomorrow?
You're both very nice.
Tell Tom you lied.
Just get in bed.
I can teach you how to sing.
I'm your friend.
You're either drunk or not.
Tom and Mary swim all the time.
I haven't done that since October.
Think about your future.
I took Tom to his home in Boston.
I hated him to death.
How do you like her new novel?
You are a witch.
Tom said he wouldn't go to Mary's party.
He understands with his eyes.
Why should I do this alone?
Why are you reading this?
Someone is following Tom.
Get in here!
Tom doesn't like Mary.
Change your clothes!
You must learn from your mistakes.
Tom didn't complain about Mary.
What time do you think you'll leave?
Are you tired?
I've ruined your sleep.
Has anyone died?
The back door is open.
I eat.
They said nothing.
Make me a sandwich.
Nothing stopped Tom from reaching his goal.
Tom said he never learned French.
I was drunk.
Love your Kabyle culture.
He gave us everything we needed.
Someone might hear you.
Why is no one speaking?
It's hot today.
The tiger doesn't understand the tiger.
Have you heard her new song?
You are blinded by love.
I think it's not right.
Darwin wrote about the evolution of species.
Someone wants to kill me.
Where are you from?
You shouldn't go to work.
I made a doll for Ann.
Running is a good sport.
Don't worry about food if it doesn't suit you.
I saw one.
I can't do it without someone's help.
Tom told everyone he was hungry.
Tom lost his cell phone.
A dog is following us.
She is not a witch.
I'm not trying to say I don't want to go to Boston.
You are screaming.
Do you think I look pretty?
Bring me a glass of wine.
Have you never worked with them?
Is Tom still here?
Tom and Mary got married in October.
You are in Boston.
I still remember doing that.
Someone is coming.
Lisa, how are you?
I cut it in half.
May I ask who you are?
I'm not going to wash your car.
Get up here!
I'm hungry as a dog.
I don't want to eat here.
Tom's dog is cold for Mary.
Ask your neighbor.
You can go home now.
Haven't you read this book?
The elder learned to write.
Someone stole my suitcase.
Don't worry, your problem will only be solved.
I'd love to go fishing with Tom again.
Tom was killed by Mary.
What do you want then?
I obviously forgot we weren't called.
Tom was in love with me.
Tom tried to save Mary.
I don't want you to sit here and watch me get hurt.
I learned Latin because it's my favorite language.
I'm going to snow today.
What do you want?
Someone made a mistake.
Please give me a coffee!
We often speak French to each other.
Where are you going today?
Please do something.
Get started !
I need someone to talk to.
I think you tried to read us.
My hand is out.
Tom is being watched.
You're the one who lied. I'm not.
He came!
Don't worry about the bad.
Are you American?
Can we ask you some questions?
Tom couldn't save Mary.
The case of the conspiracy was dubious.
I like to play.
Tom is outside.
Is it true that Tom is going to Boston?
Someone is waiting for you.
It was good!
I couldn't do it without your help.
Tom lost his mind.
He wrote a love poem.
You can use my description.
You should look up this word.
Sami is sitting outside in this heat.
He likes to read.
Have you read this?
You are grown up.
Have you eaten?
Someone planned to kill Tom.
Where will you be on October 20th?
Tom cut his hair.
That's how I got to know them.
I'm lucky to have met you here.
You need to rest.
I like summer.
Try it more.
Are you alive?
Get up!
Please, don't hurry.
Tom was younger than Mary.
I don't care about that at all.
We really like that.
We got married on October 20, 2013.
Please clean up.
Have you read this?
I don't think Tom needs our help.
Tom has a heart condition.
I don't want to hurt you. I want to help you.
Can you walk Tom home?
Are you a Buddhist?
If you eat it, you will die.
Tom is finished.
From the heart.
Just look at my new car.
Tom eats often.
Again, what is it, please?
What time is it in Boston now?
One of them is a wimp, and he's old enough to be a wimp.
What is the name of the song you are singing tonight?
Stop right there.
Are you Russians?
Tom ate something.
Are you married?
He is struggling for his livelihood.
Shut it down.
Are you crazy?
Honestly, I don't want to know.
At first, he couldn't speak any English.
I told you this would happen.
Can I ask a question that is not helpful?
Tom was surprised.
Where are you?
Whoa!
Tom was against Mary's hiring.
Keep this.
Why don't you kiss someone?
Let's try something.
Tom will be back next week.
Please stay.
You are real.
Are you talking?
I've already read this book.
I don't eat here.
Tom isn't afraid to ask for help.
You are hot!
Tom lives in Australia, right?
I know all his friends and what he told them to do.
Someone stole my shoes.
Your parents love me very much.
I'm the only one in this group who doesn't speak French.
They are all waiting.
He won, and they kissed me.

I left.
He is a jerk!

I am a Muslim, but I like wine.
Tom is a fool.
Are you shitting me like that?
Having a good garden will add value to your home.
I hope I didn't write a will.
They are suspicious.
I hope Tom is strong.
I'm honored to work with you.
Can't you see we're talking?
It's work.
Do you understand?
Who wrote this sentence?
Someone saw you.
What's the weather like in Boston?
