This not only confirms the popular theory that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, but also reports details that could not be provided by fossils  such as color and three-dimensional imagery.
Scientists say that the animal's plumage was a chestnut-brown top with a pale or carotenoid underside.
The discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since dinosaurs' feathers lack a well-developed rod called a rachis, but have other features of feathers - teeth and beards - researchers have concluded that the rachis probably evolved much later than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight but rather for temperature control or beauty, and the researchers suggest that although this is a tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen shows a mature operculum rather than a chick's plumage.
The researchers hypothesized that although this was the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen demonstrated adult plumage rather than infant plumage.
A car bomb detonated outside the police station in the Turkish city of Gaziantep yesterday morning, killing two police officers and injuring more than 20 others.

They concluded that the Sun functions on the same basic principles as other stars: it turns out that the activity of all the stars in the system is determined by their luminosity, their rotation, and nothing more.
Luminosity and rotation are used together to determine the Rossby number of the star, which is associated with the plasma flow.
The lower the Rossby number, the less active the star is in relation to the changes in the magnetic field.

The work done was mostly theoretical, but the program was designed to simulate the observation of the galaxy in Sagittarius.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the Moon pulls on the Earth, causing tides, the Milky Way also affects the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as normal matter.
This theory says that most of the dark matter in the galaxy is arranged around the galaxy in a kind of halo and is made up of many small particles.

In France, voting has traditionally been free of high-tech technology: voters go to the polling booth one by one and put a pre-printed piece of paper with their candidate on it in an envelope.
After the officials have verified the identity of the voter, he deposits the envelope in the ballot box and puts his signature on the voters' list.
The French electoral law is quite strict in encrypting the procedure.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have been required to be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes at the beginning of the voting, and no envelopes are added except those that are thrown by duly registered and authorized voters.
Candidates may send representatives to observe each stage of the process, and evening votes are counted by volunteers under close supervision, following certain procedures.

Chief of Police Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the accused appeared in court with his face covered.
Although three people were inside the house when the car crashed into it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered severe head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency responders rescued the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was first taken to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was subsequently transferred to Addenbrooke's Clinic in Cambridge.
Adeboye was tried in the Edinburgh Sheriff Court on charges of murdering her son.
She is in custody awaiting arraignment and trial, but the testimony of any witness could be disputed as her photo has been published frequently.
In other parts of the UK, this is common practice, but Scottish justice works differently, and the courts have seen the publication of the photographs as potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that "journalists are clearly taking a dangerous path by distributing photos and other data of suspicious individuals".
The prosecutor's office, which is generally responsible for prosecutions, told reporters that it would not comment further, at least until charges were filed.
This document, according to the leaked information, will refer to the conflict over the borders that Palestine wants to establish on the basis of the borders that existed before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other subjects likely covered include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both peoples, and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel demands to maintain a military presence in the valley for ten years after the signing of the agreement, while the PA has agreed to leave such a presence for only five years.
Hunters in the auxiliary pest control had to be carefully monitored by rangers, as hunting was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In partnership with the UNFPA and the Sport Shooting Association of Australia (ASSA), qualified volunteers were recruited as part of the Sport Shooting Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of the NSPDP's Parks and Heritage Conservancy, the four shooters selected for the first shoot-out operation received proper safety instructions and training.
Martelli was sworn in yesterday as a member of the new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (PEC).
This is the fifth time that Martelli has been elected as a councillor in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous TVC as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelli's response to the massive protests against the regime that began in October.
Sometimes, violent protests have been triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which have been delayed since 2011.
There were about 60 reported cases of overheating from malfunctioning iPods, which caused a total of six fires and caused minor burns in four people.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METP) said it was aware of 27 emergencies related to these devices.
Last week, the IETP announced that Apple had notified it of 34 additional incidents of overheating that the company had called "unrelated".
The ministry responded by calling Apple's call with the report "a great pity".
The quake struck Mariani at 7:19 a.m. local time (around 9:19 p.m. on Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Agency reported that no damage was reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no sign of a tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman held Hong Kong tourists hostage after hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot tourists with his M16 rifle.
At least six hostages are now reported dead.
Six hostages, including children and elderly people, were released earlier, along with Filipino photographers.
The photographers later took the place of the senior lady because she needed to go to the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a medical career.
He trained as an obstetrician-gynecologist and was employed at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to study premature birth in his spare time.
His research showed that the injection of the hormone accelerated the embryonic development of the baby's lungs.
Xinhua reported that on Wednesday, state investigators recovered two of the plane's black boxes.
The fellow fighters also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Extreme Queen. My first manager. Luna died in the night two months later. Quite unique as she is. A strong woman".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented, "Moon was as much a wretch as I am...maybe even more...I love her and will miss her...hopefully she's in a better place".
Of the 1,400 people polled for the 2010 federal election, the number opposing Australia becoming a republic has risen by 8 percent since 2008.
Interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believes Australia should become a republic after the end of the reign of Elizabeth II.
Thirty-four percent of those polled agreed that Queen Elizabeth II should be the last monarch of Australia.
Looking at the categorical responses to the poll, 29% of respondents believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe Australia should not become a republic at all.
The Olympic gold medallist was due to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and take part in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, doubts were raised about his fitness.
He could not take painkillers, which are forbidden during the Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, found the largest known prime number.
Some people confirmed the discovery using various gadgets and PCs before the beginning of February, and it was reported on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water and organic matter that could have formed proteins and sustained life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed, because comets have collided with the Earth for a long time.
Cuomo, 53, became governor earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political babble and folly".
There's a rumor that he's running for president in 2016.
NextGen  is a system that, according to the Federal Aviation Administration, will enable aircraft to fly on shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel and reduce carbon emissions each year.
It uses satellite technology, as opposed to the more outdated technology of ground-based radar, which allows air traffic controllers to identify aircraft with maximum accuracy and provide pilots with detailed information.
No additional transport is launched and ground trains will not stop at Wembley, and carpooling and interchange car parks will not be available on the surface.
Concerns over the lack of transportation made the team consider holding the game behind closed doors without any fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the formation of a new species of bird on the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although it was thought that the process would take much longer due to the breeding of the endemic Darwin's hedgehog, Geospis fortress, and the migratory cactus hedgehog, Geospis coniorostris.
Gold can be given many different shapes, and it can be rolled into tiny shapes.
It can be woven into a fine thread that can be twisted and knitted, and it can be hammered or rolled into leaves.
It can be made very thin and glued onto another metal, and it can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books called illuminated manuscripts.
This is called the pH of the chemical, and you can make an indicator using the sap of a red pumpkin.
The sap of the capsule changes color depending on how acidic or basic (false) the chemical is.
The acidity level is indicated by the number of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the test chemical.
The  hydrogen ions are protons that have lost their electrons (since hydrogen atoms are composed of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two powders by rolling them in a dish, then with clean, wet hands, pour them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, providing a strange sensation and forming something like a shell.
A toilet connected to a complex sewerage network was in almost every house in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro.
Remnants of sewage systems have been found in houses in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets were also used in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, where men and women were kept together in mixed companies.
When you make a phone call to someone thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
A satellite in space receives a call and then almost immediately reflects it back.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket, and scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere is distorting the light and what we see.
It takes a heavy-duty rocket at least 100 feet high to get a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways, and the greatest thing it has done for us is make it possible for us to do transportation much easier and faster.
It has given us trains, cars, and many other means of transportation.
Below are larger numbers of medium-sized cats, which feed on medium-sized prey ranging from crows to antelopes and deer.
There are many small cats (including free-ranging domestic cats) that hunt for numerous small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success lies in the concept of the niche, a special position each cat occupies that keeps it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of all cats, and live in large groups called pride.
The pride includes one to three adult male relatives, as well as up to thirty females and young.
Women are usually closely related to each other, being a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion packs behave much like wolf packs or dogs - animals that are strikingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and equally dangerous to their prey.
As an all-round athlete, the tiger can fight high (though not very well), swim, jump long distances, and punch five times as hard as a man.
Tigers are in the same group as lions, leopards, and jaguars, and these four cats are the only ones that can growl.
The tiger's roar is not like the full-headed roar of a lion, but more like a confused roar.
Ocelots like to eat small animals, and they will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can, and almost all the animals that an ocelot hunts are much smaller than it is.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and stalk their prey by scent, searching for their scent on the ground.
They have night vision, which allows them to see in the dark, and they also move very quietly, hunting their prey by hiding in their surroundings and then jumping out at them unexpectedly.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) separates from the main population from which they originate (for example, if they cross a mountain range or a river, or if they move to another island and thus cannot easily return), they can often find themselves in a different environment than the one in which they were previously.
In this new environment, different resources and different rivals, so the new species will need to develop new traits or become a stronger rival than it was before.
The population's roots haven't changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as new populations begin to adapt to their new environment, they begin to look less and less like other populations.
Eventually, in thousands or even millions of years, these two populations will look so different that they can't be called the same species.
This process is called speciation, the formation of new species, and speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen, which humans breathe, and absorb carbon dioxide, which humans exhale.
Plants cook food from the sun by photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our houses from plants, we make our clothes from plants, and most of the food we eat is plant-based.
Mosasaurus was the top predator of its time, so it was afraid of nothing but other Mosasaurus.
Its long jaws were lined with over 70 razor-sharp teeth along with their extra set of teeth on the upper jaw, meaning that no one who got in its way would be spared.
We don't know for sure, but it's possible that he had a double tongue, that his diet included turtles, big fish, other mosasaurs, and that he was even a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that got into the water; not even a giant dinosaur like the Tyrex could match it.
The Romans ate mostly what we know, but they also had their own strange and unusual feasts, including wild boar, peacocks, snails, and a rodent called a wolf.
Another difference was that while the poor and women ate sitting on chairs, the rich men enjoyed having communal banquets, where they rested on their sides during meals.
Ancient Romans could not have used the foods that came to Europe from the Americas or Asia centuries later.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a central temple for each god, which was considered the home of the god.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and priests tried to satisfy the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary, which only the priests could enter.
At times, special pyramid-shaped towers were built as part of temples and were called ziggurats.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, houses were no longer so important.
Most of the life of this Jewish family was spent outdoors.
Women cooked in their backyards; shops were the usual open stalls facing the street; houses were built in stone.
There were no large forests in Canaan, so the wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. The Old Norse sagas tell that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder and, traveling further west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But despite its discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there.
Although each country was 'Scandinavian', there were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you watched the movie Treasure of the Nation, you might think that the treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although the document does have a name on the back, it is not a treasure map.
The back of the Declaration of Independence was inscribed with the words "The original of the Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776". The text is at the bottom of the document and turned upside down.
There is no information about its author, but it is known that at the beginning of its existence the document (it measures 293⁄4 by 241⁄2 inches) was kept in a folded state.
Thus, it is quite possible that the record was added simply as a label.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles had liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
It was the French Vichy, the French who made a peace treaty with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies landed in southern France, and this landing was called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, the Americans and the forces of the France-Fighting movement liberated the south of France and moved into Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture of a large group of people living and working together, a society.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin word "civilis", meaning "civil", which refers to the Latin word "civis", meaning "citizen", and "civitas", meaning "city" or "city-state", and it also defines the size of society in a certain way.
City-states can be seen as the precursors of nations, and civilized culture presupposes the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a stable cultural footprint, and a uniform distribution.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving any significant historical evidence, and are therefore not recognized as full-fledged civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, thirteen states formed a weak central government for the first time  Congress was its only component  under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress lacked the power to impose taxes, and because of the lack of a national executive or judicial branch, it relied on state agencies, which often failed to cooperate in the enforcement of all its acts.
Nor did he have the authority to overturn tax laws and interstate tariffs.
The Articles required unanimous consent from all the states before their amendment, and the states were so unconcerned with the central government that their representatives were often absent.
The Italy national football team is the second-most successful team in the world, along with the Germany national football team, and were the 2006 FIFA World Cup winners.
Sports such as soccer, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 motor racing are well-known.
Winter sports are most popular in the Northern regions, where Italians compete in international games and Olympic events.
Japan is made up of some 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making it the 7th largest island in the world!
Geographically, Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago" because of the cluster/group of islands on which it is located.
The origins of Taiwan date back to the 15th century, when European navigators, sailing past, recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company opened branches in southwestern Taiwan, beginning to transform the aboriginal grain production practices and hiring Chinese laborers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty forces (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, declaring Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, in which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Wicons.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of what they looked like originally.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the world's most common still photographic image format is 35mm, which was the main format at the end of the analogue film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio has been adopted by digital camera image sensor formats.
The 35mm format is actually a bit of a shock, 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The ratio of sides of this format (divided by twelve to get the simplest ratio of integers) is therefore 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. the APIES family of formats) are equal to or very close to this proportion.
The often used and derided rule of thirds  is a simple guide that creates dynamism while maintaining a measure of order in the image.
According to him, the most effective place to place the main object is the place of intersection of lines that divide the raster into three thirds vertically and horizontally (see Example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, having become rich and powerful, came under intense scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, Christianity held the European nations together despite differences in language and customs.
His omnipresent power affected everyone from the king to the common man.
One of the main Christian positions is that wealth should combat suffering and poverty, and the church's funds are designed to do just that.
The church's central authority was in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money caused many to question whether the church had really been following this postulate.
Soon after the sudden outbreak of hostilities, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, though the blockade violated the generally accepted norms of international law codified by several international treaties over the past two centuries, cutting off vital military and civilian supply routes.
Britain mined ore in international waters to prevent ships from entering large areas of the ocean, endangering even neutral vessels.
As the response to this tactic was limited, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing mood of most citizens and nations was pacifism and isolationism.
Realizing the horror and brutality of the First World War, nations were determined to prevent a similar situation from occurring in the future.
In 1884, Nikola Tesla moved to the United States of America, in order to apply for a position at the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents in his pocket, a collection of poems and a letter of recommendation from Charles Butchellor (his manager at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, different time periods were depicted in a unique way; each stage of the country's development was each ruling family, becoming a prominent dynasty.
The most famous of these periods was the Songho Period, which lasted 60 years between the Qin and Han dynasties.
These were times of fierce warfare between many nobles vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest in ancient Chinese history  thousands of people died in the battles for the throne in the great palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political influences, such as the adoption of the metric system, the change from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the state belongs to the people rather than to a single individual ruler.
Also after the Revolution, jobs were opened up to all willing men, giving the most ambitious and talented the opportunity to succeed.
The same is true of the military, because instead of military ranks being based on class, they were now based on qualities.
The French Revolution also inspired many representatives of the oppressed working class in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond this worldly life, and he frequently visited the cave that became known as the Hira, on Mount Nur, for meditation.
The cave itself, which has survived to this day, gives a very vivid picture of Mohammed's spiritual inclinations.
The cave is located on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
It's actually quite difficult to find, even if you know it exists, and once you get to the cave, you're completely isolated.
There is nothing to be seen but the clear, beautiful sky above and the many mountains around, and very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World that has survived to this day.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., is one of many great pyramids built in honor of a dead pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, also known as the "Necropolis of Giza", in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, contains several pyramids (most of which are the  Pyramid of Cheops), small tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor the Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The "upper" button looks like a "V" and the "lower" button looks like a bracket or a square without a bottom.
Up means you start with the head and push the string, and down means you start at the pegs (where your hand holds the string) and pull the string.
The upward movement of the hand typically produces a softer sound, while the downward movement of the hand is louder and more forceful.
Feel free to add your own markings, but note that the printed markings for brass instruments have a meaning, so they usually need to be taken into account.
On 6 October 1789, a mob of women from the market chased out of Versailles the terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two young children (the 11-year-old Marie-Thérèse and the four-year-old Louis-Charles) and the King's sister, Madame Élisabeth, and forced them to return to Paris.
They returned to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a mob that was shouting and threatening the king and the queen's people.
The yuri forced the king and queen to keep the windows of their carriage wide open.
At one point, a member of the gang waved to the frightened queen the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles.
The military expenses of American imperialism during the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the US colonial regime to pay a large part of the costs and interest on loans placed on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
The profits from the continued exploitation of the Filipinos would, of course, be the main achievement of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, you have to understand the context that gave rise to the Order.
The era when these events occurred is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, a period of European history spanning the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 C.E.).
The Classical Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which is generally considered to have ended around 1500.
Technological determinism  is a concept that actually covers a wide range of ideas, from the advancement of technology or the technological imperative to the idea that human destiny is strictly dictated by the underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two common ideas: that the development of technology as such follows a path that is largely beyond cultural and political influence, and that technology in turn has "impacts" on societies that are more inevitable than socially conditioned.
For example, one might argue that a machine necessarily leads to the construction of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is economically unviable for a small number of cars, so new production methods are being developed that allow the cost of owning a car to be reduced.
The mass ownership of cars is also leading to an increase in road accidents, which is leading to the development of new health care methods for treating bodily injuries.
Romanticism has borrowed a significant element of cultural determinism from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time, customs and culture associated with that geography emerged, and those, while in harmony with society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
It is noted for being the epicenter of a luxury that began about 400 C.E. and continued until about 1100 C.E.
In the 12th century, its position deteriorated mainly because the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were valued more than in the Byzantine markets.
It was at this time that the title of the fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
Early dress of the people of the East was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture.
However, because of slow communication channels, Western styles can lag behind by 25-30 years.
In the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style, and one of the greatest achievements of the time was the Crusades, which led to the use of the gourd to stitch clothes.
Non-commercial agriculture  agriculture whose purpose is to grow enough food to meet the needs of the owner and his/her family.
Natural farming is a simple, often organic system that uses prepared seeds from plants native to the ecoregion in combination with seeding and other comparatively simple techniques to maximize yields.
Historically, most farmers practiced organic farming, and this still persists in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel ignored by societal norms and allow them to gain a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be defined by age, ethnicity, social class, place of residence, and/or gender of members.
The qualities that define a subculture as a distinct phenomenon may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic or a combination of factors.
Members of subcultures often express their belonging through the distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion items, mannerisms, and jargon.
One of the most common ways to illustrate the importance of socialization is to take a few stories of poor children who grew up in neglect, misery or intentional cruelty, and were not socialized as adults.
Such children are called "jungle children" or savages, and are often held captive by humans (usually their own parents); in some cases, parents abandon children because of the unacceptable severe mental or physical disabilities of the latter.
It may be that the wild children were the objects of cruel treatment or suffered serious injuries before they were abandoned or escaped.
Some were allegedly raised by animals; others were said to have lived in the wild.
An uncivilized child raised by animals behaves almost the same (within physical limits) as the corresponding guardian animals, for example, treating people with fear or indifference.
And while design technologies are supposed to make learning easier and more fun, scaffolding goes further.
Scaffolding is not a method of learning, but rather a help provided to individuals who are learning new material, such as a new computer program, or starting a new project.
The scaffolds can be virtual or real, in other words, the teacher acts as a signpost, like a little human-shaped box in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds in software are designed to ask, suggest, and explain procedures that may be difficult for students to learn on their own.
Children are given to families for a wide range of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even violence.
No child should grow up without care, attention, and education, but they do.
We feel that the foster care system should be a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system includes safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
The foster home is meant to provide everything that they lacked in the home from which they were taken.
The Internet is both a mass medium and a means of interpersonal communication.
The distinctive characteristics of the Internet have led to additional dimensions in terms of approach to use and enjoyment.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are presented as significant motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "sustaining relationships" were also identified as new aspects of motivation by Egme and McCord (1998), when they examined audience response to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important breakthroughs in the interpretation of micro-expressions  facial movements lasting a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that it is possible to determine whether a person is bald by correctly interpreting the micro-images.
In his article "The President's Speech", Oliver Sacks pointed out that people who are unable to understand language because of brain damage are nevertheless able to accurately determine sincerity.
He even suggests that animals, such as domestic dogs, may have such a capacity to interpret human behavior.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two types of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds a new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the set of variations that have been expressed.
Segregation and recombination change the variation between the two reservoirs with each generation.
For primates with a digestive system like ours, it is difficult to meet their amino acid needs with the plant resources available in the savannah.
Moreover, failure to do so can have serious consequences - depression, malnutrition, and death.
The most available plant resources would be proteins in leaves and beans, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest if we don't cook them.
In contrast, animal foods (ant, termites, eggs) are not only well digested but also provide a significant amount of protein, which contains all the essential amino acids.
Given all these things, we shouldn't be surprised if our own ancestors were solving the protein question in much the same way that chimpanzees do in the savanna today.
Sleep interruption is the process of purposefully awakening during a normal sleep period and falling asleep after a short period of time (10-60 minutes).
This can be easily done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without waking you up completely.
If you find yourself resetting the clock in your sleep, you can place it at the other end of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options based on biorhythms involve drinking large amounts of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bed, which causes you to wake up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace that a person has is the exact opposite of the amount of tension in his body and mind.
The less stress, the more positive life force there is, and each person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone is capable of achieving enlightenment, and the only thing that can prevent us from achieving it is our own stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has been supplemented by the path of Mahayana love and many techniques of Indian yoga.
Overall, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, it's a combination of Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of all-encompassing love.
Through Kundalini yoga, the kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened from the yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantra and visualizations.
The central focus of Tibetan meditation is the yoga of the gods, where the visualization of the various gods clears the energy channels, activates the chakras, and forms the consciousness of enlightenment.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. With the end of the war, the conflicts of systems, processes and cultures led to these countries clashing.
Two years passed after the war ended, and the former allies became enemies, leading to the beginning of the Cold War.
It was to last for the next 40 years, and it involved actual fighting between the armies of countries on the battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences had already been broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian beachhead.
However, these plans were discontinued almost overnight, when over 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Red Army entered and formed the Belorussian and Ukrainian Fronts after occupying the eastern regions of Poland, thus violating the Treaty of Rzeszki, the Non-Aggression Pact between the USSR and Poland, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships to transport goods is certainly the most efficient way to transport large numbers of people and goods across oceans.
The job of a naval force has traditionally been to ensure that your country retains the ability to move its people and goods, while at the same time creating obstacles to your enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this is the North Atlantic campaign during World War II, when the Americans tried to move people and material across the Atlantic to help Britain.
Meanwhile, the German navy, using submarines as its main ships, tried to stop the movement.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain as well as the rest of Europe.
Goats were probably first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to raise them for easy access to milk, wool, meat, and skins.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that moved over hills and other pastures, and were tended by goatherds, often children or adolescents, better known as shepherds. These methods of herding are still used today.
The first carriage road was built in England in the 16th century.
And although the paved roads were essentially two parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses working on them to develop greater speed and to pull heavier loads than on the slightly more rugged roads of the day.
Shallows were introduced to hold rails in place early on, but it gradually became clear that rails would be more effective if iron was installed on top of them.
This became common practice, although the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the carriages.
The first fully iron wheels appeared in 1767, and the first fully iron rails were made in the 1760s.
The first known movement was walking, humans started walking upright two million years ago, with the appearance of Homo erectus (which means man walking upright).
Their predecessors, the Australopithecines, did not walk in the upright position that is commonly used.
Bipedalism is found in fossil Australopithecus fossils dating from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although sahelanthrops may have begun walking on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly lives, join the environmental movement, and even become activists to at least reduce future suffering.
In many cases, it's just treating the symptoms, but if we're not looking for a temporary solution, then we need to get to the root of the problem and fix it.
It is quite evident that the world has changed dramatically because of mankind's scientific and technological progress, and the problems have increased because of human overpopulation and extravagant lifestyles.
After Congress passed it on July 4, the handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to John Dunlap's printing office a few blocks away.
During the night, 150 to 200 copies were made, now known as "Dunlop Broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was made by John Nixon, in the courtyard of Independence Hall, on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9, and a copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap posters are now known to be the oldest surviving copies of the document.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and are alive and kicking. We call them birds.
A lot of people don't think of them as dinosaurs, because they have feathers and they can fly.
But birds still have a lot to learn from dinosaurs.
They have legs with scales and claws, they lay eggs and they walk on two hind legs, like tyrannosaurs.
In fact, all computers that are used today are powered by information encoded in binary form.
In a binary number system, there can only be one or two values, such as 0 or 1, and in computer jargon, these numbers are called binary digits or bits.
Symptoms such as vomiting are too common to diagnose right away.
The first sign of poisoning may be the presence of an open vial of a medical drug or toxic household chemical.
Read the label for specific first aid recommendations for this particular poison.
Formally, entomologists describe this group of insects as beetles.
The term reflects a centuries-old familiarity with bed bugs, which are insects that are very well adapted to parasitize humans.
Both cone-bearing and bed bugs are nesting insects adapted to living in the nest or dwelling of their host.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease among middle-aged and younger people.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain and spinal cord, and the optic nerve.
Studies have shown that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their child.
Such parents may decide to create an adoption plan for their child.
Adoption involves the loss of parental rights to the biological parents so that another couple can raise the child.
The whole point of science is to use the scientific method to find out how the world works, and that's really what drives most of the scientific research.
Although it's not just experimenting, an experiment is a test used to rule out one or more possible hypotheses; asking questions and observing also guides scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers, focusing on classical texts, especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all matters of science, including psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior are often strongly dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their operation through the biological clock.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic factors, are found in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks  are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue a period of a cycle that is freely executed even in the absence of external signals.
The Hershey-Chase experiment became one of the main hypotheses in the question of whether DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into the bacteria.
They conducted two experiments, labeling the DNA of the bacteriophage with radioactive phosphorus, or the protein of the bacteriophage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have many different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the genetic material and whether the cells are attached to germ line cells.
Only mutations in germline cells are passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery, including plant and animal wildlife.
Examples of outdoor activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and learning about the ecosystem.
Another example is visiting and photographing orangutans in Borneo, as well as learning new things about them.
Every morning, people leave small provincial towns in their cars to go to work, and other people who work in the places they have just left drive by.
In this dynamic flow of transportation, everyone is connected in one way or another to support a transportation system based on private cars.
Now science is saying that this massive carbon economy has shifted the biosphere from its stable state that has supported human evolution for the last two million years.
All of them live in communities and use transportation systems, but few of them complain about them.
You don't hear that in developed countries, complaints about water quality or bridges that are falling down.
Why do transport systems complain so much and fail so often? Is it because transportation engineers are incompetent? Or is there something more fundamental?
Traffic flow  is the definition of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points, as well as their interaction.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flows is difficult because it is impossible to predict the behavior of a driver with 100 percent accuracy.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave quite coherently; thus, traffic flows tend to have some logical sequence, and may have an approximate mathematical model.
To better represent the flow of transport, the relationship was established between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These ratios help in planning, designing and operating roads.
The cockroaches were the first animals to take to the air, and their ability to fly helped them avoid enemies and find food and mates more efficiently.
The advantage of most insects is that they can fold their wings along their bodies.
This opens up a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
The only insects that can't fold their wings are the beetles and the day-flyers.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the entire solar system revolved around the sun.
Some people believed he was right, but many people believed the opposite: that the solar system revolved around the Earth, including the sun (and even other stars).
It makes sense, because we don't feel the Earth moving, do we?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth, and it holds eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes as wide as 6 miles.
A full 20% of the water that flows from the world's rivers to the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon's main watershed is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long, and it collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, the Giza pyramids were never surpassed in either size or technical perfection of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the structures of their predecessors, which were by then well over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is about 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world, and also the country with the smallest population.
In its legislation and official communication, the Vatican uses Italian.
Italian is also the language of daily communication for most of those working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of the Vatican are Roman Catholics.
People have known about the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper since ancient times, because they are all found in nature in their native form, and are quite easy to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything was made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
It was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, although he also hypothesised that they transform into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are usually a mixture of two or more metals, and remember, there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals, and then of course there are metals like silver and gold.
You can also get alloys that will include nonmetallic elements, like carbon in small amounts.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly tiny that trillions of these particles could fit into the dot at the end of this sentence.
Thus, the pencil has become a good friend to many people since its appearance.
Unfortunately, with the advent of new writing methods, the pencil's status and use declined.
People now type messages on a computer screen without ever having to go near a wiper.
We can only guess what the keyboard will be like when something new is invented.
The way the atomic bomb works is that it takes energy to bring together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like a heavy truck being rolled up.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning that they tend to decay with little or no boost.
The surface of the moon is made of rocks and dust, and the top layer of the moon is called the crust.
The lunar crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thin beneath the moonlit seas and thick beneath the high mountains.
There may be more lunar seas on the near side because the crust is thinner, and the lava could have been more easily lifted to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what makes people tick or what they like.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that were acquired by them in the process of adulthood.
These theories cover certain people and what makes them want the things they do, and what things in their environment make or don't make them do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Two general behaviors can occur when managers start managing their former colleagues: on the one hand, they try to remain "one of the guys" (or girls).
This type of manager has trouble making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary measures, evaluating performance, allocating responsibility, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, the person becomes an unrecognizable personality who feels like they have to change everything that the team has done and do it their way.
Ultimately, the leader bears full responsibility for the team's success and failure.
This behavior often leads to friction between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams follow the same standards of perfection as regular teams, but there are some differences.
Virtual team members often act as points of contact with their immediate real-world group.
They often have more autonomy than regular team members, as their teams may meet with regard to time zones, which may be unintelligible to their local supervisors.
The presence of a true "invisible collective" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual collective.
The "invisible team" is a management group to which all members report. The invisible team sets standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the process of implementing an organizational learning that takes so much time?
When all available resources are used efficiently across functional departments of the organization, creativity and inventiveness can emerge.
As a result, the process of the organization working together to overcome obstacles can lead to the emergence of a new innovation process to meet the needs of the client.
Before an organization can be innovative, management must create a culture of innovation as well as knowledge sharing and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of productivity.
Neurological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognitive abilities, and so they narrow the field of search and make it more precise.
Scientists are encouraged by the link between brain pathology and behavior.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, injuries, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and lead to changes in some mental functions.
The advent of new technologies allows us to see and explore structures and processes in the brain that no one has ever seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our consciousness.
Although AI has strong connotations with science fiction, AI forms a very important sub-field of computer science that studies machine behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation.
In AI research, machines are forced to automate tasks that require intellectual behavior.
Examples include control, planning and design, the ability to respond to customer assessments and questions, and handwriting, voice and face recognition.
These things became separate disciplines focused on solving real-life problems.
The AI system is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the armed forces, as it has been embedded in several applications related to home computers and video games.
Excursions are an important part of any classroom, and often the teacher would like to take the students to places that are not accessible by bus.
Technology offers solutions with virtual classroom experiences, where students can look at museum artifacts or admire fine art while sitting with their class.
A virtual tour  is also a great way to reflect on the trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students at Bennett's School in North Carolina create a website each year about their trip to the state capital; the website is updated every year, but older versions are kept online as an album.
Blogging can also help improve a student's writing skills. While students often start their blogging experience with a poor grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience usually changes that.
Since students are almost always the most critical audience, bloggers start trying to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging also "provides students with a better awareness of the world around them".[22] The need to satisfy the audience's interest motivates students to be intelligent and curious (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to learn well outside the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs can inspire students to become more analytical and critical; actively responding to online material, students can define their positions in the context of others' articles, as well as outline their own views on particular issues (Orovets, 2002).
In Ottawa, Canada's beautiful bilingual capital, there are a number of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south is Niagara Falls, and further north is the unspoiled natural beauty of Musco and beyond.
All of these things and more are highlighting in Ontario what outsiders think is the quintessential Canadian.
Large areas further north are fairly sparsely populated, and some are almost uninhabited wildlife.
A population comparison that may surprise many: the United States has more African Americans than Canada has citizens.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is now the largest, and is a continent in itself when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent countries or associated with France and are known as luxurious beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to these lands, and it took root in the Comoros and the Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered a sea route around Europe's Cape of Good Hope to India.
To the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel region, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: All female travelers are advised to say they are married, regardless of actual marital status.
It is also wise to wear a high heel (but not one that looks too expensive.
Women need to realize that cultural differences can result in what you might consider to be stalking, and that it's not uncommon for you to be followed, to be grabbed, and so on.
Say no to men and don't be afraid to stand up for yourself (cultural differences or not, it's not normal!).
The present town of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Marinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese completely destroyed it and then rebuilt and called Casa Branca, and in 1755 after the earthquake left it.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city under the name of Darou-i-Badiya, and the Spanish merchants who established trading bases here gave it the name of Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Near the old Medina, it is easy to find traditional Moroccan goods such as crowns, pottery, leather goods, brass and a whole range of trinkets, but that's all for tourists.
Goma  is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the extreme east near Rwanda.
In 2002, the city of Goma was devastated by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the streets in the city, especially the city center.
Although Goma itself is relatively safe, before any travel outside its borders, it is necessary to study the situation with the fighting still going on in the province of North Kivu.
It is also the base for the climb of the Nyiragongo volcano, and one of the cheapest hikes in Africa to observe mountain gorillas.
To travel around Goma, you can use a boda boda (motorcycle taxi).The usual (local) price is ~500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
Because of this, and the relative inaccessibility of the name, "Timbuktu" has come to be used as a metaphor for exotic, distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, yet it has an airport and attracts tourists with its history.
In 1990 it was included in the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the main stops during the PBS reporting of Henry Louis Gates's Wonders of the African World.
The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the country, as it has more of an Arab flair than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa and stretches along the border of Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 square kilometres (11,950 sq mi) and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, each of which holds different representatives of wildlife.
It is one of the major landmarks of South Africa and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, visitors are charged a daily fee for security and admission.
It may also be advantageous for someone to buy a Wild Card, which entitles one to certain South African parks or to all of South Africa's National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives the territory of Hong Kong its name and is a place of special interest to many tourists.
The parade of buildings that make up Hong Kong's architectural face has been compared to the brilliant histogram that Victoria Harbour has to offer.
To get the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the opposite port side of Kowloon.
The vast majority of Hong Kong Island's urban development is densely located in the swampy area along the northern coast.
This is a place that was taken over by British colonists, so if you're looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest coastal strip of mangrove forest, stretching 80 km (50 mi) from the coast to the inland areas of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within the Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
These forests, however, are not just mangrove swamps, for they include some of the last remnants of the mighty jungles that once covered the Indo-Gangetic plain.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, about a third of which is covered by water or marshland.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now 400 royal Bengal tigers and some 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (across the river) during the day, although most of them, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumtang, depart from 06:30 to 07:30.
As inter-district buses are often crowded, it is recommended that you buy a ticket a few days before the trip.
Most areas are served by small Japanese buses called "Koster", which are comfortable and durable.
The  route taxi is a quick and convenient way to travel to places located nearby, such as Paro (150) and Punakha (200).
The Oiapoque River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that connects the Oiapoque River and the city of Oiapoque in Brazil with the city of Saint-Georges-de-l'Oiapoque in French Guinea.
The bridge is 83 metres (272 ft) high and 378 metres (1,220 ft) long, with two lanes for motor vehicles, each 3.50 metres (11.9 ft) wide.
The vertical span under the bridge is 15 metres (49 ft).[citation needed] The structure was completed in August 2011, but not opened to traffic until March 2017.
It is planned to be fully opened in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs posts will be completed.
The Guaraní were the most significant indigenous group inhabiting what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who sometimes engaged in subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was also home to other indigenous groups, such as the Guaicuru and the Payagua, who survived on hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, clashes between Spanish conquistadors and indigenous groups created Paraguay, formerly called the "Giant Province of the Indians".
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is well known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest event of the year is held in December at the polo fields in Las Canitas.
Small tournaments and matches can be seen here and at other times of the year.
Check with the Argentine Polo Association for tournament news and tickets for the polo matches.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), which is set at the equivalent of the British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank in the islands, which is located in Stanley across from the FIC West store.
British pounds are generally accepted anywhere on the islands, and many establishments also accept Stanley credit cards and U.S. dollars.
In remote islands credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, although British or United States currencies may be accepted; check with owners in advance to determine what is an acceptable method of payment.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the Falkland Islands, so change your money before you leave the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there while it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics; in the summer months temperatures above +30°C are common.
Winters can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely fall below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity make you feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no "rainy" or "dry" seasons: the amount of rain falls almost constantly throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park have become accustomed to humans, wild animals are still wild, so they do not need to be fed or cared for.
According to park guidelines, keep at least 100 yards [100 yards] from bears and wolves and 25 yards [25 yards] from all other wild animals!
As meek as they may seem, buffalo, deer, moose, bear, and almost any large animal can attack.
Dozens of visitors are injured every year because they don't keep their distance, and these animals are big, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them a break.
Also, remember that smells attract bears and other wild animals, so take along and do not cook spices with the smell and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on the island of Upolu, and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbour became the site of a notorious naval standoff in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to leave.
All but one British cruiser was sunk, and about 200 Americans and Germans were killed.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city led to the assassination of the supreme leader of the Tupo, Tamaseze Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, due to Auckland's location between the two harbors, with the most popular being in the three districts.
The North Shore Beaches (in the North Harbour area) are on the Pacific coast and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of them are sandy beaches that are safe for swimming, and most of them are shaded by coconut trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located in Waitemata Bay, in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St. Helier in Central Auckland.
These are family-friendly, sometimes crowded beaches with lots of shops along the coast.
The main local beer, "Number One"  is simple but tasty and refreshing. Another local beer is called "Manta".
You can taste a lot of French wines, but New Zealand or Australian wines may be better able to withstand transportation.
Local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but if you're worried, bottled water is easy to find.
The concept of "flat-white" coffee is unfamiliar to Australians. Short black is "espresso", cappuccino is made with bitter cream (not with foam), and tea is served without milk.
This hot chocolate meets Belgian standards, and the fruit juices are not cheap, but they're delicious.
Many trips to the reef occur year-round, and injuries caused by any of these reasons on the reef are rare.
Nevertheless, listen to the advice of the authorities, observe all the signs, and pay close attention to the warnings of danger.
The Kubo-medusa is found near beaches and river estuaries from October to April north of 1770.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of people and swim away.
Sea crocodiles do not spend much time in the ocean, their main natural habitat being the river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler peace of mind that he will have a place to stay once he arrives at his destination.
Travel agents often work with specific hotels, although you can try booking accommodation with them, such as camping.
Travel agents typically offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, or even combined airline and hotel packages.
They can also reserve a reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain other documents for your trip (such as a visa).
Any changes or requests should still first go through the travel agency, not directly through the hotel.
In the case of some festivals, a significant majority of visitors to music events choose to stay overnight, and for most visitors, this is an important part of the adventure.
If you want to be close to the action, you'll have to arrive early to take a seat closer to the stage.
Remember, even if the music on the main stages has stopped playing, there may be sections at the festival that play music late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you're crossing the northern Baltic Sea in winter, be sure to have a cabin, because traveling through the ice makes a pretty awful noise if you're too close to the source.
Cruises to St. Petersburg involve spending time in the city. Passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see conditions).
Casinos generally make a great deal of effort to maximize the time and money spent by guests.
They usually have special offers of food, drinks, and entertainment to keep guests in good spirits and indoors.
Some establishments offer free alcoholic beverages, but drunkenness impairs judgment, so all good gamblers know the importance of keeping sober.
Anyone planning to drive at high altitudes or through mountain passes should take into account the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snow-covered roads, friction is low, and it is not permissible to drive on bare asphalt.
During a storm, enough snow may fall in a very short time to trap you in it.
Visibility may also be limited by falling or blowing snow, or by water or ice forming on car windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are normal in many countries, and road traffic continues unimpeded throughout the year.
The safari is perhaps Africa's biggest tourist attraction, attracting many visitors.
The term safari in general usage means a journey by land to enjoy the incredible African wildlife, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach cars, so standard equipment will allow for good viewing.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are voracious, and they are best observed through binoculars.
A bushwalk safari (also called a bushwalk, a "hike safari" or a "hike") is a hike of several hours or days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021, with some events taking place in venues across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, hosting the games in 1964.
If you booked your 2020 flight and accommodation before the delay was announced, you may be in for a difficult situation.
The cancellation schedules vary, but as of late March most cancellation schedules due to the coronavirus have not been extended until July 2020  the time the Olympic Games are scheduled to take place.
It is expected that most tickets for the event will cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with regular tickets costing around 7,000 yen.
Many hotels offer a washing machine and a washing board for rent, even if they are not in the room.
If you don't have a comb, or you don't like to wear a comb, then you can try using a hair dryer if one is available.
Be careful not to let the fabric get too hot (which can cause a lump or, at the very least, a splinter).
There are different ways to purify water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some places, boiling water takes a minute; in others, it takes several minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies, so if you have problems, consider purchasing water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pests of animals unknown in their native lands.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or, worse, cause allergic reactions, spread venom, or transmit infection.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill a person, are not usually considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is the ability to buy goods exempt from taxes and excise duties in certain places.
Travelers to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on such goods as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The most challenging section of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Freeway is the section between Point Marion and Fairmont, as it often passes through an isolated forested wilderness.
If you are unfamiliar with country roads, note that they are dominated by steep slopes, narrow paths, and steep inclines.
The posted speed limits are significantly lower than those in the previous and subsequent sections  usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h)  and it is extremely important to adhere to them.
Interestingly, however, the mobile connection is much better than on many other sections of the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastry is quite good, and Bavarian pastry is quite rich and varied, similar to that of their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastry is quite common: apples are used in the pastry all year round, and cherries and plums are used in the summer.
Many German pastries also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts, and popular pies often taste especially good with a cup of iced coffee.
If you want a small but tasty pastry, try one called "Berliner", "Pfannkuchen" or "Krapfen" depending on the region.
Curry is a dish consisting of herbs and spices combined with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the inland areas of Northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is traditionally added to curries; in South India and some other coastal areas of the subcontinent, coconut milk is traditionally added.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is an umbrella term that encompasses the wide variety of regional cuisines that can be found across the nation.
But when used without further specification, the term usually refers to food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine is now very widespread throughout the archipelago and offers a wide variety of simple spiced dishes, among which the predominant flavors are peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), as well as a variety of aromatic spices.
The saddle  is a support for the rider's column, which is suspended on both sides of the saddle.
They provide the rider with more stability, but can be dangerous due to the potential for the rider's foot to get stuck in them.

However, the Schengen area in this sense acts as one country.
By staying in this zone, you can usually cross the border without having to go through passport control again.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, you don't have to get a visa for each of the countries that are part of the Schengen area, which saves time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what is considered antique, and some tax agencies characterize goods over 100 years old as antiques.

Transgender people who have not yet had surgery should not expect to pass through the scanners with their privacy and dignity intact.
Reflective currents are the countercurrents from waves that break off on shore, often on a reef or similar.
Because of the underwater topology, the backflow is concentrated in a few deeper areas, and there can be a rapid current into the deep water.
Most deaths occur as a result of the fatigue of trying to swim backwards, which may be impossible.
Once you're out of the current, the backflow is no more difficult than it usually is.
Try to head for a place where you won't be caught in the current again or, depending on your skills and whether you've been spotted, it may be better to wait for rescue.
Re-entry shock occurs earlier than culture shock (less than the honeymoon phase), lasts longer and can be more severe.

Although the coastal archipelago and the largest lakes are actually large enough for any yacht, smaller boats and even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, considering that every seven people there are boats.
This compares with Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but is in general quite unique (for example, in the Netherlands, the figure is one in forty).
Most of these notable Baltic Sea cruises are characterized by a long stop in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can spend several full days in the historic site, returning to the ship for the night.
When you go ashore only on boat trips, you do not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some cruise brochures include Berlin, Germany, as shown on the map above, but Berlin is far from the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.

However, it is not cheap: you can usually expect to pay four times the standard economy fare for business class and eleven times the first class!
In general, on direct flights from point A to point B, there is no point in looking for a discount on business or first class seats.
