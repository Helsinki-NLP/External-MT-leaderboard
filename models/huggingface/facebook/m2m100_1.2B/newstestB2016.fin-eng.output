Nine-Year-Old Boy Found Escaped in New York
Police have been on a search for a 9-year-old boy who escaped in Tampere on Tuesday night.
A disappearance report about a boy who had gone out of West Tampere with his boyfriend has spread on social media.
According to the police, the child has been contacted and is not in danger of life or health.
The boy’s father told the Evening-Sanom at midnight that the boy had been found.
He is well, and we are now going to start the investigation.
The boy was found near the house, the father told me.
Ronaldo once again crushed Messi
Cristiano Ronaldo scored five goals in the Spanish league this weekend and continued to play in the Champions League.
The battle between Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo for the Champions League goalkeeping turned at least for a moment in favor of the latter.
Real Madrid’s Ronaldo moved alone to the top of all-time goalkeeper statistics when he shot guest Shahtar Donetsky into the net with two hits on penalty shots and one on the pitch.
Ronaldo raised his score to 80, after having 77 goals at the Barcelona Mess, which had been matched with him before Tuesday.
Real won the match 4-0.
Juventus has compiled in the Italian football league in Serie A from the beginning of the season, but in the Champions League Group D it started strongly with a 2-1 visiting victory over Manchester City.
The goal was scored ten minutes before Juventus’s Alvaro Morata.
The City attack was annoyed by the absence of the kneeling Sergei Aguero.
Aguero, who was injured in the weekend's league game, arrived on the pitch only in the last ten minutes.
Manchester United also suffered a tough match in the Netherlands against PSV Endhoven after suffering a 1-2 loss.
ManU’s 20-year-old goalkeeper Luke Shaw’s visiting match lasted only a quarter of an hour.
PSV’s Hector Moreno’s dangerous-looking slide hit the ManU squad so badly that Shaw probably broke his ankle.
Shaw lay on the lawn of his home stadium in Eindhoven for ten minutes before the medical staff left to transport him to hospital.
Memphis Depay led the guests 1-0 in the 41st minute, but ManU’s joy only lasted a few minutes.
Moreno plunged ahead of the break.
PSV won in the second half by Luciano Narsingh.
In the Champions League, Paris Saint-Germain played in the A-Group.
Manchester United’s Angel Di Maria was the Argentine player.
Di Maria broke through from the right and lifted the ball to the back of Malmö goalkeeper Johan Wiland.
Edinson Cavani scored PSG 2-0.
PSG is among the most successful.
The assumption is not wrong, but Malmö, which belongs to the league’s small clubs, is not the best possible benchmark.
PSG striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic will face Malmö FF for the first time in his professional career.
Ibrahimovic began his career in Malmö in 1999.
Roman Eremenko played 90 minutes when his team, Moscow TsSKA, lost 0-1 to Wolfsburg in a B-Group match in Germany.
Opposition calls for immediate resignation: President made the wrong speech
Zimbabwe’s President Robert Mugabe gave the same speech he had given a month ago.
Zimbabwe’s President Robert Mugabe has held the same speech in parliament last month.
During his 25-minute speech, Mugabe apparently did not realize that the speech was the same.
The speech raised doubts as to whether the 91-year-old Mugabe is fully alive.
The main opposition party MDC has urged Mugabe to resign as this is too old to rule.
Mugabe’s assistants rushed to say that confusion had only occurred in Mugabe’s staff and that the president had done nothing wrong.
Mugabe’s speech addressed the impact of China on the country’s economy in the past and now.
Germany and Austria call for emergency summit on refugee crisis
Germany and Austria have called for an extraordinary summit next week over the refugee crisis.
President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, will review the request.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel said leaders should discuss cooperation with countries of origin and how to more effectively register Europeans.
Negotiations on quotas for asylum seekers are on the table of the interior ministers.
Professor admits to shooting his girlfriend
University professor Shannon Lamb called for an emergency call while shaking police at his home and said he shot his girlfriend.
Lamb specifically mentioned that their beloved dog was there and alive and probably scared.The professor said that the contact details of the family of the deceased woman would be on the woman's phone.
Inside the house, police found Amy Prentiss's body and a handwritten message on a white paper: "I'm very sorry and I hope I could cancel my actions. I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me," a letter signed by Lamb read, according to authorities.
There was no indication in the house that Lamb, who taught two online courses at Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already travelled 500 miles away to the school campus. Police found Ethan Schmidt, a dead historical professor, who was believed to have been shot by Lamb, at the door of his office on the campus.
Delta State University police chief Lynn Buford said university officials were notified of the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
According to him, Lamb made a fatal emergency call some time after that.
One day there was another death. Lamb took his own life when the police reached him.
The day after the shootings, students and teaching staff stood behind locked doors, and authorities were still trying to find out Lamb’s motive.
The researchers examined the details in both locations, and the teachers who knew Lamb told them about the man. The researchers got a picture of a talented but possibly troubled teacher.
The students said they were always looking forward to the lectures of the professor.
According to the police in the town of Prentiss, where Gautier died, the professor had no previous violent or criminal status.
Schmidt, on the other hand, had mentioned Lamb in a book in which he had paid tribute to the "hidden people" with whom he was allowed to spend his academic life.
Both worked at the Department of Social Sciences and History, with a teaching staff of 17 people. Many of the students attended courses for both men.
However, indications of problems have emerged.
Brandon Beavers, a student who praised Lambia, said the professor seemed excited and nervous, “as if he had something in trouble.”
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said Lamb had told him at the end of the 2014-2015 academic year that he suffered from stress.
Lamb had previously applied for medical leave from Delta State University due to some health problem.
This year, he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in the university’s pay policy meant that a dissertation for which Lamb had worked hard would not automatically guarantee him an assistant professor’s position.
University rector William LaForge said he was unaware of the conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but noted that Lambia was clearly troubled by something.
These questions Lamb can no longer answer.
After leaving the campus, police investigated the route Lamb had taken from Arkansas to Mississippi.
Before police reached Lamb, he had taken his own life with a 38-caliber gun in the back yard of a house in Greenville, Mississippi, about one-and-a-half kilometers from his parents' home, Washington County death investigator Methel Johnson said.
Lamb’s car was still on the road.
The police did not immediately understand why Lamb had gone to the house, but Johnson said he believed the man knew the inhabitants.
He spent his youth in the area.
Lamb began his work as a teacher of geography and education at a university with 3,500 students. The city had 12,000 inhabitants in 2009.
He received a doctorate in science in the spring.
One of Lamb’s longest-standing friends described this as smart, charismatic, and funny.
Carla Hairston said she met Lamb through common friends when she was 15 and Lamb was 20.
He and his friends were still in high school, and Lamb was an interesting senior who tried to teach Hairston guitar for years.
“Lamb was a pretty heartbreaker at the time.
All the girls were on his side,” said Hairston, who is now 40 years old and lives in Brandon, Jackson’s suburb.
Lamb and Prentiss had apparently been dating for a while.
In an emergency call, Lamb said he had killed his wife, but according to any documents they have not been ordained.
The couple had a dog named Lightning, and they lived in a brick house on a river slope in the small town of Gautier.
Police said the dog was well.
Prentiss' ex-husband Shawn O'Steen said they separated from Prentiss 15 years ago.The couple had remained friends and they have a daughter who is now 19.
“She was totally upset,” O’Steen said of her daughter.
“My mother and daughter were best friends.”
O'Steen hadn't met Lamb but heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb loved music and played blues.
Lamb and Prentiss met when Lamb and Abigail both performed at a summer event three years ago.
Sometimes they also played together.
O’Stein says his daughter is composing and performing her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for many companies through the network.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and part-time entertainment coordinator at the modest The Julep Room restaurant outside Gautier, said he saw Lamb and Prentiss on September 5 when Lamb had played guitar and lipstick for a few audiences.
Nothing denied that something was wrong.
“A happy couple,” Shaffer said.
“We were joking together.
They both had a good sense of humor.”
“Professor Schmidt, who passed away, directed the first year seminars and specialized in the history of the Indians and the colonial era,” said English professor Don Allan Mitchell.
He was married and had three young children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was the chairman of his own fraternity and student body.
The Delta State University campus in Cleveland has 900 people gathered for a commemoration at candlestick light. There were teaching staff, other staff, students and residents of the area involved.
Schmidt's wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt also attended a nighttime event where the university choir performed the songs "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace."
Teaching continues on Wednesday.
“We’re trying to get the students back,” LaForge said.
“The crisis is over.
This is a healing day.”
Amy and Rogelio Solis report from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Assistant reporters: Associated Press reporters Emily Wagster in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans.
The case has been corrected, as police now report that Lamb called an emergency call after Schmidt was shot. Additionally, it was specified that although Lamb referred to Prentiss in an emergency call to his wife, there is no evidence of their marriage.
Toys R Us to hire fewer seasonal workers
Toys R Us will not hire as many seasonal workers as last year, but the toy and baby products retailer says it will offer its current employees and seasonal workers the opportunity to work extra hours.
The company plans to hire 40,000 people in stores and distribution centers across the country. In 2014, it hired 45,000 seasonal workers.
Most jobs are part-time.
Applicant interviews will begin this month, and new employees will start in October-December.
Although there are still months until the holiday season, the trade season is approaching at a good pace, and companies are preparing by hiring temporary workers for stores as well as for shipping and delivery of goods.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his date with Princess Diana
The premiere of the film Back to the Future was a significant moment for Michael J. Fox’s career.
The first night also had a personal significance.
“We sat in the theater and waited for the arrival of the royals. I noticed that there was an empty place next to me. It was clear to me that Princess Diana was coming next to me,” Fox said in the trailer for the upcoming documentary Back in Time.
“When the movie started, I realized that the situation was very much like a date with a princess of Wales.”
Back in Time is a documentary related to Back to the Future, with interviews with Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeck and producer Steven Spielberg.
Back to the Future premiered 30 years ago.
“This movie is definitely the time travel film of all time for me,” Spielberg said.
Back in Time will be released in VOD and DVD format and will be shown in selected cinemas from October.
UN Secretary-General: No military solution in Syria
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon commented on Russia’s intensified military action and said there is no military solution to the five-year conflict and that weapons will only bring more violence and suffering to millions of people.
The Secretary-General again urged all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite their forces and support comprehensive negotiations to find a political solution.
During a press conference on Wednesday, Ban said he intended to meet the five permanent members of the Security Council, the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France, to discuss the situation in Syria.
Ban regretted that the scattering of the Security Council, the Syrian people and regional powers have created a situation that is impossible to resolve.
He urged the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in the context of the Syrian crisis that was achieved in the Iran nuclear deal.
Chapter 8: Is Donald Trump Serious?
Trump has been described as a nonsense.
He was also considered a joke.
Some predict a collapse for Trump.
The Republican circles have (until now) made every effort to pull Trump out of the gallup leadership.
Ten of the eleven national gallups show Donald Trump double-digit support numbers. Some are already seriously thinking about what it actually says about the potential candidacy of the real estate mogul.
Elections are only in the beginning.
It has not yet been announced that Trump will be elected Republican candidate.
Experts recall that at this time in 2011, Rick Perry, who was at the head of the gallup, was allowed to give room to the rising Herman Cain.
Trump would be difficult in the general election for many reasons.
External groups such as Jeb Bush’s Super PAC and the economic conservative group Club for Growth have noted Trump’s strong position and have begun digging their image to overthrow him.
The following recent gallup data indicates that the real estate module cannot be ignored by an elevator:
There has been a major change in Trump’s support.
Just before Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a University gallup at Monmouth found that only two out of ten Republicans had a positive image of the real estate mob.
By mid-July, 40 percent had a positive opinion.
At the beginning of August, this figure was 52%.
Six out of ten Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump.
Approximately three out of ten people have a negative opinion.
These figures also hold in the states where elections are held first.
At the Quinnipiac gallup last week, 60 percent of Republicans had a positive view of Trump.
Two-thirds of Republicans would be happy with Trump’s candidacy.
At a CNN and ORC gallup last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they were very pleased or satisfied with Trump’s potential candidacy.
Only two out of ten would be very dissatisfied with Trump’s nomination.
Ben Carson is generating almost as much enthusiastic reception as Trump (43 percent would be very happy with Carson’s nomination and 40 percent with Trump’s nomination).
Who is the next most popular candidate?
Third is Marco Rubio with 21% of the votes.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republicans would be dissatisfied or very dissatisfied if Jeb Bush was elected as the party’s candidate.
Most Republicans don’t see Trump’s temperament as problematic.
Donald Trump has been widely criticized for his arrogance and offensive comments. 52 percent of Republican supporters across the country consider the properties of the real estate mob to be suitable for the president. The views are reflected in a poll by ABC News and the Washington Post.
The same reading is true of Iowa, where the party congress will be held first: according to the Quinnipiac gallup, 52 percent of Republicans consider Trump’s personal qualities suitable for the commander-in-chief of the military.
However, according to the ABC and Post gallup, 44 percent believe Trump is unable to perform effectively, and six out of ten find Trump’s temperament unsuitable for the White House.
Republicans are getting used to the idea.
They are starting to take Trump seriously.
When asked by Republicans who is most likely to be elected as the party’s candidate, a gallup by CNN and ORC found that four out of ten believe in Trump’s chances.
The situation has changed since mid-July, when four out of ten would have put their money on Jeb Bush’s side.
Overall: Republicans have never had a very reliable crystal ball at their disposal.
At this point in the last election, four out of ten Republicans considered Rick Perry a likely candidate, and only 28 percent considered Mitt Romney.
The majority seem to see Trump’s campaign as convincing.
Even if Republicans support another candidate, Trump will cover up almost every other candidate.
Some experts believe that a divided camp is likely to benefit Trump as Trump’s opponents split into supporters of different candidates.
A Monmouth University poll at the beginning of September revealed that in an imaginary duel between Trump and almost any other Republican candidate, Trump would almost always get a larger body of support on his side.
He leads Carly Fiorina with 13 points, Marco Rubio with 14 points, Walker with 15, Jeb Bush with 19 points and Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie with 33 points each.
With Ted Cruz, he is at the level.
Is Cruz the only real opponent of Trump?
Ben Carson would beat Trump with 19 points in a fictional duel.
A small majority of Trump supporters say they have already voted.
According to a gallup released by CBS and NYT on Tuesday, more than half of Trump’s supporters are confident of their vote.
The situation can change for many reasons, and at the moment a certain voter can also change his mind.
46% of Trump supporters have not made a final decision.
Trump’s highest rival at this moment is neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who have already chosen their candidate are twice as likely to vote for Trump.
Six out of ten Republicans agree with Trump’s view on immigration.
After Donald Trump’s campaign speech called the rape of migrants from Mexico two months ago, immigration has been a hot topic in 2016.
Some are concerned that Trump’s powerful speeches will drive key Latin American voters out of the Republican army and hinder the brand’s renewal.
But according to Monday’s polls by ABC News and the Washington Post, six out of ten Republicans agree with Trump on immigration issues.
As long as immigration is on the spotlight, so is Donald Trump.
The discontent with the government is at its peak.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson currently collect approximately half of the Republican votes together.
According to the latest poll by ABC News and the Washington Post, six out of ten Republicans were of this opinion.
These two candidates are also angry at Washington.
According to a poll conducted by Des Moines Register and Bloomberg in Iowa, three out of four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated with Republicans’ activities in Congress: 54 percent are dissatisfied and 21 percent are on the verge of rage.
Jeremy Corbyn at the Prime Minister's Interrogation
After the election, Corbyn’s first appearance at the Prime Minister’s questioning hour has been eagerly awaited.
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is set to stand up for the first time at David Cameron’s poll.
Corbyn asks the first of his six questions shortly after noon.The media and Labour Party representatives follow the man with an eye.
Corbyn has called for less theatre and more facts for a weekly show.
He also said he could skip some sessions and leave them to his colleagues.
Corbyn is now facing a parliamentary test after forming a shadow government and Corbyn’s speech at the TUC Annual Meeting on Tuesday.
The Labour Party’s decision to remain silent at the 75th anniversary celebrations of the British Air War held on Tuesday during the national anthem has received criticism from several representatives of the Tory Party.
Corbyn's silence during the national anthem caught attention
A Corbyn spokesman said Corbyn stood during the national anthem, silently honouring the heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle for Britain.
However, Owen Smith, a member of Corbyn's shadow government, told BBC's Two's Newsnight that he would have urged the party's leader to join the national anthem despite his opposition to the monarchy.
Ten shadow ministers have refused to join Corbyn's first team, citing disagreements in economic, defense and foreign affairs. Less than a sixth of the party initially supported Corbyn's election to lead the party.
BBC policy correspondent Robin Brant says political disagreements over Britain’s EU membership and the government’s tightened conditions for benefits have accumulated in the Labour Party since Corbyn’s appointment.
Corbyn said at the TUC meeting that Labour would propose changes to remove the restrictions altogether.
Hours later, Shadow Government Labour and Pension Minister Smith stated that the party’s position is very clear: it only opposes the government’s plans to lower the limit from 26,000 to 23,000 pounds.
Corbyn is the fifth Labour leader David Cameron has faced in the last decade.
The Labour leader, who promised a new approach to politics, says he chose the questions to be asked to Cameron from the 30,000 proposals he received from the public.
Corbyn, who was elected from the Islington North electoral district, said there were too many clashes during the poll. He promised to avoid clever speech and slander and said he would instead focus on serious topics such as poverty, inequality and youth challenges.
Corbyn has said that Shadow Secretary Angela Eagle is accompanying him during interrogation hours, for example when Cameron is on a trip abroad.
Corbyn has also thrown the idea into the air that others could sometimes get out of their voices too. he says he has discussed the matter with House Speaker John Bercow.
Following Corbyn's rise to leadership in 2005, Cameron stated that he wanted a puppet-like policy, often associated with questioning hours.
Since the first time the questionnaire was broadcast on television in 1990, it has been regarded as a key measure of a leader’s judgment, control of the lower house and position. Critics say, however, that the questionnaire has become a caricature that needs major reforms.
"Shot in Joburg": from homeless young people to photographers
The centre of Johannesburg is a challenging environment for the homeless.
For a group of former street children, a meaningful way to learn and earn money has been found.
“I was shot in Joburg” is a non-profit photography studio that teaches homeless young people how to photograph their hometown while earning money.
BBC News met a young man who graduated through the project among the first.

The pound strengthens as UK salaries rise
The pound strengthened as wages rose in the UK, and SABMiller pulled the FTSE 100 index up.
In May-July, salaries in the UK increased by 2.9 percent compared to the same period last year.
This was the fastest growth since 2009.
The pound strengthened by 1 percent, and its exchange rate was quoted at $1.5505. The pound also strengthened in relation to the euro, and was quoted at €1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index rose by 1.49 percent to 6.229.21 points.
The biggest increase was made by SABMiller, whose price hurt 20 percent after the company received a preliminary purchase offer from a competitor AB InBev.
The deal would bring together the world’s two largest breweries and brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch under one roof.
Burberry’s shares rose 0.9 percent in the wake of a positive result from the rival Richemont Group, which focuses on luxury products.
Richemont’s latest sales figures are better than predicted.The growth in sales was also driven by the rise in Burberry’s key market in China.
Glencore’s stock rose by 5 percent after the mining giant announced plans to raise $2.5 billion as part of its debt reduction strategy.
The packaging and paper group Mond’s shares fell the most with a 4.3 percent drop when Goldman Sachs dropped the price of the company’s shares for sale.
JD Sports rose by 3.1 percent after the sports company announced that its earnings before taxes would rise by 83 percent to £46.6 million.
JD Sports chief: higher wage expenditure could hinder expansion
Peter Cowgill, chairman of JD Sports, said a minimum wage increase in the UK would mean more purchasing power for potential customers.
However, increased purchasing power is not enough to cover the higher labor costs incurred by the company.
Cowgill said rising labor costs could jeopardize JD Sports’ expansion plans and reduce the need for additional labor.
Metcash Launches Grassroots Campaign Against Aldi
Metcash strives to secure its IGA store from Aldi’s seizure in South and West Australia.
Food wholesaler Metcash has launched a grassroots campaign to maintain market share of IGA retail stores in South and West Australia against Aldi’s $700 million Australian invasion.
Aldi plans to open two distribution centers and the first of up to 120 stores in South and Western Australia at the beginning of next year. Metcast and IGA supermarkets will strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the IGA brand by marketing on mainstream media and social media and by hosting events like the Adelaide show.
IGA stores and suppliers, as well as many brands, are involved in the campaign. For example, the Dunsborough ice cream factory Simmo offers tastings in IGA stores, and merchants sell tickets to the South Australian Football League games at a discounted price.
Metcasch is expected to publish more detailed details of its defense strategy on September 29, when the Food, Alcohol and Iron Trade Group will host an annual Investment Strategy Day.
This is a significant market, with South and West Australia accounting for 30 percent of the footprint of Metcasch’s IGA stores, and these regions have a higher coverage yield than the eastern state’s IGA network.
Southern and Western Australian consumers are known for their corner locations, and IGA traders have a significantly larger market share in the region than in NSW, Victoria and Queensland. Southern Australia has a market share of 30 percent and Western Australia 24 percent, while the eastern states have a market share of only 14 percent.
For example, Morgan Stanley analysts believe that Aldi will seize 5 percent of the food market in these two states within 12 months of opening the first stores.
This week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath estimated that sales of IGA traders could reach $360 million and Metcasch $250 million by the end of 2016.
The forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in South and West Australia next year and reach $500 million and $600 million in sales in these areas.
Metcasch’s fixed cost is high, so losing food sales and volume could mean it loses $13 million in earnings before interest and taxes, Kierath notes.
Meanwhile, Metcast is losing market share in the eastern states mainly to Ald and Coles, although according to Roy Morgan’s recent research, IGA’s customers are the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley expects Metcasch’s food sales to decline by 3.8 percent in 2016, 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018.
Last week, Hamish Douglass, chief portfolio manager at Magellan Financial Group, said at an event in Melbourne that he believes it is highly likely that Metcash will disappear completely within ten years.
Metcash has refused to publicly comment on Douglass’s comments.
It is understandable that a member of the Metcasch board contacted Douglas last week.
IGA’s market share has dropped from 18 percent since 2010 to 14 percent, and Metcas’s food business, which serves 1,200 IGA dealers, has dropped by 43 percent from its 2012 level.
However, the wholesaler will take retaliatory action and make an annual stake of more than 150 million Australian dollars to meet Coles and Woolworths’ prices for hundreds of products each week. The chain wants to support merchants in upgrading their stores so that they can increase the supply of fresh products and improve the food range of their own brands.
According to Ian Morrice, CEO of Metcas, price revision and store reform plans are on track and the company will be able to increase its profits again in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Australian Tennis Federation President Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves a special mention for his behavior instead of criticism.
According to Steve Healy, chairman of the Australian Tennis Federation, Thanasi Kokkinakis has been a side victim in a recent jupaka linked to Nick Kyrgios.
The "Special K" duo's younger partner, Kokkinakis, got into an unfavorable light when the evil boy Kyrgios provoked his opponent, Stan Wawrinka, at the Montreal ATP tournament.
Shortly thereafter, in the cut-off match between Kokkinakis and Ryan Harrison in Cincinnati, the referee had to separate the competitors twice. "Wawrinka should have given the back to Kyrgios and my guy," Harrison said.
At the U.S. Open, Kokkinakis struck the field with frustration as strong cramps ruined his match. Healy has faithfully defended Kokkinakis.
The teen star is currently in Glasgow, where he fights with Sam Groth for the single-player second place behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-finals against Britain.
“I strongly believe that Thanasi has been drawn into the dispute,” Healy said.
“He broke a goal when he lost a match at the US Open. He’s not the first player to break his goal because of frustration. I know Thanas so well that he’s not proud of his performance.
However, he has endured very well, for example, Harrison’s provocative behavior at the US Open, and I think he deserves recognition.
He has a strong team and a brilliant family around him.I think he has only been treated a little unfairly.
He is very mature by the age of 19, he works hard and complements the team well. He has never had problems with other players, and he is respected among the players. He trains hard, he is in good shape and really a stable and mature young man. I think he should be judged based on his own merits."
Healy also supported the decision to drop Kyrgios from the Australian team in a crucial round starting at the end. Healy describes the solution as a joint decision that works for all parties. He, however, supports the return of the Canberra coach as a long-term reinforcement of the team.
“First of all, we want to focus entirely on the matches instead of the controversy about Kyrgios,” Healy said.
Nick has risen to the top quickly. As Federer and Murray have pointed out among others, the young man has to grow up in the public eye. He deserves criticism for his bad mistakes. However, we strive to support him so that he understands the consequences of his actions. We also try to arrange his own peace for him. I believe that this is the best for both the whole team and Nick.”
European migration crisis: Hungary declares state of emergency, closes borders, detains migrants
Hungary, which declared a state of emergency, closed its southern border to Serbia on Tuesday and captured illegal migrants.
Chaos arose on the border as hundreds of migrants accumulated in a no-one-land, and Serbian authorities reacted furiously.
People fleeing violence were forced to stay in their tents between checkpoints for an indefinite period of time
The frustration began to rise to the surface.
As the police helicopter flew in the air above the migrants, they whispered “Open the border!” and shouted insults to the Hungarian riot police.
Some protested in a food and drink strike.
The Serbian Foreign Minister has said that it will not accept that migrants be sent back to Hungary at the same time as more arrives from Macedonia and Greece.
“Serbia wants to be part of the solution, not to add damage.
The situation needs to be discussed in the coming days in Brussels and also in other countries,” Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
The turmoil on the Hungarian-Serbian border began a day later when a group of 28 countries failed to develop a common migration policy at a controversial meeting in Brussels.
However, the ministers agreed that the responsibility for the flood of 40,000 asylum-seekers in Italy and Greece is shared.The meeting raised the hope that by next month or by the end of the year an agreement would be reached on which EU Member States would accept 120,000 migrants, including from Hungary.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria have called for an extraordinary summit next week to discuss the migration crisis on the continent.
Hungary, however, did not hope for immediate action by Brussels or its neighbors.
On Tuesday, the emergency situation developed to allow the authorities in two southern regions to adopt more effective measures, namely to close roads and speed up legal processes in asylum matters.
Meanwhile, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that Hungary is also planning a silk rope fence on the Romanian border to prevent the flow of migrants from that direction, now that a fence on the Serbian border is already ready.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reports that even the prisoners participated in the tender for the finishing work of the silk wire between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a clear bottleneck and transit point for migrants to the European Union.Many of these migrants are refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.
Prime Minister Viktor Orban, however, argued that the majority of the people arriving are living-level refugees, not war refugees, who have the right to seek asylum.
According to a new law that came into force at midnight in Hungary, it is a crime to cross or damage a four-meter-high silk fence that the government has built on the southern border towards Serbia.
"Due to the situation caused by mass migration, the government declares a state of crisis in the country," government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
“We follow a strict line: Illegal border crossing is a crime.”
Associated Press news agency reporters at the border have seen heavily armed soldiers with their vehicles and military dogs for several days.
Mr. Orban’s internal security adviser, Gyorgy Bakondi, said the authorities had arrested 45 people who attempted to cross the border right at the border and 15 people elsewhere.
Those who crossed the border by damaging the fence are now held by the police and are charged with crimes under the new laws.
The authorities will quickly repair the fence.
In addition, Hungarian authorities closed two of the seven border crossing points on the Serbian border on Tuesday.
Chaos seized the main border crossing near Roszke in Hungary when the Hungarians opened a small metal container where people gathered.
About 20 people were able to enter, but thousands remained outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main street connecting Serbia and Hungary. People being on food and drink strike until they were released to Hungary.
Elections 2016: Hillary Clinton's leadership over Bernie Sanders shrunk by half according to the national gallup
Former Foreign Secretary Hillary Clinton still has a double-digit support for the Democratic national presidential candidate, but Senator Bernie Sanders has broken the gap.
Clinton’s support is now 47 percent of the Democratic supporters’ votes (a drop from 58 percent), while Sanders is second with 27 percent (a rise from 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden has not yet announced his candidacy for the presidential election, with 15 percent of Democrats supporting him.
More than five months before the primary elections, it is too early for most Democrats to say which candidate they support.
But Clinton supporters are more confident about their choice than other candidates.
After a gallup by CBS News last month, Clinton has lost support from several Democratic groups, while new supporters have joined Sanders' camp.
Clinton still holds a strong leadership position among women and moderates, but the leadership has narrowed.
Clinton’s support among men has dropped significantly, and he has only a five-percent edge over Sanders.
Clinton has lost her leadership among Democrats under 50, and she is now on par with Sanders.
However, Clinton still has a clear advantage among older voters.
Last month, Clinton’s lead in support ratings over Sanders among the liberals was two-digit, but now Sanders has taken five percentage points over Clinton in this group.
Nearly half of Democrats say they would support Clinton if she were elected.
A quarter would support Clinton with minimal reservations, and 15 percent would support him just because he is a candidate.
Six percent would not support Clinton.
It’s not surprising that Clinton’s current supporters would be enthusiastic supporters if he were elected.
There is more divide in views among those who currently do not support Clinton. Only about a quarter would enthusiastically support her.
48% of Democrats would vote for Clinton, while only 35% of Republicans would vote for Republican candidate Donald Trump.
When Clinton voters are asked to freely describe why they support her nomination, the most popular reason is Clinton’s correct experience (16 percent). The second most popular answer is that it’s time to elect a female president (13 percent) and the third is that Clinton is the best candidate for the position (10 percent).
Clinton’s supporters also mention his connection with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
They also discussed the prospects and chances of winning the election.
The Vice-President was still puzzling about his potential candidacy, and 57 percent of Democratic voters would like him to join the race.
When Democratic voters are asked who is the second most popular candidate for the party, the majority of voters choose Biden.
With more than half of Clinton supporters, Biden is the second most popular candidate after Clinton and much more popular than Sanders.
If Biden does not enter the Democratic candidate box, Hillary Clinton will increase her advantage over Sanders. With Sanders involved, the advantage is 20 percentage points, and it will rise to 30 percentage points if Sanders does not leave the race.
55 percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance of winning the real election, down from 78 percent last month.
Biden is far from Clinton, but more and more believe in Biden's chances of winning the real election.
Democratic voters, however, consider the views of candidates more important than the chances of winning.
Voters do not consider Democratic candidates or potential candidates unacceptable.
Voters consider Democratic candidates or potential candidates suitable for their characteristics.
Most consider Clinton, Sanders, and Biden to be honest, trustworthy, and the type of leader.
Biden is most often characterized as honest, while Clinton is most often considered the type of leader.
Up to 30 percent of Democrats don’t think Clinton is honest and trustworthy, while Sanders is 15 percent, and 27 percent don’t know if Sanders is honest.
Democratic voters believe that the views of Clinton, Sanders and Biden are close to the voters’ own ideology.
For all features, about a quarter have no opinion about Sanders.
When voters are asked about the use of Hillary Clinton’s private email and her own server as Secretary of State, the majority of Democratic voters say they are pleased with Clinton’s explanation and it hasn’t changed those voters’ perception of Clinton.
Americans generally disagree.
Half of Americans are dissatisfied with Clinton’s report, and only a third are satisfied.
The opinions of the people were divided in March, when the clash had just emerged.
The majority of Americans believe that the controversial use of email has not affected their overall picture of Clinton.
The majority, six out of ten, are Republicans.
While voters in their own party consider Clinton to be honest and trustworthy, there is room for improvement in these attributes when asking for all voters’ opinions: Clinton considers honest and trustworthy by only 32 percent, which is 8 percentage points less than last month and 15 percentage points less than in May.
Of all voters, 62% do not consider Clinton to be honest and reliable.
On the other hand, 55 percent of all voters across the country also do not consider Trump honest and reliable.
Both Clinton and Trump, however, get good ratings for leadership.
Of the six candidates surveyed, Biden, Carson and Bush were considered the most reliable.
The majority consider Sanders to be honest, but like Carson, many do not have an opinion about Sanders.
The sample of the survey is 351 voters, and the error margin of the survey is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson takes Donald Trump’s lead in national poll
According to a recent poll by CBS News and the New York Times, Ben Carson has reached Donald Trump.
These two candidates gained more than half of the votes in the new poll, leaving the other candidates far behind.
Trump still has strong support among Republican voters across the country. The support rate has risen from 23 percent in the CBS poll conducted before the Fox News debate last month. According to a poll released on Tuesday, the support rate is 27 percent.
However, Carson’s support would jump sharply in the same period, from 6 percent to 23 percent.
According to the poll, Carson has a strong support among all population groups. In the group of higher educated people, he surpasses Trump.
Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker’s support is the weakest and has dropped from last month’s 10 percent to now 2 percent.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio shared third place with a 6% support.
The error margin of 376 Republican voters in the sample is 6 percent in either direction or other.
According to a recent poll by CNN and ORC published last week, Carson’s support is on the rise, with 19 percent of Republicans supporting him, compared to 32 percent for Trump.
Also in the latest poll by ABC News and the Washington Post, Trump was in a clear lead ahead of Carson.
During the men’s meeting last week, Trump filed unfounded charges against a retired neurosurgeon, but Carson apologized after questioning Trump’s belief.
“We need energy,” Trump said on Saturday during his campaign in Iowa.
Five Department Members Accused of Murdering Baruch College Fuks
Nearly two years ago, after the death of a student in a departmental ritual in the Pocon Mountains of Pennsylvania, five people are charged with murder.
Members of the Baruch College (City University of New York) department of Pi Delta Psi brutally abused Chun "Michael" Deng at a baptism in September 2013. According to police, the department failed to deliver Deng to the hospital on time, which was thought to have contributed to his death.
Officials said the victim’s eyes were tied, a 15-pound backpack filled with sand was placed on her back, and she had been attacked repeatedly as she tried to get into an object located on the other side of the ice field.
Deng first complained of a headache and then lost consciousness.
According to police, members of the Pi Delta Psi division did not call the emergency number when Deng lost consciousness.
Police chief Chris Wabner told a news conference that members would have time to change Deng's clothes, google his symptoms, and contact department chairman Andy Meng.
“At this point, members began to hide the tools, putting the interests of the department above Michael Deng’s health,” Wagner said.
Deng was not resuscitated and died the next morning.
According to the body record, Deng was beaten several times in the head, upper body and thighs with a dull object.
“Too many families have been upset by the department’s infestation, as at least one student per year has died as a result of the infestation since 1970,” Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing the Deng family, said in a statement.
The departments and their members must be held accountable, where the authorities must take an important step.
The Grand Jury of Monroe County presented five members of the department to be charged with third-degree murder.
In addition, 32 members of the division are charged with conspiracy and conspiracy, including Meng.
"We want to bring to account not only individuals, but also the organization that officially or informally approved the sympathy," Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College imposed a ban on the department, and the national department resigned from the local department.
The U.S. Federal Reserve’s (Fed) interest rate hike
The rise in interest rates and the rise in the stock market are crashing, the yield of securities is rising and the economy is sliding down.
We know that.
However, we do not know how long it will take and how long the effects will last.
Especially in terms of economics, we find in history a reference to timing.
The lama has arrived up to 11 months after the first interest rate raise and lasted up to 86 months.
The central bank often raises interest rates aggressively, but not always.
That’s why central bank officials have already stressed that investors should pay attention not to when interest rates start to rise, but to how long it will take to normalize the situation.
There are, of course, several variables involved.
In the end, however, market participants may find that any hassle associated with raising interest rates may be exaggerated.
“The central bank’s first lifting after the global financial crisis was undoubtedly often interpreted as a sign of the end of cheap money,” Julian Jessop, Capital Economics’ chief global economist, told his clients.
In contrast, we do not expect a gradual normalization of interest rates to a fairly low level, which is a frightening seismic shock for many.
However, this does not mean that there are no effects.
Here are examples based on historical trends of how the impacts can be reflected in different sectors of the economy:
As has been seen in the market for about a month, the enthusiasm of raising interest rates can increase the volatility for some time.
When interest rates finally rise, the impact is not so dramatic.
“The trend appears to be a standstill in capital interest yields after the first raise for 12 to 24 months, which may again reflect a delay in monetary policy,” a Deutsche Bank analyst said in a recent study of the effects of the rise in interest rates.
Specifically, during the 35-year period, the market generally sees a sharp rise at the time of the interest rate rise, about 14 percent, a fairly steady rise in the next 250 days (an average rise of 2.6 percent), after 500 days the situation normalizes, and the average interest return after six share ratings is 14.4 percent, says Bob Doll, chief equity strategist at Nuveen Asset Management in Barron's magazine.
According to Deutsche, the influence on stocks usually intensifies at a slightly later stage of the cycle and interest yields begin to decrease.
There is a lack of money in the economy, but the rise in interest rates usually leads to this.
In this case, if the central bank faces circumstances that did not exist before and that could accelerate the downturn.
Particularly noteworthy is the fact that the gross domestic product is at its lowest ever in terms of raising the central bank’s guiding interest rate.
According to the Deutsche Bank, 118 major interest rates have been raised since 1950, but only twice have the nominal value been below 4.5 percent.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent, many did not expect it to last, and in the third quarter it is 1.5 percent, according to the Atlanta Regional Central Bank.
Raising interest rates in such a sensitive economic situation can have its risks and it can be asked if this situation is different, Deutsche said.
Market players have been talking about the rise of the key interest rate throughout the year, and the eyes will be turned to this week’s meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which ends on Thursday.
Many strategists and economists believe that even if the Open Market Committee approved a raise at this meeting, a futures trade shows only a 25 percent probability.
“In our studies since 1950, all the upward cycles so far have been in a supercycle, where even a GDP that drops before the downward rate rises very rapidly after the upward cycle begins,” the report says.
The recovery has been very slow compared to the worst downturn of the recovery period.
The cycle is clearly the longest the central bank has been waiting for since the last downturn.The record had been 35 months, now it is already going to the 74th month.
Fixed-income securities have also been unstable as the market precedes interest rate increases, and the formula is repeated on the capital side as well.
“The fundamental difference is that the effect is faster in bonds than in shares when the central bank changes the rate.
For bonds, yields appear to change direction immediately when the first up/down cycle begins.
At the end of the upward cycle, yields will drop immediately,” Deutsche said.
Charles Schwab’s strategists believe that the interest rate hike will make long and short-term bonds approach each other and the curve flatten.
“High yield bonds often do better in such an environment, although we are still cautious about yields,” said Kathy Jones, a fixed yield securities analyst at Schwab.
Interestingly, Jones said the markets have already adapted to the central bank’s upcoming shift in direction.
“In addition to the strengthening of the dollar and inflation forecasts, there are already several signs of adjustment to tightening fiscal policy,” Jones says.
Short-term interest rates are rising, the yield curve is straight, credit risk margins have expanded and volatility has increased.
Generally speaking, companies that operate mainly in the U.S. market benefit as interest rates drop and local products start to attract.
The outlook for indebted multinationals is weaker as the strengthening dollar causes their products to rise in the global markets and the debt to rise.
"History shows that quality stocks will be more profitable than interest rates in the next three months," Goldman Sachs analysts told their clients.
The companies with a strong balance sheet surpassed the companies with a weak balance sheet by an average of five percentage points after the interest rate increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Companies with high capital returns and shares with low volatility also performed better in terms of quality, averaging 4 and 3 percentage points, respectively.
Debt is a big issue.
Companies with a significant share of variable interest rate debt are losing the most,” Goldman said.
Outside the stock market, consumers generally also benefit from the strengthening of the dollar.
Savers also benefit from higher yields, although experts are disagreed about how quickly the effects appear.
Parliamentarian Andrew Bingham: BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM
Conservative Andrew Bingham has criticized the radio station for its overpopularization.
Bingham said it is difficult to distinguish the channel from its commercial competitor.
He also claims the BBC Music Awards only to be a copy of the Brits Gala.
Parliamentarian Damien Collins has accused The Voice of impersonality.
According to a prominent parliamentarian, BBC Radio 3 is gradually becoming a copy of the Classic FM channel. The accusations increase the pressure on the station to prove that it offers more than any commercial radio stations.
Conservative Andrew Bingham also told the BBC chief that the broadcaster’s radio station was becoming too populist and that the channel was barely distinguishing itself from its commercial competitor.
"I don't want to talk about popularization, but Radio 3 seems to be moving towards the Classic FM channel," Bingham said.
The BBC Music Awards, which took place last December, also received criticism from Bingham:
“The BBC Music Awards, which were held for the first time last year, seem like a copy of the Brits Awards.
These two are examples of simply imitating what is already on the market, instead of being new and different,” says Bingham.
The BBC CEO denied the allegations and said that BBC Radio 3 has much more live music and educational content than its commercial competitors.
“Radio 3 learns from classical music what I can’t learn from other channels.
The channel’s commitment to live music and making music is in its own category.
I also consider it important that Radio 3 is also committed to finding new music and ordering new works,” said the CEO.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 director Alan Davey said the station needs to work harder to keep the audience interested as British people become more familiar with classical music.
However, Radio 3 is not the only BBC channel that has been heavily criticized for entering commercial channels, in consultation with the limited Committee on Culture, Media and Sports.
Tory parliamentarian Damien Collins criticized The Voice’s talent competition, which the BBC bought from Dutch producer Talpa Media.
"The program is not much discussed because it is not unique or distinctive."
Lord Hall said the BBC1 show, featuring Paloma Faith and Boy George, was produced in a BBC-typical way.
Collins also urged the company to search for a hit program in its own studio when it next time launches a new entertainment series.
Collins, however, did not rule out the possibility that The Voice would continue to be subscribed or that taxpayer money would be spent on other formats of entertainment.
E-commerce growth slowest ever in August – the reason for Black Friday
In the first few months of 2015, online sales grew by 7%.
Online sales have been registered since 2000. Last month was the slowest growth ever.
Three years ago, the online market was strengthened with mobile acquisition.
Experts believe that November’s Black Friday can curb shopping cravings.
For more than a decade, the conquest of e-commerce has devastated many of Britain’s shopping streets.
According to experts, there are signs that e-commerce is stagnating, with new sales figures showing only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015.
In August, total sales growth was the slowest during the period when online sales have been statistically recorded, i.e. since 2000.
According to experts, there are signs that e-commerce is stagnating, with new sales figures showing only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015.
“If you compare last year’s growth to 2000’s, it’s clear that the growth will stabilize over time,” IMRG editor-in-chief Andy Mulcahy told The Guardian.
According to Mulkey, e-commerce was accelerating three years ago when consumers adopted mobile shopping.
“As a result, more and more people were able to shop online, and for many people it was possible to shop in different environments, even from the home sofa.
When mobile purchases are now more moderate, growth can be balanced.”
Black Friday, originating in America, is a phenomenon that is considered to be one of the reasons for slowing growth.
According to experts, the theme day, which will be celebrated on the last Friday of November, may cause consumers to postpone their purchase decision before Black Friday.
Last year, a five-fold number of online shoppers than normal caused many merchant websites to crash.
Experts believe that Black Friday, which causes consumers to overwhelm after deals, can curb purchasing cravings at other times.
According to a study published by the British Retail Consortium, a fair £5 per £5 was spent online.
More than a third of certain products, such as televisions and washing machines, are purchased from online stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of fashion stores on the shopping street.
In Mecca, the victims of the crane accident, the family of Bin Laden responsible
Muslims carried the bodies of 29 victims on the streets when the first funeral was held in Mecca.
Saudi Arabia said the construction company Saudi Binladin Group was partially responsible for the accident.
According to the Ministry of Health, 394 people were injured in the crash.
Bodies were carried high in the air as Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims of the crane that fell on the Grand Mosque in Mecca
A crowd of white-dressed people had gathered in the streets to say goodbye to the victims on their last trip to Al-Moaissem Cemetery.
The tragedy occurred at a pilgrimage site where the crashed building demolition machine had just a day earlier penetrated through the roof of the mosque on Muslims.
The king of Saudi Arabia has claimed responsibility for Bin Laden's family-owned construction company for the crash in which 394 people were injured.
The bodies of the 29 victims of the crash in the Grand Mosque of Mecca were transported to the streets.
Among the dead was Qasim Akram from Bolton, Greater Manchester, who had traveled to Mecca on his first pilgrimage.
Akram had been in the Grand Mosque with his parents, who were beginning their annual Hajj pilgrimage.
Saudi authorities have promised that the Hajj pilgrimage will be held as thousands of people are currently arriving in the city for pilgrimage.
King Salman said the Binladin Group should not have left the crane booms up when the crane was not in use.
According to an Arabic press release, Binladin Group is partially responsible for the accident.
The news agency’s English-language service did not report in detail on the matter, however, according to the English-language statement, the management of the group has been prohibited from leaving the country.
Earlier this week, Salman promised to reveal what caused the crane to fall in the Grand Mosque yard. Thousands of Muslims will head to the Grand Mosque for a Hajj pilgrimage later this month.
Binladin Group has not published any information about the crane accident, and no representatives of the Group have been contacted for an opinion.
The king also accused the group of failing to comply with current safety regulations and of cooperating with meteorological experts.
Dozens of cranes surround the Grand Mosque of Mecca as part of a giant construction project by Binladin Group.
The bin Laden family has had close ties with the Saudi ruling family for decades, and the bin Laden have been responsible for a number of major construction projects.
The late leader of al-Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, was abandoned by his family in the 1990s.
The crane accident, which occurred in heavy rain and strong winds, occurred just a few days before the pilgrimage to Mecca, which every capable Muslim is obliged to do at least once in his life.
Officials say 158 people are still hospitalized.
The authorities ordered the payment of one million rials (approximately EUR 250,000) to the families of the victims and permanently disabled persons.
Those injured in the accident will receive half of the compensation.
B&Q boss says cheap workforce is behind the phenomenon
Brits are hiring home generalists more and more often, says Veronique Laury.
It has been popularized by skilled, professional workers coming from Eastern Europe.
More than 200 new Screwfix stores for workers will be opened.
At the same time, Kingfisher will close 60 B&Q stores around the country.
Text: Rupert Steiner, Chief Correspondent, Daily Mail
Britons are said to transfer home hammering and painting knives to authors coming from Eastern Europe.
Nowadays, painting and painting are very few.
Britain is increasingly hiring home generals to do home nicking, says the head of the company behind B&Q.
Veronique Laury is the new CEO at Kingfisher, which owns a home repair store chain. According to Laury, the backbone of the phenomenon is qualified workers coming from Eastern Europe who provide services at poor prices.
As a result of the phenomenon, Kingfisher plans to open 200 new Screwfix stores for traders.
Laury needs more female workforce in B&Q stores, as eight out of ten shopping decisions in the store are made by a woman.
Currently, most of the staff are men.
According to Laury, it is worth paying attention to demographic trends, as today more and more women who live alone are also renovating their homes.
“The staff in our stores are still mostly men,” Laury says.
“We need to balance the situation.
Half of our customers are women, and 80% of our purchasing decisions are made by women.
Women play an important role in the decision-making process.”
Laury is one of five women at the top of companies in the FTSE 100 UK Index. She has also reorganized the company’s management team so that there are equal men and women leaders.
Kingfisher is almost the only company of its kind, with just 50% of its staff being female, including CEO and Chief Financial Officer.
"This was a conscious decision. Diversity is an important topic for us," Laury said.
“It hasn’t been difficult to find good women in the leadership team.”
Kingfisher’s six-month operating profit and sales figures have declined, despite the company’s hard work after shutdowns.
Kingfisher responds to current trends: it owns the Screwfix and B&Q chains and plans to open 200 new stores.
The Three Ace government decided to resort to compulsory legislation to save the country’s economy.
The visible effects occurred quite quickly.
The sharp head of the Federal Federation and other centralized organizations began to force immediately, and as a result, the country stood up on Friday because of the widespread demonstration of workers.
A lot of people think that is also reasonable.
I wonder if it is worth it to go on strike.
There were even resistance groups.
More than 50,000 people have already visited the internet to declare that they are not going to participate in the demonstration, but are going to work.
In the good old world, this would have been impossible.
Of course, there was no internet to protest, but to openly declare a violator would have been a political suicide for a small person.
The protest of the millions-member trade unions of a few tens of thousands of people does not take much time, but it gives reason to think.
The position of the trade union movement is no longer as obvious as it was a couple of decades ago.
Not everyone knows the goals of the movement as their own, the values have changed
From the perspective of the interest of the Ay movement’s activities, the government’s fierce decisions can also be seen as a direct gift from heaven.
When things have seemed to roll on their own weight for years, now the unions finally get to the issue, i.e. to defend the rights of the worker, visible and properly.
The government may thus be willing to strengthen the role of the ay movement, when membership in the trade union may be seen as more necessary than before.
Whatever you think about the actions of the organizations, it is foolish that the Friday demonstration would somehow stop Finland.
Finland has stopped for a long time.
For example, industrial production has declined for 31 months in a row.
Gross domestic product continues to decline and unemployment continues to rise.
These things would force everyone’s minds.
University of Lappeenranta tough savings plan: aim for savings of 8.5 million, staff will be cut by 130
Lappeenranta University of Technology is launching a savings course aimed at reducing costs by a total of 8.5 million euros.
As part of the savings, the university will start full-staff negotiations with an annual savings target of 6.5 million.
In fact, this means a reduction of about 130 employees.
In addition, two million euros will be saved.
The backdrop of the NPT negotiations is the 2016 budget, which predicts an actual deficit of 8.5 million.
This also affects the government’s budget cuts.
In this financial year, the university makes approximately 2.6 million in deficit earnings.
The costs will increase slightly for next year, but at the same time the funding received from the ministry will be reduced by 2 million and the other funding by 3.2 million euros.
The university’s total budget is approximately EUR 85 million, so the savings target is 10 percent of the total budget.
The combined impact of massive cuts in teaching and research and the decrease in corporate financing on our university is very significant, says Rector Anneli Pauli in a statement.
Before the summer, the effects of the cuts seemed even more moderate, but now the reduction in supplementary funding appears to be in new proportions.
Negotiations with the confidants will begin next week and will last six weeks as stipulated by the law.
Onnibus wants Finnish railways
Sir Brian Souter, the owner of the low-cost bus company Onnibus, told YLE that the company is also aiming for rail traffic in Finland.
I am very interested in participating in Finnish rail transport.
My Stagecoach company is one of the largest railway companies in the UK, Souter says.
The railway sector will be gradually opened to competition.
The first is the capital region’s nearby traffic in the years 2017-2018.
After the long distance, there is nearby transportation.
Souter says he has already approached the Ministry of Transport.
According to the Ministry of Transport, the plans of Onnibus are welcomed.
Of other international companies, their interest in rail transport has been by at least Transdev (formerly Veolia), which also has bus services in Finland and rail services elsewhere in Europe.
U.S. Central Bank Interest Rate Decision
The Fed will meet on Wednesday and Thursday to decide whether to raise interest rates for the first time in a decade.
Half of the economists who still believed last week that the central bank would raise interest rates are now betting that the central bank would keep interest rates at the current level of 0–0.25 percent, according to a Reuters survey of 80 economists.
“This is a historic situation, as the central bank has been holding interest rates at zero for seven years.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where a major central bank can raise interest rates from zero and thus initiate the normalization of interest rates,” said Angel Ubide, senior researcher at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The state of the U.S. economy has been relatively good, with the recovery bringing trillions of extra dollars to the balance sheet and only slightly accelerating inflation.
However, the central bank cannot ignore the global situation, which is not as pink.
It has urged the market to prepare for the change, but there are also signs of the opposite.
The decision is due to be announced on Thursday at 20:00 CET time.
Delta State University gunman apologizes
After shooting his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning — before shooting a colleague later that day — Shannon Lamb wrote a message asking forgiveness for the first murder and hoping to cancel it, authorities said on Tuesday.
Lamb, a professor of geography and social sciences at Delta State University in Gautier, Mississippi, called the emergency number around 10 a.m.
On Monday, he said he shot a man.
Lamb called the police at his home in an emergency.
"I shot my wife yesterday night," Lamb said.He also mentioned that there was a friendly dog in the house who has no regrets to anyone but who is probably scared.
The police asked the man's name, but he did not say it.
He also did not disclose the motive for the shooting.
Police arrived at the scene and found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a handwritten message from Lamb that read: "I'm very sorry and I hope I can cancel my actions.
I loved Amya, and she is the only woman who ever loved me."
After writing the message, Lamb drove 500 miles to Delta State University, where he killed history professor Ethan Schmidt before taking his own life late on Monday when police reached him.
University rector William LaForge said he was unaware of the conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but noted that Lambia was clearly troubled by something.
On Monday it was that Lamb allegedly believed that Prentiss was also in a romantic relationship with Schmidt. However, authorities on Tuesday that there was no information or evidence about the trio drama.
Shawn O'Steen, who was married to Prentiss for seven years, described his ex-wife as a good person.
The couple separated 15 years ago but remained friends.
O'Steen said he and Prentiss have a 19-year-old daughter who is shocked.
He said his mother and daughter were best friends.
According to the Sun Herald, Lindsay Knowles, a close friend of Prentiss, said that Prentiss was working online from home.
Knowles noted that Prentiss had been dating Lamb for three years.
“He always wanted to help others,” Knowles said.
According to police, Lamb had called his relatives on Monday and told them he would not go to jail.
When the police reached Lamb on Highway 1 near Greenville that night, Lamb stopped the car, ran away on foot, ran into the woods and took his own life.
According to a resume on the university’s website, Lamb received a PhD in Education at Delta State University in the spring of 2015.
Shaded stars
The last years have been heavy for the actor (pictured on the left with his son Redmond).
In 2001 he fought with leukemia, and in 2009 his longtime partner Farrah Fawcett died of cancer.
The actor has also struggled with drugs, and in 2008 he was arrested for possession of drugs.
Everything that has happened has really demanded its taxes.
Manchester United's Luke Shaw leaves for two months
Luke Shaw broke his right leg in a Manchester United Champions League match against PSV Eindhoven.
The defendant is unfortunate to be out for at least half a year, but Louis van Gaal is still hopeful and believes that Shaw will return to the fields later this season.
Twenty-year-old Shaw was injured in PSV's defensive area in a bad set by Héctor Moreno during the fifteenth minute of the game.
Shaw was given first aid on the field for nine minutes and needed oxygen before being transferred to the hospital.
"Shaw has two fractures in his leg and is in hospital," Van Gaal said.
Shaw will be transferred to Manchester for surgery tomorrow or the next day.
The young man who joined Manchester United at the age of 18 has experienced hard times and is now injured after a fantastic game.
Shaw was given oxygen in the closet.
The man cried.
I’m not a doctor, but when my leg breaks from two points, he’s out for half a month and no longer plays in the block stage.
I hope he can still play this season.
Moreno appeared to be a little off when the situation did not follow a red card penalty shot.
The match’s referee Nicola Rizzoli did not punish the Mexican player.
Van Gaal said the Italian judge made a mistake.
“You can conclude for yourself, but I think the situation was worth the penalty kick and the red card.
It was a two-legged game.”
Shaw tweeted, “Thank you for all your messages. I can’t describe in words how depressed I am. My recovery starts here and I’ll come back stronger.”
Manchester United's Luke Shaw in PSV match
The English defender has a special reason to recover to compete at the European Championship in France in June.
“It’s a very bad injury,” said the PSV coach.
"In such injuries, all parties are always very sorry.
The goal of a player is never to hurt an opponent.”
Moreno broke his tail while playing in the ranks of Mexico against the Netherlands led by Van Gaal in the 2014 World Cup.
"He is very sorry because his intention was not to hurt the opponent. It is sad to hear that the injury is serious," Cocu said.
“I did not see the situation.
I just saw the ball going in the opposite direction, so it looked like he (Moreno) was touching the ball, but I didn’t see Luke’s fist.”
"I know how it feels.I know how difficult this situation can be," Moreno told SBS6.
“It feels very unpleasant, I am very sorry.”
PSV’s Andrés Guardado was also taken to hospital after a collision with Chris Smalling.
David Cameron should know Lorax better
Every parent will soon notice that their child learns his favorite book almost from the outside.
See also David Cameron.
When a children’s holiday organization asked Cameron to name his favorite children’s book, the prime minister chose Lorax, Dr. Seuss’s Environmental Teaching Story, published in 1971.
In a text published on the SuperCamp website, Cameron writes that the choice was difficult. “The story is fun, touching and creative, and it has a powerful message. I’m happy to read it to my children because there’s always a picture or message that we haven’t noticed before.”
It sounds good, except that the next point where Cameron is supposed to describe the plot of the book is a summary of the 2012 film version, which added new characters and details to complement the short original text.
“In a city where real trees and plants have disappeared and even air is a commodity, there is a boy named Ted who wants to get into the heart of his dream girl Audrey by fulfilling this greatest dream: to see a real tree,” the text says.
Unless this is still suspicious enough, Cameron’s text is partially consistent with the plot of the Lorax film on the Internet Movie Database. It starts as follows: “In a city where everything is artificial and even air is a commodity, there is a boy named Ted who wants to get into the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams.”
Cameron is known as an active parent, so it seems unlikely that the plot of the book would be such a stranger to him. Ahne Kerskanen destroys trees and makes them Necessaries despite the objections of the name character Lorax. Lorax is a small and thick, silk-like creature that protects the forests.
Probably a public relations task like this, of little importance, has been entrusted to the task of an assistant, apparently one who has not read Lorax 20 times in a row as a child.
A spokesman for the prime minister said the text probably came from the office of Cameron's electoral district.
SuperCamps did not comment on the matter in detail but confirmed that the text was written by Cameron's staff.
Adam Lyth was clearly at risk of being out of the English team, but it’s still tough
Meeting Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a tough task, but after seeing the team selected for the Tour of England’s last 3-0 Test series defeat, it’s not expected to be repeated.
I would not rule out the possibility of winning.
The side of Alastair Cook may be more inexperienced than the team three years ago, but the beat team has good players and the team’s attitude is strong – they don’t have bad experiences from 2012, only youthful positivity.
As a ball player, Moeen Ali develops as a spin-feeder, and Adil Rashid, although he has no Test level experience, represents an offensive option.
Related: Adam Lyth dropped from English Test team and replaced by Alex Hales
The decision to leave Adam Lyth is obviously difficult for me to understand as his head coach at Yorkshire.
His seven tests have been against two good attacks in challenging circumstances, and the simple and cruel truth is that cricket players are judged by their results.
For example, Joe Root is not a questionable choice because – as I have said before – players are the best selectors.
A few 50-point matches would have held Lyth in the team, but his fate was in his own hands.
Hopefully he will get another chance when he hits Yorkshire for more races.
England’s head coach, Trevor Bayliss, praised his attitude even when he didn’t do as well as he could, which doesn’t surprise me.
The question of how long a Test shooter will get a chance to make an impact is difficult.
Lyth won seven land matches – like his predecessor Sam Robson – while Nick Compton won nine.
Only Compton got a chance in both home and guest matches.
The only subject of complaint may be that the English first used Jonathan Trotsky in the Caribbean – when Lyth was at his peak – but this missed opportunity is now history.
Alex Hales is coming to the team and he’s a striker that I appreciate very much.
He is an unknown-factor cricketer, which we saw in Yorkshire earlier this season when he scored 236 points against us on Trent Bridge.
He should be given at least the same opportunity as his predecessors, but this, of course, depends on the composition of the UAE team.
The idea has been thrown into the air that Moe will start a kick-off with Cook, bringing an extra spin feed into the game while holding four fast feeders, and I’m not against the idea.
I don’t see any obstacle to the top feeders being hit here, and this left-handed player has already proved to be a great cricket player.
Moe may not have achieved much with his local team at Worcestershire, but he has been the team’s three-player, and that’s not a big difference.
My former teammate, Justin Langer, played his first 38 Test matches as the first replacement player before getting started in 2001.
He made three hundred points and there was no return.
Zafar Ansari is on the team as a backpacker, and based on what I’ve seen about him, he’s proved to be a very impressive young man.
People can look at his statistics – an average of 31 points as a beat and 35 points as a feed – and this can be a search shot, but a lot of spin feeds have not shown themselves ready, and voters decided to take a young player.
He learns a lot during this game.
Outside the team that plays, England seems to have made a couple of smart choices for its coaching staff.
The appointment of Sri Lankan striker, Mahela Jayawardene, as the advisor for the Test matches could be a breakthrough.
This is one of the sweetest men of the genre, bringing with it a lot of experience, as he has played in all sorts of conditions and against all sorts of attacks.
Paul Collingwood plays the white ball of the game trip, bringing both energy and relentlessness.
I think he has always seemed suitable for international cricket, whether in his role as a player or coach, and like Mahela, he has the intelligence to exploit.
Sometimes a new sound in the dressing room, even if it says the same as before, can be an exciting injection.
Colly’s teammate in Durham, Ben Stokes, has rested one day in matches, Root got a similar opportunity against Australia, and I agree with this decision.
Although not everyone agrees, coaches and voters do not determine the schedule of the match.
And bear in mind that just like players, their job depends on the results.
These decisions are never made without consideration.
The Brexit camp could win if the economy is in a bad position in 2017
David Cameron’s halfway re-negotiation strategy for Britain’s stay in the EU is getting deeper and deeper day by day, even without Jeremy “yes or no” Corbyniak’s election as leader of the Labour Party or the TUC mocking Europe sharply on Tuesday.
Other countries have their own Corbyn and Nigel Farage.
A European diplomat recently explained how many crises the EU is facing – even though not all are its own deeds. Some member states are tired of Britain’s self-sufficient agenda, which includes disagreement-inducing concessions and harmful treaty changes that they don’t even really want.
At the annual TUC Congress in Brighton, it was decided that they would not like the EU if it crushed the social security system.
We could call it, for example, the selfie agenda of Dave and George.
The Prime Minister and the Chancellor hang out at summits and bilateral negotiations in the capitals of different countries, take a picture of themselves in front of the famous monument, with or without high-ranking people, return home and say they have found allies for reforms.
Everything is related to me.
“Don’t leave us alone with France,” Berlin says, suggesting that more and more short-sighted ministers and officials in different capitals have come to the point that we no longer care whether we stay or leave.
Angela Merkel, the reasonable German chancellor, is an ally but has been in power for ten years and wants to leave the post before it ruins, as happened to those who stayed too long: Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
French President Francois Hollande will be re-elected in 2017.
His power is falling too.
Poland could soon have a nationalist right-wing government, while Spain could soon have a left-wing government.
It is hard to imagine them rushing to help selfie Britons who could use their energy better to try to prevent Scotland from leaving the United Kingdom.
Some of these ministers may plan to intentionally throw useless comments on the style of the Scottish National Party in the 2017 UK popular election campaign to speed up the Brexit process, my friend suggests.
“The renewal negotiations were an arranged matter. ... Britain had nothing left of the renewal negotiations.”
Europeans know how the British press is plundering and how the EU-sceptical oligarchic press is, just like Tony Benn’s 1975 referendum, whose outcome was 2:1 in favour of joining the EU in 1973.
Someone may remind himself of Boris Johnson, a geek-like euro-opportunist who became known as “our EU direct banana correspondent” in Brussels in the early 1990s.
Ed Miliband at least knew his enemy.
These include tax evaders, phones hackers, and seemingly temporary settlers who own most of our good newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair thought about the same thing about them, but then realized that when you’re in a cage with a rough gorilla, you have to stretch bananas for a jerk so that the gorilla won’t eat you both for lunch and dinner.
Miliband was more blairish than Blair when he opposed the referendum. Blairhan admitted to the EU Constitution, which was then rejected.When France and the Netherlands rejected the agreement in a referendum in 2005, Blair was conveniently out of the pit.
The press never forgave him.
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn, who gently knocked me on my back at Westminster on Monday. I told him that he has no longer time to waste on me. There may be a risk that he will introduce Neil Kinnock’s media boycott strategy from the 80s. It was a mistake and is still.
It may take time, but Corbyn must develop a consistent strategy for socializing with the media.Not with me, but with Andrew Marrin, on whose BBC sofa he sat on Sunday.
Corbyn’s official stance on Europe is what we politely call constructive.
He says he wants to keep us in a reformed Europe.
Most people outside of Ukip and Tory can probably answer this affirmatively.
That’s what Hilary “Benn but not Bennit” Benn said on radio and television this week, as her inner patrol boyfriend tried not to admit that it was a bad bet from Corbyn to appoint the shy John McDonnell as shadow finance minister.
It reminded me of the 1970s when his old father had trouble being disloyal to his Labour counterparts on television without going too far and losing his seat in the lower house.
Hilary’s problems were more interesting.
Benn said he was opposed to staying in the EU "under any circumstances." McDonnell did not say so, nor to Corbyn's colleagues and members of the House of Commons in a private meeting on Monday night.
Wished Corbyn to convey no matter how evil the picture was, it must be remembered that he touched even me. The messenger is important in the 24/7 era, especially in the social media torment where paranoia and deceit flourish.
Cameron doesn’t need to be given a free passport to the EU in order to take Labour’s support as a matter of course in a referendum, as McDonnell has said.
At least Simon Jenkins thinks so.
McDonnell and Corbyn’s equivocation of EU membership fits Benoit’s blockade economy and anti-capitalist past. The discussions are no longer just part of the narrow circle of leftist dissenters, for whom the idea that similarity unites is a key doctrine in the doctrinal chaos.
Tom Watson is unwavering that Corbyn is not campaigning for leaving NATO. Foreign diplomats are forced to try to clarify the matter to their home countries.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital? They have suspicious voters. Why should they give concessions to Britain when everything can be futile?
The United States has already been quite disappointed by the British miserable military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even by the Tory government’s cuts. I was reminded of this on Monday at the launch of the British Influence Security Forum.
Experts criticize the British authority's statements on electronic cigarettes
According to the researchers, the state-funded institution’s claims that e-cigarette smoking is 95 percent less harmful than traditional smoking came from a meeting of 12 participants, some of whom have links to the tobacco industry.
Experts have criticized the evidence presented in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) and the Lancet Medical Journal in the Public Health England (PHE) report on e-cigarettes.
The PHE described its report published last month as a “reversible and comprehensive review of the results.”
However, several researchers have questioned the reliability of the data and highlighted the links of some experts to the tobacco industry.
The main article of the Lancet Medical Journal last month laid a “remarkably good foundation” on which the PHE’s main conclusion is based.
In addition, two researchers have questioned in the BMJ whether the claims are based on "rock or sand."
Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, have stated: “The basic assumption of public health is that policies are based on clear evidence of their effectiveness.”
According to McKee and Capewell, the general public is assuming that the PHE’s claim that “the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are about 95 percent less harmful than conventional cigarettes” should be based on a detailed analysis and modeling of the research results.
The claim stems from one meeting of 12 people, which was convened to develop a model based on multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA). The model was intended to unify the views of participants on the adverse effects of nicotine products.
According to McKee and Capewell, among the supporters of the meeting were EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO’s previous independent research, according to sources, was funded by British American Tobacco (BAT).
In addition, in the Sustainability Report, the CEO demonstrated his support for BAT-compliant public health actions.
One of the 12 participants in the meeting granted funding from the e-cigarette manufacturer, but the alleged previous funding from the tobacco company Philip Morris International was not granted.
However, there are several well-known supporters of e-cigarettes, some of whom acknowledge their participation as industry funders.
However, some of the participants are not known for their expertise in the field of anti-smoking.
The meeting was also attended by PHE’s tobacco officer.
According to McKee and Capewell, the group’s research report shows that there is no unambiguous evidence of the harmfulness of products for a wide range of products and their compliance with criteria.
However, links or shortcomings are not mentioned in the PHE report.
According to the PHE report, there is no evidence so far that e-cigarettes may promote smoking in children or non-smokers.
According to PHE’s director of health and well-being, Professor Kevin Fenton, the allegations have been answered earlier.
According to Fenton, e-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than traditional smoking.
One in two people who smoke throughout their lives will die from tobacco addiction.
All evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes are lower than those of traditional tobacco, but long-term effects need to be studied more closely.
PHE is obliged to inform citizens of what the evidence shows and what it does not show, especially in situations where the relative hazards compared to traditional tobacco are unclear.
There are 80,000 smoking-related deaths in the UK every year, and smoking costs public health 2 billion pounds a year.
Responsible action requires that we clearly present current evidence that e-cigarettes are not a risk-free alternative, but the harm they cause is a fraction of the harm of traditional tobacco.
BBC should quit EastEnders, says Channel 4 chief
Luke Johnson, chief executive of Channel 4, has said that the BBC should stop broadcasting certain programs, including EastEnders and The Voice. Johnson said commercial competitors would give their right hand to hits such as the soap series Albert Square.
Johnson said the license fee should only be used to produce programs that other television stations do not.
He criticized the BBC for likely showing programs that reach smaller audiences at the same time as the competitors’ broadcasts of large audiences, and for example on the BBC4.
After BBC chief executive Tony Hall announced that the company wanted to expand cooperation with other organizations, Johnson said he had been trying for six years to get Channel 4 to collaborate with the BBC, without success.
“I disagree with the idea that the BBC would buy formats and broadcast programs that would clearly belong to the software of a competing channel,” Johnson told a communication committee in the upper house of parliament, which examined the future of the BBC.
If the BBC wants to keep a broadcast fee, which I think is not necessarily a good idea in the medium or long term, it should reduce its supply to at least programs that are not produced and purchased by others.
The BBC is broadcasting The Voice at its best viewing time because it wants the widest possible support in the future.
If no other channel cares about the program, it’s clearly ridiculous nonsense.
"I don't understand why a regressive tax should fund programs that could be funded without subsidies," Johnson said.
The Voice is one of these, EastEnders is another, although it is its own production.
Many channels would give their right hand to it.
I don’t understand how this serves the broadcaster’s service offer.
I don’t think that would be a loss for the BBC.”
Johnson is a serial entrepreneur who was at the head of Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010. He believes the BBC has good audience numbers because the company has ambitious people working at it and because they believe it is the best way to guarantee long-term support.
Johnson’s comments on BBC’s most popular series are similar to those of former Sky boss Tony Ballin, who suggested at his MacTaggart lecture in 2003 that the BBC sell out series like EastEnders.
According to Johnson, BBC’s niche audiences are broadcast on BBC4, where viewers can’t be measured mostly, but the programs are fulfilling their purpose. “BBC can say, by defending its hypocritical missions for broadcast payments of £4 billion, that it has done special programs that no one has watched.”
"The BBC shows them at times when nobody ever sees them."
On broadcast payments, Johnson said: “I’m challenging you to look for another system just as outdated in the sense of who gets the best benefit.
Everyone, of course, thinks that £150 a year is inexpensive, but for people it’s a huge sum, especially if you don’t watch the BBC very much.”
Former Sky and Channel 5 chief David Elstein, who also expressed his views in the committee on Tuesday, said the BBC should exchange its ancient missions for new "information, teaching and entertaining".
According to Elstein, there are hardly any tutorials on the BBC’s current offer – 1 percent on television and 0.1 percent on radio.
Elstein suggests that the BBC could add more broadcasts from events such as the Proms festival, which last year only broadcasted a fraction of its concerts. "BBC should also join alliances with commercial channels so that the entire offer is also available online," he continues.
Brain cells can be controlled by sound waves using sonogenetics
The video shows how the sewing mattress changes its direction when they are targeted by ultrasound.
Scientists have grown worms whose nervous system has been genetically modified.
Small spots change their direction when they are subjected to ultrasound with a frequency above the hearing area of the human ear.
Sound waves activate movement nerve cells that have been genetically modified to have a transport film that reacts to ultrasound.
Scientists are monitoring brain activity using light
According to the researchers, worms were able to demonstrate the power of a new sonogenetic method (dubbed sonogenetics). In this method, ultrasound is used to activate brain, heart and muscle cells with stimuli coming from outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that the method could one day replace deep brain stimulation (DBS).
Chalasani noted that worms, however, begin to react when placed in a liquid with microscopically small bubbles.
According to Chalasan, the bubbles intensify the ultrasound waves that progress into the worms.
Enhanced ultrasound waves affect TRP4 ion channels, which are part of the worm cell membranes.
According to an article published in the journal Nature Communications, sound waves cause these ion channels to open and activate the cells they are attached to.
In order to control the scabies by ultrasound, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that TRP4 ion channels appeared in some of the nerves controlling their movement.
When the modified worms were directed by ultrasound, the micro-bubbles strengthened the sound waves and moved to the worms, triggering a signal in the nerve cell.
The method is a bit like optogenetics, which is a revolutionary tool that allows scientists to activate nerve cells using light.
However, according to Chalasan, sonogenetics has certain advantages over optogenetics.
Light into the brain under study is directed to light by means of optical fibers. Low-frequency ultrasounds instead pass through the cell easily, so ultrasound can be directed to the brain through the skull.
“We believe that through gene therapy and viral therapy, human nerve cells can be temporarily exposed to ultrasound signals in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments,” Chalasani said.
According to the researcher, the method could also be used in muscle cells and insulin-producing cells.
Illegal torture tools – at your doorstep!
Advertisements are a shame for British arms trade
Watch the video of Amnesty International’s anti-arms trade fair.
Three deadly missiles.
Trailers breaking cars.
The bombs!
Remote removals that cause unbearable pain but leave no traces!
The joyful sound and drawings clearly reveal that the advertisement at the world’s largest trade fair is a parody.The video is produced by Amnesty International and is intended to highlight the British government’s attempt to sell weapons to repressive governments at the Defense Security and Equipment International (DSEI) trade fair at the ExCel Exhibition Centre in Docklands, London.
DSEI: Autoritarian Regimes Arriving in London
There are also posters on bus stops and subway cars that require a second look.
"Important Notice: Are you taking the subway between September 15th and September 18th?" The announcement looks like the London subway announcement.
"In September, a group of arms dealers arrives in Docklands. Customers are asked to help to close the station."
Three hundred posters were made by artists whose works were exhibited at the Banksy Dismaland Museum of Cruel Designs.
A collective called the Special Patrol Group helped distribute posters around London with a £6 “advertising space hacking package” containing six-point keys that are alleged to access about a third of the world’s bus stops’ advertising posters.
Transport for London is not posters vandalism laugh.
One of the Special Patrol Group collections.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Cruel Designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists have begun to question things and want to bring their political works to the public outside the galleries.
Artists have discovered that social influence through art requires art to be brought into the real world.
Another of the anti- gun trafficking posters greeting public transport users in the subway.
The Amnesty’s video has been viewed over 100,000 times over the course of a day via Facebook. It has been designed without compensation by the advertising agency VCCP, and both the graphic designer and the copywriter have also done their work without compensation.
Matt Lever, the artistic director of the VCCP, was amazed at the absence of exhibition advertising and an empty spot on the ExCeL event calendar. He insisted, “Give them a campaign they are trying to avoid.”
They tried to make a more realistic, obscure corporate video, but bright colors and animation attract attention better.”
“They have done an amazing job and helped us highlight fairs of illicit trafficking in torture instruments,” said Tom Davies of Amnesty International.
“Now the government must take action to ensure that torture instruments are not illicitly traded right at our doorstep.”
Per the most creative feature of the station fairs is presented in the exhibition halls themselves in the ExCeL, where exhibitors take advantage of spectacular circular expressions of their trading assets.
In a press release, Saab announced an order from the U.S. military for a “portable AT4CS RS.”
The product includes "a specially designed combat cannon that effectively penetrates directly into the target."
It doesn’t sound very pleasant.
Eight Golden Rules for Living in Student Housing
I moved to a student residence 11 years ago. I was innocent at the age of 19 and still believed in barettes and moral relativism. Only now do I remember their violent smiles that I irritated, and the countless, long complaints of others.
I can summarize the most important lessons in eight simple rules.
Moving into a home is at least a burdensome experience and at worst a shocking one.
It’s easy to tell everyone where you’re from, if you liked the break and why, what you like about Corbyn and why you don’t “really hate or love Marmite, because it’s just a yeast extract, ahahahahah, I’m in my room.”
Take a breath sometimes.
And help others to breathe: show your interest and ask others things.
Questioning guides the conversation and helps you find people you like and people you’t talk to even when your eyebrows were on display and those people would share shutters.
Give others space.
Own rooms often serve as drinking baths, cinemas and public living rooms, but private rooms are also a place to dress up, starting with underwear.
Read more: Don’t even imagine combining dating and college studies
For introverts, college is a tough place.
Your own room should be a place of relaxation, however, in many dormitories a social culture is formed, where one walks from room to room and forms lifelong friendships.
Such a culture can be a nightmare for a person who needs a place to recover.
In this environment, it’s not possible to say, “I like you and I want our friendship to continue, but I want you to go away so I can recharge the energy I spent chatting with you.”
Try to see if any of your fellow students are tired of social interaction. Per it would be better not to knock on the door and send a text instead.
Speaking of knocking: knock.
In my student residence there was a guy who thought the unlocked door meant he was welcome in.
He saw all sorts.
Make friends by baking.
You start your studies properly when baking is in, so if you bak brownies and knock on someone’s door, you won’t look like a 50-year-old, a little strange case: “Welcome to the neighborhood, I baked you something small.
Homemade delicacies are a great way to make new friends.
Your fellow students are forced to talk to you. A delicious surprise will allow them to have a positive image of you.
This, of course, requires you to have reasonable baking skills.
If you serve unfortunate cocks filled with flour, sugar, and fat, others will probably pretend to sleep when you knock on the door.
Food craving is also a common failure in student housing.
To take out another chicken is, of course, to steal, but can a drop of tea be poured out of someone else’s milk?
Always check with the owner.
Probably you will get permission, even if the milk quotation would jerk the owner of the box.
I understand very well that it’s annoying if someone whispers something from you. Still try to deal with the situation as adultly as possible – unlike my fellow student, who laundered milk with a detergent to punish milk thieves.
The woman is now in prison.
Don’t grumble when others are trying to fall asleep.
Not only is it polite, but it’s also worth remembering that each other’s hole digs...
In my own dormitory, a girl asked a resident of a neighboring room to adjust the music switch to lower, because it was three in the morning, and she had an exam in the morning.
The neighbor only increased the volume.
When the neighbor's room finally silenced, the girl let the neighbor sleep for two hours. she left for three hours for the exam, left the music fresh in her room and locked the door.
Wouldn’t it be romantic if your future spouse moved into the same apartment?
And’t it be strange if you first thought that your fellow student would be your future spouse, you would start dating, you would break up and you would have to see him every day and you would lose the right of your common friends to meet him?
Of course, the heart wants what it wants. If the fellow student is definitely not the only one right, try to curb your desire.
If you notice at a time of trouble that someone has forgotten their keys to a room whose door is not locked, the boundary between bullying and bullying is more blurred than you might think.
A good joke is funny, but one that recovers in an instant.
Hiding an object can be a valuable and fun lesson, but no one’s room should be confused with toothpaste and shampoo.
The door of the second room can be locked and the keys dropped in a glass of water to be placed in the freezer, but do not attach anyone’s items to the ceiling with a blue stamp a couple of times more.
A racist attack on the accommodation of foreign students in Kite - a house planned as a reception center was shattered in Salò
A racist attack on the accommodation of foreign students was carried out on Saturday morning in Kite, North Karelia.
Contrary to what the police said earlier, it is not the accommodation of minors asylum-seekers, but the sleeping rooms of foreign students who have been in Finland for a longer period of time, says Heidi Luukkainen, a teacher at the Evangelical Folk University of Kite.
The windows and walls of the university’s accommodation premises were stamped with racist signs, such as bars, and a metal object was thrown through the window of one of the accommodation premises, says the Eastern Finland police.
According to Luukkainen, who serves as a responsibility teacher for the youth community guarantee education at the University of Kansas, an estimated 10 people were in the building at the time of the attack.
“There was a weekend and adults were free to move, so some could be elsewhere,” Luukkainen says.
The university hosts people from 12 different nationalities.
They are students who have been in Finland for some time, as well as young asylum seekers who have just arrived.
Everyone in the building has an A-status.
Some are studying in adult primary school, some are in professional studies and some are studying Finnish,” Luukkainen says.
A status is a permanent residence permit that can be granted for four years at a time to a foreigner who has been in Finland for some time.
Police are investigating the incident as a violation of home peace.
According to Luukkainen, a briefing was held for the students on Monday, where the necessary interpreters were also present.
There was no panic here, and no one wanted to leave.
We have had foreign students for over a decade, and this is the first time that something like this happens,” Luukkainen says.
According to him, the rubbish has already been cleared from the walls.
The perpetrators are suspected of being at least three men and they were in a light car.
I think this is the main pitch of the youth weekend after this topic has now been on the surface.
There’s nothing more serious than that,” he said.
There is also a hospital in Salou, where a reception center is planned.
The incident happened last week.
This was on MTV’s website on Tuesday.
The walls of the hospital were painted with the inscription "You are not welcome".
A criminal report has been filed to the police.
Accuracy 15.9. at 16.02 Corrected incorrect information given by the police about the age and status of people living in the building.
The state shuts down the Y-train to Karja - passengers in their clutches, "completely idiotic"
The Y-train from Helsinki to Raaseborg will stop operating in March.
The news annoyed passengers on the start of the train at the main railway station in Helsinki.
In particular, the downturn hits the blessed people, said Torbjörn Bengtström, who lives in the municipality.
It’s very idiotic, because the population is growing all the time and those who are working need a fast and smooth connection to Helsinki.
It can’t depend on anything other than political will or lack of it.
Bengtström says in a video interview with HSTV that he will come to the capital by a tractor.
In other parts of the country there are also changes in trains.
The H and R trains on the main line will be merged into a new R line.
The Purola station in Järvenpää and Nuppulinna Tuusul stays out of service.
On Tuesday, the Ministry of Transport and Communications and VR announced the details on which routes the Ministry will purchase train services for the next contract period.
The contract period will change at the end of the year and there will be closed routes across the country.
The new four-year contract, which will be finalised in the autumn, will be approved by the Monetary Affairs Committee later.
Siuntian Bengtström considers that the state train cutting machine is a short-sighted activity.
Make the same mistakes that have been made before and repeat them very systematically.
Then comes regret.
The Y train is also used by non-Raseborans and Blessed people because it is fast and passes several stations.
Spanish woman Annina Pöyry was upset by the fate of those travelling beyond the city area by train.
"It's specifically unfortunate for those who have to re-planning their trip," he said while hurting on the Y train.
A little relief is promised.
There will probably be a new train connection to the Rantara, which will replace the Y-train in the Helsinki Seudun Traffic (HSL) area, i.e. it will take you to Kirkkonum.
This leads to additional costs for HSL, i.e. in practice for the municipalities of the region and their taxpayers.
“We are now exploring the different options and their impact on service levels and ticket prices,” said Suvi Rihtniemi, CEO of HSL.
Costs cannot be estimated accurately.
Rihtniemi says that based on the number of passengers, HSL has paid about one million for the Y-train in a year, the ministry of course much more than this.
The R line leaves two stations in between.
On the other hand, the number of trains in Ainola and Saunakalli is doubling.
A total of 28 small stations and numerous routes are closed across the country.
The Ministry will no longer purchase train services on the routes Joensuu-Nurmes, Tampere-Keuruu and Jyväskylä-Haapamäki-Seinäjoki.
The Route Pieksämäki-Joensuu will be abbreviated to the Route Pieksämäki-Varkaju.
Trains are reduced on the routes Riihimäki-Lahti, Hanko-Karjaa, Kouvola-Kotka port and Kajaani-Oulu.
More than half a million journeys are made per year, while the total number of journeys purchased by the Ministry is about nine million.
The new agreement is intended to bring the state annual savings of 12.3 million.
The value of the contract is approximately 27.5 million euros per year.
Sixten Korkman wrote a chapter in the book "Actuality of Capital": "Marx is worth studying"
The crises of the world economy have brought to the surface Karl Marx (1818-1883) and his main work, Capital, published in 1867-1894, writes the former chairman of the SKP, Yrjö Hakanen, in the book Marx’s Capital’s Actuality, published today.
“He is being taken more seriously now than he has been in a long time,” Hakanen writes in his preface.
Marx’s assessments of the development, internationalization and increasing penetration of capitalist economy into all spheres of life, of the concentration of capital, and of the growing role of money capital and fictional capital have proved astonishingly far-reaching.
Among the authors of the book based on the Capital seminars organized by Hakasen is also Aalto University professor, renowned economist Sixten Korkman.
In the book, Korkman writes that Marx is current “now and forever.”
Isn’t the former director of the Institute for Economic Research and the Delegation for Economic Affairs, however, a Marxist?
At least not.
Korkman says on the phone that he does not consider Marx to be a contemporary economic thinker, but rather an interesting social theorist.
Today, social sciences have differentiated and specialized, but Marx was a philosopher, historian, sociologist, economist, journalist, political agitator, and literary expert.
“The common belief is that the history of ideas tells about the false opinions of the dead men,” Korkman begins.
It is true that Marx’s predictions went terribly wrong.
Although Marx understood the nature and significance of the industrial revolution, he drew too far-reaching conclusions from the beginning of capitalism.
But Korkman sees value in Marx’s radical attitude.
“More relevant about Marx is that he asked good questions,” he says.
Now we are again discussing Marx’s interests, such as the distribution of wealth.
"Marx may be an inspiration for those who want to understand the big picture, a world that is changing as a result of a technological revolution," Korkman analyses.
But in what the government should decide tomorrow, Marx is not helpful.
He believes that capitalism is a hopeless case that should only be stopped.
However, Marx believes that Korkman should be examined.
“In the 1970s Marx could not read,” says Korkman.
“The Maoists and Trotskyists and the other factions hated capitalism all, but even more one another.”
Today, the discussion is more diverse, and even Marx can be approached without the ideological and political burden of the years back.
“Every social scientist should get acquainted with Marx’s world of thought – as with other classics,” Korkman says.
UN calls for war crimes in Sri Lanka
The United Nations is calling for the establishment of a special court to investigate war crimes committed during the civil war in Sri Lanka.
The United Nations report on the civil war between 1983 and 2009 was released on Wednesday after a long delay.
The report blames both the Sri Lankan armed forces and the Tamil rebels for war crimes.
The civil war in Sri Lanka has killed at least 100,000 people.
The exact number of victims is not known.
Particularly the massive attack by the armed forces in the last months of the long war in 2009 should be properly investigated, the UN report calls for.
The report blames the Sri Lankan armed forces for torture, kidnapping and systematic sexual violence, with men as likely as women to be victims.
According to the report, the rebels are responsible for forcing outsiders and children to become fighters.
Both parties are accused of the murder.
Sri Lanka responded on Wednesday that it intends to conduct the investigation itself, but will not allow the establishment of the UN Court of Justice because of foreign judges.
In English yo-exam, social media was punctuated
In the autumn student writings there was a long foreign language turn on Wednesday, most of which was English.
More than 16,000 people tested their English skills.
In the experiment, you could write a material even on social media.
From our own experience, we had to think about whether social media makes us lonely and unhappy.
Alternatively, a 150-250-word writing in English could be directed to the editor of the online newspaper’s advisory board.
It was called Dear Agony Aunt.
Agony Aunt corresponds to Finnish Leelia's sleeping chair.
He was asked to advise how parents should look at things from a younger perspective as well.
There were four subjects, one of which was to be chosen.
"It was the most difficult of them," said Mia Lybeck, an English lecturer at the Swedish-language high school in Borgonya.
This is a quote from the former President of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso.
The fourth point was very good for Lybeck.
It had to write a fire talk about why companies should hire young people to work.
"At least in our school, we have been trained to write speeches," Lybeck says, evaluating the entire exam as "pretty normal."
In the Finnish – or Swedish – English test, questions were answered about texts that covered, for example, the adaptation of the summer campsite to climate change and the handling of large data masses.
On Wednesday, some length was also written in Russian (168 students), German (124), French (52) and Spanish (27).
The autumn tests will continue on Friday, when the second domestic test, Sweden or Finland, will be held.
In high schools, the exam is held normally, i.e. the demonstration of the employees does not affect it.
The Student Examination Board urges the examiners to find suitable connections in time so that they can get to the examination.
Additional time may also be granted if you can prove that the delay was not due to your own negligence.
In Oulu theft with gun threat
On Wednesday morning, a shop was robbed in the city district of Oulu.
According to police, the robber was dressed in dark clothes and was covered with a commandopop.
He is a normal man and is about 30 years old.
Police said the man threatened the staff with a gun and seized a small sum of money.
This is being investigated as a robbery.
Police are preparing for tens of thousands of protesters to arrive in Helsinki – support parties from elsewhere in Finland
A protest against the government’s cuts will block down central Helsinki on Friday, police predict.
According to preliminary data, tens of thousands of people are expected to attend.
The members of the Federation, Akava and STTK will meet at the Railway at 11 a.m.
Police are also expected to participate in the demonstration.
The task of the police officers at work is not only to handle alarm tasks and other police activities, but also to ensure the running of the giant demonstration.
The roads leading to the railway line will be closed for motor vehicles for about 9:30-14 hours.
Only emergency vehicles are allowed into the area.
From the direction of Hakaniemi, traffic will be cut off from the point of the Kaisaniemi traffic circle, from the west direction from the Mannerheiminti.
Is there enough people at the Helsinki Police Department, High Commissioner Seppo Kujala?
At least for now it seems to be enough.
I am not talking about police work.
As a result of the protests, support groups from other parts of Finland are coming to Helsinki.
The exact numbers are not revealed by the police.
“Something is coming, but generally we can do it on our own,” Kujala says.
The police are advising to avoid private cars in the centre of Helsinki on Friday.
Kujala estimates that the worst traffic jamming extends from the level of Hakaniemi to the core center.
Traffic stops are expected from early morning.
With the protesters coming from other parts of Finland, many buses are also coming to Helsinki.
They are not allowed on the railway.
The buses are very far away.
At the end of the journey, we have to walk to the demonstration site,” Kujala says.
The protest also stopped public transportation in Helsinki.
From a police perspective, there is a positive side to this.
The question of the smoothness of public transport, which is normally at hand in these large crowd gatherings, is now partly dealing with itself.
The organizers of the demonstration have informed the police that tens of thousands of opponents of the government’s economic policy could arrive in Helsinki.
Police are expecting the demonstration to proceed peacefully.
There are ordinary unemployed people – ordinary citizens.
The Finns are reasonable and peaceful people,” Kujala says.
There will also be local demonstrations across Finland on Friday.
Friday’s demonstration is in many ways exceptional – do you remember those strikes and demonstrations?
The big demonstration organized by the trade unions on Friday is interesting and exceptional in many ways.
For example, there is no very good benchmark for this in Finnish political history, says Martti Siisiäinen, professor of sociology at Jyväskylä University.
It is not surprising that the AI movement is protesting.
If it did not, it would raise hands in front of the government, Siisiäinen said.
A very right-wing government has struck the core points of the Finnish corporatism tradition – and also those that have been important for the development of the Finnish welfare state.
There is a lack of government contracts in the law.
Here are a lot of features that the ay movement is actually trying to get on its knees.
At the same time, the ay movement also has a place to look in the mirror.
A mirror is needed, for example, because the ay movement does not have the support of all employees for the Friday demonstrations.
New now is the sharp division that the demonstration creates among the crowd that the ay movement would like to participate in the demonstration.
Unemployed people from all over Finland demonstrated in the House of Representatives in November 1993.
If a benchmark is sought for the Friday demonstration, it could be a giant unemployment demonstration, Murrostorstai, held in 1993, Siisiäinen says.
In the midst of the deepest downturn, Murrostorstai gathered 20,000 unemployed.
The Esko Ahon (central) government is computing from one labour market crisis to another.
It was said that the relations between the Finnish government and the employers' organizations had never been so bad as during the Aho bourgeois government.
Now the relationship between the government and the ay movement is even worse than it was in Murrostorstai’s time.
Furthermore, there is now a very bourgeois government in Finland, Siisiäinen says.
The current coalition is still so interesting that it is so strictly right-wing despite the speeches of the Basic Finns.
There were certain elements of the old working-class movement at the time of the Jytky.
Thousands of protesters are expected on Friday.
The demonstration will also stop public transport and possibly close kindergartens and schools.
Although the demonstration does not receive the unshared support of the employees, it may become the highest in years.
Over the past few years, about 300 demonstrations have been held in Helsinki every year.
They are wide.
Traditionally, the protests of the Ay movement in Finland have been quite peaceful - although the practices have been tightened in recent years.
Traditionally, in the Finnish demonstration, conflict is avoided and law is obeyed.
The protesters try to avoid damaging or destroying property, Siisiäinen says.
The late 1990s brought new winds.
The culture of demonstration has changed.
EU membership made farmers nervous to throw eggs and police prepared to catch pork.
The firefighters strike lasted for three months.
There were also strikes among pilots and flight managers.
Do you remember these strikes and protests?
Electricity and Metal Industries in the 1970s
The most significant strikes of the 1970s were a metal strike in 1971 and a power plant and electricity strike in 1977.
70,000 metal workers participated in the strike.
The strike was suspended on the proposal of the conciliation committee after a seven-week strike.
The employees received a 16% salary increase.
In the spring of 1977, a power outage lasted for 49 days and caused power outages across the country.
Crashed in 1993
On November 4, 1993, around 20,000 people, many of whom were unemployed, gathered in front of the House of Representatives to demonstrate in favour of the work.
Firefighters strike for three months in 1998
The fire strike was one of the longest, if not the longest, national strikes of the 1990s.
Farmers opposed the EU in 1994 and 1999
In 1994, farmers protested against the EU.
“Siberia teaches, the EU stops,” was one of the slogans.
The farmers have taken a ton of snow.
The European Union summit in Helsinki in 1999 also prompted farmers to protest and burn strawberries in front of the meeting place.
Nurses strike in 1983 and 1995
The nurses went on strike for about a month in 1995.
The last time they were on strike was in 1983.
The strike of 1995 was colored by a few deaths during the strike.
Tehy threatened a strike and mass displacement of nurses in 2007.
The threat of mass displacement ultimately accelerated the negotiations.
Doctors Strike in 2001
"Doctors on strike - forced," was the slogan of striking doctors in 2001.
The strike of local health centers and hospital doctors lasted for five months and sparked a lively debate about how strikes could jeopardize patient safety.
After the strike, the public sector raised the salaries of doctors.
Students in 2013
Around 5,000 students marched for study support from the Senate Tower to the parliamentary house in Helsinki in 2013.
Central crime police investigate the background of a Finnish truck filled with refugees for Austrian police
Austrian police have requested assistance from the Central Criminal Police to find out the backgrounds of a refugee cargo registered in Finland.
On Sunday, Austrian police stopped a truck carrying 42 refugees near the German border in Aisterheim.
It is not known whether the truck was on its way to Finland.
Everyone in the car was in good condition.
We have had an exchange of information with the Austrian police.
The investigation and main responsibility is on the scene in Austria, said Tero Haapala, the High Commissioner of the Central Criminal Police.
At the end of August, other refugees travelling in a truck in Austria suffered more fatalities.
All 71 passengers on board died of suffocation.
According to the Austrian broadcaster Yleisradio, the truck belongs to a Finnish company.
The company is engaged in, among other things, restaurant activities and its CEO is a man of foreign descent, about 40 years old.
Two Iraqis have been arrested in Austria for human trafficking.
A captain who beat refugees, a former drug courier and a wealthy businessman - the story of five smugglers
A wealthy king of smugglers, a violent boatkeeper, a style-conscious missionary and a good taxi driver.
For example, such people are engaged in human smuggling into the European Union.
Criminologist Andrea Di Nicola, who works at the University of Trento, and journalist Giampaolo Musumeci have met and interviewed dozens of smugglers and their “customers”, and their book Death Travel Agency will be published in Finnish this week.
In the book, they introduce the tricks of human trafficking, propose solutions and introduce smugglers from different stages of the business.
HS presents five of them.
Immediately remove them from you.
The Kerkenna Islands on the eastern coast of Tunisia do not attract foreign tourists, but many Tunisians head there for a summer holiday.
Due to their location, the islands are also ideal for smuggling, as the journey to the Italian island of Lampedusa is only 120 kilometers.
For comparison, the distance from Helsinki to Tallinn is approximately 85 kilometers.
There, in the village of El Attaya, lives Emir, a chain-burning captain and father of six children.
The Kerkenna Islands are famous for their shrimp, but it is more profitable for a fisherman to transport people.
That’s what Emir has done with his blue, ten-metre-long cotton boat hundreds of times.
If the boat is full, it can accommodate 40 people.
For one trip, Emir earns about 8,000 euros after expenses.
Emir has five assistants who are looking for clients for him across Tunisia.
Guests come from many countries, but during the Arab Spring a huge number of Tunisians wanted to escape the unrest.
The situation then calmed down until the refugee crisis broke up again.
Guests arrive from the mainland to the Kerkenna Islands in small groups.
Emir houses them in empty houses for as long as he sees fit.
Food is provided in such a way that customers just stay alive.
Accommodation costs around 75 euros per night, and if the customer gets out of money, it’s their problem.
We go to the water at midnight with the lights turned off.
The first night we drive away from the islands, then stop, wait for the day and drive the next night to Lampedusa.
Sometimes sailing is harsh, and in 20-meter-high waves, passengers cry and vomit.
The ship is disembarked in half an hour and Emir is on the way back.
Emily wants him to be afraid.
That’s why he beat his clients and at least claims to be killing the whistleblowers.
He tells the book that when the police once struck him, he threw all his passengers over the edge and told them to swim to the nearest island.
“I met clients one by one from the neck and threw them over the edge,” Emir says in the book.
The most peaceful travelers come from the south of the Sahara.
He said his countrymen should be abused by this.
I think you’ll get rid of them right away.
They must immediately be shown who rules here.
Ordinary taxi driver
Goran is an ordinary taxi driver in Bogova, Serbia.
His taxi is not very good - the start engine is pulling its last and still it has seen its best days.
For Goran’s customers, however, the most important thing is that the taxi is moving at all, and that it is moving towards the Hungarian border.
Bogovaða is a small village of 500 inhabitants about 60 kilometers southwest of Belgrade.
Next to the village is a centre for asylum seekers, which is mostly allowed to families.
In the forests surrounding the city centre, men traveling without their families are housed in tents, barracks and abandoned cars, which now everyone has managed to find or build.
There are also families living in the forest who, for some reason or another, have not applied for asylum in Serbia.
Some are also housed in private houses, but it is a public secret.
Among Foresters, Goran finds the majority of its customers.
These are often exhausted - the route through the Balkans requires a large number of border crossings and weekly walks in hard-to-pass terrain, often in mountainous areas and in the dark.
Eventually arriving in Bogota, a major human trafficking hub, people are fatigued.
The Goran Cytians are mainly Syrians, Afghan, Pakistani, Iraqi and Kurds.
The best customers are Syrians, he says in the book.
“They say their thing once and that’s enough,” Goran praises.
He says the Africans are trying to catch up.
Goran does not like that.
The idiot goes all the way.
First, you agree to the price, for example, 300 euros, then they drop it to 200 and eventually offer 150.
Goran emphasizes that he is a nice and kind man.
Money does not interest me.
I just do my job and help people,” he says in the book.
Goran says he works cheaper than others and charges only 50 euros per person to the Hungarian border.
The distance is three hundred kilometers, most comfortably by motorway.
It is said to be three or four times the price.
Goran earns about 50,000 euros a year.
This is not a large sum for a smuggler, but it is a fairly comfortable annual income in Serbia.
Serbia has ordered taxis not to carry migrants closer than 12 kilometers to the Hungarian border.
Goran doesn’t care about it: he knows the roads and shortcuts and takes his Cytes a mile away from the border.
He then points his clients in the right direction and walks away.
The work of mercy
The 35-year-old Congolese man is called Missionary, and it’s not just a nickname.
He actually has a Protestant church in Kampala, Uganda’s capital, which hosts a large number of Congolese refugees, and a small center that helps Congolese refugee children.
In addition to preaching, the Missionary runs a smuggling business in which people are transferred from Congo to Europe.
He does the work of mercy.
It is important for a missionary to look good.
She polishes her shoes several times a day and makes sure that the rubber stripe of the white jerseys glimps elegantly under the low waist of the jeans.
The missionary is proud of his new Mercedes, his off-road car and three motorcycles.
When the Missionary does not preach, he organizes people from Congo to Uganda and on to Europe.
The client will first call one of the Missionary’s five phone numbers.
He advises that it is worth arriving at the border in the morning, hiding the money wisely and stumbling among the merchants crossing the border.
In order to obtain the status of asylum seeker or refugee, the Ugandan authorities must be informed that they come from, for example, war zones in North Kivu, and that they have been forced to flee violence from their homes.
Often this is true, but if not, the Missionary arranges a new identity for the client.
The old identity card will be removed and a new one will be replaced.
This is accompanied by the Missionary’s contacts with Ugandan police.
The client is then directed to the same place where the real asylum seekers go: to the asylum procedure, to NGOs, and finally to the UNHCR.
The missionary knows the bureaucracy because he himself came to Uganda as a refugee.
He charges for each step separately: submitting an application to the Ugandan police costs about one hundred euros, handling documents to a humanitarian organization about 150, and the process of migration, for example, to one of the European countries 4 500-7 000 euros.
Foil and ice
Tom is a beginner smuggler, a former drug courier.
A 40-year-old Irishman journeys on the French coast in Calais, where his job is to load people onto trucks heading to Britain.
He is assisted by an Afghan taxi driver living in London, a French taxi driver and dozens of truck drivers who may not even know they are involved in a human trafficking business.
At night, Tom and a taxi driver picked up their customers, usually 2-3 people, somewhere near the centre of Calais.
They drive the A26 motorway and try to avoid the police.
If the police stopped the car on the highway, Tom and the driver would go straight to jail for organizing illegal immigration.
That’s what Tom doesn’t want, he’s been sitting for seven years because of drugs.
When a taxi stops, Tom and his clients run across the highway to a resting place where the drivers sleep before continuing across the canal to the British.
Tom chooses a suitable truck – you have to make sure it’s on the way to England, not even to the Netherlands, for example – and cuts the safety curtain on the protective cover.
It must be done quietly so that the drivers do not wake up.
Sometimes the driver is in the run, but then the desire is more expensive.
When the route is clear, Tom wraps his client in an aluminum foil, similar to the one wrapped around a fried potato or oven in the kitchen.
It should prevent the police heat scanner from detecting the hiding person.
Some people use ice-filled sleeping bags for the same purpose.
Tom leaves his client in the truck and leaves, hoping that he won’t be able to catch up with the riders before he arrives in Britain.
The King of Smugglers
Muammer Küçük is one of the most famous human traffickers in the world.
He has been called the master of marketing and the undisputed king of illegal landings in the Mediterranean, controlling maritime routes from Turkey to EU countries, mainly to Greece and Italy.
Küçük has been operating since the 1990s and has continuously developed new methods of smuggling.
He also has a competitive advantage over other entrepreneurs: he demands money only when he arrives.
One of the new methods is luxury shipping scams: Turkish ports are allegedly rented fun boats to take U.S. or European families on a comfortable few-day tourist tour.
In reality, the ships are loaded with Syrians, Iraqis, Kurds and Afghans, who are transported for a fee of 5,000 to 7,000 euros first from Istanbul by land to a port and then by sea to Europe.
Customers are kept in human warehouses, such as old industrial halls, until the time comes for them to leave.
People are locked in minibuses and driven somewhere toward the coast.
They are told to hide amongst the vegetation and wait for a sign.
When it is given, it is necessary to get on board quickly.
Passengers must stay hidden under the deck all the time.
The naval guard can only observe how deep the ship was swimming, as no other signs of the crowd are visible.
Food and beverages are given, but the less the travellers exfoliate and vomit, the better.
Küçük receives approximately €53,000 for one luxury boat trip after expenses.
He does not do the practical things himself, but hired captains, recruiters, guards, hosts and other smaller agents to do the work for themselves.
During the summer season, transports are organized at least hundreds and Küçük earns millions.
He is believed to have bought land, a pharmaceutical company and more than a hundred apartments he rents through cover companies.
Muammer Küçük was arrested in 2011 simultaneously with a member of the Turkish Democratic Party and a pharmaceutical businessman.
After that, he apparently disappeared.
Correction 16.9.2015 at 15.10: The book Death Travel Agency will appear this week, not next week.
American Olympic runner in a book about his illness and becoming a prostitute
Three-time Olympic runner Suzy Favor Hamilton’s new book has attracted attention in the United States.
In his book Fast Girl, Favor Hamilton tells the story of ending her career and becoming a prostitute.
Sports Illustrated published the book on Tuesday.
Favor Hamilton ended his career at the Sydney Olympics.
He entered the competition in top form and ran in the second best time.
In the end, he fell in panic.
He rushed to the top at the beginning and defended his leadership position with a ground run.
150 meters before the goal, however, his powers were exhausted.
He crashed to the surface of the track, and the other competitors passed him one after the other.
I felt like an idiot and thought I would never run again.
But I forced myself to go beyond the goal line, says Favor Hamilton in his book.
It was later revealed that Favor Hamilton suffered from bipolar disorder.
His brother Dan had committed suicide a year before the Sydney Games, and he himself felt tremendous success pressures.
Favor Hamilton was a 43-year-old mother when she became a prostitute in Las Vegas.
The couple had no financial problems, but was fascinated by the idea of getting money from having sex with strangers.
She also promised her husband to accept her actions.
Favor Hamilton’s tax was 450 euros per hour.
He said he spent his money on luxury.
One of Favor Hamilton’s explanations for becoming a prostitute was that he wanted the same adrenaline he had received when competing in sports.
Later, Favor Hamilton discovered that he had bipolar disorder.
The double life of the former star runner was revealed in late 2012 when the Smoking Gun magazine published an article about him.
Favor-Hamilton participated in the Olympic Games of Barcelona, Atlanta and Sydney.
In 2000, he was the world recorded top at 1500 meters at 3.57.40, but was last in the Sydney Olympics final.
The world champion rejoiced when the federation disciplined the Norwegian skiing squad: "Straight"
Norwegian skiing king Petter Northug has crossed the boundaries of suitability, according to at least one of his colleagues.
Northug and the Norwegian skiing federation have twisted over the entire summer and autumn, like last year, on a sports contract.
Although the federation has offered Northug a better contract than other athletes, it has not been enough for the multi-time world champion and Olympic winner.
As a result of the contract dispute, the Norwegian ski federation decided to exclude Northug from the upcoming season's World Cup.
The award was awarded to double world champion Astrid Jacobsen.
He said he was delighted that the union put the skyscraper on track.
“Thank you for pointing the backbone,” Jacobsen wrote on his Facebook profile.
"We cannot allow one active athlete to avoid working for the federation's sponsor," he continued.
The dispute between the Norwegian Ski Federation and Northug is about money.
Northug would obviously like to be part of the season's national team so he could advertise his own sponsorship.
Jacobsen said he was delighted to represent a federation that also cares about future generations and does not give one athlete solo.
At the same time, he recalled that the alliance has given Northug both financial and other privileges for several years.
I know it because I’ve been part of the system.
Jacobseb does not accept that one athlete has completely different rules than just because he is the best.
Northug announced on Tuesday that he would like to play in Norway’s colours next season at the World Cup as well as at the World Cup and Olympics.
Astrid Jacobsen has won six World Cup medals, two of them gold.
He was a member of the team that won the Message Gold last winter in Falun.
Translators’ Day will also be celebrated in the North
On the day of the competition, on September 25th, we will organize trips in various restaurants and shops, which have been awarded the Shield of the Bake Translators.
The aim of the day is to highlight Finland’s high level of food industry expertise and lower the threshold for entering a restaurant, as well as raise awareness of the importance of the shield as part of high quality.
At the same time, we would like to remind you that not all high-quality restaurants have concentrated in the capital region, but top-quality restaurants inspected and rated by an impartial operator can be found all over Finland.
The international attention received by the event is a demonstration of the significance of the event as part of increasing the awareness of racing restaurants and the organization.
In the northern part of the country, the day will be held in Vaasa restaurant in Fondis and Kantarelli.
The old town restaurant participates in the race.
The event has also received considerable attention internationally.
The event was decided to become one of the organization’s most important international events, which will be held in different parts of the world during the same day.
Finland remains the host country.
Kauhajoki-magazine: A case for the establishment of a terrible reception center for the Chancellor of Justice
The Migration Agency and the Finnish Red Cross (SPR) are working together to establish a refugee reception centre in the premises of the Kauhava ex-garde force currently owned by LSK Business Park Oy.
According to the complaint, critical infrastructure of the crisis period is still permanently located in the area, which is in the use of the Defence Forces and its partner, Finland Erillisverkot Oy.
According to the private person, the placement of the reception centre in the same building would constitute a significant security risk, which has not been taken into account in the preparation of the case.
According to the complainant, the defence forces may have interests in the area and airport of the former Flight Military School, the impact of which has also not been investigated during the preparation of the reception center, the newspaper writes.
In the case, it is stated that for the Kauhawa airport, negotiations have been held over the past two years on the organization of flight training and the arrival of a potential foreign operator at the airport.
The matter has been discussed with, among other things, Minister of Defense Jussi Niinistön (PS) and the Chancellor-in-Chief of the Ministry of Defense Arto Rädy.
A private person declares to the Chancellor of Justice that the complaint is not a matter of principled opposition to the reception center, but that the planned location in the former reserve area is wrong.
The city council dealt with the case on the reception center last Monday.
The situation in Syria is reflected in Ukraine and the Baltic region
Management means that the immigrants and those here have the necessary conditions, Niinistö commented to journalists in the evening after meeting with the presidents of all parliamentary parties in his office residence in Mäntyniemi.
According to the president, concerns about the management of the refugee situation united all participants.
He believes it is worthwhile that the government and opposition parties in Finland are able to discuss fundamental issues in a confidential manner.
Especially in these times when we are facing great challenges.
The situation in Syria, as well as the actions of Russia and the United States in the region, could also have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and, consequently, in the Baltic Sea region.
This is an opportunity for the development of dialogue.
If the situation develops in a positive direction, i.e. the United States and Russia can, it will have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and further tensions on the situation in the Baltic Sea.
The NATO issue was also discussed.
The government did not take a stand on the labour market.

From the direction of Mannerheimintie, cars are not allowed in the direction of the Railway Station.
From Union Street in the direction of Hakaniemi, traffic is directed to Union Street in the circle of Kaisaniemi.
The closing time depends on the number of people participating in the demonstration.
Only emergency vehicles are allowed into the area.
Metro and railway protest on Friday
Metro and tram drivers will participate in Friday’s demonstration from the start of morning traffic to the end of night traffic.
The railway and subway staff association told STT this evening.
The majority of openings will be closed for two hours, including posts closed.
Friday’s protests also disrupted the post office.
Significant delays are expected, among other things, in the distribution of daily mail.
Most post offices are closed.
The Finnish Red Cross blood transfers will be handled despite the strike.

Helsinki kindergartens will not be fully operational on Friday, the Helsinki Early Childhood Education Agency reports.
Due to the demonstration of trade associations, daycare may be concentrated in certain kindergartens, and club activities in kindergartens and play parks will not be organized.
Day-to-day kindergartens and groups of children with developmental disabilities and multi-disabilities remain open.
In addition, afternoon activities for developmental disabilities and autistic schoolchildren are organized normally.
The Ministry of Education promises to announce further changes tomorrow.
Media analysts take a big risk
According to Sipilė, a variety of channels are needed for communication, and the Prime Minister’s television and radio speeches are one channel among others.
This channel will also be needed in the future.
This will not be the last time, Sipilä told reporters in parliament.
Sipilä did not yet want to assess how often the prime minister’s television and radio speeches are repeated.
In the future, speeches will not necessarily always be broadcast on YLE channels.
If there are other channels, we will see.
I’m going to use this channel tonight, he said.
According to Sipilä, the state of the Finnish economy is so serious that it requires television and radio to speak to the citizens.
This set of facts, which we are talking about now, is quite complicated and requires a longer reasoning.
That’s why we ended up on this channel, Sipilä explained.
The speech will be broadcast from 21.05 to 21.20 on TV1 and Radio Finland.
You can also see it in the arena.
The dog takes a big risk.
The media researcher hopes that Sipilä’s television speech does not speak of a more general turn of the government inside.
Is it an attempt to take the right to define the public debate more strictly into their own hands and refuse to ask questions about the public debate? thinks Anu Koivunen, a professor at the University of Stockholm.
It comes to mind the recent comment of Foreign Minister (Timo) Soini that he does not follow the media agenda and does not allow it to define himself.
In the name of democratic debate and publicity, I hope these things are not related.
Koivunen understands that the commercial media is angry at Sipilän’s announcement.
It would be strange if the media didn’t react.
The communication styles of political decision-makers are not announcements in a democracy.
It is the responsibility of the media representatives to strive to ensure that politicians’ agendas are not taken as given.
I think television is a big risk.
The speaker should bring something new and special to the table in his speech, so that the exceptionally high expectations set on the speech can be met.
Is there anything more available today that we have already heard?
Or can he speak in a different tone, in a different way, or in different words, or say something new?
Koivunen says that if there is only more of the same old in the license, one must wonder why such a great gesture was made and Yle gave it an exceptional time.
In general, take this risk in the sense that it is not a particular situation, but a routine speech among others.
There is a danger that Yle will be labeled as a message for politicians or the parliament and the government, which is not in accordance with YLE’s interests or the general line.
A wise veto
In Sipilö’s upcoming speech, what the prime minister will not say is also important, the media researcher emphasizes.
In the evening, we have to look closely at what is missing and what is not, says Heikki Kuutti, research coordinator at Jyväskylä University.
According to Kuti, the TV speech is a clever appeal from Sipil, because in this way he can express his own views without a whisper.
This gives the message a broad audience without a journalistic filter, unlike in a press conference where journalists can ask critical questions.
He passes the media and speaks directly to the public.
However, there is a risk that the media will misinterpret the speech because it is not possible to ask specific questions.
According to Kutik, it is very important how Sipilä appears on TV - swelling sweat, shaking hands.
He compares the Sipil to the father figure, who now tells the people what to do.
If you know how to perform well, it can work.
The situation is different than if the government informed about something, because it is as if a person is speaking directly to another person.
This is what President Barack Obama and his colleagues regularly do.
Really exceptional
Political researcher Erkka Railo considers the Prime Minister’s speech to the public to be truly exceptional.
It hasn’t happened in decades that the Prime Minister has spoken directly to the people.
Exceptional times require exceptional means, says Railo.
The researcher thinks the prime minister thus wants to get the Finns to sympathize with the extortion ahead.
On Friday, workers organized a strike against the government’s actions.
Leftist chairman Paavo Arhinmäki says on Twitter that Sipilä could hold his speech on the state of the nation in parliament as an announcement by the prime minister, in which case the speech would also be discussed.
SDP Chairman Antti Rinne (SD) once again announces that he is challenging Sipilä’s dialogue.
No time for monologues.
Half a year from the election.
You can’t hide it indefinitely, Rinne wrote on Twitter.
9-Year-Old Boy Found Escaped in Tokyo
The boy was well at the time of his arrival.
The boy’s father has updated his Facebook page.
The Inner Finland Police Department is also confirming the matter to Iltalehd.
The boy went out to play at four in the afternoon.
Later that night, he was no longer contacted.
I would like to thank all the people who helped in the search.
Thank you for the contacts and observations during these hours.
The update was shared close to 15,000 times which is an incredible balance in such a short time
Finnish UFC star disappointed by youth's violent deception: You'll generate hatred
Kurdish-based freelance player Makwan Amirkhani posted a video on Facebook in which he appealed especially to young people of immigrant background.
Makwan Amirkhani made a heavy speech against the street struggles of young people.
Born in Iran and arrived in Finland with his family at the age of five, Amirkhani has so far won both of his professional matches in the most prestigious UFC series.
Amirkhani said she received a message asking her to look at an Instagram account.
There are videos that show young people struggling with extreme violence.
Amirkhani says he is disappointed with the youth’s wildness.
The 26-year-old Amirkhan has more than 62,000 followers on Facebook.
The boys kick the people on the ground, sit on the other side and strike without thinking about the consequences of what happens when you make such videos, Amirkhani updates.
Difficult to defend
Some of the young people on the video are immigrants.
According to Helsinki Police Commissioner Jarmo Heinosen, video of the fighting has been uploaded to social media by both immigrants and young people from Finland.
In other words, you are fighting on the street.
You are making the lives of so many other immigrants more difficult here in Finland, Turkish Amirkhani reminds.
Amirkhani reminds that there are websites in Finland that search for crimes committed by immigrants.
These individual cases have become very severe.
A little difficult, guys, no longer to defend you.
You should remember that you are still in a foreign country and you will be a long time here.
That’s a different way to thank you for being here, Amirkhani says.
Amirkhani urges young people to remember their relatives.
If they ever face someone’s racism, you can blame yourself.
Think a few times before you get involved.
Amirkhani says that violent activity contributes to racism.
You’re causing a kind of hatred that I don’t like.
You have things pretty badly and you will not improve them at all, Amirkhani decides.
FAK puts its stance on savings package - Lyly: decisions on Monday
Lauri Lyly, Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, tweeted on Monday that the wage-taker organization will consider its position on the alternative savings plan proposed by STTK.
Lauri Lyly commented on STTK’s proposal on Twitter.
Earlier on Wednesday, STTK said it would present its own proposal to the government to the 5 percent productivity reduction demanded by Prime Minister Juha Sipilän.
Akava Chairman Sture Fjäder believes that the government will approve the proposal if the FAK, STTK and Akava are all behind the proposal.
However, it would require the largest wage-taker organization FAK to soften its previous position.
Chairman Lauri Lyly commented on the matter on Twitter.
Lyly writes that the FF Working Committee will discuss the matter on Monday.
According to Lilly, the FAK is looking for solutions to "open the labour market" and that instead of compulsory laws, agreements between active parties are needed.
Lyly reminds that the proposal of the government of Prime Minister Sipilä for a social agreement did not favor the FAK.
Sipilä previously interrupted negotiations on a social agreement after the FCA refused to commit to the target of a 5% productivity loss.
Comments: The protest threatens to run out - "It feels a bit weird to throw a thumb"
It feels a little strange to have a tree fist if you already have a reconciliation paper in your pocket, writes Pekka Tiinanen.
The atmospheres vary widely in the salary camp.
Should the government be dismissed or agree with it?
On Monday, the federal leaders sparked holy hatred against the Republican government.
The whole country was threatened.
It also spread to the Aquarius.
The teachers’ trade union OAJ threatened to close schools and kindergartens.
On Tuesday, the OAJ cancelled: no school or kindergarten will be completely closed.
On Wednesday, the Chairman of the staff center organization STTK Antti Palola (sd) made a conciliatory appearance.
He said he was in contact with the government and prepared an alternative proposal requested by Prime Minister Juha Sipilän (central) as a 5% productivity loss.
Akava Chairman Sture Fjäder (kok) promptly announced that his agreement paper was already ready.
In the beginning there was no office.
President Lauri Lylyn (SD) has had difficulty agreeing when federal leaders just ordered the country to stand up on Friday.
Finally, however, Lyly announced that the FIS Working Committee will meet next Monday to address the situation and that the FIS will look for solutions to “open the labour market.”
In order for a joint proposal of the wage-earners to arise, the FIS should be inclined to accept a productivity reduction of 5 percent as its goal.
It’s no wonder that the Palolan STTK has a good relationship with the Sipilä government.
Palola’s right hand, Jukka Ihanus, the director responsible for STTK’s social impact, has previously served as a special assistant to Central Prime Ministers Matti Vanhasen and Mari Kiviniemi.
Mr. Palola also characterizes the fact that the government’s AI expertise has been constantly improving.
Coincidentally or not, but Palola’s departure took a bit of a blow away from the Finnish standers, whose front figure is AKT’s Marko Piirainen (SD).
It feels a bit strange to have a fist if you already have a reconciliation paper in your pocket.
Modified at 18:00: Added information about Lilly's comments.
Russia blames Finland as bad host: ‘This must not be repeated’
Russian Duma Chairman Sergei Naryshkin has criticized the OSCE meeting in Helsinki.
Russian Duma Chairman Sergei Naryshkin said that Mongolia is a better host of the OSCE than Finland.
In the Mongolian capital, Ulan Bator, the autumn session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly began, where Naryshkin made extensive comments on the July solemn meeting in Helsinki.
At that time, Finland did not allow Russian politicians on the European Union’s sanctions list, such as Naryshkin, to attend the meeting – a matter that the President had the time to remind reporters.
In our opinion, this was contrary to the values of parliamentary democracy and the principles of open dialogue.
This should not be repeated, Naryshkin stressed, according to the news agency Interfax.
Naryshkin’s criticism was not only directed at Finland and the EU, but also at the United States, where his entry was also blocked.
The sanctions are a political suicide for the EU, Naryshkin said.
In Mongolia, the Russian delegation got into trouble, so Naryshkin continued to flatter Finland by praising and praising Mongolia for its "excellent organization".
I am confident that the Parliamentary General Assembly will proceed constructively and with positive results – unlike the meeting held in Helsinki in July.
The Mongolian leadership understands that there should be no obstacles to parliamentary dialogue.
Naryshkin has met with Ilkka Kanerva, the chairman of the meeting in Ulan Bator, who, according to Russian media, has already talked with the Russian delegation.
The lock faces the real playoff hole: "Goals in tight"
Kappara and Lukko continue today in the Hakam Forest on the bull days, when both are on fire for the second day in a row.
Janne Lahti predicted that there will be no real paint festivals in the Hakam Forest today.
Yesterday, he went on to win a 3-2.
The rise was masculine, as the silver group last season was at its worst out of two goals losing.
Tuesday was more winning.
Blues, who started the catch with the space, had rounded zero points, and the losses also counted 2-3.
A tough game, goals tight, if any play a similar game as last year, Lukko attacker Janne Lahti predicts settings on the club’s pages.
It has become a playoff nightmare.
In the last two seasons, Kappara has just knocked out the final in the semi-finals.
In both matches, a decisive seventh match was required.
Last season, Lukko drove the series in the fourth game, but Kappara rose alongside and past in the next three.
There are no major changes in the composition of the groups except for the goalkeepers.
Both of the boys who were arrested yesterday will be arrested today.
Mika Noronen makes room for Tomi Karhus, while Rasmus Rinne replaces Ryan Zapolski.
Title: A Bad Show in Action
Sporting director Toivola wrote an inappropriate sequel for the head coach Rautakallio, writes Santtu Silvennoinen from Tampere.
It is classic.
In 1976, Sylvester Stallone wrote a screenplay for the film Rocky, in which he himself played the lead role.
He was a heavyweight champion of the world, Apollo Creed.
Rocky received great sympathy, even though he eventually lost the title match.
Thirty years after the premiere of Rocky, Mika Toivola wrote a troubled ashes story for Pori.
An unnamed and knife-haired batch advanced to the surprise of all to the SM-finals in 2006.
The team was filled with anonymous but stubborn underdogs like Rocky.
There was the White Indian, Porin Mattia and Pele Peltosta.
In the fall games, the players painted their heads red and cut off the Iroquois.
She became a blonde.
A good TV reporter, JP Jalo, called the coach Neumann.
They won the silver.
Toivola was one of the heroes.
Screenwriter Toivola believes that this season’s novel works in the same way as ten years ago.
The man who works as the sporting executive of the Ace has built a patchwork on the bad boys.
Semir Ben-Amor and Josh Gratton have mocked the pigs in the distance like Rocky pigs in the slaughterhouse.
The merits of Masi Marjamäen, Mikko Viitasen, Juha Kiilholman and Matti Kuparinen are somewhere other than circular play.
Toivola has forgotten that in Rocky VI the main role is played by Pekka Rautakallio.
Karri Kivi has crossed the Iron Horse into Sean Connery.
Iron Rock is just as dumb as Connery would have been in the 1976 original.
There is no other Rocky in Iron Rock than a nickname.
The game philosophy of the Iron Shark does not include rushing and small skating.
He appreciates a tough game, but it’s a different thing to play hard than a pig.
Last season, Garret Stafford hit Kill Jere in the head.
He was given 2+10 minutes by the judges, but the man was put in the shower by Rautakallio.
He did not deserve a minute.
We only play those who deserve it.
I do not accept such a game and it does not belong to hockey assault, the fiery Iron Rock rushed to the people after the game.
This season’s team is strangely built.
There are trains, veterans, policemen and scouts.
There are practically no best players in the game.
No wonder the head coach has complained about a lack of skills.
How much have you been able to influence the purchases of players, Pekka Rautakallio?
The events of last season affect the procurement and unfortunately the situation in the market was rather narrow, Rautakallio responded diplomatically.
under the surface.
The 1953 model Rautakallio is known to be interested in moving to Toivola as a sports bomber.
Men’s contracts end in the spring.
The balance of the Ace in the three league games of the season is equal to the number of losses with a goal difference from 1 to 6.
It’t have been worthwhile for Hope to write a follow-up.
Olga Temonen plays the mother of Sipe Santapuk
Olga Temonen reveals that if she had met her husband Tuuka as a teenager, they would have had nothing in common.
Olga Temonen will play for the first time under her husband.
Yes, in the movie I represent the mother of my husband’s friend.
Somehow it feels crazy, actress and producer Olga Temonen laughs.
She has been married to Apulanna's former bassist and director Tuukka Temosen since 2008.
The couple have done a lot of work together before, but now Olga plays for the first time under the direction of Tuuka.
Olga's role in the movie You Made Us Beautiful, which tells about the early years of Apulanna, is played by drummer Sipe Santapuki's mother Sirkka.
Sirkka tries and supports his son, even though his father Risto (played by Lorenz Backmann) tries to be the voice of reason.
The more I get acquainted with my true example Cirka, the easier it feels to play the role.
He’s a great guy and I’m grateful to Tuuka for trusting me in the role.
Olga had met Sirka before the film project, but since then the two have come closer together.
They met, spoke on the phone and communicated.
The circle helped a lot.
We have been through many different corners of their history.
Sirkka is also fortunate to understand that drama is drama and the truth may have to be painted a little.
Olga emphasizes that Sirkka was almost the only one in Heinola who blindly believed that Apulanna would become the largest band in Finland.
In the 1990s, it was very bad and very bad.
There was little chance that someone would really succeed, but Circus had some intuition, and he was right.
Olga says she had heard a lot about Tuuka’s youth before she started filming.
Parents’ stories are sometimes different.
So, if you’re a 15-year-old teenager, then how much your parents really know what you’re doing.
Olga reveals that her own youth was completely different from that of Tuukan, who was known as Heinola’s infamous skater.
Olga was a day-to-day and kind girl who had nothing to do with the movie Tuuka.
He could have secretly admired it.
Olga says she has worked so much with Tuuka over the past 10 years that a large joint project is not scary.
Everything has always gone super well.
The entire production team will now go to Heinola for a month.
However, the couple who live in Iit will often drive home at night because of their young children, because the distance is not too long.
We will spend a month in Hainan.
They have received us very warmly, only asking which streets and when to empty.
Iron Sky 2 became the most expensive film in Finland
Iron Sky: The Coming Race, directed by Timo Vuorensola, has a budget of 17 million euros.
Filming begins in Belgium in October.
Director Timo Vuorensola will start filming Iron Sky 2 in Belgium in October.
Iron Sky’s sequel, Iron Sky: The Coming Race, will become Finland’s most expensive drama film of all time with a budget of €17 million.
The title of the most expensive film in Finland has previously been given to Jalmari Helander’s Big Game.
The animated Angry Birds movie will be out of the Iron Sky 2, with a budget of more than 100 million euros.
The filming of the film, directed by Timo Vuorensola and produced by Tero Kaukomaan, will begin in October at AED Studios near Antwerp and will last for eight weeks.
Director Timo Vuorensola is scheduled to travel to Belgium next week.
The budget is not scary.
I have been very sick!
I’m so casual about the script because I know exactly what kind of film should come out of.
Everyone in the group seems to realize that something unprecedented is being done.
It’s great to go to Belgium.
Although time is tight, there is no fear in the ass.
I’m more excited and can’t wait to show this movie to the audience, he tells Iltalehd.
The film was originally planned for a budget of 8-10 million, but as the script developed, the budget also increased.
It’s a big budget, but it’s a big stock.
However, the film should cost $100 million, because every angle and every effect is so expensive.
Now everything is turned so tight that nothing is loose.
Iron Sky Universe has launched a crowdfunding campaign and a bond that will be paid at an annual interest rate of 4-8 percent.
The final rate is determined by supply and demand during the campaign.
Within two years, the company will repay the loan.
The film stars Udo Kier, Tom Green and Vladimir Burlakov.
Junt or Cool?
T-shirts are back in the shirt
The fronts of the trendsetters have recently been decorated with large logos.
Until some time ago, fashion-conscious dressers avoided clear and large logos like Crocce.
Advertising for the Huppar or T-shirt brand was seen as a bit of a junkie.
But the times change.
Sport has become a true megatrend in fashion, and so have old, well-known sportswear brands such as Adidas and Nike risen to the wave of coolness.
And as so often before, the boundary between funny and trendy is blurred: if something is already right junta, it starts to become ironic and cool.
First came the norm core trend, i.e. the fashion style, where trendsetter surprises by favouring the most boring basic clothes as possible as a way to stand out from the mass.
Now, instead of the gray basic college, we put on the web shirt already buried at the bottom of the closet, in front of which the manufacturer’s logo stands.
The larger and more traditional, the better.
In addition to the logos, adidas’s recognizable tracks, favorite team t-shirts and the New York Yankees lipstick have also returned to street fashion.
The Calvin Klein logo is now a cool detail.
The trend seems to be moving from sports brands to luxury brands as well.
For example, the front of Versace’s autumn bracelets makes it clear which brand clothes are in question.
Would you like to introduce your logo in your dress?
Russian politician reveals evidence: I wasn’t stuck in a tank lock for hours
The incident is believed to have occurred in Nizhni Tagil, where Russia Arms Expo 2015 was held.
In recent days, Russian media have circulated colourful allegations that the Russian Ministry of Emergencies had to remove a large Zotov from the tank cage for five hours.
Zotov has since made every effort to deny the information.
He even posted on his own public Facebook page a picture in which he appears to be staring out of the lock of a tank vehicle in a pretty good mood and at least according to those pictures it is not about getting stuck or angry at all.
Full of nonsense.
Let’s start with the fact that I didn’t go into a combat tank, it was an assault tank BMP-3.
I myself am a former soldier, Lieutenant Colonel, I have served in the Urals.
I went in, looked around and came out peacefully, Zotov told Komosomolskaja Pravda.
“I didn’t get stuck and I didn’t really spend five hours in that position,” he said.
In an interview with the Russian Army television channel, Zotov explained that he admired the new technology of Russia because he himself is a former professional soldier.
So I was interested in what was inside the cars, I admired our technology.
And I came out through the backdoors, he said.
I went to all tanks.
And in the next show, I will definitely visit all tanks and all strike tanks, Zotov promised.
Zotov also whispered the journalist who wrote about it as a fool.
One fool wrote and all the others repeated.
There was nothing like that.
I went in and I went out.
I am tall and rough, but nothing like I was stuck somewhere in a tank did not happen, he told the Russian radio.
Zotov’s words are supported by the fact that no photographs of the alleged trapped have been published, despite a total of 50,000 people attending the weapons exhibition in a few days.
The allegation that Zotov was trapped originated from a case on Bloknot.ru, where Zotov was told that he ran out of the tank cage while trying to get out and eventually threatened to shoot everyone around him if he didn’t get out of his surface.
Later on, the Bloknot website published a sequel, in which the organizers of the exhibition shared their views on what happened.
Everyone is just used to the fact that soldiers quickly jump out of armored vehicles.
But MP Zotov, due to his large size, was simply delayed when he came out.
But in any case he did not sit there for five hours, the exhibition coordinator Aleksandr Pisarevski told Bloknot.
This is my favorite blog post.
The Lassen candlestick of the architects brothers Mogens (1901-87) and Flemming (1902-84) from 1962 looks like it was designed today.
The cube-like steel frame is like a work of art, and that was what it originally was.
The architects are known to melt the shape of the candle for a long time and mathematically accurately.
It was initially presented only to gentlemen's prestigious dinner guests.
Kubus candlesticks are manufactured by the family company By Lassen, whichins the design heritage of the renowned brothers.

The Kittilän mine at Agnico Eagle Finland, a Canadian mining company, has been leaked.
The process water purified by the gold mine has leaked into the so-called enrichment sand pool.
According to the company, measures have been taken to repair the leak.
The pool contains neutralized enrichment sand and purified process water.
Generally, water is either pumped for reuse as process water or, as permitted, drawn into the environment through the surface drainage field.
The leak was estimated to be about 300 cubic meters per hour when it was detected.
According to the company, the quality of the leaked water meets the current authorisation conditions.
No other material is discharged into the environment.
The leak was detected on Monday morning during an inspection.
The leak has not been found to have caused structural damage to the pool's patio structures.
The company says it will work closely with the authorities to monitor and correct the situation.
The mining company employs about 600 permanent workers.
IMF warns against excessive cuts
The report released today by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) largely follows the views of the government and the Ministry of Finance.
The organization urged Finland to undertake comprehensive structural reforms to overcome economic problems.
According to the IMF, reducing overtime compensation and paid holidays would support Finland’s competitiveness.
Reforms would be needed for the entire contract system and for unemployment protection.
Pasi Kuoppamäki, chief economist at Danske Bank, said that we agree on structural reforms, but there are small differences.
The IMF’s assessment contains a lot of messages in favour of the government’s actions, but on the other hand there are words of warning about what should not be cut too much.
Such are infrastructure investments, Kuoppamäki says to Taloussanom.
The IMF believes that growth projects should be implemented as soon as possible in order to support weak economic growth.
The IMF forecasts for Finland a 0.4% economic growth this year, which will accelerate to 0.9% next year.
In its new economic forecast, Danske forecasts that growth will remain at zero this year.
The IMF is a little more optimistic about this year.
They may have been based on the latest findings.
This morning, the Statistics Centre that total output had increased slightly in the summer, Kuoppamäki notes.
The weakened confidence in the industry or other so-called softer metrics may have been paid less attention.
However, the difference is only a few percentages.
Nintendo has appointed a new leader.
Tatsumi Kimishima, who worked under Satoru Iva, who died of cancer in July, will begin work on Wednesday, Nintendo said on Monday.
Iwata led Nintendo since 2002 and he was a popular and charismatic face in the gaming industry.
Iwata, for example, was responsible for the launch of a successful Wii console.
The choice of the 65-year-old Kimishima is not a big surprise.
He was one of those names that were raised as a possible successor to Iva.
Kimishima is a safe choice to follow Iwa’s footprints, Ace Research analyst Hideki Yasuda said.
Kimishima’s mission is to bring Nintendo strongly into mobile games, but not to eat the company’s bread on the side of traditional gaming consoles.
Increasing number of asylum seekers arriving in Finland
In February 2015, the Swedish Immigration Authority admitted that hundreds of children who have entered the country disappear every year.
According to SVT.se and Dagens Nyheter, hundreds of minors are missing every year.
Juha Kannelmaa, chief inspector of the Immigration Agency, explains what the situation in Finland is and how it has changed.
Is the same situation in Finland?
How many asylum seekers disappear under the land per year? – In Finland, in 2013 a total of 156 asylum applications were filed by minors who came alone.
9 of them disappeared.
In 2014, 196 similar applications were filed and 11 of them disappeared, Kannelmaa says.
The disappearance may be based on the fact that the applicant is already registered in another country that applies the Dublin Regulation and may have been declared to be of majority there.
In this case, it may be more attractive for the applicant to disappear than to continue the proceedings in Finland and be returned to the country responsible for the processing of the application.
Similarly, some of the missing persons are also found later when they seek asylum in another Member State.
In 2014, there were a total of 3651 asylum-seekers in Finland, of whom 134 were deferred because the applicant was likely to have moved out of Finland, so 123 adult asylum-seekers disappeared over the past year, he says.
Is the number growing?
As of September 6, this year, we have received a total of 586 asylum applications from single minors.
There is no total statistics on missing minors asylum-seekers this year, but the number of minors asylum-seekers is therefore known and has increased significantly, which is likely to affect the number of missing, he emphasizes.
What about those who have received the decision?
Are they going to disappear in the ‘dark market’?
This is difficult to assess from the Migration Agency, as the police are responsible for the enforcement of the decision on conversion, Kannelmaa stresses.
Interior Minister Petteri Orpo has expressed concern over the growing number of unregistered prospects.
He has taken action on this.
Orpo, who discussed refugee issues at the EU interior ministerial meeting, said on Monday about practical measures to control the flow of asylum seekers through Sweden to northern Finland.
Nina Mikkonen sells Timo T.A’s studio online - see photos of devices
The equipment used by Timo T.A. Mikkosen, a pioneer in the media industry who lost his workability due to illnesses, is now on sale.
Mikkonen’s wife Nina Mikkonen sells on Huuto.net devices that were once the most advanced tools for professionals in their field.
This was the first announcement by the online newspaper Iltamakasinini.
Today, a large part of the equipment has been left to the feet of technological development.
In the digital media world, TV shows are no longer filmed on Betacam tape.
Nina Mikkonen is confident that interested people will be found.
Of course, the hardware is no longer up-to-date in this way, but these are also needed as long as there is such an old generation of material that needs to be digitized.
On the other hand, there are also many enthusiasts – collectors and builders of their own studio, Nina Mikkonen thinks to IS.
The reason for the sale is that Mikkoset are trying to move away from their current Myrskylän home.
We cannot carry all the goods with us.
I slowly began to invent and see what things to give up.
This is where I started, says Nina Mikkonen.
Television and radio equipment are no longer available.
After a recent stroke, it is clear that a man who has had a long career will no longer return to work.
Nina Mikkonen points out that now only goods and equipment are sold.
Timo T.A. Mikkosen’s actual life work was filed in the summer at the National Audiovisual Institute, whose representatives went to pick up films and other material from the stormy store.
Traffic threatens to crash worse than thought: Metro and trams may stop all Friday
Metro and tram drivers will decide today whether to extend force action in connection with Friday’s demonstration.
The original plan was to stop metro and tram traffic only for the time of the demonstration on Friday.
In the afternoon, the traffic will stop for the whole day.
Chief confidant Pekka Hirvonen says that the oak is big on the field.
Night and tide cuts are harming drivers, so the government’s plans for cutting the tolls are provoking resistance.
Hirvonen thinks that stopping the traffic all day is a sort of dilemma.
If the metro and tram stops on Friday, public transportation in the capital region will be almost entirely stopped.
According to data from VR, trains do not run between six in the morning and six in the evening on Friday.
There is no long-distance or short-distance traffic on Friday.
The trains departing in the morning will be sent to the station.
According to HSL data, most of the buses will be left in shutdown.
ACT members are out of work on Friday from three in the morning to three in the morning on Saturday.
Probably a small number of buses can be driven, they will be driven with the lead force, HSL spokesman Pirkko Repo thinks.
Repo says the HSL cannot say exactly which buses will run on Friday.
The workers’ organizations will organize a large demonstration at the Helsinki Railway on Friday from 11 to 13 p.m.
Aftonbladet: Hungarian police used tear gas against refugees
Hungarian police attacked hundreds of refugees with tear gas.
The incident took place on the border between Hungary and Serbia, where many refugees are trying to get to Europe, according to the AP news agency.
According to Sky News, refugees attempted to break through the border fence.
The refugees, many of whom were women and children, fled in panic.
According to local media reports, the Hungarian police also used water bombs against people.
Muslim boy arrested at school in Texas: teacher thinks clock was a bomb
In Texas, the 14-year-old Ahmed Mohamed has been arrested after a teacher held a self-made clock he brought to school as a bomb.
Mohamed told Dallas Morning News he just wanted to showcase the outcome of his electronics hobby.
However, one of the teachers held the clock just like a bomb.
Police were called to the scene, and the situation eventually ended in the fact that the boy was taken to the youth's detention cell in handrails.
Muhammad has never claimed anything but that he had made the clock.
However, it is still possible that the boy will be accused of making a false bomb.
The police said the clock looked like a “film bomb.”
The clock is in police custody, but it was known to consist of a circuit plate and a digital display with wires between them.
The incident occurred last Monday and Muhammad was sentenced to three days of forced absence from school.
His father is angry at the incident and the country’s American-Islamic Council is wondering if the incident is another sign of Islamophobia in the United States.
UK Labour leader refuses to sing national anthem
The song asks God to protect the queen, but Corbyn is an opponent of the monarchy.
Corbyn’s own Labour Party members have also joined the criticism.
This has offended the people, Labour MP Kate Green said in a BBC radio interview.
Green thought Corbyn should have joined the song.
In 1940, British Air Force pilots fought the German Luftwaffe.
In its official statement, the Labour Party defends Corbyn and stresses that he showed respect for the pilots by attending the event.
We are all in an enormous debt of gratitude to the heroism of the Royal Air Force pilots.
He (Corbyn) stood respectfully silent during the national anthem, the statement emphasized.
Corbyn’s election as leader has divided Labour.
Especially among parliamentarians there are those who fear that he will expel moderate voters with his radical views.
Corbyn is in favor of unilateral disarmament, an end to austerity measures and increased public spending.
Corbyn is scheduled to appear today for the first time as leader of the party in parliament at the Prime Minister’s questioning hour.
Corbyn has asked the public for suggestions about what Prime Minister David Cameron should ask.
Earlier this week, Cameron tweeted about Corbyn’s election as party leader.
The Labour Party is a threat to our national security, our economic security and the security of our families.
The cause of Minnesota family death remains unclear - the father of the family awaited trial
Police in South Lake Minnetonka have investigated a family murder in Greenwood, Minnesota.
A family of five were found dead in their home on September 10 and a few days later police confirmed that the shooter was the family's father, Brian Scott Short, 45.
After shooting his wife and three children, Brian Short committed suicide in his garage.
Dead for days
The family was found after the school was concerned about the absence of the children.
Based on this announcement, police went into the house for an inspection visit and found the short family dead across a huge house.
According to StarTribune, it is possible that the victims had been dead for days.
Millions and a successful business
The investigation into the case of South Lake Minnetonka police chief Michael Siitar is still ongoing.
The motives for the bloodshed are still unclear.
Shooter Brian Short was a successful entrepreneur and he had created his fortune on the nurse-focused social media site AllNurses.com.
In a 2014 StarTribune interview, Short said the site had four million different visitors each week.
I have received 50 purchase offers for the company over the past ten years.
I have abandoned them all.
I still have a lot of ideas that I want to implement.
Per at some point I will sell the company, but not yet.
Short’s family bought a house in Greenwood in 2011 for $2 million.
The house is advertised on the real estate site in Zillow as the dream of a car collector: the house has not only 12 rooms, but also a garage sufficient for eight cars.
Trial ongoing
According to StarTribune, however, the family’s father was awaiting a trial.
Achieve Test Prep, which offered various preparation courses, sued him for comments on AllNurses.com.
According to Achieve Test Prep, no comments defamatory to prep courses had been removed from Short’s website, and as a result they had lost customers to their competitors.
However, according to StarTribune, it is very unclear whether the trial would have had a significant impact on Short’s transactions.
The Loire Coffee Coffee
In addition, the owner trio was awarded the Finnish Hippo's Horse Owner of the Month Award at the feeding event.
This is great, Loiri commented with a kindness of honour.
The celebrated Fabrice Duo won the Derby on the first Saturday of September and earned a win of €100,000.
Artist legend Loiri was still confused by the success of the Fabrice Duo in the grand competition.
I still don’t believe it has happened.
With Loir, the successful horse coach Korpi gets full working peace when working with the horse.
Pepe decides where the horse will be taken to compete.
And I hold my shame, Loiri cried.
A stunning gesture from the NHL star - "The biggest donation made by an athlete of all time"
Montreal Canadiens superstar P. K. Subban has donated ten million dollars (about 6.7 million euros) to the Montreal Children’s Hospital.
The hospital said it was the largest single donation ever made by an athlete to charity in Canada.
In addition, 26-year-old Subban has committed to helping the hospital with other funding for the next seven years.
Subban signed an eight-year, $72 million deal with the Canadiens a year ago.
Subban’s donation is therefore significantly greater than his annual income of $9 million.
As a reward for his donation, Subban receives a hall space bearing his name from the hospital.
Canadiens players have previously helped significantly local hospitals.
The longtime captain Jean Beliveau, who died a year ago, raised millions of dollars for the same children’s hospital, among others, and Saku Koivu raised a giant sum of money for another major hospital in the city, which provided the hospital with the PET scanner needed for cancer studies.
In a Japanese cafe, you can order your wife for the evening - serving food only in a bikini and an essay.
Coffee is a tough thing in Japan.
There is already a goat cafe, a rabbit cafe, a vampire cafe, a barbecue cafe and now a wife cafe.
It strikes the lonely, accompanied and hungry.
This was by Metro.
In Tokyo’s Ore no Yome coffee shop, you can book for your wife or husband’s evening.
A waitress who pretends to be a client’s spouse.
The "partner" is selected from the list before entering the cafe and he prepares and serves food.
The wife is faced with an essu and bikini, while the husband is in tight cycling shorts.
The website provides women candidates with all the information about length and weight, including the type of mattress they prefer to sleep on.
150 million vehicles will soon be connected to the network: Vehicle security attacks have begun
The Automotive Security Review Board (ASRB) will also support technological development and innovation in the industry, Intel said in a statement.
The committee consists of top security experts from all over the world.
ASRB researchers will conduct continuous security tests and audits to standardize best practices and design recommendations for advanced cybersecurity solutions and products.
At the same time, Intel released the first version of its best practices for cybersecurity.
In the future, the company will update the report based on the findings of ASRB research.
Global ICT research and consulting firm Gartner estimates that by 2020, approximately 150 million vehicles on the road will be connected.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road.
According to the same estimate, 60-75 percent of these vehicles are able to consume, create and share networked data.
We can and must improve the cybersecurity of cars,” said Chris Young, chief executive of Intel Security.
The ASRB enables Intel to establish best practices in security and support the vision that cybersecurity is an important component in the design of every connected car.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road, making an ASRB board the right idea at the right time.
Intel is one of the world’s leading innovators in data processing.
The Ford Focus RS will cost approximately 52,000 euros.
Ford’s Focus RS has been expected for years as a moon rising.
The car is finally coming to Finland.
Ford has revealed the details of the RS now as the automotive world looks at the Frankfurt Auto Show.
Ford’s new four-wheeled RS accelerates from zero to 100 in 4.7 seconds thanks to its 2.3-liter 350 horsepower engine and has a peak speed of 266 kilometers per hour.
The price is also interesting for the Finns, initially it is said to be 52 000 euros.
The car is now available to order, although when the first cars will arrive in Finland, Ford does not say in a statement.
Kia introduced two new features at the Frankfurt Motor Show: the new Sportage and the new Optima.
The most important of the two innovations is the new fourth-generation Sportage, with which Kia plans to seize a greater share of the ever-growing street SUV market.
The new Sportage, created under the leadership of European design director Gregory Guillaume, is more circular than ever.
The axle and outer dimensions have become a centimeter to one here and the car passes through the air more efficiently.
The engine range is essentially unchanged, but it has been added to the 1.6-liter turbo, which develops 177 horsepower.
More about the Kia Sporttag and its performance and consumption will be told closer to the sale.
We still have to wait a little while for the new Sportage to arrive in the spring of 2016.
Before the end of the year, the new Kia Optimat arrived in our country.
Suddenly, it doesn’t seem to have changed, but it’s a completely new car.
Kia intends to conquer the hearts of upper middle class buyers with better driving capabilities, lower noise levels and higher equipment.
The Optimizes are equipped with a 1.7-litre turbodiesel and a 2.0-litre petrol engine.
Next summer, the pace will accelerate with the Optima GT with a 2.0-litre turbocharged engine.
At the same time, with its arrival, the sale of Optima farmar begins.
Chisu Returned to the Stage - Rushed in a Brave Shirt
The singer Chisu will participate in the Life for the Child concert with other domestic stars.
The electric blue dress has a spectacular, open neck opening.
This is a beautiful presentation of the singer’s belt.
The crown of the whole is a gold metal belt and a red lipstick.
During the three-year break, the singer who became a mother has been able to punish pregnancy pounds with light exercise and yoga.
My daughter will soon be a year old.
The singer released his first single from a new album in August.
Getting back on stage and standing in front of a large audience after a long break doesn’t really excite me.
Everything has to do with music, the singer says.
In a few weeks, Chisu will release their fourth album, Polaris.
The new life situation has inspired us to make new pieces.
At this point, I wonder if people will find my new record, Chisu thinks.
Kim Kardashian's motherhood style is surprising again - now appears the chest
Real TV beauty Kim Kardashian gives speeches one after another.
She’s showcasing her pregnancy belly and breastplate in gorgeously sexy clothes, last night at 1 p.m. American Time when she left with her sister Kourtney Kardashian from her husband Kanye West’s show.
The black dress is transparent on the breasts.
It reveals the skin-colored bra under the dress in the flash of lightning lights.
Last time Kardashian was wearing an amazon-like maternity suit, she visited her friend for dinner invitations in New York just a few days ago.
It was highlighted by black shoes.
The third special maternity dress is as fresh as it was last Friday, when the presentation turns on the pregnancy stomach.
The harsh laws of the fashion world: No home, you're lonely, the competition is terrible
Top model Manon Leloup wanted to correct the idea that the modeling world would be pure glamour and a champagne party.
He made his own documentary, Speaking Dolls, in which Leloup and his colleagues speak out about modeling.
Harpeer’s Bazaar magazine summarized Leloup’s six harsh truths behind the scenes.
Every season begins from scratch.
Even if you’d posed in top designer costumes in the previous season, the new season will start again with castings.
And every season there are new, fresh faces in the field that compete for work with concards.
Models rarely have a place they can call home.
Work is continuous travel and can go for years so that the accommodation is a hotel room or an apartment in which the fashion houses accommodate their models.
If you’re very young and your mother can’t travel with you, loneliness can be unbearably difficult.
New York and Paris are the most sought-after jobs, but they are the most stressful of all.
There is not just one kind of humility.
An agent in New York may ask you to drop pounds, but in Paris they say you’re too thin.
Getting a job is always a risky game.
During the Fashion Week, models and designers are always together, and at the same time act as a support network.
When the fashion week ends, the difference is sharp.
Models want this industry because of the opportunities it offers, but they are fooled by the fact that everyone thinks work is just a presentation of clothes.
They want to be their own personality.
Work makes models feel like they’re actors with a role.
But in the work of the model, you can also express yourself.
In the show of Tory Burch.
New York is currently celebrating a fashion week, where designers will reveal their next year’s collections.
Roope Salminen plays the most unknown musician in the film
Roope Salminen plays the band’s founding member Antti Lautalaa in a film based on the early years of the Apulanta band.
Lautala founded Apulanna in 1991 with Toni Wirtasen, but left the band in 1994.
After all, this is a big challenge for me, because I am a 26-year-old rap artist, and in this film I play the 16-year-old guitarist, Salminen Laurahta.
I didn’t want to meet the real Ant before the shootings, because I want to make him my own interpretation.
Antti is clearly the most unfamiliar of those people, so I think it’s good that I learn his playing style only from the video.
I do not want to imitate a person.
The man who loots the completely empty Roope Salminen and Dogs group does not go into the role.
Punk manners come from nature.
In the punk episode of the Star, Star show, many of you have probably seen the prequel, as well as if you have ever visited our shows.
Our appearance has never been a small fault, but we always go in full.
The lead actors of Tuukka Temosen’s “That’s Us Beautiful” film, which played bass in 1993-2004, were announced today.
The band’s core group, which has become familiar to the public, is played by young actors still quite unknown to the general public.
Drumpali Sipe Santapukk is performed by Teppo Manner, singer Toni Wirtas Tatu Sinisalo bassist Tuukka Temosta Iiro Panula.
Roope Salminen gave a hint about her upcoming release yesterday evening, when she told Snapchat that she was mysteriously preparing for the most important day of her career.
Roope has already posted on Instagram a photo of her new look, which she has had to realize for the film.
Roope, who had previously been seen in shovels and a pair of wool, has shaved her face to siloposki, and colored her brown hair black.
Psychologist advises: This is how you tell children about refugees
Many parents have had to think in recent days about how to tell their children about the situation of refugees seeking to Europe.
Is it worth telling at all?
There is no need to be forced to talk about it, advises psychologist Ferdinand Garoff, a member of the SPR crisis group.
Younger children should be protected and not, for example, let them watch news alone.
Young children aren’t always able to understand what they see, and it can keep their minds turning around and annoying, she says.
However, if a child has encountered television news footage about refugees or heard about it elsewhere, it is worth talking about.
It is important to listen to the child’s questions and listen carefully to what he asks.
The child’s feelings can be surprising.
They may not be the ones the parent thinks they are afraid of.
It is not necessary to intimidate a child in vain, even if he is intimidated and frightened.
The younger child closely monitors the behavior of their parents.
If the parents remain calm during the conversation, the child will also feel safe.
Older children are likely to encounter discussion about refugees at school, with friends, or online.
It is important for parents to talk to them if the child is concerned.
The fact is that not all people in the world are doing well.
Parents can, together with their children, think about how this is treated in our family.
Is the world a safe or unsafe place?
Parents may also have different educational perspectives – some may want to protect their children from anxiety as much as possible.
On the other hand: If the family also talks about difficult things, the child gets a model on how to deal with the difficulties in life.
This may be useful for him in the future.
Social psychologist Janne Viljamaa: "Teach your child to help the weaker"
At the end of the day?
You can be a good parent for your child.
The bullshit is hard to control
Pertu Pohjola was hit by Apila Pallosala in the middle of the season.
It scattered only wins and second places until a collapse in the Tampere raves at the end of July.
As the eagle crumbled deeply, the coach suspected something was wrong and ordered his protector time from the veterinarian.
The explanation for the disappearance was revealed.
The horse had a headache.
The disease was not mild, but it required two treatments to overcome it.
Because Apila Pallosala had to be on light exercise, Pohjola says that he is positively surprised by the horse’s last run.
It was in the record time after the second SE-Tamma Taruntu.
Apila Ballosala was very pressured from the break, when she had only been able to run normally for a few weeks.
Considering those things, a small slope at the end was understandable, Pohjola says.
The coach assumes that a decent competition made the Orion sharp.
The horse was going on, and hopefully it was going on.
The Pallos of Apila have been so-called humorous horses.
When it was not entertained, it could have been thrown into a juice without even getting sick.
On a good day, however, the orie has disbanded such a lightning signal that the opponents have been surprised.
At top speed, fellow competitors can’t handle the Ballosalam, from which even warm-blooded rides get rid of.
In the north there is a desire.
However, the different thing is how the Apila Ballosala will agree to it.
It’s quite difficult at the start and can even be stuck under the boom of the start car and so on.
Hopefully, it would be quieter than going down.
Apila’s Ballosala will be able to come out of the bow when it’s in good shape, and we’ll go with it to win, the coach promises.
This is why you will not get rid of unnecessary iPhone apps
Apple CEO Tim Cook.
At least some of the apps that come with Apple’s iPhone phones may be removed sometime in the future – but not all.
Apple is likely to remove some of its own apps from iPhone phones in the future, Apple CEO Tim Cook said in an interview with Buzzfeed.
There are a number of apps on Apple’s iPhone that are relatively rare to use: for example, FaceTime calls, Press Kiosk, Health, Stock Exchange, Podcasts and Tips come to mind.
The latest addition to these programs is the Apple Watch, which came as a compulsory update to iPhone phones, although it’s only needed for Apple’s smartwatch owners.
Cook says removing Apple programs is more complicated than it seems.
Some apps are linked to another iPhone.
If they are removed, it could cause problems elsewhere on the phone, Cook told Buzzfeed.
Cook did not mention which of Apple’s iPhone apps work firmly with other apps.
There are other programs that don’t work that way.
So over time, I think we can develop a way to allow the user to remove them, Cook added.
Cook said Apple is investigating the matter because it doesn’t want to waste memory on iPhone users.
Eurozone inflation dropped to 0.1% in August
Consumer prices in the euro area increased only slightly in August, or 0.1% from the previous year, the EU statistical agency Eurostat today.
The rise in prices was driven down by the lowering of energy prices.
Eurostat revised its 0.2% forecast slightly lower than a few weeks ago.
In July, the inflation rate was 0.2 percent.
The so-called base inflation fell to 0.9% in August from 1.0% in July.
Eurostat’s forecast for base inflation was 1.0%.
Energy was 7.2% cheaper in the euro area last month than a year ago.
In all 28 EU countries, the average inflation rate was zero in August.
In July, the increase was 0.1 percent.
Consumer prices rose by 1.4 percent in Malta in August.
In Cyprus, inflation was the lowest when prices fell by 1.9 percent.
In Finland, the inflation rate was minus 0.2 percent according to the EU Harmonised Price Index.
Inflation in the euro area is still far from the European Central Bank (ECB) target of a price rise of 2 percent in the medium term.
The ECB forecasts an average inflation rate of 0.1% for the euro area this year.
Next year the rate will rise to 1.1 percent, the central bank predicted in its new inflation forecast released in early September.
The Fed is trying to tighten monetary policy.
The next U.S. recession will start at its fastest in less than a year, but more within three years after the country’s central bank, the Fed, has begun to raise interest rates again for a long time.
And in the financial markets, the downturn, in turn, begins before the next recession.
The Fed has suggested that it will start raising interest rates this week and at the latest by the end of the year.
Thus, the next recession could be pushed up at its fastest by next autumn and as the exchange rate of the financial markets before that.
Or at least that’s what happens if the world’s largest economies and financial markets function as they used to – and if they react to the Fed’s extortion of money as they did before.
Such conclusions have been drawn by London market research strategists Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Barker of Deutsche Bank in their extensive study of long-term market and economic cycles.
The bank distributed more than 60 pages of its Long-Term Asset Return Study report to its major international clients last week.
The strategists who compiled the survey and the report do not pretend to know exactly when the Fed will start raising interest rates or what will happen to the economy and markets afterwards.
Instead, they use their cool facts and calculations from economic statistics to show how the economy and markets have behaved in the past during and after the Fed’s interest rate hikes.
In addition to historical findings, they will examine which key variables in the economy and financial markets are now on the same or different pattern than at the time of previous interest rate increases – and what may result from it.
It becomes clear that both the economy and the financial markets are now in a better condition to withstand the rise of interest rates than ever since the 1950s.
Not even a year before the beginning of the recession.
Thro the past summer and early autumn, the leaders of the Fed’s monetary policy and its current orientation have suggested that the time has begun to mature for interest rates.
The first rate hike in more than nine years may occur this week.
The decision will be made on Wednesday and Thursday, when the Federal Reserve’s Open Market Committee will meet for a two-day meeting.
The Fed last raised its Fed interest rate in June 2006.
That was the end of a two-year series of relatively regular but at a time small 0.25 percentage point interest rate increases, with the Fed raising its interest rate from 1.25 percent to 5.25 percent.
The symptom of financial markets began in 2007 with the difficulties of the U.S. most risky housing funding company, and a year later the financial crisis broke into a global day of judgment nightmare.
There was a major recession in 2009.
Last time, severe downturns in the financial markets and the real economy started more slowly than have typically occurred since the previous Fed interest rate hikes.
Similarly, the trials were then harsher and harsher than ever since the 1930s.
German strategists have screened the ups and downs of the world’s largest economies and the turnarounds of the financial markets since 1950 and in some places since the beginning of the 19th century.
They have been reporting on the Fed’s interest rate hikes and their economic and financial implications since the 1950s.
From the first rate hike to the beginning of the recession, less than a year has passed, most often less than three years, and on average less than three and a half years.
Financial markets have ended up rising within a year or two of the Fed’s start of interest rate increases.
The Fed has, in turn, increased and decreased its core interest rates for a dozen different cycles since the beginning of the 1950s.
Each time has differed to some extent from the other, and the times are examined relatively rarely, so on the basis of them it is hardly possible to conclude anything certain about the effects of subsequent interest rate increases.
The experts say that many things are different this time.
Not only better.
Interest rates too low for too long
The crucial causes of the financial crisis, even the culprits, may not be undeniably discovered even by decades of research.
But three factors that led to the crisis and increased its devastating power may be quite undeniably clear:
1) The Fed, the ECB of the euro area and other major central banks in the world held their main interest rates too low for too long in the 21st century.
They planted the traces of the technology bubble, and at the same time raised the next one.
2) The amount of debt accumulated over the decades in the various sectors of the financial and real economy, which has already been excessive, has grown even greater under the influence of monetary policy.
It was the largest debt bubble in economic history.
3) The crazy debt financing, which has almost slowed down in the financial economy in particular, inflated the largest exchange-rate bubbles in the history of the financial market for most segments, from shares to real estate, bonds and commodities.
It is hardly possible to argue that the financial markets, which have risen to heights due to increasingly complex debt bulls, were in a rare, dangerous and volatile situation when the Fed and other central banks last pushed interest rates up.
The financial structures, even the valuation bubbles, which were tailored to the debt bursts, did not last until after the interest raises had begun and the costs of debt financing had turned to rise.
The risks came into being as a financial crisis, followed by a major recession.
More debt and more debt.
The German strategists don’t guess what will happen next, but they give the point by mentioning the following, for example:
1) The Fed and other major central banks have now kept their monetary policy orientation even lighter for even longer than before the financial crisis.
If interest rates were too low for a long time before the crisis, they are now even lower for a longer time.
2) Borrowing has not been crazy for a long time as it was ten years ago, but now debt money at its cheapest is literally cheaper than free.
Thus, the financial and real-economy debt ratio has not eased, but now in different parts of the economy there is a heavier debt burden than before the financial crisis or half of it ever before.
3) The liquidity issued by central banks, which is increasingly fluctuating and less expensive, has largely remained in the financial markets and has silenced key securities and assets to their most expensive peak since or ever before the financial crisis.
Not only are the strategists alerting the financial markets, but they also point out that even the U.S. economy has not yet recovered from the financial crisis and the worst recession in decades to the pattern ever seen.
The eurozone economy has hardly recovered.
In other words, the real economy is in an unusually weak state but, accordingly, the pressures and risks of the financial markets are incomparably greater than before the financial crisis, as the Fed next time begins to tighten its currency bonds.
Per the picture of the future of the French banking company Societe Generale’s strategist Albert Edwards is not as strange as it suddenly seems.
He has long trained the bank’s international investor clients for the following full translations of the Fed:
First, the Fed will raise interest rates, then the financial bubbles will break out – and soon it is time for the Fed to shut down the financial crashes with even greater QE splashes.
Hewlett-Packard, a manufacturer of computers and printers, plans to cut up to 33,000 jobs.
The majority of the reductions will be for HP’s corporate service side, the company says.
In November, HP will split into Hewlett Packard Enterprise, which focuses on business sales, and HP Inc., which focuses on consumer PCs and printers.
HP had its highest number of employees in 2011, when it had 350,000 employees.
Last year, the number of employees was reduced to 30,000.
The company records a one-off cost of $2.7 billion (approximately €2.4 billion) for the arrangements.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will cut 25,000 to 30,000 employees.
Reductions on the consumer side will remain at 3,300 within three years.
HP plans to move its operations to low-cost countries so that 60% of its employees will be in low-cost countries by 2018.
The company says it has already balanced its business so that none of its customers is responsible for more than 10 percent of its business results.
Last year, its three most important customers accounted for 65 percent of its business profit.

Yle: Minister Berner has served in the board of a tax haven company
Anne Berner, Minister of Transport and Communications, has served as a member of the board of directors of the tax haven company.
According to YLE, the company’s activities involve so-called tax planning.
It concerns the Luxembourg-based Saltri II LuxCo, whose board member Berner was appointed in December 2012.
According to the Luxembourg Commercial Register, Berner remains an official member of the Board of Directors.
Berner himself says he submitted a notice of resignation in May of this year.
I checked the matter and it is enough that I have submitted a notice of resignation.
It is almost impossible to manage and control that the registration chains take place within the agreed timetable, Berner says in an interview with Yle.
Membership after the merger
The Luxembourg company manages the shares of the Swedish company Kährs.
Kährs is a parquet manufacturer that merged with Finnish parquet manufacturer Karelia-Upofloor in 2012.
Berner served in the board of directors of Karelia-Upofloor from 2010 to 2013 and, after the merger, in the board of directors of Kährs and the Luxembourg company.
According to Yle, Kährs’ ownership in Luxembourg passes through a multi-stage ownership structure.
Berner tells Yle that he accepted board membership in the Luxembourg company at the request of Kährs, the second largest owner.
This owner is Hartwall Capital.
I have been a member of the board of directors of Karelia-Upofloor, which is owned by Hartwall Capital.
The company was searched for a partner found in Sweden.
This company was owned by a capital investor with a company in Luxembourg.
I felt that my own task was to take care of the capital interests of the Finnish family company.
It is important that we ensure that the income from the capital of our Finnish companies is taxed in Finland and that the starting point was safeguarded in this context, Berner says.
Berner says that the holdings of Hartwall Capital in the company do not involve tax planning.
According to Berner, the complex ownership structure in tax havens is due to the fact that the largest owner of Kährs, the capital fund Triton, already had a Luxembourg holding company ready for ownership.
A company-run reception center opens in Espoo
Espoo Otaniemi opens the first company-run reception centre for adult asylum seekers.
The reception center is ready to receive the first 100 inhabitants as of this evening.
Within a week, the number of seats can increase to 300-400 people.
The Immigration Agency establishes a reception centre in the property of the former Salvation Institute.
The activity isined by Luona Oy, whose activity is in particular the production of healthcare and medical care services.
The city of Esbo, the Immigration Agency and Luona Oy have agreed together, among other things, on the security arrangements of the center.
STTK prepares alternative package for work-life blackmail
STTK is preparing an alternative package to the government’s blackmail on the workplace.
The organization is also looking to include other employee centers.
According to President Antti Palola, at the moment the attention is on Friday’s demonstration.
Alternative ways to lower the price of work will then be returned.
Everyone understands that life will continue after Friday, Palola pointed out to journalists during a break from the organization’s administration meeting.
Palola estimates that the Economic and Social Union (EK) is not prepared for talks.
STTK economists have calculated that the change protection contained in the government’s competitiveness package will cost the employer an estimated €30 million, while the other side of the package is €2700 million.
I don’t know if there’s a great enthusiasm for a party to engage in a conversation if there’s a relationship between one and a hundred.
Palola: Negotiations have been constructive
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (central) has hoped for alternative proposals by Wednesday, because then the government is to give a communication to the parliament about its own package and start preparing the reforms.
He did not assert that the timetable was realistic.
The dialogue with the government, according to Palola, has always been constructive.
For the staff center organization STTK’s field, especially the cutting of Sunday days is a painful place, according to Palola.
The organization requires the government to withdraw from mandatory legislation that would implement part of the blackmails.
In the STTK, according to Palola, there is no warming up for the preparation of an alternative package with the SDP that raised the matter.
Employees will gather in Helsinki on Friday to oppose the government’s extortion package presented last week.
As part of the package, wages for the first days of illness will be cut, overtime compensation will be halved, Sunday compensation will be reduced to 75 percent and holidays will be shortened.
The STTK emphasizes that the central organizations have invited workers to demonstrate and that it was not intended to organize a strike.
Acknowledgment thanks
Akava Chairman Sture Fjäder welcomes STTK’s announcement of the preparation of an alternative package.
According to Fjäder, STTK will now be on the same line with Akava, as an alternative model for government proposals has been outlined in Akav.
Fjäder hopes that the SAK will also be included in the alternative package, because without the SAK the package will not be sufficiently comprehensive.
Akava Chairman Sture Fjäder hopes that the SAK, led by Lauri Lyly, will be involved in preparing the proposal as an alternative to the cuts.
Antti Palolan STTK said earlier on Wednesday that it was preparing new proposals.
We want change protection and working time banks.
Akava said on Wednesday that it has long been preparing its own proposal with which it is ready to negotiate a 5% competitiveness leap aimed by the government as an alternative to cuts.
Akava has been ready to negotiate all the time, and we have been writing an alternative model for government proposals for a long time.
We are prepared to consider the terms of the employment relationship as part of the contract.
In exchange, we want change protection and working time banks, says Chairman Sture Fjäder.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also be on Akava’s lines, as STTK did earlier on Wednesday.
Without it, the package is not strong enough.
We are now working together on a model for the country’s government and employers,” Fjäder said.
The committee will meet on Thursday at 5 p.m. to decide on the possible contents of the agreement.
"The same boat, common coal, talcoos" - play bingo while Sipilän talks in the evening
Green Left University of Tampere
Tampere University Green Left Viva bingo voucher for the evening.
Prime ministers have previously held exceptional speeches during the Mäntsälä rebellion and wars.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä speaks very exceptionally to the nation about the state of the Finnish economy on YLE channels on Wednesday evening at 21:5 p.m.
In order to seek a similar previous speech of the Prime Minister, we must go back to 1932, when Pehr Evind Svinhufvud was Prime Minister when he delivered the famous radio speech, which marked the beginning of the end of the Mäntsälä uprising.
After that, the president and ministers held several radio speeches during the Winter and Continuing War.
In the 1990s, Esko Aho held a New Year’s speech instead of President Mauno Koivisto, but it was more of a ceremony.
In the autumn of 1976, President Urho Kekkonen ended the strike of train operators in a television address.
Monarchy and Monarchy
The speech of Sipilö has aroused criticism and speculation all day long about what is to come.
Leftist chairman Paavo Arhinmäki said on Twitter that “Sipilä could consider his speech on the state of the nation in parliament as an announcement by the prime minister, in which case the speech would also be discussed.”
According to the Greens, “a single call has already been seen.
Leadership involves dialogue, listening to people.
Erkki Tuomioja of the SDP condemned the “monarchist mindset: the prime minister tells the people what is best for him.”
SDP Chairman Antti Rinne challenged Sipilä’s dialogue: “Long half a year from the elections.
No appearance of the Prime Minister in the media with the opposition.
has been tried.
What are you afraid of?
Public service
According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the speech was recorded in advance and lasted about 15 minutes.
It was commented in a live broadcast by the Chairman of the ECF, Lauri Lyly, and EK CEO, Jyri Häkämies.
Criticism has been given about the presentation of the speech.
We considered the matter and concluded that it belongs to the task of the public service to promote comprehensive publicity across Finland, says Ismo Silvo Yle, head of YLE publications.
Like at the time of Tammeleon
The speech also sparked discourse.
In the evening, the dinner is served in good time, the children are shaved and dressed as best they can.
Mother wears a gorgeous collar, and Dad puts a tie on her neck.
At nine o’clock we are silent in front of the TV like we did in the time of Me Tammeloide,” writes blogger Saku Timonen.
“Does Prime Minister Sipilä also explain in his speech why there are millionaries sitting in the Finnish government in tax havens who hide their capital, who draw up amnesty laws for their fellow tax evaders and at the same time claim to the people that it is compulsory to cut when the state is running out of money?” asks Pia Lohikoski.
From what Sipilä says, one guess is made by the Green Left Viva of Tampere University.
He posted a bingo on Facebook.
Will we hear about the same boat, common coal, living in debt and team spirit tonight?
The coupons and pens are ready, at 21.05 it starts and the channels are TV1, Radio Finland and Yle Arena.
Ahtisaari in the Guardian: Western countries rejected Russia's proposal to remove al-Assad
More than three years ago, the West rejected a Russian offer to force Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to resign, President Martti Ahtisaari told the Guardian.
According to Ahtisaari, the Russian ambassador to the United Nations proposed a plan by which Assad would after some time withdraw from power elegantly.
But the Western countries did not accept the proposal because they believed that Assad would fall within a few weeks.
Ahtisaari discussed the Syrian crisis in 2012 with the five permanent members of the UN Security Council.
According to Ahtisaari, Russian Ambassador Vitaly Churkin listed him in a bilateral discussion with three points of plan: the opposition should not be armed, the opposition and al-Assad should be immediately communicated, and Assad’s withdrawal from power must be carried out in a modest manner.
I know Tshurkin.
We may not agree on everything, but we can talk openly.
I told him what I was doing there and he said to sit down, Martti, and I’ll tell you what we have to do,” Ahtisaari recalls in an interview with the Guardian.
Diplomats are not commenting.
Ahtisaari said he sent the message to the United States, Britain and France, but nothing happened.
Tshurkin did not confirm the content of the conversation, but according to Ahtisaari there are no two words about it.
United Nations diplomats also declined to comment on Ahtisaari's allegations, but said that al-Assad's forces had already carried out a number of massacres at that time and key opposition groups rejected any agreements that would have allowed him to remain in power.
Sir John Jenkins, the former head of the British Foreign Ministry’s Middle East department, is hesitant about Ahtisaari’s remarks because, according to his experience, Russia was at no point ready to discuss the fate of Assad.
Russia has supported Assad throughout the war.
The weakest point in Ahtisaari’s claim is that Tshurkin spoke with a Moscow mandate.
If he had told me about Churkin’s speeches, I would have answered that I would like to hear the same from President Vladimir Putin so that I can take it seriously.
Jenkins said he would have suspected Putin’s attempt to hold power by a supporter of al-Assad.
Refugees in our own actions
During the Ahtisaari negotiations, approximately 7,500 people were killed in the Syrian crisis.
The United Nations estimates that the number of deaths at the beginning of this year exceeded 220,000.
More than 11 million people have fled their homes because of the war.
We should have prevented this disaster.
The flow of refugees to Europe is our responsibility.
I have no choice but to take care of these poor people.
We are now paying the bill that we caused ourselves, Ahtisaari says to the newspaper.
Asylum Seekers Centre in Turniou
The asylum-seekers arrangement center planned by the government in northern Finland is likely to be established in Torni.
The center would be established in the empty building of the Township of Tornion in the city center.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs has sought a place suitable for the need to better control the flow of refugees from the Swedish border.
Helsingin Sanomat on Tuesday that the board had already decided to present the school building as a space solution to the ministry.
According to the Deputy Chairman of the City Council of Toronto, Sauli Hyöppinen, this is not true.
When the whole council was not gathered and some of the people wanted a formal decision, we decided to convene a council meeting next Monday to decide on the matter.
There were 36 of the 43 delegates present.
Thirteen councillors were opposed.
On the basis of this, we can expect the decision to be positive, Hyöppinen says.
According to Mayor Timo Nousiainen, the city was contacted on Monday and responded quickly.
There are estimated 500 asylum seekers at a time.
The expert has checked whether it could be suitable for such use.
The location is a couple hundred meters from the border, so it would also work in that sense, Nousiainen says.
Labour market is an alternative to blackmail.
According to Prime Minister Juha Sipilän (central), the halving of public holiday pensions would only deal with part of the government’s aimed to reduce the price of work.
However, the government will be happy to accept an alternative package if the labour market organisations manage to agree on it.
Sipilä told reporters in parliament that he has not been in contact with the labour market organizations.
He also did not know how seriously organizations were looking for remedies for the government-declared workforce blackmail.
If such an agreement arises, we will welcome it as part of the overall package.
According to Sipilä, half-cutting the holiday allowance would be effective because it would affect almost all payers unlike, for example, the government’s planned Sunday allowance cuts.
Labour market organisations could agree on cuts in holiday allowances because they are recorded in collective agreements rather than in the law.
With these outlook, the government will announce to the parliament on Wednesday about the blackmail in the working world as a statement from the State Council.
According to the ministry, the proposals should be known before.
There is no final deadline either.
The legislative work then begins, i.e. the train is in motion and it is becoming more and more difficult.
Now is a lot of time.
It doesn’t take long, if there is a will, to formulate such things.
The list published by the government last week includes, among other things, the conversion of slum and helatorst to unpaid holidays without reducing the annual working time.
In addition, the salary for the first days of illness will be cut, overtime compensation will be halved, Sunday compensation will be reduced to 75 percent and holidays will be shortened.
The reforms are being implemented as mandatory legislation past the trade unions, which has raised strong criticism.
The workers' centers organize a large demonstration on Friday, and several trade unions have declared political strikes.
Tohmajärvi authority approved the expansion of the mahlahall warehouse
The Tohmajärvi Board unanimously approved the expansion of Nordic Koivu Oy’s hall, i.e. the mahlahall’s warehouse.
The criticism was caused by the fact that the project is larger and more expensive than originally discussed.
It also has a busy schedule.
It was also a little strange that the need for land was not known a year ago when the decision on the previous expansion was made.
At this stage, an expansion of the inventory by 400-450 square meters was approved as part of the investment program, but the money will be decided later in the context of the semi-annual report.
Even on the agenda, there was an investment of 150,000-200,000 euros, but at the meeting technical director Erkki Ikonen said that the price is estimated to be 300,000 euros.
The investment was supported on the basis that it brings jobs and tax revenues to the locality.
The municipality has no risk, as the company pays the investment as a rent, Vesa Väistö (ps.) explained.
Language in the river
The City Government eased its previously sharp stance on bringing Karelia-language street signs to the centre of Joensuu.
The new decision is important and correct in view of the cultivation of the Karelian tradition throughout the province.
Joensuu is not declared the capital of the Karelian language because there is no historical basis for it and the Karelian language is not an inherent part of the identity of the region.
The language spoken in the river area has belonged more to the Eastern Savoy language.
After the new decision, there will be no street signs in the city centre.
However, the city of Joensuu is also ready for the use of the Karelian language on a case-by-case basis, for example in information boards and in tourism marketing.
The same approach is recommended to all other participants.
Although Joensuu is officially a one-language municipality, it is worth taking a wide-minded approach to the use of the Karelian language now that multiculturalism is alive and is rapidly changing even in North Karelia.
The Karelian language is still a peculiarity of the province, as is the view of Joensu as the entire Finnish forest capital.
Both can be used for a wide range of marketing activities.
The closure of rail connections cuts the vitality of the province
The cuts in rail connections are striking the vitality of the province with a tough hand.
Transport connections have a direct impact on the economy and competitiveness of the province.
And that affects whether it is possible to live and work here at all, Joensuu Mayor Kari Karjalainen wondered.
He also highlights aviation, which has also been repeatedly discussed in the report.
It is important for the whole of the province that our chances of succeeding are not reduced by state power measures, as is now happening.
We should look at the impact of these closures on employment, Karjalainen emphasizes.
The deterioration of traffic connections poses an additional challenge for the University of Eastern Finland in terms of attractiveness.
Of course, the better services there are, such as traffic connections and housing, the easier it will be to get students and employees, says Jukka Mönkkönen, rector of the University of Eastern Finland.
He points out that poor traffic connections also affect the research team, which is very mobile and travels a lot for research.
Recruitment manager Marko Junkkarinen says that already at the moment it is difficult to market the university towards Western Finland because the cross-directional connections are weak.
Approximately half of the university’s students are from outside Finland.
Approximately 10-20% of them are from New Zealand, which is partly explained by direct train connections.
The river became one of my waves.
The view of the Joensuu City Council on the provincial Siun sote project is apparently unanimous, but there is one among the voices.
The city council member Pentti Keskisalo (pictured) proposed to abandon the entire project at the meeting of the council on Monday, but his proposal disappeared as unprofitable.
The Board of Directors approved the draft decision by Mayor Kari Karjalainen, which will be reviewed at the beginning of October before the City Council meeting, which will issue a final opinion on the project at the same time as all other municipalities.
One train ride from the Eagle to Kouvola will end next year
Passenger train traffic from Kotka to Kouvola will continue to exist in the future, although one pair of trains will be fewer.
There will be changes in passenger train traffic between Kotka and Kouvola next March.
One pair of trains are missing, but still five times a day you can get from Kotka to Kouvola and vice versa.
This is due to state austerity measures.
The Ministry of Transport and Communications’ rail transport purchase funds for the next four-year period will be reduced by EUR 12.3 million.
The quiet routes are closed.
VR will set a new schedule by the end of the year.
They enter into force on 27 March 2016.
The boys climbed to the roof, one couldn’t get down, the boys lived from the spot
The rescue agency rescued a 12-year-old man who climbed to the roof of the roof and could not come down from the roof.
The incident occurred on the street at half six o’clock on Tuesday night.
There is an old two-storey wooden house where there are no stairs to the roof.
It did not stop the group of boys, who decided to climb the roof of the house along the radio-amateur mast next to it.
The other two went down the same path, but one did not.
As a result, others lived from the spot and passers alerted the rescue service to help the last person left on the roof safely return to the ground.
FedEx turnover fluctuation, weaker outlook for 2016
FedEx announced its weak results for the last quarter.The transportation industry dropped its year-round earnings forecast due to a decrease in demand for freight services and increased costs for land transportation.
The company plans to hire 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season.
At this time last year, FedEx announced it would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
The company’s stock fell by about 2.5 percent 45 minutes before the actual trading opening on Wednesday.
FedEx forecasts $10.40 to $10.90 for the financial period ending in May. The forecast is down 20 cents compared to the previous forecast.
According to the FactSet survey, analysts predicted $10.84.
The forecast has declined, despite an average price increase of 4.9 per cent. The increases will take effect on 4 January. Additional charges for land shipping of heavy or large sizes will take effect in November.
The company still expects earnings growth from the previous year due to cost cuts, greater turnover and growth in e-commerce.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith noted that the company has achieved more than expected in a weaker economic situation that has tested production and global trade in particular.
The hiring plans for seasonal workers were announced a day after the competitor UPS announced plans to hire roughly the same number of seasonal workers as last year, between 90,000 and 95,000.
In the quarter ended August 31, FedEx’s operating profit was $692 million, an increase of six percent.
The result per share was $2.42, which was below the $2.44 forecast of 12 analysts at Zacks Investment Research.
The turnover increased by 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
According to six analysts interviewed by Zacks Investment Research, revenue was expected to reach 12.23 billion.
In recent years, FedEx has experienced a decline in international first-class shipments, which has led to the company’s Express unit’s downturn.
The strong growth of e-commerce has confirmed the results of FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, the turnover of land transport increased by 29%, but the operating profit reflected the increased costs of large shipments and insurance.
The Express unit produced better thanks to higher base fees, while the return on freight business decreased due to higher labor costs.
About an hour before the actual opening, FedEx’s stock price had dropped by $3.85 or 2.5 percent to $150.15.
On Tuesday, the stock ended up falling 11 percent from the year’s average and 17 percent below the highest note recorded on 11 June.
This week, the U.S. Central Bank’s Fed leaders will meet for the most anticipated meeting in years.The crowd will sit down at an eight-foot Honduran wooden table to decide whether it’s time to raise interest rates for the first time in a decade.
On the wall of the central bank’s decorative, two-story meeting room, a wall painting depicts the United States.
The map is a reminder that Central Bank President Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues must put the financial interests of the state above all other interests.
The central bank has a double order from Congress: maximize employment in the United States and keep prices stable here.
However, after the big bang, the central bank’s management has noted a third unwritten mandate: financial stability.
On Thursday, the central bank is due to announce whether the U.S. economy is ready to start withdrawing from the unexpected stimulus provided by short interest rates that remained close to zero at the end of 2008.
While most data indicates that the economy is growing steadily, the recent turmoil in the financial markets may already make cautious central bank officials fear increased volatility by raising the federal tax reference rate – even by a quarter of a percentage point.
“The labour market and inflation are of course the first and most important in their practical follow-up,” says Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at banking firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"H, I believe that if the central bank is looking for an excuse not to raise taxes, the increased uncertainty in the global markets is giving enough reason to wait yet," Piegza continues.
Those who think about it disagree with what the central bank is going to do, which in itself causes nervousness.
About half of economists in a Bloomberg survey surprised the rise in interest rates this week.
In the financial markets, however, the central bank is expected to wait, and according to the key indicator, there is only a 30 percent chance of a leverage.
If the central bank raises its steering interest rate, stock prices can fall unless policymakers soften the blow by promising a second raise.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 228.89 points or 1.4 percentage points to 16.599.85.
“The backdrop was the expectation that the central bank will keep the main interest rate stable this week,” said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody’s Capital Markets Research Group.
“It would be a surprise if the central bank raised interest rates at this stage,” he said.
"If that happens, the central bank should think carefully about how to keep the hands of those operating in the financial markets unshakeable."
On the other hand, experts concluded that raising interest rates could calm the financial markets and remove the uncertainty about when the central bank will operate.
Just a month ago, the central bank appeared to be inclined to raise interest rates by 0.25 percentage points this month.This would be the first small step in tightening the financing conditions and thus strengthening the U.S. recovery.
Yellen has said throughout the spring and early summer that he has expected interest rates to rise this year – despite the liberals saying that economic progress is needed.
Although job creation slowed in August, growth in the labour market has been stable this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1 percent last month and is now at its lowest level in seven years and close to the level that the central bank calculates as full employment.
Wages appear to rise
While inflation continued to fall below the central bank’s annual 2% target, central bank policymakers concluded that the main reason for this is the sharp temporary impact of oil prices.
“The economy can survive with higher interest rates, and it needs them as long as it takes into account the tight conditions in the labour market,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, financial markets around the world were not shocked last month, as China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by up to 16 percentage points from a record high in May, and investors feared the Chinese economic recession would also impact global growth.
Markets have boosted this month, and the Dow Jones has now dropped almost 10 percent from May’s peak.
The turmoil of the markets means for central bank decision makers that considering raising the steering rate is becoming even more complicated.
“The central bank’s work is becoming more complicated despite what’s happening in the financial markets and what news of China’s economic decline has been hearing in recent weeks,” said Stephen D. Oliner, senior researcher at UCLA’s Ziman Center for Real Estate and former central bank official.
Now he believes the central bank will have to wait at least a month to be able to deal with the effects.
"There is great uncertainty about what the impact will be on the U.S. economy. There is little reliable information about the post-recent developments in China's economy," Oliner said.
The recovery of the global economy is not the central bank’s main concern, so in principle it should not affect the central bank’s decision-making.
In practice, however, the central bank is the most influential body in the world’s monetary economy.
The influence of the central bank has been huge in recent years.
In 2013, the mere hint from then-Chairman Ben S. Bernanken that the central bank could narrow its scope caused turmoil around the world.
In today’s world, markets and economies are closely intertwined.In addition to monitoring global trends, the central bank is also required to communicate with other central banks and experts in order to have a good overview of the global economy.
“The central bank’s decision-making process is more of an art than a science,” said Zachary Karabell, global strategy director at Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, chairman of the regional central bank of Richmond, said this month that the central bank has overreacted to financial market movements in the past that appear to be unrelated to the underlying pillars of the economy.
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, has called for a raise of the interest rate.
“The Asian economic crisis led the central bank to decide at three meetings to lower the key interest rate by 0.75 percentage points, despite the limited, identifiable sanctions available for U.S. economic growth,” Lacker said.
A year later, the central bank reversed the decision.
“The central bank should put monetary stability first only in a major crisis, such as the 2008 economic collapse,” said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England’s interest rate committee.
The latest turmoil doesn’t even approach the situation at the time,” he said.
“There is no reason to be afraid of raising interest rates because of market shocks,” said Posen of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
“The Federal Reserve Act still has a dual mandate and does not mention monetary stability.

Brazil’s Rio Grande Association of Pediatricians promotes a proper diet for breastfeeding
The Brazilian Rio Grande Association of Pediatrists (SPRS) has developed a blind way of teaching breastfeeding women the importance of a proper diet. They are shown pictures of babies breastfed from their breasts painted with images of unhealthy foods.
The human breast milk consists of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates. This way the baby gets all the food it needs and can develop a strong immune system.
Due to the extra energy consumption, pregnant women are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 kilocalories.
A new study suggests that in addition to increasing calorie intake, you should also make other changes in your diet.
A recent study by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, revealed that a healthy diet for a pregnant woman can affect the baby’s genes and protect the baby from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, unhealthy diet has been found to negatively affect the child’s immune system.
Seven's Sunrise has the most viewers, even though Nine tries to capture the lead in the Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson invited Canberra to conduct a morning program on the aftermath of the Liberal Party’s leadership elections, but this did not improve Today’s audience numbers.
The morning program of Channel Nine was broadcast from the capital after Malcolm Turnbull removed Tony Abbott.
David Koch and Samantha Armytag conducted the competing channel's morning program, which was broadcast from London. The program's weekly special programs will also be broadcast from Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
The distance seemed to be irrelevant for Australian television viewers, as Sunrise was watched by an average of 397,000 people in five state capitals, while Today was watched by 339,000 people.
The number of viewers on Today rose slightly compared to last Monday (317,000) and Tuesday (283,000), but left last Thursday's reading (343,000).
Today has grabbed the distance to Sunrise in recent months.
Today had an average of 318,000 viewers in August, while Sunrise had 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference was between 40,000 and 50,000 spectators.
In September, Sunrise has so far reached an average of 349,000 viewers and Today 314,000 viewers.
This is the most interesting event of the morning.
The changes in the winds will affect the parliament more this morning.
Karl and Lisa are okay, thank you for asking!

Seven also featured the 800 Words series featuring former Packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson.
The new drama tells the story of a recently widowed father who decides to move to the coast of New Zealand with his two children.
Critics have questioned whether Thomson would be enough to be the star of the hit series alone, without the Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
According to the report, the response is clearly positive.
Seven's The X Factor retained its strong position with 1,136,000 viewers. The series brilliantly defeated The Block (838,000) and TBL's Families (726,000).
Seven’s The Chase Australia has captured viewers in a varied way.
The first half hour (17.00–17.30) of Andrew O’Keefe’s new screening series was followed by an average of 446,000 viewers.
In the second half (17.30–18.00) the number of spectators rose to 623,000, which was as much as it was at Eddie McGuire’s Hot Seat (613,000).
On Monday night, the first half of The Chase Australia had an average of 520,000 spectators, and the second half collected a staggering 720,000 spectators.
The total number of viewers was 620,000.
The Chase Australian’s second night’s audience numbers showed Nine channel that Hot Seat will pass by at 17.30.
The Chase Australia replaced the Million Dollar Minutes, which failed to challenge McGuire's series.

The final trio thinks Sam Wood is really the boy of Dreams – but whom will he choose?
Has the secret been revealed?
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have unintentionally revealed their choice of Dream Boyfriend.
Sam Wood’s final choice has been a closely guarded secret.
The three remaining women do not say a word about who has received the last rose from the boyfriend.
We asked Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski, and Lana Jeavons-Fellows about the mood before dropping one out of the trio.
Sam Wood’s lips are tightly sealed until Thursday’s final.
The women praised the man’s sense of humor, ambition, family values and positivity and considered him to be a suitable partner for their qualities.
When women were asked who would be the best partner for Wood, if the last rose didn’t hit them, their answers could give a clue about who will take the heart of a boy.
Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly named Mackay the most suitable partner for Wood.
Everything between Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood has been easy from the beginning.
"As soon as I got home, I noticed that Sarah and Sam fit well together. This feeling has remained throughout the program," Jeavons-Fellows said.
“Sarah has her legs on the ground, and she’s a really fun companion,” Markoski added.
“I’ve seen them together and I have to admit that there’s chemistry between them.
They look like a natural couple.
Sarah Mackay considers herself and Sam Woody to be a good couple.
Mackay said he realized at a home-city meeting last week that Wood could be the right one.
“When I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this is not just a race.
When Mackay was asked whom Wood should choose if he didn’t choose her, she answered mysteriously:
“I can’t say,” he said.
“I like the other girls just as much. Snezana and Lana are equal.”

Jarryd Hay has several options to start his NFL career
Detroit and Seattle were very interested in Hay after he moved to the U.S. A number of other clubs were also interested in him after an impressive open day last year.
Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula, and the choice seems to have hit the button.
Some coaches would have kept Hayne on the bench, as he did with the Australian rugby national team. Hayne spoke about the return of the crash after the team drove the win from Minnesota on Tuesday by 20–3.
Tomsula, however, demonstrated her confidence in Hayne and gave the man a new chance to restore the crash. The coach kept Hayne in play after Reggie Bush injured.
Tomsula continued his line in the costume after the game.
He didn’t beat the newcomers in front of the other team, but encouraged them.
Tomsula also defended Hayne publicly at a press conference after the game.
49ers Special Editor Cam Inman reports that Hayne also received encouragement from Special Teams Coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised Hayne to forget about the failed capture and focus on the next game.
Jarryd Hayne plays a capture in the first quarter of a game against the Minnesota Vikings.
Hayne and his Australian fans had been expecting another man from the NFL debut.
After the failure, Hayne left the field with a rage and later told 2DayFM 104.1 channel Hamish and Andy that he could not have imagined a worse start to his NFL career.
“These things hurt, and we have to move forward,” Hayne said.
Hayne compared the mistake to his debut in the State of Origin series in 2007 when his feed in his own territory opened up a place for Queensland.
Overall, the experience was incredible for the 27-year-old.
Hayne posted a photo on Instagram where she poses alongside fans and the Australian flag.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin discuss gay rights
In 2003, the richest man in Russia, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, was arrested with a gun at an airport in Siberia.

Four killed in gunfire against protesters in Nepal
Four people were killed in southern Nepal, authorities said on Wednesday. Police fired rubber bullets at a crowd in a protest against the country's alleged new constitution.
Violence broke out on Tuesday night in the Rupandeh district, less than 300 kilometers from the capital, Kathmandu.
District Chief Bishnu Prasad Dhakal said more than 1,000 protesters had gathered outside the police station, some of whom threw stones and fire bombs.
Dhakal said police used tear gas and fired fire in the air before rubber bullets were fired.
He said twenty police officers and five civilians were injured.
It is not entirely clear why rubber bullets, which can kill but are generally considered a less destructive alternative, suddenly became so deadly.
It was the most recent clash in weeks of protests in the southern plains of Nepal, where the Madhesi tribe said new provinces based on a new constitution would weaken their political influence.
Protests have also been seen in western Nepal, where the Tharus tribe is demanding its own state.
At least 40 people, 11 of whom are police officers, have been killed in violent clashes since August 10.
This is a significant step towards a new constitution, but the subject is very sensitive in Nepal, where the government has been centralized for centuries.
The new constitution has been working on since 2008, but lawmakers accelerated the process after thousands of people died in the shocking earthquake in April.
Legislators have voted on the constitutional clauses in Kathmandu this week, and authorities say the new charter could be adopted by Sunday.
NHC hurricane center: 60 percent probability of cyclone south of Cape Verde
A large low-pressure region about 560 kilometers south of the Cape Verde islands could have a 60% chance of developing a tropical cyclone within the next 48 hours, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said on Tuesday.
According to the Miami Department of Meteorology, there is also a clear low-pressure center in the middle of Cape Verde and the Small Antilles, with a 60 percent probability of developing into a tropical cyclone in the next two days.
Google to raise $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) has announced that it is launching a campaign to raise $11 million in humanitarian aid to organizations that help thousands of people fleeing war and poverty across Europe.
Google announced the donation campaign in its blog in a personal way.
Instead of running, the campaign was launched by Google employee Rita Masoud, who shared her own experiences when she was only seven years old when she fled Kabul with her family.
"We traveled in the dark with the train and the bus and experienced hunger, thirst, cold and fear," Masoud wrote.
I was lucky.
With the worsening refugee and migration crisis in Europe, many families in similar situations are in urgent need of help.
Donations are allocated to non-profit organizations that help refugees and migrants: Doctors Without Borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the UN refugee organization.
After a $5.5 million donation through google.com/refugeerelief, Google promises to donate the corresponding amount, bringing the total to 11 million.
The European refugee crisis is at its worst since World War II. The situation is especially aggravated by the four-year Syrian civil war, which has caused more than four million people to have fled their homes this year.
They also have to flee the war from Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Slightly overweight diabetics may benefit from obesity surgery
According to a new study, slightly overweight type 2 diabetics may benefit from obesity surgery for at least five years.
However, it is too early to say whether slightly overweight type 2 diabetics will live longer after obesity surgery than those receiving non-surgical treatment.
“Getting mortality data takes time,” said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in obesity surgery, who dealt with the new study in the journal JAMA Surgery.
Obesity surgery, or bariatric surgery, reduces the stomach by various methods.
Surgical methods reduce the feeling of hunger and limit the absorption of food in the body.
Over the years, bariatric surgeries have been found to be effective treatments for type 2 diabetes, but most studies have been conducted on patients who are clinically overweight with a body mass index (BMI) of at least 35.
The weight index indicates the relationship between weight and length, where the normal value is 18.5 to 24.9.
If you have a body weight index above 25, you are overweight, and if you have a body weight index above 30, you are significantly obese.
You can calculate your own weight index at 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
In the new study, researchers at the Min-Sheng Hospital in Taiwan used data collected since 2007 in a study comparing two methods of obesity surgery, stomach bypass surgery and wrist surgery, to drug treatments for type 2 diabetes in mildly obese individuals.
Following obesity surgery, the average weight index decreased from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year of the study.
The weight index of those treated without surgery remained at 29.
Among those who received surgical treatment, diabetes improved completely by 36 percent and partially by 28 percent.
In the drug-treated group, diabetes improved completely by only 1 percent and partially by only about 2 percent.
The study also found that blood pressure, triglycerides and bad LDL cholesterol were better in the group receiving surgery.
The researchers also monitored patients’ hemoglobin A1c levels, which depicts the development of blood sugar levels.
The recommended level of hemoglobin A1c is less than 7%.
After surgery, hemoglobin A1c levels dropped from an average of 9% to 6%.
In the group receiving medication, the figure remained unchanged at around 8%.
However, a research team led by Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsun found that this did not reduce mortality over five years.
The research team also compared the consequences of two different surgery methods.
In the fifth year in the stomach bypass surgery group, the weight loss was greater compared to the wrist surgery group (18.7 and 14.2 kg), the weight index drop was greater (7.4 and 5.1), as well as hemoglobin A1c levels (3.1 percent and 2.1 percent). In the bypass surgery group, diabetes also improved completely in a larger proportion (46.9 percent and 16.7 percent).
However, according to a Swedish study by Blackstone at the University of Arizona College of Medicine in Phoenix, surgical treatment provides years of life for obese people.
In a Swedish study, those overweight individuals who underwent stomach bypass surgery had a 29 percent decrease in the likelihood of death over 15 years compared to the group receiving conventional treatment.
Although no lower mortality was found in the new study, according to Blackstone, it was confirmed that people with a weight index below 35 could benefit from the procedure.
"This is the study's most important finding, as it suggests that surgery is safe in the lower-weight index group and does not increase the risk of death or kidney disease," Blackstone wrote.
According to Blackstone, people and doctors should take weight seriously when the weight index is between 27 and 30.
“We’re waiting too long for people to start taking the situation seriously,” the researcher said.
“When there are genetic changes accumulated in the human body that predispose to obesity and diabetes, it’s really hard to reverse the situation.”
“Not everyone can come to Europe” – Dalai Lama – RT News
“Europe is not able to accept all refugees,” the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis is in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader has called for an end to the violence in the countries of refugees.
The Dalai Lama addressed the refugee crisis in a speech during his visit to the United Kingdom. The Dalai Lama delivered a speech at the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which focuses on ethical research.
According to the Dalai Lama, in the current situation, humanity should be put before individual countries or continents.
He also stressed that while the Western European countries’ response to the refugee crisis is admirable, it is not sufficient in this situation.
“It’s impossible for everyone to come to Europe,” the Dalai Lama said in a speech.
While the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria for their efforts in the crisis, he stressed that the solution was only temporary.
“Taking care of thousands of refugees is a magnificent act, but at the same time there is a need to think about long-term solutions and how we can bring true peace and real development to these Islamic countries, mostly through education,” the Dalai Lama said.
“Ultimately, we need to think about how we can reduce the number of killings in these countries.
The use of power must be reduced.
The problems have never been solved by means of force,” he added.
Speaking of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush’s actions in connection with the 9/11 terrorist attacks and argued that by resorting to force in response to the terrorist attack, the United States created an uncontrolled chain of events.
“After the 9/11 attacks, I expressed my condolences to President Bush and told him that the solution will come through non-violence.
I know that his intentions were good, but he resorted to means of force with unpredictable consequences," the Dalai Lama said.
Hand swallowing cases quadrupled in children in four years
According to the Georgian Center for Poisoning, poisoning centers across the U.S. have a four-fold increase in cases of intense alcohol consumption in children under the age of 12 since 2010.
According to Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgian Poisoning Center, cases of hand swallowing in children under 12 years of age to poisoning centers increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
“These products are becoming increasingly accessible to children, and unfortunately some of them are getting first aid,” Lopez told CNN.
According to Lopez, children drink their hands intentionally, some to impress their friends, and some inspired by social media.
YouTube videos show teenagers drinking disinfectant because of cheap drunkenness.
Teens are told to mix alcoholic mouthwater with a disinfectant to make the drink stronger.
Younger children may be attracted to the smell of handles.
“The child doesn’t think the substance is evil,” Lopez said.
“Many of the attractive handmade products are just scented.
There are handmade products with the flavor of strawberries, grapes and oranges that appeal to children.”
The alcohol content of disinfectants is between 45% and 95%.
Even small amounts can cause alcohol poisoning.
"The alcohol content in the hand is very high," Stephen Thornton, medical director of the Kansas University Hospital Poisoning Center, told Fox Channel 4 in Kansas City.
"No one would leave whiskey shots at the reach of children, but if hand disinfectants are often left at the reach of children, they quickly get a large amount of alcohol."
Six-year-old Nhaijah Russell recently four scratches of strawberries on her hands at school, and the girl was delivered to first aid to take care of.
"The girl's blood alcohol level was 179, which is twice as high as that of an adult," said Dr Chris Ritchey of the Gwinnett Medical Center near Atlanta.
Nhaijah was unable to walk when he was brought to first aid.
Doctors monitored the girl’s condition overnight in a separate children’s hospital for brain damage, as she had fallen and hit her head after drinking alcohol,” Ritchey said.
“The situation was really scary,” Nhaijah’s mother, Ortoria Scott, told CNN.
My daughter could have died.
Lopez has advised parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic products and disinfectant towels in addition to putting your hands out of reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants have been linked to deaths.
In 2013, two Ontario women died from swallowing hands containing a toxic substance that had not been.
Health authorities suspected that the product contained lethal methanol instead of ethyl alcohol, although the latter was indicated as an active substance in the product leaflet.
According to a police report, three fourth-grade students in the northern part of New York state planned to kill a "sick" teacher in January by placing antibacterial products around the classroom.
The teacher is very allergic to the handcuffs and forbids bringing them into the classroom.
The police found that the plan was meaningless and urged the school to take disciplinary action.
Not to disagree with Celtic

Aberdeen's neck to Celtic 5 points
ADAM Rooney's first half penalty brought Aberdeen a small win over Hamilton at Pittodrie Stadium. The victory raised Aberdeen to a five-point escape from Celtic.
Griffiths refuses to talk about disappointment
Griffiths has disregarded rumors about a discomfort in the Celtic ranks. According to their own words, Griffiths and his team are not being observed as they prepare to face the Dutch leader.
"I don't think we have any pressure, I think the players are looking forward to the match.
The Dutch miss an old Scottish fighting pair – de Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and Dutch national team player Ronald de Boer has said that the interest of Dutch football fans in Celtic has disappeared because it is no longer allowed to watch the Celtic and Rangers duels.
De Boer, head of Ajax, said: “The highlights of Celtic games are no longer shown in the Netherlands.
Because the Rangers are no longer involved."
“It’s not just about the return of the Rangers.
We are talking about the old company.
The Dutch want a match between the two teams.
Old Firm’s games are very exciting and they’re also interesting outside of Scotland.”
I will reverse the situation, Deila assures.
RONNY Deila acknowledges that Celtic is having a difficult time, but the Norwegian has assured that the situation will change.
The club, which lost to Malmö, fell out of the Champions League and lost ten players to Aberdeen, which now has a five-point lead in the top of the table.
"Celtic has had tough episodes before, and we're going to get up again," Deila said.
“We want to improve our situation as quickly as possible.
The situation is very frustrating, and it causes anger or sadness in many.
We do, too, but we have to move forward.
We need the support of the Celtic supporters because it will strengthen the players considerably.
The common spirit is really important.”
Warburton cautious on January player transfers
While only a few weeks ago Rangers boss Mark Warburton hinted on January player transfers, he is cautious about the transfers and says he wants to jeopardize the team’s unity.
"January player transfers differ significantly from summer transfers," Brentford's former coach said.
“The players who join the team in the summer will be able to get used to the team before the start of the season, which is a success for our team this season.
The team is going really well.
Sometimes unnecessary purchases of players can cause a team more harm than benefit.”
Celtic to retire from Michu

Neilson, however, remains behind his words. "I did not question honesty.
Griffiths vows to avoid Tynecastle
The Griffiths were criticized after the man admitted he had cheated off blasphemous songs about former Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident occurred in a pub in the Roseburn district of Edinburgh before the Edinburgh local match at Tynecastle in March 2014.
"There was a local match coming in, and the atmosphere was fierce," the attacker said. "I can guarantee I won't go back to Tynecastle except in the Celtic ranks."

McInnes pleased with Hamilton's victory in dirty game
Derek McInnes acknowledges that Aberdeen was desperately struggling against Hamilton for his seventh consecutive league victory. With a win, Aberdeen scored a five-point neck to Celtic at the top of the chart. That's thanks to Adam Rooney's penalty in the first half.
"There is no cup or league-winning team that would not have won such games," McInnes said.
Unemployment continues to rise in the British Isles
The number of unemployed in Scotland remained unchanged between May and July, with 164,000 unemployed.
According to the Office for National Statistics, the unemployment rate in Scotland was 5.9 per cent, compared to 5.5 per cent in the UK as a whole.
The number of people employed in Scotland is 12,000 fewer than three months ago.
The employment rate in Scotland fell to 74.0 percent in the quarter, and the average employment rate in the United Kingdom is 73.5 percent.
Scottish Minister of Affairs David Mundell commented on recent figures: “The government’s long-term plan has laid the foundation for a strong economy.”
Almost exactly a year ago, Scotland made a historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
The job market situation in Scotland has improved over the past year: and unemployment has decreased.
Why do I watch the execution in Oklahoma?
Later today, if there is no legal basis for revocation, I will follow the execution.
If the execution is carried out, which I do not hope, I will sit in the execution room of the Oklahoma State Penitentiary, while Richard Glossip is executed with a poison injection.
Glossip has asked me to be one of four official witnesses.
I received the invitation in January through the man’s best friend and, despite my shock, I responded affirmatively.
As the day approaches, I am terrified.
Why did I agree?
I agreed because I thought I could tell a true story about the death penalty.
The perspective would be unique.
Journalists will be able to follow executions in the United States, and because there are more applications than places, participants will be selected by macabre draw.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of journalists from 12 to 5.
The execution is followed moderately.
I cannot do it.
I’m sitting next to Richard Glossip’s closest friends.I’ve created a man’s personal relationship as we’ve spoken on the phone several times over the months, and one of my visits lasted two and a half hours.
I like this man.
We often laugh when we talk.
According to the prison staff, I cannot be present both as a witness and as a reporter, so I cannot take a notepad and pen with me to make notes.
I just have to try to keep the details in mind.
One Oklahoma journalist accused me on Twitter of compromising neutrality.
“The basic idea is this:
When you tell a condemned story in a pleasant way to him, you get close to him."
I gave the reporter a different opinion.
The journalist admitted that she could have formulated her words more carefully, but still believes my actions were wrong.
Richard Glossip has disagreed with some of the things I have said and written.
He doesn’t dictate what I write.And even if he tried to dictate, I’t obey.
I told him that he could remove me from the witness list at any time.
But he wants an international journalist who can write about what happened.
If Glossip dies, he believes publicity will promote the anti-death penalty movement.
The Huffington Post reporter Kim Bellware will sit next to me.
If you want to learn more about the subject, you can listen to my podcast.
I will not repeat any details in this context.
I cannot say that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of helping after the crime.
However, I believe that it is very likely that the man Glossip is not guilty of the murder.
There was not enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
I think his execution is wrong.
From this point of view, I follow his execution.
I can’t say I’m completely neutral.
A neutral description can be read from other journalists’ stories.
I will tell you what it feels like to see a man die in vain.
Man attracted from the Canning River after a police hunt
The officer in the Canning Valley area remained dry while pulling the man up from the Canning River.
The attempted escape of the Perth man into the low, muddy water. The police, which were a few meters away, brought the man back to dry land.
Canning Valley police received a call on Tuesday for an unauthorized stay in Beckenham.
Upon arrival, the police spotted a suspect who was trying to get rid of the police by heading to the Canning River.
But the man did not go far.
"A man standing in the water said he would not get out of the water and urged the police to get him," senior colonel Shandell Castledine said.
The irrigation of officer Lachlan Perhaveci’s garment did not appeal, so he chose a safer tactic – negotiation.
“Sometimes an escape attempt causes a person to resort to fun ways,” Colonel Castledine said.
The case of football champion Ben Cousins is a memorable example.
In 2006, Cousins abandoned his car to avoid a police blow and tried to swim on the other side of the Swan River.
The man’s attempt was doomed to destruction, but the trick inspired the locals to plan the Ben Cousins biathlon.
Peter Moody says agents tried to spy on him and he threatens to stop competing
Peter Moody has accused Racing Victoria’s executives of spying on them last year and has threatened to stop the competition immediately.
Moody claims that the executives and Racing Victoria’s integrity department have attacked him personally, and Lady Tata’s rejection for recent treatment on race day was the last drop on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he has always tried to work for the benefit of competitive sports. Moody has been in a difficult situation when kobalt was found in Lidar's sample and the man could not explain the discovery.
Moody's has been keeping his tongue under control over spying charges for a year and a half, and he didn't want the charges to appear like a bitter man's actions.
“I’ve been thinking about this for a long time, but sometimes frustration breaks out at once,” Moody said.
“They know what really happened.”
"Sometimes I have to react and accept the consequences.I now have to accept the state after I opened my mouth.
I go home and sleep well.
I want to walk upstairs.I want the owners of the horses to believe that I will do my best.
If the owners don’t believe it, I don’t need to continue as a horse coach anymore.
I have to think about my future as a licensed coach.”
Moody dropped the bomb earlier in an interview with Racing.com, where he told about the intolerance department’s espionage attempts on his yard.
“A year and a half ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Brian Stewart sat in the same room and offered a man a job in my club in order to spy on my actions.
“They clearly believe I’m a scammer.
If so, they should provide evidence, because I have not been caught for anything unauthorized.
Robert Roulston, former Chairman of the RVL, David Moodie, current Chairman of the RVL, and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of the RVL, were aware of the action then and now.
Should I consider the situation as a personal driver?
Should the RVL take real action and leave responsibility for the situation in the industry to non-coaches?
Is it harmful to the industry?
Am I really hurting the industry?
Per many think so.
Per I still get a training license and push me out of my duties.There is no doubt that my speeches make many people think so.
But I’m at the point that I don’t care anymore, that’s sad.
It is really sad.
I urge them to make their decisions.
My family supports me and I can withdraw.”
The long-lasting investigation of Lidar’s cobalt values and the recent rejection situation made the coach eventually frustrated so that the man threatened to give up his license.
Moody is best known as the coach of the unbeaten champion Black Caviar. The man described the rule of the race day as ridiculous after a clay wreath was placed against the rules on the feet of the horse.
Treatment is against the rules.
I take full responsibility for it,” Moody said.
“A person in my staff mistakenly put clay on a horse’s foot.
It could have been done yesterday night.
It could have been done yesterday, and it happened.
It happened on the day.”
Moody's can expect a three-month ban on competition for unlawful clay care, which the organizers have begun to investigate.
“This is a joke.
The rules are made by someone who doesn’t know horses at all.
Everyone understands that rules are needed, but this has gone too far,” Moody said.
Escape from Cobram crash site
Police have arrested a man who struck a cyclist on the weekend and fled the crash site.
The cyclist was transported by helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital. He was seriously injured after a car crashed into him on the Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
According to police, the man who was driving the car escaped from the scene and did not help the injured cyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia to Shepparton police.
He is likely to be charged with neglecting stop-and-assist obligations in a traffic accident and other traffic violations.
The 40-year-old cyclist from Cobram is still in hospital and his condition is stable.
Melbourne Storm Coach Craig Bellamy Says He's Gone
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy considers the criticism of his team’s tackless game to be a purposeful activity for both NRL’s league favorites.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said the judges gave Storm a blow to the hosts of Melbourne in a win-win match in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett barely concealed a reference to Storm after defeating the Broncos in the Queensland Cowboys final on Saturday night. He called the game a modeling game and found that Queensland didn’t care more about the presses.
Bellamy defended his own team's tackling game and said they only focused on contact when tackling.
Bellamy added that his confidence in his own team was increased by the fact that two top team coaches criticized his team. Bellamy considers this as a proof that coaches are worried about losing to Storm.
"I remember Trent Robinson didn't talk about the press when his team beat us 24-2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I guarantee that we have not changed anything in our defense system or technology throughout the year.For the last six weeks we have only invested in contact games and tackles, which has turned us up.
Trent has been in office for three years. The loss may have been a shock for him because he has a great team that is not used to losing.
It’s funny that the same thing always comes up at the same time of year.
Bellamy disagreed with Bennett about what is interesting about football. He reminded his mentor that Bennett's St George-Illawarra Dragons won the league in 2010 by playing boring football.
"Wayne is talking about interesting football.
He compared his own team’s Saturday game to our Friday game and found their game interesting,” Bellamy said.
“In 2010, St. George received a lot of criticism for his boring game.
Now he has a team capable of playing so-called football, especially his young, fast center attacker.
This is the kind of football you want to play when the player arsenal is like this.
He emphasized this in 2010.Now he wants everyone to play in his style.Not all teams have central attackers like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt.
I get more self-confidence when other coaches are so worried about my team that they are resorting to it.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn’t think they would meet us in big games.
Bellamy also mentioned that Storm and Roosters scored more goals than Broncos and Cowboys.
Broncos was probably a good game. I haven’t seen it, but what was the outcome? 16–12?
Our final score was 20–18.We had more situations in the game, but is it interesting football?
Or are the game breaks and downsides an interesting football?
I think the objectives make it interesting.
If they mention us, we will probably encounter them.”
Storm has a free weekend as the team will be able to visit either the North Queensland Cowboys at Cronu Sharks next Saturday at AAMI Park.
Serbian man released for $200,000 in drug deals
A man who could be sentenced to life sentence for possession of 40 kilos of cocaine smuggled to Queensland has been released against a $200,000 bail.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of five men arrested last month after police found a hundred-pound cocaine barrel on a Solay vessel that had come through Vanuatu from South America and arrived in the port of Coomera in August.
Police watched Maximovich and his fellow criminals meet in the boat port during the morning and later surprised the two at Coomera Roadhouse.
Although Maximovich is expected to possess the drug for a lifetime for commercial purposes, according to the man’s lawyer, there is no evidence that his chief had attempted to seize the entire batch, but the man may have been in the cafe for an innocent purpose.
Supreme Court Judge Peter Flanagan said there is a risk that Maksimovic will try to flee the country.
“Maksimovic has clear connections with Serbia.
He travels to Serbia frequently," the judge said in court on Wednesday.
“He lied to the police from his home.”
Maximovich's mother and father-in-law jointly paid the guarantee of 200,000 euros, against which he was released.
"After reading the oath testimony of both persons, it is clear that $200,000 is a real financial burden for them," Judge Flanagan said.
"But that alone is not enough to prevent the man from escaping," the judge warned.
Maximovic was released on condition that he handed over both his Australian and Serbian passports, to the police on a daily basis and stay at home from 6 p.m. to 6 p.m.
Stevan Hogg used a girl’s phone to get pedophiles to send photos
A pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to obtain images of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the phone while the girl was asleep and logged in to an online messaging service where he caused another user to send themselves inappropriate photos of children.
Later, when she woke up, she noticed the phone was missing and found it sleeping in Hogg’s hand.
While browsing the content of her phone, the girl found shocking messages and immediately told her mother about it.
After examining the computers found at the address, the police found disturbing internet searches using search terms to search for inappropriate child images.
Hogg claimed to the police that he tried to mislead pedophiles on the Internet and to portray a police officer with the intention of frightening pedophiles.
Prosecutor Eilidh Robertson said at the local Dundee Sheriff Court: “The man claimed to be addicted to intimidating people.
He admitted that he had done a computer search, but claimed that he did so in order to represent the police and thus be able to intimidate pedophiles.
Hogg was asked about conversations with an unknown person who had sent pictures to him and from whom Hogg had asked for more pictures.
Hogg argued that his intention was to mislead pedophiles.
He said he got disturbing thoughts while drinking and wanted to watch pictures of rape and murder.
Robertson added: "After finding the messages on the phone, the girl cried out to her mother shaking and crying."
She saw inappropriate pictures on the phone, after which Hogg was questioned.
She said the accused used a computer and a PlayStation to talk to girls who looked much younger.
The 23-year-old Hogg Dundeen of Ward Road admitted charges of possession of inappropriate child photographs on 14 June last year.
Defense lawyer Gregor Sim requested that Hoggie not be included in the sex offender register, as it could be considered that the crime did not contain any significant sexual traits.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the sentencing to October due to background reports on social work.
Hogg was granted release against bail in this case, but was detained on other grounds.
Hogg was included in the sex offenders register before the date of his conviction.
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe speaks in Parliament
Mugabe, Africa’s oldest head of state, fell on the ladder earlier this year.
Mugabe was not injured, but a video of the incident quickly spread on social media.
Parliament's opening was also overshadowed by allegations of opposition lawmakers claiming to have received anonymous death threats warning them not to booze Mugabe during his speech.
Last month, parliamentarians buzzed and interrupted the president’s speech in parliament on the state of the country with intermittent screams.
Innocent Gonese, a bishop of the MDC (Movement for Democratic Change), said seven opposition politicians had received text messages urging them not to interfere with Mugabe’s speeches.
"The message was sent from an unknown number, but the title of the message is 'death,'" Gonese told reporters after Mugabe's speech.
The message warns the recipients that outside the Parliament, members are no longer subject to immunity.
According to the party’s bishop, the party headed by Morgan Tsvangirai is concerned about the threats to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard to cut 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard plans to cut 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of its restructuring and austerity efforts.
HP will split into two listed companies later this year, separating the computer and printer business from the fastest-growing enterprise hardware and service business.
According to a HP statement, the company will record $2.7 billion in one-off expenses starting in the fourth quarter.
“The restructuring will enable a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise,” said HP CEO Meg Whitman, who will lead the company after the split.
“Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be a smaller and more focused company than HP today, and we have an extensive and profound portfolio of business operations that will help companies move to a new business style,” Whitman said.
“As our own company, our position is better than ever and we are better able to meet the changing needs of our customers around the world.”
With annual revenue of more than $50 billion, Hewlett Packard Enterprise is focused on delivering unique integrated technology solutions to.
Founded in the 1930s by Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard after growing up at Stanford University, the company is now divided into two.The two founded an electronics company in a garage in Palo Alto, which is now considered the birthplace of Silicon Valley.
HP has undergone massive restructuring as it is moving from traditional desktop computers to mobile devices.
The changes made by HP, the world’s second-largest computer manufacturer, and one of the largest technology companies in the United States, are the latest move in an industry where concentration is believed to bring success.
Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta: Team must support injured Jack Wilshere before meeting Dinamo Zagreb
Wenger has also stressed to Wilshere that it is only September. If everything goes well with the rehabilitation plan, there is no reason why he could not return to the field as early as December.
The best possible scenario means that Wilshere will surely have to miss at least the next four matches of the English national team. Knowing the man’s history, his participation in the European Championships is clearly unclear.
The biggest regret of the latest problem is that Wilshere ended last season after a strong ankle down and seemed to have returned to his former ax under a new season.
“This kind of injury doesn’t threaten my career,” Wenger said.
My bone did not heal properly.
This is not a serious injury.
It was just an accident.
It wasn’t related to his ankle or previous injuries.”
From a medical point of view, this may be the case, but as Wenger said, additional injuries may occur when a player tries to return to the pitch in the middle of the season.
There is also an unpleasant regularity here.
Premier Injuries Ltd lists 23 different efforts since Wilshere debuted six years ago.
He also played for Arsenal in 65 of 157 league matches in the last five seasons.
The broader picture of Arsenal is that in six out of eight seasons from 2007-2008, the team has been the second team with the most money losses due to injuries.
Wenger accepts a possible vicious circle, but Arsenal believes last season's improved injury statistics will continue to evolve in a better direction.
“Sometimes post-injury recovery can be accompanied by a vulnerable period in which you need to strengthen your body and seek out competitive powers,” Wenger said.
“Jack is young, so he will survive this.
I hope he gets his body balanced.I believe in it, and with it his career will continue as he deserves."
Arsenal will start their Champions League competition against Dinamo Zagreb on Wednesday evening, after which the team will face Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not traveled to Croatia, so Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely beginners.
Wenger will also be replacing Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud with Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to take care of the team's balance and give rest to those in need," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal is a clear favourite for the F-Group sequel, Maksimir Zagreb has some of the most terrifying stadiums in Europe.
Dinamo has also been unbeaten for 41 games with the team.
The stadium was shaken on Tuesday night when the earth shake at a magnitude of 3.2 on the Richter scale.
It was the tenth earthquake in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes Arsenal has learned the lessons of last season after having to bow to Monaco and is still motivated by a distant desire to lead the team to the European Championship.
“We have a huge energy load,” Wenger said.
“Arsenal has not yet won this title.
We were very close in 2006, on the other hand, with experience, I am also realistic.
We are ambitious but not dreamers.”
FriendsFest: a comedy series that taught us the truths about friendship between men
A similar description shines with its absence in other series. It is remarkable, especially considering that the need for men to open up is greater than ever and the suicide statistics among young men are at their highest in 15 years.
In 2013, suicide was the leading cause of death among men aged 20 to 45 in the UK. Suicide is three times more common among men than among women.
Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) addresses the problem by declaring 2015 the Year of Men. The campaign aims to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking the help they need.
Friendship is the ultimate idea of the challenge.
A recent study surveyed 2,000 high school students and found that people with depression had better chances of recovering if they were surrounded by healthy people.
The likelihood of an asymptomatic person developing the disease was also halved if there were people in their immediate circle who did not have a mental health problem.
The basis of all this is friendship.
Modern communication is dominated by social media, and the style of communication is often more important than content.
With the digitalization of life, the need to appear strong, fun, and successful doubled, even though isolation is a reality.
Surface success involves external values, money, image, and social status. All of these draw attention from our inner values and our inherent desire for personal growth and friendship.
One millionaire in the video game industry recently stated that money can’t actually buy happiness.
The great thing about Freddie was that the series turned the focus on his head.
None of the characters in the series were defined by profession but by personality.
The series humoristically portrayed Joey and Chandler hugging or watching football on their TV chairs. We also saw Ross often missing Rachel. It was clear that men were able to identify with this even though they did not refrain from feeling full.
One volunteer explained this to me: “Listening to people who are depressed and thinking about suicide has made it clear to me how much even the slightest reactions of friends can mean.
Men who contact us are often unable to talk to their friends.
The traditional idea that men should do well is strong; a man is easily considered weak if he talks about his problems.”
“Friends is one of those series that presents long-term survival mechanisms.
In the series, small moments of friendship between men were emphasized.
Through the phone, I can offer external help in moments of despair, but long-term support comes from a close circle of friends and family.”
In honour of Comedy Central’s FriendsFest, the stage stages of the series have been brought to life.So if you are attending an event this weekend, you should take your friends to a coffee in Central Perk.
Or do something even better. smile and greet if you see someone sitting alone at Starbucks.
You never know how important a friendship can be.
Comedy Central releases the entire Frendit series – all 236 episodes – to celebrate #FriendsFest
Di Maria's hit helped PSG defeat Malmö
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuid and Edinson Cavan after scoring against Malmö.
Angel Di Maria made a successful goal in his Champions League debut and helped PSG beat the Swedish team in Malmö on Tuesday.
Read the game report and evaluation.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were in shock when Paris Saint-Germain started their job in the Champions League by beating at Malmö’s Parc des Princes Stadium on Tuesday.
Di Maria scored a goal after the debut game had been played less than four minutes. He confirmed the position of the French champions immediately in the hand. However, PSG scored several goals before finally being able to increase their lead: Cavani painted after the game had been played for 60 minutes.
In the A-Group are also Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, so PSG needed a strong start against the Swedish champion.
Although SPG scored, the match was not the perfect show for the team led by Laurent Blanc. Zlatan Ibrahimovic lost the spot and the man had to be replaced when he faced his former home club, where he began his stunning career in 1999.
“It’s not easy to win in the Champions League at home or abroad, so a 2–0 win and good shots provide a good foundation, even though we still have a lot to do for the season,” Blanc said.
“This knows well.
We were proud of the victory and we were able to do so, but we are sad that we were unable to score one or two more goals.”
Ibrahimovic returned to the team after an injury. The team had to settle for a 2–2 draw in the weekend in Ligue 1 against Bordeaux. However, Di Maria left Ibrahimovic in his shadow for four minutes.
Last month, the Argentinian goalkeeper who moved from Manchester United to PSG was named PSG’s decisive player to take the team to a new level in Europe. He proved to be worthy of the nomination by kicking the ball from Marco Verratti’s feed past Malmö’s defense and then kicking a precise hit to the back of the goal past Johan Wiland.
Those expecting the PSG win were disappointed.
Malmö defeated Celtic in the drop-down games, marching nine players of international level to the pitch from the start. The team playing with a five-man defense and two-attacker tactics was hard to beat.
Nikola Djurdic's shot passed Kevin Trapp's goal back in the 34th minute of the game.
Instead, PSG was crushed by unnecessary feeding and poor finish, and not least Ibrahimovic, who lost five goals in the first half alone. Immediately at the beginning of the second half, Ibrahimovic’s kick drove the goal to the peruces of Cavani.
Ibrahimovic, however, showed his nails in the feeding game. From Ibrahimovic's feeding, Di Maria shot a spin-off past Wiland at 52 minutes.
The second goal was achieved at the time of Count Cavan. The Uruguayan, who played sixth in a row, shot a full shot when Ibrahimovic struck him with his left-wing attacker Maxwell.
Malmö’s score ended in a second goal, and only Wiland’s top strike from close distance to shooting David Luiz kept the scores in control, and the goal of Ezequiel Lavezzi, who came from the exchange, was rejected in the final meters.
Malmö goalkeeper Åge Hareide later admitted that PSG was in its own class: “We played the last Champions League game in December last year.
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish league, where the level is not the same.
Sweaters are not enough.
Hats for Parisians.
It was a top match for them.”
Glencore to raise $2.5 billion in shares
Swiss mining giant Glencore, faced by falling commodity prices, raised $2.5 billion as part of its debt reduction strategy on Wednesday.
Glencore, which is listed on the London Stock Exchange, said in a statement that it had sold new shares worth approximately £1.6 billion to reduce debt.
This year, the company’s market value fell by 57 percent.The company is burdened by a crash in commodity prices as the Chinese economy’s recession harms demand and burdens the market.
As a result of the release, Glencore’s stock price hit the top of the London Stock Exchange on Wednesday morning.
The stock rose 2.77 percent to 131.60 pennies on the FTSE 100 index, which opened up 0.69 percent.
Glencore announced last week its intention to raise $2.5 billion as part of a strategy to cut its $30 billion debt by a third.
The company sold its new shareholders at a price of 125 pence, which is a 2.4 per cent invoice from Tuesday’s closing price.
The company issued 1.3 billion shares, totaling up to 9.99 percent of the group’s total value.
Worries about the continued economic downturn in China have caused the price of iron ore to collapse by half, while coal, copper and other commodities have fallen by 20 to 40 percent.
White House confirms Xi Jinping visit to Washington
A statement released by the White House on Tuesday confirmed that Chinese President Xi Jinping will make a state visit to the United States at the end of the month.
Xi Jinping will make his first official visit to Washington on 25 September, following President Barack Obama’s visit to Beijing last November.
Following bilateral talks between heads of state, the President of the United States and his wife, Michelle Obama, will host a dinner for Xi Jinping and his wife, Peng Liyuan, in honour of their state visit.
“President Xi Jinping’s visit will provide an opportunity to expand cooperation between the United States and China on a wide range of global, regional and bilateral topics of mutual interest. At the same time, President Barack Obama and President Xi Jinping will have an opportunity to conduct constructive discussions on topics of disagreement,” the White House said in a statement.
Xi Jinping’s visit was first announced in February and is expected to be in Seattle to meet several U.S. technology leaders. From Seattle, the president’s trip would first continue to Washington and from there to New York for the United Nations General Assembly on September 28.
Obama and Xin are expected to raise a number of controversial topics, including Washington’s concerns about China’s alleged cyber espionage and the country’s increased activities in disputed waters in the South China Sea.
Matt Damon dismisses diversity in filmmaking
Matt Damon spoke enthusiastically with African American Effie Brown and found that diversity is not needed behind the camera.
In an episode of HBO’s Project Greenlight series on Sunday night, the experienced actor interrupted Brown when he explained how important it is to take into account different views about the black protagonist in the screenplay chosen for the project.
"Diversity is taken into account in the role-playing of the film, not in the role-playing of the program," Damon argued.
Brown nodded shocked and hurt by the allegation. “Wow, it’s clear,” she said after Damon, who starred in “Alone on Mars,” commented.
Damon and Brown had met with other producers Ben Affleck and Farrelly brothers to discuss the finalists of the race.
“No matter who the director is, I would like to encourage you to think about how the character of Harmony will be portrayed,” Brown said at the beginning.
“The only black character is a prostitute who has sex with her white mate.”
The producer of the film Dear White People supported Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio as directors of the film. Damon replied sadly that choosing a twin could lead to an unwanted outcome.
As the conversation was shown on television, social media exploded from Damon’s disgusting comments.
Mr Pooni, a Twitter user, expressed his outrage over the scene in straight words: “The fact that Matt Damon speaks to the only black person to explain what diversity is is so emphasizing white that it hurts.”
The tweet was shared over 5,000 times and was liked 4,000 times.
Damon’s comments come at a time when the equal representation of human races in the media is a topical topic.
After teenager Michael Brown died from the bullets of a white police officer in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement gained support across the country. The movement seeks to end the discriminatory treatment of black people by lawmakers and authorities.
In February, Prince referred to the issue when presenting the album nominations of the year at the Grammy Awards.
“The albums still matter,” he said.
“Just like books and the lives of the dark people, albums still matter.”
Recently, the Black Lives Matter movement released a statement in response to Elisabeth Hasselbecki’s question from Fow News about whether the group should be characterized as a hate group.
"The Black Lives Matter network is a group based on love," the leadership of the movement said.
Damon is one of those entertainers, producers and media moguls who have been invited to the Pope to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the West.
It is not known whether Damon responded in favour.
The American Ninja Warrior Series
Professional climber and dish collector Isaac Caldiero won his first American Ninja Warrior title on Monday and received a million dollars for his win.
In the seventh season of the television series that just ended, all assigned tasks were clarified for the first time.
In the final episode of the season, Caldiero and photographer Geoff Britten survived the final round.
In the final task, the men had to pull up a 23-meter rope in 30 seconds.
Britten was the first to complete the fourth stage of the American Ninja Warrior, but Caldiero finished the task three seconds faster and became the winner.
After a tough battle, Caldiero told E!News that he was still in shock after catching a million-dollar pot.
“The winning amount is incredible, because I’ve never earned more than $10,000 a year,” he said in an interview with E!.
“Suddenly, I can’t even imagine what will come from this, the future is completely open.”
Co-producer Kent Weed told The Hollywood Reporter about the final and why Brittany wasn’t awarded, even though he was the first competitor to complete all the assignments.
According to the rules, the fastest wins the prize money.
If more competitors solve all the tasks, the fastest wins,” Weed explained.
“The money prize is fantastic and life-changing, but the British are also satisfied with their performance.
I don’t think he’ll bury it any more.
He is only pleased with his performance.
He has received a lot of praise from his fans.
Britten is a great guy for whom family is important.
His wife and children regarded him as a hero.
Geoff told me that because he didn’t win, he preferred Isaac to win.
He also believes that Isaac would have thought the same about him if the situation had been different."
America Ninja Warrior has been renewed for the eighth season, which will start shooting in the spring of 2016.
Detroit Tigers win against Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS -- The Detroit Tigers have no pleasant experiences in the second half of the season.
Tigers, one of the best teams in baseball, is now in the last place in the American League Central.
The team defeated the Minnesota Twins at Target Field on Tuesday.
The Twins lost their chance to rise to the Houston Astros to fight for another wild card spot in the drop-down games.
Detroit returned, even for only one night, to the taste of victory, which has been behind the stone in the second half of the season.
“Every victory is nice, no matter how it is achieved,” said Tigers goalkeeper Brad Ausmus.
Tigers feeder Alfredo Simon kept his lead when Detroit managed three times in the first two swing pairs, once in the sixth and once again in the ninth swing.
Simon (13-9) made a 6 1/3 turn of a good game and dropped three runs.
He has only had three good starts in nine outdoors.
“I just want to finish the season strongly this year,” Simon said.
"It's hard to throw a change player in every game, and that's why I want to go into the sixth turn."
The Tigers feed-back vicecamper Victor Martinez got three hits and hit two runs, which were his first hits in the run since mid-August.
It was Martinez's first night of three hits since he scored four hits against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
“He hit well,” Ausmus said.
"He looked good in the stroke exercises and kept up in the game."
In the second round of the seventh pair, the Twins had the best chances to get back into the game.
The midfielder Byron Buxton started the turn by hitting two nests near the left side boundary with a beating.
The right pair Aaron Hicks hit the sacrifice, and Simon took the turn of the second Brian Dozier, who took three direct feeds before being replaced by the left-handed Blaine Hardy.
Herdy was given a free-to-play to Mauer. Miguel Sano, the deputies’ replacement, hit the two nests. Following him came the right-handed Drew VerHagen.
With two runners on the pitch, VerHagen got a third Trevor Plouffen to burn two players.
The Major League team led for the 27th time this season, with Plouffe burning two players.
After Detroit had hit the confirming run in the first turn of the ninth turn, Tigers finisher Bruce Rondon hit a two-run hit, and the situation was 5–4.
However, the right-handed feeder threw three straight feeds and was able to keep his team’s position.
Detroit took advantage of the fact that Phil Hughes was a little rotting.
The Tigers ran three times in the first two turns against a right-handed squadman who had just returned to the field from the injured list.
“Of course, the start wasn’t the way I’d hoped it would be. But as the game progressed, it started to feel more comfortable and I was able to perform well and have some good feeds in the third twist,” Hughes said.
After taking the lead, Hughes gave one nest hit to second Ian Kinsler in the first twist.
The right pair of J.D. Martinez's free game brought Victor Martinez the first imported run of the game.
Victor Martinez's 0/21 pipe broke when the team had players in the nest.
Third, Nick Castellanos was hit by one nest, one run, but Victor Martinez burned in an attempt to advance to third.
The Tigers increased their lead in the second twist. Siepper James McCann survived hitting the second twist and Anthony Gose the first twist, where the situation was 3–0.
“It’s a big hit,” said Twins coach Paul Molitor.
“He didn’t hit very well, but he hit the right spot.”
In the feed shift was Hughes, who drove a pointless third pair, after which he was replaced by his right-handed substitute A.J. Achter.
Hughes's balance was three runs, six hits, a free-to-play and four straight feeds.
Note: The Tigers' right-handed striker Anibal Sanchez was not in the team due to a crash.
The shoulder is being examined by Dr. James Andrews, who cut Sanchez’s shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez has been on the injured list due to an injury to his shoulder since mid-August, and was scheduled to join him on Wednesday.
When Sanchez is out of play, left-handed striker Daniel Norris leaves the injured list and joins the start-up against the Twins.
Norris has won 1–1 in four games since he was replaced by his left-handed striker David Price on July 30.
He has been out of the group since August 20 due to an abdominal muscle injury.
Tigers and Twins will finish their three-game series at Target Field on Wednesday.
Norris (2-2, running average: 4.43) will face Minnesota’s right-handed feeder Ervin Santana (5-4, running average: 4.73).
Xi urges opening the economy to the rest of the world
"The economic system must open up to the rest of the world to boost growth," President Xi Jinping said Tuesday at a meeting of the Economic Reform Steering Group on Tuesday.
"China should commit to attracting foreign investment and expertise and developing an economic opening policy," the president said at the 16th meeting of the central executive group set up to deepen the comprehensive reform.
“Promoting the policy of opening up and deepening reforms will trigger a new momentum and vitality for economic growth,” Xi said.
The Management Group adopted guidelines, which included a negative list regulating market access, easing border control policies, facilitating the entry of private capital into state-owned companies, and a review of the registration system for citizens.
The Communication is intended to draw up a negative list of sectors and companies in which investment is prohibited.
The system is being tested gradually and is being developed through test programs.
This is a significant change, as it gives the market a greater role in allocating resources, a law-based business environment and market openness.
The government is also easing the control of companies and I want to ensure that companies have decision-making power over their own business.
China will allow the development of new models of cross-border cooperation in border regions, as well as the search for new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
With the opening up of government-controlled sectors, many sectors will open up to private investment.
"The government does not change its foreign investment policy. It supports the legitimate interests of companies receiving foreign funding and provides them with better services," the statement said.
In addition, the application for a permanent residence permit by optimizing the requirements and streamlining the application process.
The meeting also discussed the right of lawyers to exercise their profession and the support of judges and prosecutors.
The meeting was attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang and party leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli.
