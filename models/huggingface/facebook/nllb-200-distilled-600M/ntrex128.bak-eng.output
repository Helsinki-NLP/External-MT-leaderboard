Members of the Welsh Assembly fear being like mappet dolls
Some fear changing the name of the assembly to MWPs (Member of the Welsh Parliament), or members of the Welsh Parliament.
This debate arose over plans to change the assembly to the Parliament of Wales.
AM, or members of the assembly, think that we can be laughed at, across all political spectra.
One AM leiborist was concerned that his team was being rhymeized with Twp and Pwp".
Welsh news by foreign readers: translated from Welsh, twp means dry, pwp means steam.
National Welsh and Social Democratic political parties generally suggested alternative options rather than a риза.
Although the Welsh Conservative Party was open to changing its name, the move from the MWP to the Mappet Party was rapid.
In this context, the Welsh letter w is read similarly to the Yorkshire letter u in English.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently working on a draft law on name changes, declared: "The decision on how to name the members of the Assembly, of course, remains with the members themselves".
According to the Welsh Government Act 2017, the Welsh Assembly has the right to change its name.
When the Commission published the results of the open consultation on the proposals in June, it was clear that they preferred to call the assembly the Welsh Parliament.
As for the name, the Commission gave preference to the members of the Welsh parliaments, i.e. WMP, but the MWP variant received a lot of votes during the public consultation.
Members of the Assembly, in their view, proposed alternative options, but the agreement on this debate could pose difficulties for Chairman Elin Jones, who is expected to present the amended bill within a few weeks.
The legislation on reforms included the working methods of the assembly, as well as rules for disqualifying assembly members and the structure of the committee system.
After the legislative debate, the members of the Assembly will hold a final election on how they should be named.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on changing the name of their states
On Sunday, voters will be able to express their consent or opposition to the change of the name of their state to the Republic of North Macedonia.
This referendum was partly due to a long-running dispute with neighboring Greece, which had its own province called Macedonia.
The leaders of Athens believed that their northern neighbors could claim their lands because of the name of the state, and opposed their accession to the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President George Ivanov, questioning the public, opposed the change of the name of the state, saying he was cold-hearted about the votes.
In any case, the referendum supporters, as well as prime minister Zoran Zaev, considered that changing the name of the state was simply the price that allowed for accession to the EU and NATO and that it was only possible to pay.
The bells of St. Martin's Church were silent like the churches in Harlem
All the old people I've met, historical bars and churches here, were in every corner  Mr. Adam said.
There is nothing here today.
He said, "It's understandable that everyone is missing".
He says that today people communicate in many different ways.
It is not all neighboring hotels that other people frequent regularly.
When it comes to churches, the leaders were worried that the money they had bought the assets would not last as long as they expected, and that sooner or later they would return to what they had started.
He added that it was possible to build large numbers of houses from churches, filling condominiums with people who were indifferent to other churches or temples.
Most of those who will receive condominiums in these buildings will be white people, he said,   and will therefore wait for the complete closure of these churches, as it is doubtful that people who have moved into these condominiums will ever attend such a church.
Both churches were built by the Union of Whites, before Harlem became the city's black community in 1870, and St. Martin's Church ten years later.
The first white Methodist community left in the 1930s.
A black community of people had prayed nearby, and they acquired property rights to the building.
St. Martin's Church was occupied by a black community led by John Howard Johnson, who was also known for his boycott of 125th Street, the main shopping street in Harlem, which was opposed to hiring black people.
The 1939 fire caused extensive damage to the building, but Johnson followed the authorities and when they still had plans to rebuild the building, they ordered a carillon.
David Johnson, the son and successor of John Johnson, proudly called the carillon of St. Martin's Church the Bells of the Yarr.
However, in July, a specialist who played the corillon gave it another name:  Cultural treasure and Unparalleled historical instrument.
University of Michigan expert Tiffany Inn also noted that this was the first carillon played in the world by black musician Dionicio A. Lind, who had moved to the large carillon of the Riverside church only 18 years earlier.
Mr. Merrivezer said that the carillon in St. Martin's Church was not replaced.
During the last few months, the Cathedral of St. Martin was in a difficult situation for architects and contractors, some of whom were invited by secular church leaders, while others were invited by the Episcopal Diocese.
The governing body of the visitor's union, composed of more common people, wrote a letter in July to the Eparchy out of fear - saying that it should not try to pledge the expenses of the Eparchy, because they did not hire the architects and contractors sent by the Eparchy.
Some churchgoers complained that the diocese had not made a clear understanding of the church.
13-year-old boy held by lobsters in California attacked by shark
On Saturday, California began a manhunt for lobsters that killed a 13-year-old boy who was chased by a shark, officials said.
The attack took place at 7 a.m. near the beach of Bikon in Ensinitasse.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that on Saturday morning, after he and his friends had been in the water for about half an hour, he heard a child screaming for help and they went to help the boy.
Hammel first thought the boy was excited to catch the lobsters, but only later did he realize that the boy was screaming, "They bit me!"
I was bitten!
As soon as she reached the boy, she saw that his hand was broken.
I called out to everyone to get out of the water: A shark in the water!  added Hammel.
The boy was flown to the Redi Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was in critical condition.
The type of shark attacking is unknown.
Rescue captain Larry Djails saw the shark in the area a few weeks ago, but he told the media briefing that the shark was a safe species.
Jails noted that the victim suffered an upper body injury.
Officials have closed the beaches of Swami-bich in Ekinita for 48 hours from Ponto-bich in Kasablad for security and investigative work.
The area is home to more than 135 species of sharks, but most of them pose no threat to humans, Giles added.
Sainsbury plans to capture the British beauty market
Sainsbury acquired a range of beauty departments in the style of a convenience store, including a convenience store, a supermarket, a supermarket, a supermarket, a supermarket, a supermarket, a supermarket, a supermarket, a supermarket, a supermarket, a supermarket, a supermarket, a supermarket, a supermarket, a supermarket, a supermarket, a supermarket, a supermarket, a supermarket, a supermarket, a supermarket, a supermarket, a supermarket, a supermarket, a supermarket, a supermarket, a supermarket, a supermarket, a supermarket, a supermarket, a supermarket, a supermarket, a supermarket, a supermarket, and a supermarket.
The British beauty market has grown rapidly to £2.8 billion, which continues to grow, while the prices of fashion and everyday household goods have fallen, so we should organize larger beauty salons in 11 stores across the country, and continue with more stores for the second year if all goes well.
The beauty comes in terms of investments, the use of the boxes in supermarkets that used to house televisions, microwaves and everyday items.
Sainsbury said they will increase their beauty cosmetics offerings to 3,000 products, including the brands Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The already existing lineages L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also expand, taking the place of a special department store, as in the Boots store.
The supermarket also updated its range of boutique cosmetics, most of which consist of vegan cosmetics, as there is a demand for this type of cosmetics among young people.
In addition, the perfume seller will conduct a discount test at two Sainsbury's shops, the first of which will open in the south London area of Croydon last week, and the second in Selly Oak, Birmingham later this year.
With the shift from online stores and local day-to-day stores to daily food purchases, supermarkets have to do more to keep people interested.
Sainsbury's CEO Mike Kupe said that retailers would be more attracted to supermarkets as supermarkets tried to resist the numerous discounters Aldi and Lidl that sold both food and non-food items.
Sainsbury also set up sales points at Argos, and the good place he bought two years ago, he said, increased his revenue from the sale.
The supermarket's attempts to renovate its previous beauty and pharmacy departments were unsuccessful.
In the early 2000s, Sainsbury and Boots had been working together, but the relationship was severed because they could not separate revenue from sales.
The new strategy came three years ago when Sainsbury sold its 281-store pharmacy business Celesio to the Lloyds Pharmacy pharmacy network for 125 million pounds.
It said that Lloyds' network would add luxury brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy to its four-store range.
Commercial director Paul Mills Hicks of Sainsbury said: "We've changed the look and feel of our beauty salons to make our customers feel good.
We also invested in staff who could provide special advice.
Our brand range is designed with all the customer's needs in mind, and with a charming look and convenient location, we are now the ideal beauty site that is against the old sales laws.
After Holly Willowby pulled out of an £11 million deal, Peter Jones "got very angry"
When Peter Jones, star of Dragons Den, and host Holly Willowby, left the brand business with a lifestyle of £11 million, became "very angry", Willowby signed new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willlowby has no time for the homewear and accessories brand Truly.
The couple's business is often compared to the Goop brand Gwyneth Paltrow's.
The 37-year-old morning TV host announced on Instagram that he was leaving the project.
Holly Willowby, who was with Peter Jones, star of Dragons Den, left the lifestyle brand business at the last minute and began work on her new contracts with M&S and ITV.
According to sources, during a tense meeting at the business-imperial headquarters of Marlow, Backinghamshire, on Tuesday, Jones was furious after he announced his exit from the business because Willowbi had no time left for his new £1.5 million contract with the brand Truly".
The business was similar to Paltrow's Goop brand, so it could double Willowby's £11 million cash position.
After 37-year-old Willowby announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones left Britain and moved to one of her vacation homes.
According to the source, "However, Truly  was one of Holly's top priorities.
This was his chance to live the next few decades with ease, in the long run.
When they heard him leave, they were astonished.
No one could believe what had happened on Tuesday, because the project was about to begin.
The headquarters of Marlow has a full warehouse of ready-to-sell goods.
Experts believe that the exit of the British star of the most profitable morning show Today is a loss of millions of dollars for the firm because investments in various things, from meals to clothing, have been made for a long time and may have delayed further realization.
This may well be the end of a long-standing friendship.
The mother of three, Willowby, and her husband, Dan Bolduin Jones, and his wife, Tara Capp, were close friends for ten years.
Along with Willlowbi Kapp, he founded Truly in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined them as chairman in March.
The families were together for a vacation, and Jones Bolduin held 40% of the shares in the television firm.
Willlowby will be the brand ambassador for M&S and will replace ITV's anchor, Enth McPartlin, who is the host of I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night: "We don't comment on his business relationship".
It was hard to talk, but eventually we fell in love.
Some would consider the commentary unworthily for the president, and Trump joked that he would be criticized by the media for his positive attitude toward the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump laughed in the voice of the news anchor.
I never gave up.
Kim agreed to a second meeting after their first meeting in Singapore in June was marked by Trump's significant step toward North Korea's nuclear arms withdrawal.
But negotiations on the abandonment of nuclear weapons were fruitless.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean chief diplomat Ri Yonho noted on Saturday that we had not seen a consistent response from the United States to the leaders of the UN General Assembly's initial steps toward North Korea's abandonment of nuclear weapons.
Instead, he said, the US continues to exert pressure with sanctions.
Trump spoke in a particularly optimistic manner in his speech at the rally.
He says our relationship with North Korea is good .
We thought we were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
And now we have a good relationship.
He said that efforts to improve relations with Kim had also had positive results: rocket tests were suspended, captured hostages were released and the remains of American soldiers were returned to their homelands.
And he kept his weird outlook in the conversation about Kim.
It's so easy to be president, but instead of trying to get 10,000 people out there into this little arena, we have about 200 people standing right here Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
An earthquake and tsunami that killed hundreds of people devastated Indonesian islands
For example, after the earthquake in Lombo, foreign non-governmental organizations were said to be no longer needed.
Despite the relocation of more than 10 percent of the population in Lombok, the status of national disaster was not declared, and it remains a necessary condition for the activation of international assistance.
"Unfortunately, they made it very clear that in many cases they did not need international assistance, which caused some difficulties", Ms. Sumbuung said.
At the same time, while he assembled a team to go to Pallu, he was not convinced that foreign workers could help.
The representative of the National Agency for Emergency Situations, Mr. Sutopo, is a highly respected official who appreciates the need to seek assistance from international organizations in the situation in Palú, Indonesia".
Given that Indonesia has been constantly experiencing earthquakes, they remained unprepared for natural tests.
Although tsunami-resistant sites have been built in Acheha, they are not uncommon on the coastline.
The absence of warning sirens about the tsunami disaster in Palua, despite warnings, may have been a cause of human deaths.
Even in good times, traveling through the vast islands of Indonesia was a difficult one.
Natural disasters further complicated the logistics.
A hospital ship sent to treat earthquake victims in Lombok was heading for Pallu, but it took less than three days to reach the new disaster site.
President Joko Widodo made improving Indonesia's decaying infrastructure a key element of his pre-election campaign, and used the money to finance road and railway works.
However, the lack of funding has left Mr. Joco in a state of disrepair, as elections are due next year.
Mr. Joko also opposed the pressure in Indonesia to convert most Muslims to a conservative form of religion.
During the street fighting between Muslim and Christian gangs using machetes, arrows and other crude weapons, more than 1,000 people were killed, and tens of thousands were expelled from their homes.
See: Daniel Starridge from Liverpool has tied against Chelsea
Daniël Starrijk scored a goal in the 89th minute of the match at the Premier League stadium "Stamford Bridge" in London on Saturday, saving Liverpool from a loss to Chelsea.
At about 30 yards from Chelsea's gates, when his team was beaten 1-0, Starridge took a pass from Herdan Shakiri.
He takes the ball to his left side, and then hits the most distant stall.
The ball flew up to the upper corner of the gate.
Thus, the ball jumped through the Kepu Arrizabalaлаг and once entered the gate.
I tried to get into this position and score with the ball, players like Shaq were always playing hard, so I tried to give myself more time,   says Starridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Cante coming up and I hit the ball without much thought in one touch.
After scoring a goal in the 25th minute of the game, Belgian star Eden Azar led the game with a score of 1:0.
The Roses'  attacker passed the cricket to Matteo Kovačić, and the latter turned the field in the middle and ran towards Liverpuł.
Kovačić made a quick transfer to the middle of the playing field.
He then made a nice pass and drove Hazard off the penalty box.
Hazard came ahead of the guards and scored a goal on the far away stand with a barefoot leg through "Liverpool" Alison Becker.
Liverpool will play against Naples on Wednesday at 3 p.m. in the group stage of the Champions League at the Stade de San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
In London, at 3pm on Thursday, Chelsi will meet Videoton in the UEFA Europa League.
Death toll from tsunami in Indonesia reached 832
The number of deaths from the tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia has reached 832 people, the Emergency Agency reported on Sunday morning.
A representative of the agency of the Sudopov Purvo Nuгроho told a press conference that a 7.5-magnitude earthquake on Friday caused the collapse of various structures, which also caused waves of 20 feet in height, and left many people trapped under the debris of buildings.
The city of Palú, with a population of more than 380 000 inhabitants, is composed of ruins and remains of buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man accused of murdering a woman
The investigation began this morning with the discovery of a woman's body in Birkenhed, Merseyside.
A 44-year-old man was found at 7.55 a.m. with a knife wound alongside a 32-year-old man in the Greyson-Museum building, John Street, and a 32-year-old suspect was arrested immediately.
Police officers are searching for people who saw or heard something in the area.
Detective-inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is still in its early stages, but I have a request to all those in Birkenhead near John Street that if you see or hear anything suspicious, contact us.
I also ask others, especially taxi drivers, to contact us, because their video recorders may contain video recordings that are important to our investigation.
The woman whose body was found lived in Birkenhend, and a police spokesman confirmed that she was found inside the house.
Friends who thought they knew her came to ask where they had found her instead of at the event this afternoon.
The investigation is ongoing, as police are still in the process of informing the victim's immediate family.
A taxi driver in Grayson-Musez has just tried to enter his home, but police have denied anyone access to the building.
When he learned about the event, he began writing.
The residents of the building were informed that they would be able to return home after a few hours.
It was also reported that a police officer reported that one person was now viewing the entire district as a crime scene.
The woman who was crying emerged at the scene.
He repeated Kot oskós".

The parliamentary statue of Cromwell became the last memorial hit of the attempt to rewrite history
It would be poetic to destroy this statue by its followers, who would have followed it as it destroyed most of the cultural and religious monuments of the Taliban-colored England.
However, the Kromwell Society called Mr. Crick's suggestion a "rewrite of history" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmit, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "It is not surprising that in the current debate over the abolition of statues, the figure of Oliver Cromwell, who was not at the Palace of Westminster, has become a puppet.
During the English Civil War, no order was issued to destroy icons, nor was it carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps Cromwell should have been a victim of the mistakes of his ancestor Thomas of the last century.
The beautiful painting of Cromwell by Sir William Hemo Thornikroft reflects 19th-century thought, and is still a part of the historical personality image that many praise.
As Mr. Goldsmit reported to The Sunday Telegraph: Cromwell's identity was viewed by many, more than today, at the end of the 19th century as a defender of the parliament from outside pressure, in his case from the monarchy.
Whether this is an exact prediction is one of the most ongoing historical debates.
The conflict of the mid-17th century undoubtedly marked the further development of our nation, and the character of Cromwell shows one side of this breakdown.
His achievements as lord-protector were also worthy of praise and perpetuation.
Farmer killed by pigs in China
According to local media reports, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in southwestern markets in China.
The man, known only by the surname Юань", was found in the morning of Sunday morning in the swine palaces of the city market of Lupanjshue, Guychжоu province, with a broken artery, reported South China Morning Post.
In the Chinese province of Qinghai, a pig farmer was preparing to vaccinate pigs in the palaces on May 30, 2005.
He and his two cousins came to the market on Wednesday from the neighboring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs.
The next morning, his brother found him dead, and the door of the neighboring pig palace was open.
According to his account, inside the palace stood a large pig with its mouth painted in blood.
The report states that a 550-pound pig was killed by a court-medical examination.
My two cousins had their feet bruised and covered in blood,   says   his brother named by the U surname by the Guiyang Evening News.
CCTV footage showed that at 4.40 a.m. on Thursday, Yuань entered the market to feed the pigs.
About an hour later, her body was found.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his twin brother.
The market manager told the evening news that the pig had been locked up until police had gathered evidence at the scene of the crime so that no further attack could be made.
The family of Yuang is reportedly in talks with the market authorities about compensation for death.
Although rare, there have been previous instances of human attacks by pigs.
In 2016, a woman and her husband were attacked by a pig on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving a man with serious injuries.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig stuck a Welsh farmer in a tractor, and his wife scared the animal away.
In 2012, after an Oregon farmer ate his pigs, a Manitoba farmer reported to CBC News that the pigs were usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood had a negative effect on them.
That's just how they play.
They're very curious... they're not going to hurt.
You should show them the respect they deserve.
The remaining parts of Hurricane Rose bring heavy rainfall to the southwest of the United States
As we expected, the cold waters of the coast of the Gulf of Mexico would reduce the strength of the hurricane Роза.
However, in the near future, the Rose will bring flooding to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States.
On Sunday, at 5 a.m. summer time, the winds of Rosa reached 85 mph, with Category 1 hurricane reaching 385 miles southwest of Punta-Evgenia, Mexico.
On Sunday, Rosa is expected to head north.
At the same time, a dry air formed over the Pacific Ocean, which moved eastward toward the west coast of the United States, and when Rose reached the Lower California Peninsula on Monday, a tropical storm began to push deep tropical moisture northward into the southwestern United States.
On Monday, some parts of Mexico experienced rainfall of up to 10 inches.
Subsequently, tropical moisture, in contact with the approaching chalk, will cause heavy rains in the southwest these days.
Rainfall from 1 to 4 will cause sudden flooding, a flow of garbage and possibly slippage in the desert.
Strong tropical humidity will bring rainfall rates in some places to 2-3 inches per hour, particularly in southern Nevada and Arizona.
In parts of the southwest, especially much of Arizona, rainfall is expected to be 2 to 4 inches.
As the seeding season for tropical rainfall is clear, conditions may deteriorate and there may be sudden flooding.
It is not wise to walk in the desert during the tropical rains.
Heavy rain makes rivers out of canyons, and thunderstorms can suddenly blow in places, and raise dust.
The approaching dry weather will bring heavy local rainfall to the coast of Southern California.
Rainfall can be about half an inch in total, which will cause very little disruption to the flow of garbage and roads.
During the rainy season, this will be the first rainfall in the region.
Little tropical rainfall will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, and rainfall will be stronger late Monday and early Tuesday.
Heavy rains will spread in four directions on Tuesday and will continue until Wednesday.
In October, the temperature changes across the entire U.S. were observed as the Arctic began to cool, while the tropics remained warm.
Temperatures can change abruptly over time, even at small intervals.
A perfect example of a change in temperature was Sunday in the central part of the United States.
Temperature differences between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, as well as St. Louis and De-Moine, Iowa, can reach up to 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, there will be another long summer heat.
Most of the central and eastern parts of the United States, as of the 80s, are expected to see a widespread warmth beginning in October, from the southern plains to some northeastern parts.
Tuesday in New York could be as high as 80 degrees, which is 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term forecast is that the east side of the United States will have a high temperature rise in the first half of October.
The broadcast of Brett Kavano was watched by 20 million more people
More than 20 million people watched Thursday the proceedings between Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavano and the woman who accused her of sexual assault in the 1980s, Kristin Bleici-Ford, on 6 television channels.
The regular program was interrupted at the last moment on Friday, indicating that political opposition was continuing: Arizona Senator Jeff Flake had signed a deal designed to keep the FBI investigating for a week.
At the school disco, while he was drunk, Kawano confessed to the Senate Judiciary Committee that he had been robbed and stripped of his clothes, and that Ford knew 100 percent.
In his emotional response, Kavano said that he knew 100% that this had not happened.
According to Nielsen, the report was viewed by more than 20.4 million people on Friday.
The company has averaged the number of subscribers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers of the PBS, C-SPAN, the Fox Business Network and other channels that also showed this were not initially known.
And determining the number of viewers from offices caused trouble for Nielsen.
In perspective, the audience size is roughly equal to the number of viewers who watched a football playoff match or the awarding of the Oscar prize.
According to Nielsen, the channel Fox News Channel, as its hosts say, supported Kawano's appointment, with about 5,69 million viewers during the day of auditions.
ABC is second with 3,26 million viewers.
Nielsen said that CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2,94 million, MSNBC 2,89 million and CNN 2,52 million television viewers.
Even after the hearings, the interest did not stop.
Flake became a major figure in the Friday drama.
After the Republicans announced that they had voted for Kawano, he was shot by the cameras CNN and CBS as protesters cried out on Friday morning as they tried to climb the elevator to the Judicial Committee, where the hearings were held.
He stared at the floor for several minutes before being pulled into the live stream by CNN.
A woman says, "I'm standing right here in front of you".
Do you think he is telling the truth to the country?
"When you were strong, so many women were weak".
Before the elevator was shut down, Flake's office responded and said he would have more to say before the committee's next hearings.
Cable television and radio networks broadcast live for several hours, when the Judiciary Committee was to vote in the full Senate to remove Kavanaugh's candidacy.
However, Flake said that voting would only be possible if the FBI examined the charges against the candidate in the second week, something that was supported by the Democratic Party, which was short-lived.
Flake was convinced by a conversation with his friend, Senator-Democrat Chris Kuns.
After consulting with Kuns and several other senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake's voice was important because the Republican Party could not elect him without conducting investigations into the Kawano case.
President Trump launched an FBI investigation into the accused Kavano.
British Prime Minister May accused critics of running a "political game" on Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of playing a political game that disrupted Britain's future and national development, the Sunday Times wrote in an interview.
British Prime Minister Theresa May visited the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK, on 29 September 2018.
In a second interview on the front page of the paper, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson criticized his Checker plan for Brexit, saying that the proposal to create a common customs territory between Britain and the EU was "completely ridiculous".
Wade Sims shot: Police arrested Dayton Simpson accused of killing LSU player
Police arrested a man accused of shooting, 20-year-old Wade Sims, a player for the LSU basketball team.
According to the Baton Rouge police chief, 20-year-old Dayton Simpson was arrested and charged with second-degree criminal activity.
Officials posted a video of Sims and Simpson fighting, where police officers said Sims lost his temper.
Police obtained information from the crime scene, where they found Simpson's DNA, CBS branch WAFB reported.
After Simpson was questioned, police said he admitted to shooting at Wade.
According to his lawyer, his salary was set at $350,000.
A Coronor officer of the East-Baton-Rug district published a preliminary report on the results on Friday, in which the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck, - reports the newspaper.
The department also thanked the Louisiana State Police Task Force for their efforts to find refugees, the State Police's Criminal Laboratory, the Southern University Police Department and the local community for their help in locating the criminals.
Sports director of LSU Joe Alleva expressed gratitude to local law enforcement for their "seeking and efforts for justice".
Sims was only 20 years old.
The 6-foot-6-inch forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at LSU.
Last season, during the game, he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds.
On Friday morning, coach of the LSU basketball team, Will Wэйd, announced that the team was sorry for his death.
These kinds of events always care about you", says Wade.
Volcanoes blow ash to Mexico City
Ashes from the Popokatepetl volcano reached the southern areas of Mexico's capital, Mexico City.
After the crater's activation intensified and 183 gas and ash eruptions were recorded in 24 hours, the National Center for Disaster Management warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano on Saturday.
The center observed a large number of sounds and vibrations.
In the photos on social media, you can see a thin layer of sand in the windows of cars in the Hochimiлько district near Mexico City.
After a magnitude 7.1 earthquake in September 2017 struck central Mexico, Geophysicists observed an intensification of the volcano's activity in a 45-mile (or 72-kilometre) southeast direction from the capital.
The volcano, named after Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
When the year of voting for independence came to an end, police officers clashed with Catalan separatists
After a radical group protesting independence on Saturday clashed with the Omon, six people were arrested in Barcelona, and thousands joined the demonstration dedicated to the first anniversary of the separation of Catalonia.
A radical group attacked the OMON with egg and powder paints, which raised black sand clouds in crowded streets.
Later that day, several clashes broke out after police officers used clubs to arrest the population.
The group that fought for independence for several hours, We do not remember, we do not forgive, "they were shouting Viva España .
Fourteen people were treated for some of the injuries they sustained during the protests, local media reported.
The region, which had set itself the goal of independence, remained highly tense, especially after the referendum held on October 1, a year after Madrid declared it illegal, but the Catalan separatists celebrated it only once.
Most voters wanted to be independent, although the number of attendees was small, and those who supported leaving the Spanish constitution largely boycotted the election.
According to the Catalan government, more than 1,000 people were injured during the elections last year, which were caused by police attempts to halt the election in polling stations.
The group of independents were wounded in the camp by Friday night, with the intention of preventing a demonstration by national police supporters.
The demonstration continued, but she was forced to take a different path.
The 68-year-old electrician Narcis Termes, who was with his wife during the separatist protests, said he no longer believed that Catalonia could be independent.
Last year we had one of our best moments.
My parents were crying because they had chosen, and now we are delayed.
Despite the defeat in the small regional elections last December, Catalan parties that had campaigned for independence tried to continue their work this year, with their most famous leaders either going into exile on their own or sitting in detention awaiting a court ruling to declare independence by referendum.
Joann Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who helped police record the protest on his cell phone, said the conflict was started by politicians from both sides.
"This is a very serious matter", he said.
On Saturday, one of nine Catalan leaders, who has been in prison since the end of last year, Oriool Junkeiras announced that he would be running for a second term in the European Parliament elections.
The fact that the candidate is a member of the European elections, which we have just seen, will not allow the democratically enhanced regression and repressions from the Spanish government to continue.
Londonerri: arrested men who were hit by a car
In Londonderry, men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after being hit by a car several times after they had gone home.

Also, at some point, the car was struck by an arballet.
Menga's goal helped Lifington beat Rangers 1-0
Dolly Mengo's first goal for the Lifington goal ensured the team's victory.
Livingston Ibrox The Rangers were surprised to see the club's manager, Stephen JERRARD, sent to the second loss of 18 games.
When Gary Holton's side was on the same level as Hibernia for the second time, Dolly Menga's punch came out differently.
The Gerrard team was defeated and would meet the leading team Harts on the next Sunday of this Premier League season, who were eight points behind.
Prior to that, on Thursday, the Reingers hosted the Rapid team of Vienna in the Europa League.
Livingston, meanwhile, extended his unbeaten series game to sixth in his division, with head coach Holt still feeling a sense of defeat after replacing Kenny Mayler last month.
Livingston unleashed the opportunity against guests.
Holt's team, with a variety of difficult times in the Rangers, felt that it should be ahead of the pack before it started scoring.
Scott Robinson was able to pass, but his stamina at the gate was over, and then Alan Litgow tried his luck, but the ball failed to match the head of Craig Helkett.
The owners let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could disturb the guests during the presentation.
That was the goal.
With the ball passed from the Reйнджерс penal, Livingston opened the score, and Declan Gallagher and Robinson teamed up against the penalty-ridden Menga.
By this time, the Rangers had taken the lead, but decided not to overcome the owners' defense, with goalkeeper Liam Kelly being calm in a high degree.
This phenomenon continued in the second half, but it was still Alfredo Morelos who kept Kelly.
Scott Pittman hit the ball from the other spot of Livingston in the leg of "Reiners" goalkeeper Allan McGregor.
The attack continued to the Livingston gate, but was not successful, and was rejected after Helket was called in for Glenn Middleton and asked for two penalty minutes to touch the ball.
Fenoменаль result from Livingston
You were accompanied by Alasder Lamont in the Tony Macaroni arena, BBC Scotland.
It was a phenomenal effort and result for Livingston.
These guys played very well, only to exceed the expectations in the upper trajectory.
Their style of play and staff remained the same since their rise to the top, but they should be grateful to Holt, who was a huge inspiration to the team.
He has so many heroes.
While Captain Halkett was leading a well-organized defense, Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrell under pressure.
However, the Rangers were not inspired.
In Gerard's time, however well they played, they were simply not up to these standards.
Their last ball, the game owners' field, was only once, which should be a sign for the Re Rangers" who fell to the middle of the table.
Erdogan was met in Köln in a double
On Saturday (29 September), under the blue skies, the leaders of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin with a smile.
Today is the last day of President Erdogan's stay in Germany  This meeting was held to restore relations with NATO ally Germany.
They had been involved in a dispute over human rights, press freedom and Turkey's accession to the European Union.
Erdogan then traveled to the city of Köln to open a large, new mosque.
For the large number of Turkish people living outside Turkey, this city is like another home.
Police, citing security concerns, surrounded the 25,000 people gathered outside the mosque, but most of them could get closer and see their презеdents.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan  most of them Kurds  also criticized Erdogan's political work and the decision by the German government to recall him to his country.
A two-way split ensued: some German Turks greeted Erdogan as hero, while others slandered him as dictator.

Long-Lartin prison: six officers were wounded in clashes
The prison's management reported that six men were wounded in the clashes at the mansion.
Disorderly conduct in Long-Lartin, Worcestershire, continued into the air at 09:30 on Sunday, summer time.
To quell the unrest involving eight prisoners, special officers of the Tornado were called in.
Officers were injured on the scene, though not much.
A prison official said that special trained prison staff were sent to the scene to stop the ongoing clashes at Long-Lartin.
Six officers were wounded.
We don't want to tolerate such clashes in our prisons, we hand the culprits over to the police, and of course they can spend more time behind bars.
Long-Lartin Prison houses more than 500 inmates, some of whom are the country's most notorious criminals.
In June, after the prisoner's attack, the prison chief was reportedly rushed to the hospital.
And in October of last year, during a serious riot, prisoners attacked with billiard balls, and OMON personnel were called to the prison to solve such an incident.
Hurricane Rose caused sudden flooding in the Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City areas (which may benefit drought-prone areas)
Tropical rainfall is rare in Arizona, but it is likely to be the same rainfall next week, with the energy left over from hurricane Роза heading southwest along the desert, causing a sudden flood.
National Weather Service issued flash flood watches for western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, as well as Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City on Monday and Tuesday.
It is expected that on Monday evening, with rain, Rosa will make her way through Phoenix on Saturday.
Phoenix National Meteorological Officers noted in their report that only ten tropical cyclones within 200 miles of Phoenix have received tropical storm or disaster status since 1950.
The Hurricane Katrina (1967) hit 40 miles from the Asian border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center are expected to have 2 to 4 inches of rainfall, with a rainfall of up to 6 inches in the isolated Mogoallón Valley of Arizona.
In the vicinity of rocky mountains and large basins, it probably drops 1-2 inches, resulting in a 4 inches drop along with its isolated sites.
For areas that were not affected by flooding, the rain of the Rose may seem a blessing, as the region is prone to drought.
Although flooding is a complex problem, some of the rainfall is likely to be beneficial, as the southwest is currently experiencing drought.
According to American monitoring data, at least 40% of Arizona is experiencing extreme drought, a second category of magnitude, reports weather.com.
First, the path of Hurricane Rosa lies along the coast of the Lower California Peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday morning, still having hurricane strength, the Rosé winds reached a maximum of 85 mph, stood 385 miles south of Punt-Euchenia, Mexico, and were moving north at 12 mph.
The storm would lose its strength by meeting the colder waters of the Pacific.
Thus, it is expected to reach the Mexican coast in the afternoon or Monday evening, with the force of a tropical storm.
In some parts of Mexico, heavy rainfall is likely to cause flooding.
Weather.com reported that from Lower California to the northwestern Sonora, there may be 3-6 to even 10 inches of rain.
Роза will travel north through Mexico in the form of a tropical storm, turning into a tropical depression until Tuesday morning, when it reaches the Arizona border, and heading south from Arizona to Utah on Tuesday evening.
The main threat from Rosa is heavy rainfall in the low-lying areas of California, northwestern Sonora and the southwestern United States, reports the National Hurricane Center.
These rains are expected to pose a safety hazard, such as sudden flooding, debris flows in the desert, and landslides in mountainous terrain.
Attack on Midsomer Norton: Four people arrested with intent to kill
After a 16-year-old was found stabbed in Somerset, 3 teenagers and a 20-year-old were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder.
The teenager, wounded, was found in the Eccelssior-Terrass area near Midsomer Norton around 04:00 local time on Saturday, summer time.
He was taken to the hospital, where his condition is stable.
Police in Avon and Somerset said that a 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old were arrested overnight in the Redstock district.
Police officers asked everyone who had a note on their cell phones to explain what had happened.
Trump said Kavano was frustrated by the Democratic Party's "violence".
We need to reject the Democratic Party's brutal and dirty tactics, so vote for Judge Kavano,  Trump said in the state of West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavano has been suffering from the "evilness" of the Democratic Party since he ran for office.
Kavano responded to Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally rejecting accusations that she raped Christine Blasie Ford when they were young, several decades ago.
During the hearing, Ford also made a statement.
On Saturday, the President said that the people of the United States saw the extraordinary qualities and bravery of Kavano that day.
Voting for Judge Kavano  was a vote to endorse the most brilliant legal mind of our time, a lawyer who had rendered ideal service in the public service, he told the pro-Western Virginia community.
The president also omitted the Kawano candidacy when he said that it was important for members of the Republican Party to attend the elections.
5 weeks until one of the most important choices in your life.
I am not a partaker of this game. I am telling you this.
That's why I'm fighting for good candidates everywhere.
Trump added that Democrats were opposed to the idea of a "foot-setting mission".
According to a senior aide to the Republican Party leader, Kavano's candidacy for the Senate is not expected to be voted on later than Friday, as we know.
Hundreds of people died in the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami, and the number of victims is increasing
At least 384 people died, most of them by the great waves of the Euphrates, after the earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Saturday, authorities said.
Hundreds of people gathered on the beach of the city of Palú for the celebration on Friday, when waves of up to six metres (18 ft) in height crushed the shore in the dark and destroyed everything in its path.
The tsunami began after a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
When the tsunami threat came, people were still helping their way on the beach and were immediately killed when they did not flee the land,   said Supopo Purvo Nuгроho, a representative of the Indonesian agency that helped with the disaster outcome in Jakarta.
 Tsunami did not come alone, it was followed by cars, trees, houses,   said Nuгроho, adding that before the tsunami hit the shore it had first arrived in the open sea at 800 km/h (497 mph).
He says that some people escaped the tsunami by climbing trees, and that is why they survived.
About 16700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in the city of Palú.
The images of the Emergency Department from the air show most of the destroyed buildings, commercial buildings, bridges and mosques surrounded by water.
The city, which was located on the edge of the coast, was also devastated by the earthquakes on Saturday.
Continuous earthquakes were also felt in the area of 2.4 million inhabitants.
The Indonesian Agency for Assessment and Use of BPPT technology, the energy power generated by the earthquake on Friday, exceeded the bomb's capacity of Hiroshima during World War II by about 200 times.
The city, due to its long, thin bay, was reportedly able to intensify the tsunami even further.
Nugroho identified the damage as "big", and reported that hundreds of homes, hospitals, commercial buildings and hotels were destroyed.
Some victims were found under parts of the buildings that collapsed, 540 people were injured and 29 people went missing, he added.
According to Nuгроho, the damage could be greater at about 300 km (190 mi) north of Paлун, a region called Donggala, located near the center of the earthquake.
According to Nuгроho, the connection with the city of Dongala was completely cut off.
More than 300 000 people live there, the Red Cross reported, and their volunteers and workers were displaced to the affected areas.
It's sad now, but things can get worse", she says.
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticized for not reporting the tsunami attack to Pallu, but officials responded that the waves came along with a warning.
A video posted on social media by witnesses shows a man from the upper floor screaming about the tsunami threat to the people on the street below.
Within minutes, the water wall was engulfed in the shore, sweeping away the cars and buildings.
Reuters agency is not quick to confirm the authenticity of the material.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a power outage, which destroyed the connection around Palú and caused difficulties in coordinating assistance to the authorities.
The authorities reported that they were starting to send military cargo aircraft from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuees were still in need of food and other first-aid items.
The city airport was opened only for emergency assistance, which was closed again until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the evacuation centers in Palo on Sunday.
Indonesian tsunami victims have exceeded 800
This is a very bad thing.
From Dongało, World Vision employees reported that they passed by the empty paintings before their office in Palula reached the brass ramps inside the gate.
"They told me that they saw many ruins of houses.
That's bad.
Even after the start of the relief process during the disaster, support groups were concerned that foreign workers, some of whom had extensive experience, were not allowed to enter the territory of the Palau.
According to Indonesian rules, foreign financial, food, and personnel assistance can only be obtained when a disaster is declared at the national level.
Such a proclamation had not yet been made.
Auliya Arриаni is a representative of the Indonesian Red Cross.
As soon as the government declares the disaster at national level, we can seek international assistance, but such a status is not available
On Friday night, the night after the earthquake and tsunami, friends and loved ones of the missing were convinced that they would be miraculously found during a natural disaster.
On Saturday, the little boy was released from the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who had been buried under the rubble and had been lying with her mother's dead body for two days.
Gendon Subandino, coach of the Indonesian national team for paraplanerism, trained two missing paraplaners for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others who had been lured into the hotel of Роа-Роа were also Mr. Mandagi, his pupils.
As the oldest paraplaner, I have an emotional burden of my own", she says.
Mr. Gendon told him that after it became known among the paraplanetist organization that the hotel Roa-Roa had been destroyed, he sent a few hours of text messages via WhatsApp to the participants of the beach festival competition in Palua.
But his SMS letters were marked with only one gray mark, not two skies.
I think the SMS didn't get there,  says.
Bankmatan bulls in the NeNewport entertainment complex at the dam 26 750$
The Newport Police Department reported that on Friday morning, when the burglars were filling up the money at the Newport ATM in Dumbarton, they stole $26,750.
The employee had been planning to take money from the ATM at the entertainment complex and take it to the next location, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a press release.
But while he was still unloading, a man ran behind the bank clerk and stole the purse, which was meant to be carried, along with the money.
Witnesses saw a suspect who fled the scene, but the police did not record the exact number of criminals involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about the criminals is invited to contact the Newport Police by cell phone at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
He tweeted about this on Saturday, writing: "The creature known as Kанье Wэст".
The 41-year-old rapper was known for some time under the alias of Ye, even his eighth album, released in June, was called Ye.
These changes were due to Kanye's appearance on Saturday Night Live, which is where his new album Yandhi is expected to be released.
According to the show's host, she will take the place of singer Ariana Grande, who had declined for эмоциональных reasons.
Although this is an abbreviation of his current professional name, the word has religious significance for West.
I think the most common word in the Bible, Ye, means hin, was the name of the album that West heard earlier that year when he spoke to radio host Big Boy.
So I am you, I am us, this is us.
He moved from Kanje, which means one, to the name that includes all our good, all our confusion, in all - that simple Ye, that is, һиңә.
Who we are is reflected in the album.
He is one of the most famous, renamed rappers.
Sean Combs was known at various times as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he had given preference to the names Love and Brother Love.
Western collaborationist JAY-Z also used different lines or without lines, or capital letters to write his name.
Mexican leader pledges not to use military forces against civilians
The elected president of Mexico, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, pledged not to use military force against ordinary citizens, which coincided with the 50th anniversary of the bloody executions of students.
On Saturday, López Obrador pledged at the Three Cultures Square (Tlatelolco Plaza) that he would never use military force against the oppression of the Mexican people.
On October 2, 1968, during a peaceful demonstration on the square, military forces opened fire on students and killed about 300 people, a movement that was typical of Latin America at the time.
Lopez Obrador promised to support young Mexicans, to give monthly subsidies to their students, and to open more public universities that taught for free.
He said that youths were drawn to criminal organizations because of unemployment and lack of opportunities to study.
US to double its funding of artificial intelligence
After China becomes heavily active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the funding of research in this direction, says investor and AI expert at Google, Microsoft and Apple, Kai-Fu Li.
Such comments began after separate parts of the U.S. government reported on AI, despite the fact that the U.S. also lacked a formal strategy for developing AI.
Meanwhile, China has shown its second year plan: it aims to take the 1st place in innovation by 2030.
Given that the rest of the world is far behind the US, it would be good to double the research budget for AI, and we look for further discoveries in AI,  said Lee.
The doubling of financial support will also increase the chances of employment in the next major discovery in the U.S. for the next major innovation", Lee said in an interview with CNBC.
His book Superдержавы: China, the Silicon Valley and the New World Order was published this month by Hawton Mifflin Harcourt, who is also the CEO of Li Sinovation Ventures, which invests in China's most famous Face++S.
In the 1980s, he worked on AI systems at Carnegie Mellon University, which set the highest records in American Otello games, and later became the executive director of Microsoft Research and president of the China branch of Google.
Lee knew of previous U.S. technological competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge on robotics, and asked when the second race would be held to help find the next leader.
Lee said that U.S. researchers had to work hard to get government grants.
Academic leaders are not taken by China, but by corporations,  says Li.
Recently, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired the brightest minds from universities to work on AI.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy would also help strengthen the U.S. position in the field of AI.
I think that green cards should be automatically presented to PhD students in the field of AI,  he says.
In July 2017, the Chinese government Council presented its second-generation development plan for AI.
Like the National Science Foundation and other government organizations that distributed funds to American researchers, the National Science Foundation of China provides financial support to people in academic institutions, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Li said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a joint AI center that includes partners in industry and science, and the White House announced the creation of a special committee on AI.
And this month, DARPA announced that it has invested $2 billion for an initiative called AI Next.
As for NSF, it currently invests more than 100 million in research in the field of AI.
He did not show any work for several months after he wanted to form a commission.
Macedonians voted in a referendum to determine whether they should change the name of their countries
Macedonians voted in a referendum on Sunday to decide whether their country should change its name to the Republic of North Macedonia, which would help resolve a decade-long dispute with Greece that would not allow Macedonia to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece considered that its northern neighbors could claim their lands because of Macedonia, a province called Macedonia, and opposed their accession to the EU and NATO.
In June, the two governments signed an agreement based on a new name proposal, but nationalist opponents believed that the changes would have a terrible impact on the ethnic consciousness of the Macedonian people, most of whom were Slavic.
After President Georgy Ivanov announced that he would not vote in the referendum, he expressed doubts that the number of voters who would attend the boycott campaign would be 50 percent, so that the referendum could become a reality.
The newsletter also asked: "Are you willing to accept the agreement with Greece and join NATO and the EU?"
Supporters of the name change, as well as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, considered the change in the name of the state to be a simple price that would allow for accession to the EU and NATO and would be possible to pay to Macedonia, which emerged from the breakup of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote for the future of my country, for the youth of Macedonia to live a free life under the wing of the European Union, because it promises a safe life to all of us", said 79-year-old Olivera Georgievski of the city of Skopje.
Although the referendum does not necessarily have legal force, most parliamentarians say that the results of the elections are decided with the eye on.
Two thirds of the parliamentary vote is needed to change the name.
The government election commission said that no violations were observed until 1 a.m.
However, the turnout was only 16 percent, as stated in the last parliamentary elections of 2016, 66 percent of voters registered and 34 voted.
I'm here to vote for my children because we have a place in Europe", said 62-year-old Yoze Taневsky of the city of Skopje.
Prime Minister of Macedonia Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Duško voted in a referendum on renaming Macedonia, which gave them the opportunity to join NATO and the European Union, in Strumitsa, Macedonia, 30 September 2018.
Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was walking in front of the Parliament building, preparing a small stage, chairs for the boycott organizers at the referendum.
We are on the side of NATO and the EU, but we want to be on the same level, with our heads up", Kavadarkov said.
 Our country is poor, but we have a good conscience.
If they don't want us to be Macedonia, we can be part of the Eurasian integration by appealing to other countries, such as China and Russia.
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO membership would bring the necessary investments to Macedonia, which has a 20% unemployment rate.
I am sure most will agree, because 80% of our people support joining the EU and NATO,  said Zaev after the vote.
He says that the result of the y confirms our y future.
When the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research conducted a poll last Monday, it showed that 30-43% of voters voted for the referendum, which is less than the required number.
In a poll conducted by Macedonian TV channel Telma TV, 57% of voters indicated that they were going to vote on Sunday.
70% of them said they voted for эйе.
To successfully hold a referendum, the number of voters must be 50 percent and one vote plus.
The failure of the referendum would have been the first serious test for the Western-leaning government since coming to power in May last year.
See: Manchester City's Serchio Aguero, who wanted to score, passed through all of Brighton's defenses
Serhio Aguero and Rahim Sterling headed to Brighton's reserve zone, Manchester City with a 2-0 win over England on Saturday at the Этихад stadium in Manchester.
In 65 minutes, Aguero performed his maneuvers very lightly.
The Argentine striker took the pass in the middle of the field at the start of the series.
Before he could get out of the open, he ran past three of Brighton's guards.
Then four green robes surrounded Aguero.
He passed one of the guards and overtook several others at the edge of the Brighton stables.
He then found Sturling and passed him to the bare side.
Using the English forwarder's penalty for one touch, he returned the ball to Aguero, who used his right-handed boot to kill the defending player, and hit the right side of the set and scored a goal against Matthew Ryan.
According to Manchester City football club coach Pep Gвардиo, the Aguero footballer is currently suffering from foot pain.
We had talked about his arrival in the game for about 55 to 60 minutes.
He went and did so.
The goal scored by the footballer was a great joy for us.
But, in particular, the team Sky Bluz took the lead in the Premier League clash due to the Sterling footballer.
The goal was scored in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball at the bottom of the territory of the Brighton team.
And then, later, Leroy sent a very good pass to the Sané footballer from the side flank.
Before taking Sterling to a remote station, Sane devised a skillful method.
The forward of the Skai Bluz team sent the ball to the goal of the opposing team before leaving the football field.
The next group match of the Hoffenheim teams of the Champions League against Manchester City will be played on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. in Zinsheim, Germany, at the Rhein-Nekkar-Arena.
Sherzer wants to play against Рокиз
After Washington was eliminated from the playoffs for the Nashville Nets, there was no need for a new team.
But always competitive, Sherzer hopes to beat the Colorado Rockies on Sunday; he has one condition: the Rockies should still have a chance to make the playoffs, which is currently one game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the West Division of New Zealand.
In any case, the Rokizs won the Nэшnls team 5-2 on Friday, and of course they made their title of winner obligatory, but the Hammans also tried to consolidate this victory in the first division.
I'm sure I'll be able to experience the atmosphere of Denver with football fans and other teams, even though we played for nothing, and maybe I'll be able to experience the game at the highest level this year.
What is the reason for not sharing?
Despite the fact that the Nationals announced the team's roster for Sunday's game, they decided to allow Sherzer to participate in the game.
Sherzer, who will be the 34th in the new lineup, will leave the reserve game table on Thursday and return to the field on Sunday as usual.
This season, the team posted a 18-7 throw, 2.53-topping passing percentage and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings.
Anti-Trump rally in the West Virginia Mountains
Speaking about the importance of the Republican Party's participation in the upcoming elections, the President also omitted the Supreme Court's nominating judge, Brett Kavano.
Everything that is done in our name could be put at risk in November.
We are just 5 weeks away from one of the most important choices of our lives.
This is a very important event - I am not going to vote, but I should try not to give it away - so I am actively fighting for worthy candidates.
And Trump continues: "You can see how evil the radical party Democrats are.
They are determined to use whatever means they can to regain power - both fraudulent and wasteful.
They don't think they're hurting people at all - because they don't care - they only have power and control in their minds, but we won't give them that.
The president said the Democrats were carrying out a mission of resistance and deterrence.
This is what you've been saying for the last 4 days Trump and the Democrats are bad, dangerous, scary and unreliable people.
With these words, he addressed the Senate Judiciary Committee, and cited Democrat Senator Дайэнн Файнстайн, which caused a stir in the public.
Do you remember his answer?
Did you leak the document?
What, what.
No, no, I was just waiting for something-- a very awkward hand gesture - something I had never seen so bad.
The Labour Party no longer accepted the proposal.
Those who like to express their opinions are not tolerated there
I was never surprised that activists of my political organization were opposed to me.
Finally, among those who were not happy to be honest about what we were thinking, I was the last member of the Labour Party parliament.
My colleague, Joan Ryan, was treated in a similar way for her resolute opposition to anti-Semitism.
In my case, the decision to declare disbelief was critical of my disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
As fate would have it, Jeremy had similar disagreements with previous party leaders about the importance of economic policy and national security in Europe.
We want our meetings to be open and effective for all The Labour of East Nottingham's meeting to be held on Friday was announced in a statement.
This is exactly what happened at the General Conferences held on Fridays after I had been a member of the Labour Party parliament for almost 8 years.
Unfortunately, today's congregations are not in a good mood, and the policy of white hopes has long been forgotten, even difficult to remember when it was.
It became increasingly clear that the Party of Labour was not tolerant of different views, that everyone's opinion was only evaluated in the conditions that were favorable to the Party.
This started when Jeremy was the leader of the party, because people who worked with me (who I think had similar political views) were expecting me to make drastic changes, some of which I disagreed with - whether it was national security or the single market of the European Union.
Every time I speak to the public - it doesn't matter what I say - then on social media I get ridiculed for allowing elections, for examining politics, even for not being a member of the Labour Party.
Again, this is not my only experience.
In fact, some of my colleagues were not particularly good at this, since most of the comments I received were political, so I know my folly.
I pride myself on my very professional and courageous colleagues who never give up, day by day enduring the same insults.
One of the most dissatisfying aspects of this political measure was the normalization of such extreme cruelty.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn spoke about the need to develop a culture of tolerance in the Labour Party.
In fact, our party did not open its doors to everyone else - it always broke up whenever it expressed disapproval or spoke about changing the electoral system.
Over the past two years, I've been told by many people that if I keep my mouth shut, nobody will touch you.
But I did not come to politics for her.
I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a schoolboy, and I was motivated by the contemptuous government of Thatcher - which almost destroyed my classroom in the general education school I was attending; I tried to provide and preserve quality public services to all kinds of people - whether it was a local people's councillor or a government minister.
I never hid my past politics.
No one in East Nottingham has yet been involved in my political disagreements with the current government.
I have only one word for the leader of the meeting on Friday - when the whole country opposes Brexit (the UK's withdrawal from the European Union), I am not forced to waste my time and energy and loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party, because it is clear that Brexit will cause great damage to the domestic economy, to various organizations and to public employees.
But I want to say my only true word, not to the Momentum of Nottingham, but to my constituents, whether there are Labourers or not: It is a great honour for me to serve you, and I promise you - I will not be harmed by the cancellation of elections, by the emphasis on political unprincipledness, nothing, the importance of protecting your interests.
Words by Chris Leslie, Member of Parliament for Nottingham East
Er United 38:17 wins Mellroуз: Invincible Er team rises to the top of the standings
Perhaps the last two attempts will change the final result slightly, but there is no doubt that the team of Эр will win the main triumph in the Tenant Premier League after today's impressive match.
Now they are at the top of the standings, a team that has never lost among ten competitors.
At the end of the game they showed remarkable defense and, as a result, took control of the football field, so coach Peter Murtchi had every right to agree.
"We may have to go through such difficult games, but we don't give up, so how can we not be happy", says the coach.
We repeat the words of the player of the Mellroуз team, Robin Kristi: Congratulations to Mr. United, who played this game better than us.
The 14-minute attempt by Grant Anderson to score was continued by Frayzer Climo, which allowed the Эрs to advance, but a yellow card was issued to Roori Hughes, a player for the Уорриорз team of the Scottish team - allowing the Мелроузs to draw the score and Jason Baggot to finish the attempt.
Initially, Klimo led the Ers forward with a penalty, and just before the break, he introduced the ball and then just after the rain, the score was 17:5 in favor of the Er team.
However, the team of Mellroуз successfully started the second half of the game and the attempt of Patrick Anderson was realized by Baggot, who narrowed the difference to 5 points.
Later, due to a serious injury to Rуари Nott, the tenure was short-lived - the player had to be dismissed from the match; when the game resumed, Stafford McDowell and the climbing climb of the climb led the team further forward.
The team captain, Blair MacPherson, was issued a yellow card and Melroуз refused to let another player take the ball because of Bruce Colvin, who was under more intense pressure at the end of the game.
However, the owners of the field returned, but Struan was given a yellow card for taking the ball from the line of the penalty area at Climon, while MacPherson was left behind by Er's players.
Just like at the beginning of the period, Klimo sent a penalty and after Kyle Row caught David Armstrong's ball, he passed the attacking player Greg Henry and took the fifth round on the owner's side.
Someone's game star ends up starting his career in the restaurant industry
It was revealed that the star of the game, Ford Kirnan, was considering a move to the hospitality industry after being appointed head of a licensed restaurant company.
Ford, 56, played and wrote the screenplay for the BBC Channel, a popular sequence with his former collaborator Gregory Hempfill, playing Jack Jarvis.
Together they announced that the ninth edition of the series would be the last, and it was noted that Kirnan had planned his fate after Craiglang.
According to official statements, he is currently the head of Адрифтморн Лимитед company.
The actor declined to answer questions about this, but a Scotics newspaper source  indicated Kirnan's desire to participate in the buzzing restaurant trade of Glasgow.
The sea is ours: Bolivia, which has no way out of the Pacific, hopes to reopen the way for the trial
The Marines are currently patrolling the naval headquarters in La Pas.
The blue flag of the sea waved in public buildings.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon River, the naval bases even have their own base: The sea is considered to be ours by law.
It is our primary duty to bring it back.
In Bolivia, where there was no access to the sea, the entire country remembered the attempt by the hamman to cross the coastline and the Pacific, and in the 19th century, the bloody dispute over resources, the way to the water was transferred to the Republic of Chile.
The International Court of Justice of Bolivia issued a 5 year investigation decision on October 1, which the public has been most optimistic about over the past decade.
"We have a country of motivation, unity and perseverance, so we expect the outcome only with a positive outlook", said Bolivian Ambassador Roberto Calсадилья.
After years of disorderly negotiations, Chile must consider the possibility of a move to an independent sea, a claim that will be upheld by the International Court of Justice in The Hague and hopefully watched by all Bolivians through blue screens.
The situation of Evo Morales, the influential president of Bolivia from the indigenous people, is closely tied to the decision of the court held on Monday, which will see him contested re-election next year.
In August of last year, he swore that he would soon return the Pacific to us.
But while some analysts believe that the court's ruling will not be in Bolivia's favor, much will remain the same.
The United Nations, which is based in the Netherlands, has no right to influence the territory of the Republic of Chile, so it cannot be determined at the next round of negotiations.
Pass Sarate, an international law expert from the Republic of Chile, said: "The fact that the International Court's decision was issued only six months after the last hearings shows that this action was not very difficult.
So the last four years have not been in Bolivia's favor.
Sarate said that the issue of opening the sea was captured by the present-day Bolivian administration.
He thought that President Morales's militant rhetoric had destroyed the last remaining kindness of Chile.
Negotiations between Bolivia and Chile will continue, but it will be very difficult to carry them out after this.
The two countries have not had meetings of the apostles since 1962.
Former Bolivian president and representative in The Hague, Eduardo Rodríguez Velte, rejected the concept of a trial that was not too difficult.
He said that Monday would provide a great opportunity for the people of Bolivia to establish a new relationship with Chile and a mutually beneficial opportunity to end the 139-year-old dispute.
Morales was one of the most prominent presidents of Latin America; in turn, Calсадилья was surprised by the political use of the sea issue.
Bolivia will never give up fighting for the right to open its way to the sea.
The judgment is the opportunity for us to forget past decisions.
North Korea: Don't expect the United States to disarm without confidence
According to North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho, without showing confidence in Washington, the Korean people would never give up nuclear weapons.
The minister made his remarks at the General Assembly of the United Nations on Sunday.
And the United States asked to keep its promises made at the summit in Singapore.
The comments of the minister surprised America, which seemed ready to resume the unflagging nuclear diplomacy of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, after a meeting with North Korean Chairman Kim Jong-un in Singapore three months ago.
Because of the ongoing sanctions on the part of the United States and the disagreement over the demands for an end to the Korean War, the imposition of North Korea would remain a mere dream.
Pyongyang avoided a deal with the Washington Declaration without taking the first important disarmament steps.
Both Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump expressed a desire to hold a second summit.
But it is not easy to believe that Korea will soon abandon its weapons, because it is the only guarantee of security for the country.
To prepare for a summit for Kim and Trump, Pompeo made a plan to travel to Pyongyang in the following month.
The latest collection of the massive headwear presented at the fashion show in Paris went to the shops in the central street of your city
If you look at a new headgear or like to completely cover yourself with the sun - you may not be looking anymore.
Designers Valentino and Tom Braun presented a line of fancy headscarves that surprised the audience with their SS19 collection on the podium and surprised members of the Paris Fashion Week.
This summer, uncomfortable hats filled the entire Instagram network and the designers sent these dangerous creations along the podium.
Valentino's hat was a light brown, with large wings covering the heads of the models.
Other major accessories included a carrot, pineapple, and a wizard's hat - but they won't keep you warm.
Tom Brown showed in his wise masks that it would be Halloween.
The masks of different colors were even sewn together - in horror films, the term "high fashion" was not used.
One was a tool for swimming underwater, with a spoon and a spoon; the other was like a melting pot of ice.
If you're looking for high fashion, it's time to celebrate.
People who know are going to be screaming - soon these infinite hats will be very close to your home.
Large-scale hats replicated the collection La Bomb - woven from straw, with almost a meter of items on the bar - from the singer Riana to the model Emily Ratakovski.
The popularity of the hat, which was caused by the uncomfortable wearing of hats, spread quickly on social media; they were followed by a large number of people.
The pink yellow muzzle made of burnt rafi cloth, with a black and white leather strap sewn from rafi on the edges - the Jacema La Riviera SS19 collection - was a prominent element of the Paris Fashion Week.
About this, noted stylist Luke Armitage said: "I look forward to seeing hats with large bags in stores next summer, because designers have made a significant impact, and sellers will feel a strong demand for older items.
John Edward, head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools: Language education is a must for all citizens of the world
Scottish independent schools have been very supportive of academic achievements, so that the results of the exams for single and group students in sports, culture, music and other public initiatives have yielded excellent results in 2018.
The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) has over 30,000 students across Scotland who are committed to providing the best possible service to their pupils and parents.
The main problem of independent schools is to prepare their students for future higher education, career choice and to find their place in the world.
As an education system that has developed and implemented its program individually, we are building on the fact that modern language classes are very popular and necessary.
Nelson Mandela, former president of South Africa, said, "If you talk to someone who has learned a language, you are talking to their brain.
If you speak in a language other than English, you are speaking in the heart of the speaker.
These words remind us that we cannot rely solely on English to build strong relationships and trust with people from other lands.
According to the results of this year's exams in independent schools, language studies are at the top of the list.
Among students who studied foreign languages, 68 percent of them received the best score.
According to the data collected, among 74 such schools, 72 percent of the students spoke Chinese, 72 percent spoke German, 69 percent spoke French and 63 percent spoke Spanish at the best of their ability.
Independent schools in Scotland have confirmed that learning foreign languages is a necessary skill for children in the future.
Language learning in the programs of independent schools and elsewhere is also frequently chosen among other subjects (science, craftsmanship, engineering and mathematics).
A 2014 opinion poll by the Employment and Training Group in the UK showed that 17% of jobs were vacant due to the lack of language-savvy workers.
Therefore, knowledge of other languages becomes increasingly important, as it is a key issue for young people to get a good job.
As the need for linguists in jobs with great prospects increases, foreign language speakers are essential in a globalized world.
No matter what profession a person chooses, learning a second language will always be a real advantage for him.
A person who can communicate directly with a foreigner will automatically be ahead of others.
In a 2013 survey by YouGov, over 4,000 adults in the UK reported that 75% of them could not communicate in a foreign language and only spoke French, and that 10% had passed - a figure that was 15%.
That is why emphasis on language learning is so important for today's children.
For a person who speaks several languages, especially in developing countries, it will always be more convenient to get a full-fledged job.
In Scotland, each school will teach in a different language.
Some schools will focus on classical modern languages, while others will focus on what is considered to be most important for the UK in 2020, such as Chinese and Japanese.
Regardless of what your child is interested in, independent schools will always have teachers who teach these subjects in several languages.
Scottish schools set out to create an educational environment that would prepare children for the various challenges ahead and teach them to fight for success.
Today, the importance of languages for the future of the country plays a key role in the global business environment, and this situation should be reflected in education.
Otherwise, modern languages should be considered as a practice of international communication.
Independent schools will offer the young people of Scotland the opportunity, diversity and high quality of this education.
Il faut bien le faire. (French) - You have to do everything right.
The head of the Independent Schools Council of Scotland, John Edward.
In San Diego, LeBron will make his first debut with the Laykers
Fans who are expecting James Lebron will soon see him in the squad of the Los Angeles Lakers.
According to Luke Walton, coach of the Lakers, James will face Denver Naggets in the preseason opener in San Diego next Sunday.
However, it is not yet known exactly how many minutes he will play.
On the team's official website, Walton's words were recorded for more than a minute, but less than 48 minutes.
Laykers reporter Mike Trudel tweeted that Probably they will give James little time to play 
After training earlier this week, James told his brother about his plans for the upcoming three preseason games.
"I don't need to play pre-season at this stage of my career", he said.
YouTube censorship: time for Trump's rallies in West Virginia
Today evening, President Donald Trump is starting a series of rallies in the city of Willing, West Virginia, ahead of last year's election.
This was one of five planned rallies, including in quiet places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
When the evidence in the Supreme Court was delayed in the presidential election, Trump sought to get help from the upcoming midterm elections, as the Republicans were determined to lose leadership in Congress if they delayed the election to November.
When and how can Trump's rallies in West Virginia be viewed on social media?
The rally was scheduled for 7 p.m. on Saturday, September 29, 2018, at Iti Tunayt channel.
You will also be able to watch Trump's rally in West Virginia live on the iotope via the link below.
Perhaps the president was forced to appeal to the Supreme Court's former Britta Kavano because of allegations of sexual assault; this caused the Senate to delay the election for the next sentence, which was still under investigation by the FBI, by a week.
But the main issue of these rallies was to help the Republicans with some developmental direction who had to face the challenges associated with the November elections.
Thus, the five rallies for Trump's campaign next week are meant to activate volunteers and defenders, as Republicans try to grow and protect their party with people in the House of Representatives and Senate, according to the Reuters channel.
A Trump campaign spokesman, who declined to name himself, told Reuters: "The president has the leadership of Congress so important that she's ready to go all over the states, and we'll be preparing for the campaign season".
According to West Virginia Metro News, a rally at the VэсBankco Arena in Willing today could include supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and media from Pittsburgh.
Trump, who planned to arrive on Saturday, will be second in the past month to West Virginia, a state he won more than 40% of the vote in 2016.
Trump was forced to help Senator Patrick Morrisy from West Virginia, who had been a Republican candidate in the Republican primary.
For Morrissey, it's no longer a good idea for the president to have to put you on trial, said Simon Hader, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
Ryder Cup 2018: United States national team prepared to fight for their hopes in Sunday's singles
After three one-door games in all, the fourth round of golf competition on Saturday was significant for the Ryder Cup.
Such a variation of the design is entirely conceived in sport, but especially in such competitions, it is a true belief among athletes.
Where is that uplifting direction now?
One day's golfer Jordan Spit said: "They were six points ahead, but now they're only four, so we're not giving up because of the upward trend".
In Albitta, the European side had a lead of 4 points, 12 points in all games.
According to Spit, the Americans were excited and excited at the time, as they were able to boast, for example, that Spit and Thomas played together with three out of four points.
From start to finish, Spit was a brave key player.
Every time he hit a decisive field, the sound of the feasting in the field was heard, because Thomas had to fight for the two points he had lost.
His goal was sent to the 15-day game with the same loud voices on the field, and his earnest desire for victory showed his faith in the American team.
"The rest of us need to think more deeply and care about our matches now", said Spit.
The players had only one thing left to worry about.
Only 18 points are short of making a mark in history.
The two most historic players of the past two days of the Ryder Cup, Franчесko Molinari and Tommy Flitwood, led only Spit and Thomas by a few points.
These two varied but well-known golfers in Europe have four of four possible points, so they should all be good.
Franчесko and Tommi did not play a single booggy (the number of hits that would have to be done in a single shed) in either Friday night, Saturday afternoon, or early morning games.
If Molinari and Fleetwood Le Golfe were to emerge as the winners of all Europe on Sunday at the National Field, there would be no more definite golfers than they, because they have such a strong influence in the players, in themselves.
As expected, two players won two separate sheds.
But it's still too early to say anything about the whole of Europe, buddy.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly beat out the hero Serchio Garcia by four balls in the morning game, and he, in turn, played in a pair with Alex Noren.
Spanish Garsio and Swedish Noren were left behind due to a double-double hit with one boggy (two times the amount of punch needed to work in one shed).
It is the first day of the week, so no one can help you.
It's even more interesting to watch the four golfers: how they interact, what advice they give, which they follow and which they don't, and how the game's ability changes in the blink of an eye.
The fact that the European team did much better than that was obvious, for example, by advancing abruptly in the final game, but these four games proved that America had the courage to fight, even if the states had less confidence in it.
Europe reaches the final of the Ryder Cup with a score of 10: 6
After the four-player match on Saturday, Europe outscored America 10-6, which was already a major advantage for them in the final game of the Ryder Cup.
The winning duo Franчесko Molinari and Tommy Flitwood beat Tiger Woods on the field at Lé Golf National, bringing the previous record to four points.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who was about to take first place, beat the American team in the series 3-1 in a game this morning after being left behind two years ago at the Hezeлтаine Golf Club.
Although they won two games in the States without losing, they were not outnumbered.
Jim Furic's team needed a total of eight points in 12 singles games on Sunday to leave the trophy.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, Flitwood was the first European starting golfer to score four consecutive points, while he and Molinari were nicknamed Моливуд after surprisingly long breaks) - only the second duo to score a double in the first four games.
After leaving Woods and Patrick Reid behind, they also boldly defeated American starter Bryson DeShambo, 5:4.
Woods, who played two games on Saturday, had some brilliant moments in his interim playing, but lost 19 of his 29 matches between four men.
After four games in the morning, Justin Rose, who had been less rested, returned to his partner, Henrik Stenson, and defeated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who had won first and third place in the World Series, 2:1.
Although the southwest side of Paris was dry and clear, the European team did not fare very well.
Triple-A winners Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas set a control mark for America on Saturday by scoring two points.
They defeated the Spaniards John Ram and Jan Poulter by a scoreline of 2:1 and later came back to beat Paulter and Rory Maquilroy in four straight games by a score of 4:3.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, the team has only returned two times in singles without scoring four points, and Furic's team would have had enough to keep the trophy.
If they came in second for two days, it seemed that the Sunday counterattack would be unsuccessful.
North Korea has reported that there has never been a unilateral disarmament without confidence.
On Saturday, North Korea's foreign minister said that the continued US sanctions on the United Nations only increased the confidence of the two countries, so it is unlikely that nuclear disarmament will be discussed in these circumstances.
At the annual World Organization General Assembly, Minister Ri Yong Ho acknowledged that North Korea had made important commitments last year: it had completed nuclear and missile tests, decommissioned nuclear sites and pledged not to disseminate nuclear weapons technologies.
But we did not see an equivalent response from the United States  the minister said.
"Without any confidence in the United States, we will not have national security, and under these conditions we cannot unilaterally disarm".
While the appeals of the minister of the Interior to Washington's lack of response to the gradual changes in North Korea seemed familiar, his petitions were felt to be correct, as last year Pyongyang had been completely against arms control by one country.
In his message, Ri recalled the agreement between President Donald Trump and leader Kim Jong-un at their first joint summit in Singapore on June 12. The leaders of the two countries had promised each other: Korea would begin disarmament efforts, and America, in turn, would make guarantees of their security mandatory.
North Korea officially ended the 1950-53 Korean War, but it expected the United States to initially give up nuclear weapons entirely from Pyongyang.
Washington, in turn, sought to ease the stringent international sanctions on Korea.
America insisted on first disarmament and therefore even opposed the refusal to declare an end to the war, under pressure from its sanctions, says Ri.
Sanktions are people who have made us dream about getting down on our knees, they don't know our country at all.
It is true that the sanctions that do not endure only make our unbelief worse.
Ri did not comment on the plans for a summit between the leaders of the two countries that would commemorate the American president at the United Nations.
Instead, the minister noted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months: "If South Korea had been on the side of the US instead of the US, we would not have been in a difficult situation to move forward or backwards".
Thus, the mood of the speech of Minister Ri to the Organization was much more different than last year, and the General Assembly affirmed that North Korea could not avoid launching missiles into America because President Trump had previously called leader Kim the man of the racket.
This year, at the United Nations, the American president, who last year threatened to destroy North Korea  completely, praised leader Kim for taking steps to abandon the weapons, but said that sanctions would remain in place without North Korea's centralization, so many things to do must be done first.
On Wednesday, Trump declared that there was no time limit for this at all: "Whether you spend two years, three years or five months on this question, it doesn't matter".
China and Russia spoke to the UN Security Advisor about the need to reward Pyongyang for its actions.
Thus, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo from America told his United Nations Security Advisor on Thursday that the Security Council's "continuing enforcement of sanctions must continue without interruption, while the work on the sanctions is not fully and completely completed".
The Security Council unanimously reinforced sanctions against North Korea beginning in 2006, thus attempting to cut off Phyongyang's funding of its missile and nuclear programs.
He met with Pompeo Ri, a former member of the United Nations General Assembly, and discussed plans to return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not go well.
And in July, he returned from Pyongyang and confirmed that there were good results, but only hours later, North Korea accused the politician of dangerous claims.
At a meeting this month, North Korea promised Moon that it would launch a joint venture on missile and nuclear affairs unless the U.S. states took appropriate action.
According to him, for Kim, these "comprehensive measures" were only a mandatory security guarantee in Singapore by Trump, and were designed to facilitate good communication with Washington.
Lessons for Harvard students to relax
A new class at Harvard University forced all of the students of the latter class to sleep more - a move that was against the culture of overnight caffeine among students.
Among the educated students of the world's leading universities, there are those who do not even know about self-care.
Charles Цейsler, a professor at Harvard Medical School, a professor at Brigham Young University and the Women's Hospital, developed a special course and said it was a unique course in America.
After talking about how sleep deprivation affects reading, she was inspired to start this work.
After the lecture, a girl came to the professor and asked, "Why am I hearing about this only recently, in my last year?"
According to the student, the professor was very surprised that no one told him about the importance of sleeping", writes the journal Telegraph.
This year's first-ever course explains how sleep helps students in reading, sports, and general well-being.
According to Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health service, the university decided to include this course in the program after learning how students could not sleep during the week.
The hour-long class features a lot of interesting, interactive topics.
For example, in a painting of a bedroom, students sit on coffee cups and explain the importance of caffeine, sleeping on the bed, and sleeping well, even teaching them what to do before bed.
Students then learned about the causes of insomnia, heart attacks, depression, and even cancer.
The school's landscape with various interactive signs, the classroom gives viewers a thought about how they should spend their day.
We know that students' behavior cannot be changed right now.
But they should have the right to know about it - just like you have the right to know about the harm of tobacco, added Professor Цейслер.
According to him, the culture of preparing for the nightly tests is in flux, especially modern technologies and the growing difficulty of reading - sleeplessness - is an adult problem.
Convincing students of the importance of adequate sleep would be a secret weapon against stress, fatigue and overcoming, even avoiding the problem of obesity - because if you sleep less, your brain asks for more food.
19-year-old California native Raymond So, who studied chemistry and physical biology; after he began taking this derby in his first class last year, helped Professor Цейsler organize the class better.
He said that he liked the lesson so much that he even wanted to do a general education lesson.
His hope, the next step, was to ask the graduate students to complete this course before being placed in other educational institutions.
Professor Цейsler advised students to set alarm clocks for bedtime and wake time, and also to not forget about the harmful effects of blue screens and light-diode lamps.
Livingston 1:0 Rangers: The goal of the Menga is to beat the Gerrard
In the move, the Rangers suffered another defeat, losing to the Menga team to Steven Jerrard by a score of 1:0.
4:1 Ibroxa's team was confident of its first win in the move game after a triumphal victory over St. John's in February, but Gary Holtan's team led to a second defeat for coach Gerrard in 18 games, leaving his team 8 points behind and outscoring Premier League leader Landbrocker Hartz.
With 7 minutes left in the break, Menga scored, one of the Marys did not satisfy the Reйнджерс team.
When Reingers fell to sixth place, Livingston climbed to third place and only missed Hibbernian by one ball.
Other than that, the rangers could face new discomfort when the lineman (judge on the outside line) Kaлум Spens had to be treated after something hit him from the bottom.
After defeating his team in the semi-final of the Bettfried Cup, Gerrard produced eight touchdowns in the team.
On the other hand, a week before, a fellow Hartsman named Holt had been competing against 11 other Linwingstonian teams and had been getting ready to take them one step at a time.
Maybe the Rangers were the top team, but the team did better with the ball.
They were supposed to have entered the game in two minutes when Mengi took Scott Pittman out of the game for Allan McGregg's exit through the gate, but the halfback took advantage of his great opportunity.
Keegan was hit deeply by a penalty kick from Jacobs' captain Craig Halket, but his defensive partner, Alan Litgow, was hit with the back bench.
He got his observations in the Rangers's story, but in their third part there was more hope than confidence.
The 15-minute introduction was felt by Alfredo Morelos when he was hit by Stephen Lowlesss, but the judge Stephen Tomson declined the Colombian's statement.
In the first half, Reingers scored twice in the goal, but the former goalkeeper Ibroкса's Liam Kelly was not disturbed by the ball being kicked by Lassan Kulibali's head and Ovi Ejaрии's hand.
The first match was over in the 34th minute, and it was clear that perhaps no one would refuse, that they had won with money.
Again the Rangers failed to beat the well-trained jacekobs.
When Declan Gallagher gave the ball to Scott Robinson, who chose Menga to finish easily and kept the cold, Scott Arfield ignored it.
During the break, Jérrard decided to replace Kulibali with Oayana Kent, and this replacement had the same effect when the attacker Morelossa took over, but Kelly influenced the countries on his block line.
But Livingston was always inviting visitors to a game they liked: Lytto and Halkett always got the long ball.
Holt's team could have increased the distinction in the final stage, but McGregor was able to hold out strongly to eliminate Jacobs before Litgow could hit the corner.
Glenn Middleton of the Rangers, who had already made the jump, was again late with a penalty in the game, but Tomson was back on the sidelines.
Almanach: The inventor of the Geiger count
The time for the Almanac journal's Morning Sunday was 136 years ago, on September 30, 1882 and, we believe..... the day of the birth of future physicist Johann Wilhelm Gans Geiger in Germany.
Geiger invented a method of protecting and measuring radioactive material and is now known as the Geiger counter.
Since then, he has been a prolific assistant to many sciences, including filmmaking, with scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans in the 1950 film Colorado Bells:
The question is, "What is the purpose of all this in the world?"
Rogers: This thing is called a Geiger counter and helps us find where radioactive minerals lie, such as uranium.
If you listen carefully, you can actually hear the radioactive nature of minerals.
Evans: Look, there's really explosion!
Hans Geiger died in 1945, a few days after turning 63.
But what he had planned was in vain.
The vaccine against cancer teaches people to see the negative side of their immunity
The vaccine against cancer teaches people to see and eliminate bad aspects of their immune system.
This vaccine sees the discovery of bad outcomes as a way to correct them.
Again, this methodology includes removing the abnormalities from the human body and modifying them in laboratories.
He was then able to see and re-introduce the protein found in many common cancer diseases.
The vaccine tested was very effective in patients with various cancers.
One woman with ovarian cancer died 18 months after being vaccinated.
In this method, the vaccine detects defects, removes them from the human body, and then converts them to a laboratory, where it can then detect and reinsert a protein called HER2, which is present in many common cancer diseases.
Jay Berzofsky, a professor at the National Cancer Institute of America in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our new vaccine offers a lot of hope.
According to Professor Berzofsky, HER2 stimulates the growth of several types of cancer, such as lung, genital, lung and esophageal cancer.
A similar attitude helped to cure some types of leukemia.
Kanye West, backing up Trump, made an appearance on Satedey Knight Liv.
But the release did not go very well.
Satedey Knight Liv left Kanye West in disgrace after his release, as he was determined to support Donald Trump, who was elected in 2020.
When he released his third song Гост таун, he wore a Trump-themed headgear, and eventually began to speak out against Democrats and show his animosity to the president.
When I talk to a lot of white people, they ask me, How do you like Trump, when he's a racist?"
If I was so worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago, ", she said.
Satedey Knight Liv began with a parody starring Matt Damon; the Hollywood star was mocked for how Christine Bleici Ford had directed Brett Kavano to the Senate Judiciary Committee on a case of sexual misconduct.
Although West was not shown on blue screens, the comedian Chris Rock posted a few shots on social media.
It is unclear whether this publication was intended to offend the rock singer.
Also, West told the audience behind the scenes how difficult it was for her to wear that hat.
"I was mocked on the stage.
They told him not to wear it.
"I was mocked on the stage!
And they looked at me very, very away, he said to the Washington Examiner.
And West continued, "If you want to see someone who's been excluded, don't look at me, because I'll wear someone's hat if I want to, and I won't ask you what you need to do". Did you want to see the world go forward?
Be more humane.
His words were at least twice received with a loud response from the audience and were stirred up by the actors present, and one witness there told the magazine Вериити: The entire studio was in terrible silence for a very long time.
Kanye West was invited to perform in the role of singer Ariana Grande, as her boyfriend, the famous rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
The singer dressed like a sprite bottle again, and was surprised by the song "I like this".
Tipyuэсэй Conservative leader Kendis Turner tweeted in support of the singer: I speak to the most courageous person: Thank you for standing up to the popular group!
But in a tweet from Tolk show host Karen Hunter, Vэст was left alone and it was so gnarly.
But I will not be a man of my people, to hear his songs, and to buy his garments.
He is a free man.
And we are free as he is.
Before the show, the rapper had written on his Twitter that he was forced to change his name.
He was not the first artist to change his name: the famous star DiDi, as if repeating his other names as Paff Daddie, Paffie and Pi Diddie.
During his time with fellow rapper Sнуп Dog, he was known as Sнуп Layon, and of course, it is known that the artist who left this world changed his name to Prinzta.

Game of Thrones Star of the series Keith Harington: Poison youth
Keith Harington is best known for his heroic leading role in the HBO series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor broke down the heroic tale: according to him, to be respectful of men who often played such roles, it is necessary to show toughness.
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Keith discussed the issue and how to solve it in the days of activism.
Earlier, Keith had married the star of the series, 31-year-old Rosie Leslie - the actor said he was ready to solve the problem.
Now I ask myself, When did we start the problem of men and women?
When this is a problem, how should we raise our own children today?
The actor thought that television should be responsible for the problem.
Then he continued: "Is this from birth or have we learned it?
What is it that is taught on television, outside, so much that young men often face difficulties in becoming young?
I think the most important question right now is how can we change that?
Because it is understandable that young men have gone wrong at one time.
In this interview, Keith expressed his desire not to participate in any of the projects of the upcoming Game of Thrones sequence, as he was very tired of the fighting spectacles.
Beginning in November, Keith will play the lead role in Sam Shepard's film The West, about the producer and his brother-in-law.
The younger actor Keith was right that the most sacred of the "Game of Thrones" sequence turned out to be Rosie.
I met my bride at that time, and from then on, I started my own family.
In the fictional sequence that won the Emmy Award for Best Supporting Actress, Rozi played Keith's favorite character, Igrit.
In June 2018, the couple celebrated their wedding in the Lesley family home in Scotland.
HIV and AIDS: China reports growth of infections increased by 14%
China reported a 14% increase in infection among citizens with HIV and AIDS.
According to health officials, more than 820,000 people are sick in the country.
In the second half of 2018, about 40 000 new cases were reported.
Most new cases of infection are sexually transmitted, as they are a result of past experience.
Traditionally, some parts of China are infected with HIV due to bloodshed.
But the number of people infected in this way is now almost non-existent, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
Thus, in a single year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS increased by 100,000.
Sexually transmitted infections of HIV cases are a major problem of the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was legalized in China in 1997, but is considered to be a very strictly LGBT community.
Due to conservative values in the country, 70-90% of LGBT swings among men are known to have ended in bridesmaids.
In these relationships, the disease is caused by a lack of sexual protection.
To help with this, the Chinese government has promised to increase the number and potential of HIV vaccines since 2003.
Maxine Waters denies that the Republican Party of Senators has been erasing data and has been using zaговор theory and dangerous deception against the United States
On Saturday, House of Representatives member Maxine Waters uncovered allegations that one of them, a representative, had posted personal data of three Republican-American senators on the Internet.
According to the Los Angeles Democrat, these false claims were being flooded with unknown experts and websites.
In his tweet, Waters said that it was "a lie, a lie and a disgusting lie".
The data contained the home addresses and phone numbers of American senators, including Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch of Utah.
The information was released on the Internet on Thursday and the name of the deceased was placed on Capitol Hill during the hearings against Supreme Court candidate Bret Kavano.
The appeal came after three senators asked Kawano.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the source's IP address was linked to Waters's account and that the information was posted by someone working for Waters.
Woters says that there is no true memory of this story.
The personal information and security of a member of my office has been compromised by these false accusations, and he should not be held responsible for them in any way.
Woters says that there is no true memory of this story.
Waters' words immediately began to be made public in the networks, even when former White House press secretary Ari Fлейшер said:
He wrote that he should answer with a very bad language.
This behavior indicates that he could not be a member of Congress.
If an innocent person is charged with any crime, he must not be denied the charge.
He must be quiet.
He should not question the accusers' words.
It must be silent.
As noted, Flejcher compared Waters's confrontation to Kavano, who was tortured by judges at Thursday's hearings for his bad reaction.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate, was forced to place himself in the spot of Waters at the upcoming elections and wrote his thoughts on Twitter:
 If it is true, it is very surprising.
Waters reported that law enforcement authorities had made statements about these untrue statements.
We will find the perpetrators and they will be held accountable by the legal entity, because such actions are more proud for each member.
Agent Johnny English is a spy parody of the movie by Rouenen Atkinson
It's now common practice to find something about Brexit in every film - and it's the same with the ridiculous franchise that's been re-released; the ridiculous boer with Johnny English, which debuted in 2003, re-released in 2011.
Will this ridiculously ridiculous film be a new export opportunity for our country?
However, Johnny English, as subtle as the ball-eyed and rubber-faced Johnny English, was licensed for a second time and was all but Bulgarian - a film, according to the cinematographers, a largely humorous creation, but it was produced for non-English speaking countries.
Of course, he was only more cunning, and his more provocative behavior, his appearance as Mr. Bin and even his voice as a singer at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympics - all proved to be such a unique hero to us.
He was also a character, settled in the image of a traveler and a mysterious man, played by Atkinson in the long-forgotten Barclayard attraction.
The last Johnny English has a few very interesting moments.
I loved the moment Johnny English arrived on the helicopter, dressed in medieval military clothing and the helicopter's air guns were struck several times on his guard.
Everyone knows that Atkinsson was capable of a grumpy comedy, but his level of humor was too weak and overly obvious, as he showed a good sense of humor in modern serious cinema films such as 007 and  impossible mission.
For me, this humor was like adult-oriented children, and Johnny English's seductive behavior was no longer interesting, and Mr. Bean's silent film was even more fun.
The fact that the UK is now in a very bad situation is always an issue.
Kevina was surprised to learn that a small role-dejouring agent for Eldon was being played by a cyber-hacker who had infiltrated a British highly secret agent organization and had begun to reveal the names of other agents.
This was the last straw for the then-prime minister, whose reputation was in a very bad condition: although the actress Emma Thompson was given the role of the fake Theresa May, the script was not so difficult.
His advisers told him that he would have to dismiss some retired agent because he knew the name of every active spy.
And this retired Johnny English - now a teacher at a wealthy school who, though unsuccessful, still teaches a lesson in slumber - was the only episode that seemed a little more humorous to me.
English was soon sent back to Whitehall to organize an emergency, where he rejoined his former assistant Bow, played by Ben Miller.
Bow is now a family man, his bride is like a commander, and this fun role is like Vicki Pepperdini playing for nothing.
Thus, Batman and Robin were reunited, and they got very badly mistaken in the Queen's Secret Service, and met the beautiful Ofelia Bulletova, played by Olga Kurilenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is caught up in the deception of a very charismatic technological billionaire; he convinces the minister that he will eliminate all British computer problems, and this evil Jason Walt is played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bow began their adventure by dressing up as waitresses, lighting fires in a French restaurant, making a real noise by going to the luxurious yacht of Volt, and making headlines with a virtual reality garnish.
I don't remember the rest, but of course, this movie is just for kids.
A very medium-sized film.
And finally, with Johnny English's other films in mind, I ask: Could the British film industry have given such a talented actor, Rowan Atkinson, a role that would have been more appropriate?
The Labour Party refused to draft a plan for four days of work, but paid for five days, made for the British
Jeremy Corbyn of the Labour Party devised a plan for the four days of work for the Bitanes, but paid for five days.
According to reports, the company's executives will have to pay the workers for the fifth day of the month for the money collected due to Artificial Intelligence.
And they shall take three days' rest, and enjoy themselves; but they shall bring home the same money.
According to sources, this view is in line with the party's financial side and the country's plans for working-class relations.
The shift to a four-day workweek was supported by the trade union Congress because it was a direct way for people working to take advantage of the opportunities of a changing economy.
A leading Labour Party source told the Sunday Times: "These political changes are expected to be officially announced by the end of the year.
This will not happen very soon, but a four-day workweek is more appropriate for the party's move towards the right economy and general industrial plans.
The Labour Party was not the first to implement these plans - in 2017 the Green Party made speeches before the general election with a four-day system.
However, this effort was not fully opposed by the Labour Party.
Party spokesperson: Four days of work is not party politics and we can't take care of it now.'
Chancellor John McDonnell held a conference of Labour last week to focus his views on the social transformation of the economy.
According to McDonnell, it was important for him to regain control of directors and speculators.
The Chancellor's plans again meant that the shareholders of the companies could not take their share of the water supply, as the Labour Party could send various results to the government in case of disorder.
He also presented plans to the board of directors of companies to include ordinary workers and to make funds for subsequent ownership, handing over 10% of its capital to private firm employees and giving them dividends of up to 500 fountain per year.
Lindsay Graham and John Kennedy spoke on the political television show "60 Minutes" about the possibility that the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh could change their minds.
The FBI's investigation into the indictment of Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final election of his candidacy for the Supreme Court by at least a week and raised the acute question of whether the bureau's results would lead to confidence in the confidence of Republican senators.
In a speech last Sunday, correspondent Scott Pellley, a Republican senator, spoke with John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham about the possibility that the FBI's investigation could change their minds.
Kennedy was more visible than his South Carolina counterpart.
"Of course", Kennedy said.
I spoke to Judge Kavano, who was scheduled to be present at the hearing.
When I heard about this, I called him and asked him, 'Is this your fault?'
He was very bold, courageous, and one-lined".
However, Graham's voice seemed unchanged.
"I made a decision about Brett Kavano, but it will require a very strong indictment", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett has decided to give up on this", Graham added, referring to Christine Blaysey Ford.
"But he cannot prove his claims to anyone who has come forward.
He was 36 years old.
I don't see any new changes".
What is it, the Global Urbanist Festival, and did it help the poor in any way?
This Saturday, New York City will host the annual musical event - the Global Citizens' Day - which features influential stars who address the most important issue - how to fight poverty.
Now, after 7 years of this event, tens of thousands of people gather at the Senior Grass of Central Park, not only to watch the famous Janet Jackson, Cardi Bee and Sean Mendes's eruptions, but also to eliminate extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Urbanist Day, which was announced in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Project on Fighting Poverty - an international organization that is part of the international interest protection organization and whose main goal is to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people fighting against poverty.
If you are not ready to get a VIP ticket, a person who is a visitor must do various activities to get a free ticket, such as volunteering, sending a letter to a world leader, making a phone call and other effective measures to raise this problem.
But has the festival produced any fruitage in the past 12 years?
Is the idea of giving a free concert the right way to convince real people, or is it just a matter of signing online petitions and believing that different posts will bring real benefits?
Since 2011, the Global Urbanist Festival has recorded more than 19 million relief cases and has been a controversial event for various purposes.
According to reports, these goals have forced world leaders and politicians to work worth more than $37 million, and these finances are expected to help more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, organizers of the event reported 390 works, which were paid or collected for about 10 billion dollars.
The organization estimates that the money raised has left a mark on the lives of at least 649 million people worldwide.
One of the most important mandate tasks is the British investor and management organization The Power of Nutrition, whose main goal is to help children. Thanks to the 4700 tweets written to their names, the organization has pledged to give Rwanda $35 million to address the problem of food shortages.
With the help of the UK government, donors, the people's government and so on, we can eliminate hunger forever in history", Tracy Uulman, a spokesperson for the organization, told a live concert in London in April 2018.
Following the organization's remarks and the adoption of more than 5000 steps on the nutrition problem of mothers and children in Britain, the government announced a project to finance more than 5 million women with children.
One of the most frequently asked questions is: How can we end extreme poverty?"
The festival website answers: This road will be very long and difficult - it will be in difficult times.
But if we remember the great anti-human rights movements that were long forgotten, we will inevitably win this battle, because unity is strength.
Janet Jackson, Wycknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi Bee, and Janel Monet are all stars of this year's event; the festival will be hosted by Deborah-Lee Ferness and Hugh Jackman in New York.
US Interior Minister: We can attract naval forces to block the export of Russian energy sources
Washington could attract naval forces to demand Russian energy exports, as long as it was necessary, and that was the case in the Middle East, the Washington Examiner quoted American Interior Minister Ryan Zink as saying.
According to Zinké, Russia is not involved in Syria in vain, especially the situations called by the Legislative Government are merely a reference to the investigation of the energy market.
I think the reason Russia is a frequent visitor to the Middle East is because they have been intervening in the energy sphere, because the same is true in Eastern and Southern Europe, the minister said.
The authorities said that there are many ways and means of solving this issue.
"The United States has the right to ensure that our Marine Forces are open and that their energy resources do not go to the free market when necessary", he said.
Zinkke addressed the participants at a meeting of nonprofit organizations organized by the Energy Consumers Alliance who considered themselves the voice of energy consumers in the United States.
He compared Washington's position to the situation in Russia and Iran, stating that they were the same.
The only option for Iran and Russia is  fuel use and replacement - he said, noting that Russia's profile is limited because the Russian economy is linked to the burning fields.
These statements came as the Trump administration put before it the issue of increasing natural gas exports to Europe and selling it at a much cheaper price, in order to push Russia out.
Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump and his administration urged Germany not to participate in the construction of the project North Stream-2, as the project anticipated Russia's influence in Europe would increase.
Moscow has repeatedly stated that the North Stream-2 gas pipeline, which cost 11 billion dollars, will double its capacity to 110 billion cubic meters and this is only an economic project.
The Kremlin maintained that Washington's fierce opposition to the project was purely economic and exemplified by a dishonest struggle.
Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said at his September meeting in Moscow with US Energy Minister Rick Perry: "I don't think energy resources should be a tool of pressure and consumers have the right to choose their own suppliers".
The negative position of the United States had a negative impact on Germany, which agreed with the project.
Germany's leading industrial organization, the German Federation of Industry, advised to stay away from the Organization of American Energy Policy and the Berlin and Moscow bilateral agreements.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel, head of the German Industrial Federation, Dieter Kempf, said after the meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin that "I would be in a difficult situation if a third country gets involved in our energy issue".
Massachusetts state senator Elizabeth Warren has announced that she will consider running for president in the 2020 presidential election
On Saturday, Massachusetts state senator Elizabeth Warren confirmed that she intends to run for president after the midterm elections in Congress.
At the administration building in Holioc, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he intended to run for president.
The newspaper Tshe Nill reiterated her words: It's time to give women the right to make their way to Washington and govern the country by changing the government's acute view of us.
I will seriously consider my participation in the presidential election after November 6.
Warren expressed his opinion that U.S. President Donald Trump was not leading the county in the right direction.
I am truly concerned about what Donald Trump has done to our democracy", he said.
Warren bravely gave Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Bret Kavano, his negative assessment.
On Friday, he wrote on his microblog on Twitter: "However, before the election we will need an FBI investigation".
However, according to the results of the Thursday poll, many voters agreed with Warren's participation in the 2020 election.
According to the Boston Globe, 58% of Massachusetts state voters believe that the senator will not win the election, according to a survey by the Center for Political Research at Suffolk University.
Thirty-two percent supported his candidacy.
The most votes in the polls were cast by former state governor Deval Patrick; in a potential race, 38 percent supported and 48 percent opposed.
In the run-up to the 2020 presidential election, former vice president Joe Biden and Vermont state senator Bernie Sandors were mentioned along with other prominent Democrats.
According to the Associated Press, Biden announced that he would make his official decision in January.
At a vote-getter meeting for Donald Trump, Sarah Palin said: "My son is suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder".
Trek Payn, 26, served a year in Iraq.
On Monday night, he was arrested on charges of domestic abuse.
"I understand the other families very well when my son came back from the war, our soldiers brought back not physical wounds but soul wounds", she said at a vote-getter rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his son's arrest a "burdened issue" and his son and "their oldest veterans" returned from the war with a tough heart", he said. "They are only concerned about one question - how much honor do their uncompromising soldiers and soldiers have for the country?
According to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the police department in Уасилла, Alaska, Trac Pэйlin was arrested on suspicion of domestic abuse - assault with a deadly weapon.
18 states and the District of Columbia oppose new U.S. policy on housing
The District of Columbia and eighteen U.S. states have a legal view of the political support for criminal groups, domestic violence and abuse.
NBC News reported that to deny such a policy, representatives from 18 states and the District of Columbia in Washington, D.C., on Friday appealed to a court consultation to defend refugees.
The real name of Grace was not given in the August lawsuit against Sessions against the Federal Policy by the American Free Citizens Union.
Grace was abused by her partners and her bloodless sons, gang members, but on July 20, the United States refused to give her a place of refuge.
He was arrested in Texas.
State lawyers who supported Grace considered gangs and domestic abusers in El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala to be the most common problem, as these countries have a large number of asylum seekers in the United States.
A new U.S. law in 2014 overturned a decision passed by the Immigration Council to grant asylum to undocumented refugees fleeing domestic violence.
On Friday, the District Attorney General of Columbia Karl Rasin noted that the new policy would repeal state, federal and international laws.
According to the court consultation, All appeals under federal law were considered as separate facts and circumstances, which prohibited all principles.
Lawyers in their address said that the policy of exclusion of refugees would be detrimental to the U.S. economy because most would be entrepreneurs and create jobs.
In June, the Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, authorized immigration judges to no longer provide refugees with shelter.
In his statement dated June 11, Seshns said: "The refuge is reserved for specific social groups persecuted or threatened for reasons of race, religion, nationality or political opinion".
The refuge has never been given to solve all the problems, even the major problems of everyday life that occur around the globe.
The number of deaths during the rescue operation in the pavilion has doubled in the call for a search

The magnitude 7.5 earthquake destroyed hospitals, injured hundreds.
Some of the injured, including Dvi Harris, who had a broken back and shoulder, were hospitalized at the Palua Army Hospital, where patients were treated outdoors due to a prolonged tremor.
He was filled with tears when he remembered the powerful earthquake that occurred when he was living with his wife and daughter in a hotel room.
 There was no time to be saved.
I think I was crushed by the ruins of the walls", Harris told Associated Press, adding, "We came to town with our family for a wedding".

I don't know what happened to my wife and child.
I'm sure they're safe.
The American ambassador blamed China for using propaganda.
A week after the official Chinese newspaper American Daily made a four-page advertisement about the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of spreading propaganda to the U.S. press.
Last Wednesday, US President D. Trump accused China of interfering with the November 6 US congressional elections, citing a paid advertisement by the publisher China Daily published in the Des Moines Register, a top-selling newspaper in Iowa, but China denied the accusation.
Reuters News agency reported that US officials accused Trump of creating a new company in Washington to increase pressure on China due to Beijing's interference in the US elections.
Beijing and Washington equalized import tariffs due to their trade wars, while other countries were placing their goods through advertising.
Chinese and American experts estimate that new tariffs have been introduced in China to reduce exports from other states such as Iowa for Trump's support of the Republican Party.
According to Terry Bransdad, former Iowa governor and U.S. ambassador to China, who sold agricultural products to China, Beijing caused damage to American workers, farmers and businesses.
In his article in the Sunday edition of the Des Moines Register, Branssted wrote: "China is now carrying out a double-heist operation by publishing propaganda advertising in our free press".
The Chinese leadership used paid advertising for the Des Moines Register to spread its propaganda using the American tradition of free speech and press", Branssted wrote.
Instead, in the Beijing newspaper kiosks you will not find articles that illuminate the Chinese people and the worrying economic development that are inconsistent with the government policy, because the press materials are under the supervision of the Chinese Communist Party.
A Chinese newspaper opposed the publication of his article, but did not say what press it was about.
Analysts say Republicans are excluding women who are elected in the inter-election period, as Kavano's failure illustrates
Many Republicans support and support the nomination of Brett Kavano to the Supreme Court despite allegations of sexual assault; they will see a negative reaction in the inter-election period, especially by women", noted the analyst.
In this tense time, most Republicans expressed their desire to vote.
Grant Richer, professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, said in an interview with the Saturday edition of The Hill: "It's irreversible what's going on".
He doubted whether the unexpected demand of Arizona state senator Jeff Flake, who said that an FBI investigation would be enough to jam angry Voters, would appease him.
Washington, D.C. reported that senior advisor and international press secretary of the progressive group Move on on Friday, Karin Jean-Pierre, noted: Women were yesterday, and tomorrow, November, will not be forgotten".
According to the news agency Mic, when Kavanaugh was seen in the Senate corridor on Friday, protestors organized a demonstration under the slogan November is Coming!, which was a protest by Republicans who oversaw the Judiciary Committee to move forward with Kavanaugh's candidacy, rather than responding to the testimony of Kristin Blaysi Ford.
According to the unbiased political analyst, Stu Rotenberg: "The interest in this work will be raised by citizens".
It is a folk tale, and this is true.
But it can be higher, especially among the hesitant suburban female voters and young voters aged 18 to 29, who don't like the president, but don't often vote".
Until Ford's open testimony that he was accused of sexual assault, analysts predicted that a sharp reaction could occur if Republicans rushed to confirm this candidacy to the Supreme Court.
Earlier this week, former chairman of the Republican National Committee Michael Stil said that this was a very confusing vacation for the Republican Party, wrote NBC News.
As Guy Cecil, director of the U.S. Committee of Preference, who helped elect Democrats, noted: "It's not just a matter of electing or electing a committee, but of putting Kavanaugh on the bench and how they got out of this situation, what their position was".
However, after the evidence of Ford and Kavanaugh, the Americans were divided into two groups, but the supporters of the Shui were more numerous.
A new YouGov poll showed that 41 percent of respondents believe or partly believe Ford's testimony, while 35 percent believe or partly believe Kavanagh.
In addition, 38 percent of the respondents said that Kavano was deceived in his performance, while 30 percent thought so about Ford.
Under pressure from Flake, another Kavano victim, Deborah Ramirez, was investigated by the FBI", reports The Gardian.
Last week, before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Kavano swore in testimony that he had been shot at Ford while drinking at the age of 17.
During a party during his time at Yale University in the 1980s, a Supreme Court candidate showed off his sexual organs", said Ramirez.
The creator of the World Wide Web plans to create a new Internet to resist Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launched a new startup that is resistant to Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The project, built on the Solid platform with open source code from Berners-Lee, was called Inrupt.
Solid gives users the ability to choose where their data will be stored, to whom to open or to provide information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt's goal was to dominate the world.
We have to do it now", he said of the startup.
This is a story.
The application uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own personal online data.
It contains a list of contacts, a workbook, a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional tools for work.
Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are all like a single browser and all at once.
The uniqueness of personal online storage is that the user chooses what information to access.
The company calls this "expanding personal possibilities through information".
According to the company's CEO, John Bruce, the idea behind Inrupt is that the company offers resources, processes and relevant skills to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of a security platform purchased from Berner-Lee, Bruce, IBM, several staff developers and an organization of freelance programmers hired to work on the project.
Beginning this week, developers of the technology will use their own centralized applications around the world, the tool available on the website Inrupt.
According to Berners-Lee, he and his team are not going to work with Facebook and Google to discuss the issue of a complete transformation of the business model in consultation with Facebook and Google.
We do not ask permission from them
On Saturday, in her Medium portal, Berners-Lee wrote: Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystems, to protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid.
He created the Internet in 1994 when the World Internet Networks Consortium was founded at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has played a key role in the discussion of net neutrality.
Although he left Inrupt, he was the founder and director of the Berners-Lee Institute for Open Information, the World Internet Network Consortium, an international nonprofit organization, the Web Foundation.
I remain optimistic about the future era of the internet", added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: The First World War worshiper of the Victoria Cross became famous
100 years later, the only Anglican clergyman was awarded the Victoria Cross for his heroism in the First World War.
On 29 September 1918, during the attack on the Belanglish and Leocur communes, the Reverend-Pred. Bernard Vann of the Sub-Polonch received the award.
However, he was unknown for his claim to the highest military award of the United Kingdom, being killed by a sniper 4 days later.
A memorial tombstone was erected in his honor this Saturday in the town of Rushden, Northamptonshire, with the participation of his grandchildren.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that placing a plaque on the monument 100 years later had a "great meaning".
The London Gazette reported that on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Canal de Saint-Kanten under the fire of heavy artillery and machine gun fire.
He then reached the firing range and with great bravery led the line forward, destroying a third of the squadron.
A month before the end of the war, on 4 October 1918, the German sniper killed Underpolkovnik Vann.
Michael Vann, 72, said he could not replicate the bravery of his grandfather".
After the parade of the Empire Youth Orchestra of Brentwood, she and her brother Dr. James Vann laid flowers for their grandfather.
"We are very fortunate to have the opportunity to showcase our true hero's courage through the support of many people, and to be part of the parade", said James Vann.
Fans of mixed martial arts came to watch Bellator 206 without sleep, but instead took Swinka Peppa
Imagine that you came to watch Bellator 206 and you were refused to watch it.
The schedule of the tournament, which will be held in San Jose, includes 13 matches, six of which were shown overnight on the main map on UK Channel 5.
At 6 p.m., while Gegard Musaci and Rory McDonald were preparing for a face-to-face meeting, the replacement of the report Swinka Pepppa shocked British viewers.
Some of them were not convinced of this, for they were awake to see what was happening.
One fan called the replacement of the show with a children's animation a "crazy joke" on his Twitter.
Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator, said: "According to the government's view, at 6 a.m. this content was not worthy of the task, so it had to be transferred to a children's program", when asked about the broadcast.
Yes, Swinka Pepppa.
Scott Kokker, president of Bellator, said that in the future, UK fans will be working on their own set of rules to watch the tournament.
I think we'll think about doing the translation and work on it", said Kocker.
In the UK, we can't decide on Sundays until 6 a.m. and Sundays until Sundays, because they have Monday.
But we're working on it.
And believe me, when the broadcast went down, we thought about technical flaws and tried to fix them, there were a lot of messages from that side and that side, and they were not friendly.
We thought about technical flaws and tried to correct them.
But that didn't happen, and all the questions were to the government.
He promised that he would not repeat it.
This time we increased the fight for the fans from five to six and we did not keep time - there will be five matches in the future as usual.
This is a pity.
Radio program Desert Island Discs reports that Tom Daley felt sexually attractive
Olympic water-jumping champion Tom Daley felt sexually attractive as an adult, but it was a strengthening of his strength to win.
"I didn't realize that everyone was not like me until I went to middle school", said the 24-year-old.
In an interview with radio host of Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, Lauren Lavern, she spoke in support of gay rights to inspire hope in others.
He also said that as a family head, he thinks less about winning the Olympic Games.
Many years of regular host of the show, Christie Young, took several months off due to illness.
In Lavern's first show, she felt inferior to everyone else because it was "unwelcome for boys and girls alike", said Daley.
His words: "I have kept myself inferior and secondary to others until today, and it has given me strength and energy to achieve success".
According to her, knowing her sexual orientation meant that she wanted to prove herself as a person so that people wouldn't change their view of her.
At the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year, a two-time bronze medalist from the LGBT Campaign called on other countries to free homosexuality from the criminal penalty.
He explained the reason for his courage was that his ability to live openly caused him to feel the urge to live in others.
I started to feel unexpectedly in love with American director Dustin Lens Black, whom I met in 2013", said the three-time world champion.
She married a man 20 years older than her Oscar last year - and she said age difference was never a problem for her.
She attended her first Olympics at the age of 14 and 3 years later her father died of cancer - she said that it was difficult to find people who had risen and fallen at the same age and who had suffered so much despite being young.
When Robert Ray lamented in June that Black-Dayley had been killed, he said: "My view of the world has changed", and he said: "I'm not going to be able to do anything about it.
If you had asked me last year, I would have told you that I had to win the gold medal".
"And you know there are things in the world that are more important than the gold medal of the Olympics.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbi.
Her son, Robert, was named after his grandfather, who died of a brain tumor in 2011 at age 40.
My father couldn't cope with his death and one of the questions he asked was about the availability of tickets to the 2012 London Olympics, because he wanted to sit in the front row", said Daley.
"I couldn't tell you, Dad, you couldn't sit in the front row", he said.
"I held his hand until he was sick, and when he stopped speaking, I thought he was a nice man, dead".
In her second year, Daley won bronze at the 2012 Olympics.
"I knew swimming in front of my people at the Olympics was my lifelong dream", she said.
He was also inspired by the song Proud by Hézér Sмол, which inspired him during the preparation for the Olympic Games and still makes his body feel good today.

The game of the Ryder Cup is very rough
In a game on Sunday at the 47th Ryder Cup, American Phil Mickelson set his own record, but he needs to get back in shape so the record doesn't get ugly.
A two-year-old who competed for the 12th time, Mickelson was replaced by captain Jim Furic in Saturday's forwards and forwards.
The five-time winner, who was at the center of the US's frequent events, sat half the day in the fan stands and spent the rest of the day working on a game that worried you on the field.
The 48-year-old was not easy to play at the beginning of his career and the uneven narrow Le Golf National field was not very favorable for him and he punished the player for his mistaken strokes.
While the golf course won't be intimidated by Sunday's 9th game, this week Mikelson will play against Open Championship champion Franчесko Momenari, who is set to win all 4 games, along with new winner Tommy Flitwood, the UK's goaltender.
If the Americans who were 4 points behind in 12 games were given a strong start, the game could be tense for Mickelson.
Furic expressed confidence in his partner, but that was all he could say about him.
He realized his role in the game he played today, mi hugged me from behind and announced that he was ready for the game tomorrow", said Furik.
She has a lot of confidence.
He was a member of the Hall of Fame and worked for this team a lot this week.
I didn't know he played two games.
I tried to show myself that we had to go the way we wanted to go, and it was.
He wants to be where others are.
Nick Faldó's record was broken by Mikelson Sunday by passing the number of Ryder Cup games.
This may mark the end of his Ryder Cup career, which never came to personal record.
He had 18 wins and 20 losses in 7 innings at Mickelson, but Furic thought his presence in the team made him feel differently.
He's a housewife, hot, thorny, likes to make fun of people and is a very good guy in the team", he explained.
I think the young players were encouraged when they played with him this week.
It offers more than a simple game.
Thomas Bjorn, European team captain, knows that his big advantages may be lost
From experience, European team captain Thomas Bjorn knew that the single-disc race on the final day of the Ryder Cup could turn into a hot race.
In his first game in 1997, Valderram, led by his tenth team, Sev Ballesteros, won by the smallest margin, 141⁄2-131⁄2 points, with a five-point lead over the Americans.
You always remind us of the great advantage in the Walderram: our advantage was when we lost in Brooklyn and won in the Walderram, there was nothing left", Bjorn said on Friday after looking at the results of the 2018 victory with a score of 5:3 and the 10:6 score of Golf National golf club last night.
So, history will show me and all of this team that this is not the end.
I hope you will do even better tomorrow.
Go there and do everything right.
It won't be finished until you have scored.
We must strive to win and focus on that.
I've been paying attention to 12 games that we've played and we know that the best players on the planet are against us.
Always excited about how players play on a hard golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never rush ahead of time".
Tomorrow there will be a competition with another person.
Tomorrow there will be separate competitions, and that's another matter.
It's nice to be around your partner when the race is going well, but when you play alone, you test your skills as a golfer.
We have to get the players to know that we are going to do our best in the game tomorrow.
Tomorrow, you will have to forget about putting all your effort into the game and put 100 percent effort into it too.
His partner Jim Furic would have achieved better performances than Björn in individual events, with three-quarters points from Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas not counting.
On the final day, Furic himself was at the forefront of both of these changes; after establishing the Medina Miracle as a representative of the winning team in Brooklyn and as the loser of the European national team.
In 1999, captain Ben Krenshou answered a question when he assembled his team before the final race: "I know every word that will be spoken".
We have 12 important games tomorrow and we want you to start as fast as you did in Brooklyn and Medina.
The match was heavily emphasized when the force moved to one side in the middle of the tournament.
We tried to prepare your talent, the team, in the same order to our eyes, to be miraculous tomorrow.
Thomas was forced to stand at the start of the attack and meet Paul Casey, Dustin Rose, John Ram, Tom Flitwood and Jan Poulter in the top half of the game and other Europeans in the group match with Rory Maquillroy.
After his separate choices, Bjorn said: "The reason I'm going in this manner with this group of guys is because I think it's so attractive to him".
New German warship delayed again
According to local press reports, the new German Harbi-Marine Fleet frigate was to be introduced in 2014 to replace the old warships of the Cold War, but this was delayed due to the poor system and the rapid rise in prices.
According to the newspaper Die Zeif, the introduction of the new forward-looking frigate Reypland-Pfalz, similar to the Baden-Vürtemberg, was postponed until the first half of 2019, according to a representative of the military sector.
The ship was scheduled to be delivered to the Navy in 2014, but problems with the supply of the products prevented the ambitious project.
Four ships of the Baden-Würtemberg class were ordered by the Navy in 2007 to replace old frigates of the Bremen class.
According to calculations, they were equipped with powerful gun, zeniit and anti-ship missile sets, as well as low radiolocation, optical and infrared surveillance technologies.
Other important features of the new frigates included the fact that even longer technical service would have to be sent two years further from the bases in the port.
However, as Die Zelt noted, the constant delays suggested that these advanced warships would not only show their power to Germany among other countries, but also become obsolete by the time of armed violence.
Last year, the German Navy officially declined to commission the F125 and re-entered the yard instead of building and repairing the ships Blohm & Voss in Hamburg, the headlines of the newspapers said.
This was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to a shipbuilder.
The reasons for the return of the ship were not disclosed, but the German mass media relied on the ship's "pro-program and hardware" to show acute defects and its ineffectiveness in the performance of its military mission.
The lack of a supply program was particularly important, as the crew of the Vürtemberg-Baden-class ships was to have about 120 sailors, which was only half the personal composition of the former Bremen-class frigates.
It also revealed that the ship's weight was much higher than it should have been, which reduced its activity, and thus prevented the Navy from modernizing these ships in the future.
The weight of the 7000-tonne Rheinland-Pfalz ships was twice the weight of the similar class of ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the lack of equipment, the project was also a problem, taking into account the training of the crew, and the high cost of the project.
The price was remarkably high: the initial price was 2,2 billion euros, while the current price reached 3,1 billion euros (3,6 billion dollars).
The problems associated with the newer frigates were particularly significant because of recent warnings about the shrinking of the German naval forces.
Earlier this year, the parliamentary commissioner for military forces, Hans-Peter-Bartels, acknowledged that the Navy was actually running out of spare ships with a short-term expansion (dislocation) schedule.
The official said that over time, the problem worsened, as old vessels that had gone out of business were replaced by new ones.
She was very upset that not a single frigate of the Baden-Würtemberg class could join the fleet.
National Foundation studies the secret life of the narcissists
The search for a hut in the Scottish Highlands was aimed at finding out how the marshes used the landshat in their hunts.
We hope that the data obtained will introduce new insights into the study of the life of rare mammals and contribute to conservation activities.
The research, conducted by scientists at the National Foundation of Scotland, will involve a large carnivorous lizard, a small large lizard, a long-eared gray lizard, and the devil's butterfly, Dabonton, which is found in the Interview Gardens in the Wester-Ross area.
During the entire season, special registrators will be installed at important locations around the hotel to monitor the livelihoods of the fairgrounds.
Employees and volunteers of the SDF will also conduct mobile investigations using portable detectors.
The frequency and type of sound of the vibrations will be determined by recording and analyzing the sounds.
The following will be a map and report of the locations of the inhabitants, a survey of the landscape to create a picture of their lives.
Rob DEUAR, a conservation adviser at the ShMF, discussed what the grapes of this study are in, and how each grape uses the characteristics of the surrounding area.
This information will help determine how the geysers are related to habitat management, bush processing and forestry conservation and other species.
In Scotland and the United Kingdom, the population of the caterpillars has declined over the past 100 years.
They were threatened by construction and technological activity, which prevented them from adjusting to living conditions.
Wind and lighting equipment, such as seeding tape, are a safety concern, and chemically treated building materials, such as house cats, are also a danger.
The jaranats are not actually blind.
Yet, because of the nighttime hunts, the ears are better than the eyes when they catch prey.
They use a complex technical echolocation to avoid obstacles on their routes.
The country is seriously affected by the 270 historic houses, 38 important gardens and the shoreline of the SMP with 76000 hectares.
There are 10 trained specialists who help with regular checkups and night vision.
The organization even built the only specialized wildlife sanctuary in Scotland, with 8 of the 10 species living in the Trev district on the property of David Topson.
According to area director David Thompson, the area is a good place for the dunes.
"This place, Trev, is good for the brats".
There are old houses, old trees, plenty of living facilities", he said.
However, there are many unknown facts about the geysers, so we need to understand what is needed for the population here and elsewhere.
He stressed the importance of investigating the presence of a nest before serving the property, as the destruction of a nest could kill 400 females and young nestlings, while wiping out the entire local population.
The species is protected by law, so every safety, killing, existence, nesting, destruction is checked.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Foundation activist in Scotland, called for help in the conservation of the herring.
His words: We know about the larvae and we do not know about their populations in their lives.
Ronaldo denied the rape charge and his lawyers were planning to hand over the German magazine to the court
Cristiano Ronaldo called the allegations of rape "false news" and claimed that people were going to make a name for themselves because of his name.
His lawyers were about to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel for publishing these allegations.
The forward of the Portugal and Juventus national teams was accused of raping an American named Kathrin Majorga in 2009 at her Las Vegas hotel room.
According to reports, Ronaldo paid $375,000 in 2010 to keep the letter from telling the story.
A few hours after the complaint was published, 33-year-old Ronaldo called it a "fake news" in a live Instagram feed to 142 million writers.
No-no-no.
Their story today is falsehood. "The one who holds the golden ball five times told the chamber.
They want to glorify themselves because of my name.
This is a common sight.
These things are part of my job.
I'm a happy person and I'm good with everything".
According to the news agency Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are going to hand over the magazine Der Spiegel to the court for "inciting unstable messages" in his personal life.
According to lawyer Christian Sherz, the footballer demanded compensation based on the degree of moral damage for violating his personal rights, which was probably a serious violation of his rights in recent years.
The unfortunate incident is thought to have occurred in June 2009 at the Palms casino of the Las Vegas Hotel.
After meeting the club at night, Ronald and Majorga reportedly returned to his number and allegedly raped Majorga, according to documents filed with the Clark County Court in Nevada.
According to the girl, after being raped, Ronaldo knelt before her and said: "I'm a 99% good guy, but I was cheated 1%".
According to documents, they slept together, but there was a mutual agreement, according to Ronaldo.
According to Majorga, she had contacted the police and photographed her injuries in hospital, but later, fearing public humiliation, agreed to an unsuccessful settlement.
The 34-year-old woman said she now wants to refuse the contract, because she still can't recover from her heart attack after the incident.
After the ill-fated attack against Ronaldo, Manchester left United for Real Madrid, and this summer he moved to Ювентус Italy for 100 million euros.
Brexit: Britain will forever regret the production of cars
Greek Clark, who was the post-Brexit minister for business and entrepreneurship, said Britain would regret losing its leadership status in the global automotive industry.
According to the BBC, the official leadership of Toyota said that if Britain left the EU without a deal, Bernaston would be stopped not far from Derby - a news that had left the minister in mind.
We need a deal", said Mr. Clark.
A Japanese automaker has said that a no-deal Brexit would result in job losses due to delays in the grain.
The Bernaston plant, which produced about 150000 cars, exported the Toyota Auris and Avensis brands over the past year, 90% to other European Union countries.
If the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, production in our factory will stop", said Martin Cook, director of Toyota in Bernas.
UK carmakers like Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover were concerned about leaving the EU if they did not agree on how the car dealership worked.
For example, the BMV announced that it would close its mini-zavod in Oxford for a month.
The major risk of manufacturing by car manufacturers is the non-agreement of the UK's withdrawal from the EU.
The Toyota production line operates as a Tougal time, with spare parts of order-made cars coming from the same EU from UK manufacturers every 37 minutes.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there may be disruptions along the border, which industry officials believe could lead to delays and parts shortages.
Toyota said that the spare parts at the Derbicher plant will not be able to hold for more than a day, so production will be stopped.
The Checkers plan, devised by Theresa May, was to prevent such investigations in the future relationship with the EU, which is a well-regarded journal", Mr. Clark said.
We need a deal, Mr. Clark said. <seg id="15" Translator-id='User 03'>We want such a good deal, a pleasing of today's successes, beyond the possibilities of the deal, " he told BBC Radio 4 on the Today program.
As not only Toyota, but other manufacturers know, we need to continue to do the most successful work possible
Toyota warned that it could not say how long production would be halted, adding that additional losses would reduce the competitiveness of the plant in the future and would eventually lead to job losses.
Peter Tsувалларис, union leader of Unite, worked at the Bernaston plant for 24 years, whose collective was deeply saddened: I can tell you from experience that if jobs are cut, they will no longer exist.
According to a government spokesman, We have a precise and solid plan for our future relations with the European Union.
Trump and Rosenstein's meeting may be postponed
The White House said that Donald Trump's meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein on Sunday could be "postponed for another week" as the fight for Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavano continues.
Rozenstein, special adviser to Robert Müller, conducted an investigation into Russian election interference; the ties between Trump and Russian aides were tied to the judiciary's potential opposition to the president.
Trump had been in Washington for several months, rumored to have fired the Deputy Attorney General and thereby threatened Müller's independence.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rozenstein was recording his talks with Trump and discussing the possibility of the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein rejected the news.
On Monday, he made his way to the White House to announce his intention to retire.
Instead, a meeting with Trump at the UN was announced Thursday in New York.
Trump insisted on not firing Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed due to hearings by the Senate Judiciary Committee, where Brett Kavano and his accuser, Christine Bleici Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into Kavanaugh, so the Senate vote was delayed for a longer period.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, gave an interview on Monday with the Fox News news program.
When asked about a meeting with Rosenstein, he said, "The date of the meeting has not yet been set, but it may be this week, and I think it may be postponed for another week because of other things going on at the Supreme Court".
Let's see, I like to keep the press on the course
Some reporters dismissed the claim that Sanders had not held a briefing for reporters at the White House since September 10.
The host, Chris Wallace, asked why the event was not held.
Sanders: I wouldn't call the absence of Brifing a "sick look" to TV reporters for the purpose of showing themselves, but I don't deny the fact that they showed themselves".
Trump did not deny the increase in direct meetings between the press and the media.
The president conducts more question-answer sessions than any other president", he said, without proving anything: We looked at those numbers.
Sanders said the briefing would be held as usual, but if matbugat wanted to ask a direct question to the president of the United States, it would be much better than talking to me.
We're trying to do it, you've seen how we did it a few weeks ago, and talking to the president of the United States replaces a press briefing.
Trump always answers questions not only when he meets in public at the White House, but also at press conferences in front of high-ranking guests.
There are few solo press conferences.
He explained why he was so open and unusual in front of reporters in New York this week.
Scottish Health Minister writes to EU official, Scottish police health officer about Brexit worries
The Scottish Health Minister expressed gratitude to the EU official, the Scottish military health officer, and the country and beyond, and called on them to continue their work after Brexit.
Jean Freeman, a Scottish MP, sent a letter 6 months before the UK left the EU.
The Scottish government was charged with the costs of applying for EU immigrant status for citizens working in the autonomous public service.
In her letter, Mrs. Friedman said: "The UK and the EU have been negotiating a withdrawal for the summer and the decision we have been waiting for has been taken in the autumn.
But the UK also accelerated the work on the possibility of a no-deal exit.
I know that these are very difficult times for all of us.
That is why I wanted to say that we respect every worker, regardless of his nationality.
Employees outside the EU also have a wealth of experience, improving the work of healthcare professionals and providing a great deal of support to the diseases and communities we serve.
Scotland  this is your home and we definitely want you to stay with us
Christian Aberkromby had surgery after he suffered a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers Football club halfback Christian Aberkrombi's defeat of Christian team, which had an emergency head injury while playing against the Vanderbilt Kommodores team on Saturday, ended with a score of 31:27, reports Mike organ sports journalist from Tennessee.
Tennessee head coach State Rod Reid reported that the injury was sustained before the break.
When he reached the top of the ridge, he fell".
The trainers and doctors gave Aberkrombi oxygen before putting it in the nozilk, and then took it away for further examination.
A representative for the State of Tennessee told Chris Harris of his release from surgery at the Aberkrombi Vanderbilt Medical Center, a channel in Tennessee.
There is no information yet on the type/size of the injury". Harris added, while Tennessee State is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
A second-year student, Aberkrombi, spent his first season in Tennessee after moving from Illinois.
On Saturday, he attempted to score five times before the game ended, resulting in 18 repetitions of this maneuver during the season.
New arms tax on foreign buyers of real estate in the UK
Foreign buyers will be subject to an additional herb tax when they purchase real estate in the UK; according to new plans by the Tory political party, this money will go to the homeless assistance program.
This step was taken to prevent the leader of the Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, from attracting young voters.
Additional herb tax will be raised in the UK for tax-exempt individuals.
The UK's Ministry of Finance expects it to raise 120 million pounds a year for the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be subject to an additional herb tax when they purchase real estate in the UK - money that will go to the homeless assistance program, - Theresa May announced today.
This move was seen as a compromise on Jeremy Corbyn's success by promising young voters cheap seats and taking into account high-income people.
The herb tax would be collected in the UK from non-taxpayers and firms, and the additional money would have led the government to create a program of low-cost housing for households.
The new herb tax, introduced two years ago on secondary housing and purchase for rent, was 3% in total.
The UK Ministry of Finance hopes to collect 120 million pounds of tax per year.
According to estimates, 13% of newly built London homes were purchased by foreign UK representatives and rising prices prevented others from buying them.
Foreign buyers made it possible to call the "towns" the rich districts of many countries, especially in the capital, because they spend a lot of time abroad.
The new policy came a week after Boris Johnson's request to reduce the new crest tax on helping many young people get married.
In a plea to correct Britain's property disgrace, May urged her to refuse a quota for cheap property and accused her of not buying land from major construction firms, but of not using it.
Mr. Corbin was among those who introduced new housing reforms, including paying rent and evicting innocent residents.
His desire was to empower local governing bodies to build new houses.
Mrs. May: Last year I said that I was dedicated to reviving the British dream of being prime minister  to improving the lives of the new generation,
This is called the upgrading of the housing market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, this did not apply to British foreigners who did not live in Britain but bought a comfortable home and worked there.
The dream of building their own home is far from being realized for many people and the problem of sleeping outdoors remains a reality
My main goal is to govern Scotland", said Jack Ross.
The ultimate goal of Jack Ross, manager of the football club Sunderland, was to manage Scotland.
The 42-year-old, who finished third in the Premier League three points behind, was delighted to work on the reconstruction of the Northeast club.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this year after returning to the Scotland Premier League last season.
BBCRadio Scotland's Sportsound program:
I wanted to be a player for my country".
When I was a kid, my father and I used to watch the Scottish games at the Hampden Stadium and he always attracted me to him.
But that opportunity will only come when I have great success in managing the club.
Sandersland's managers before Ross were Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Ellardays, Martin ONil, Roy Kins, and Gustavo Poyet and Paolo Di Canyo.
I never feared coming after such influential people as Barnsley and Ipswich Town after rejecting their previous offers and becoming manager of a major Scottish football club", said future manager of the Scottish football club Alloa Athletic Ross.
Can I get this club back to the Premier League?
Due to its structure and possibilities, it certainly has a place in the Premier League", he said.
It is not an easy task to achieve this, but I will consider myself successful only if I bring the club back to it
Ross worked as a manager's assistant at Dambarton for 15 months and coach at Hearts for only 3 years.
He then helped Alloa climb the third eschealon late in the afternoon and lifted Sent-Mirrén from the bottom line to the title champion the following season.
I feel more comfortable than I did during the climbing times of Klaid, Hartlpul, Folkerk, Sant-Mirrren and Gamilton Academical", said Ross.
"It was probably a very trying time", he recalled, taking responsibility for Alloa.
I sincerely believed that management was more for me than playing.
It sounds strange, because I was doing well, I was doing well, and I was suffering.
But it's complicated to play.
You are daily subject to many trials.
I still go through stress and pressure, but management makes me feel good.
I have always wanted to be a ruler, and now I feel comfortable in everything.
You can listen to Jack Ross's full speech on Sunday, September 30th from 12:00 to 13:00 on Radio Scotland's Sportsound show BBC-Scotland.
According to the survey, the best time to drink beer is Saturday 17:30 minutes
Despite the increased prices of British pubs, which had been experiencing financial difficulties, there was considerable pressure on restaurant chains.
Statistical surveys show that pubs and bars saw a 2.7% increase in sales in July, while restaurants saw a 4.8% decline.
According to the CGA sales company, Peter Martin: In the wake of England's long participation in the World Cup and the prolonged hot weather, July went along with the June scheme: restaurants suffered more when the discounts in pubs increased by 2.8%.
The decline in sales volume in June by 1.8% only increased in July.
Other intolerable pubs have the same inequity as the restaurants that have their incomes.
Food and pubs were also damaged by the sun, but not as much as restaurants.
The people wanted only water.
Pub and bar sales increased by 6.6% per month, while food sales increased by only 3%.
Cultural-holiday and hospitality analyst Paul Newman of RSM said: "It's been trending since April, as we've seen".
When it comes to foreign markets, the weather, social and sports news remain the main condition.
Despite a sharp decline of 4.8% in sales compared to last year, most restaurants are trying to keep up and continue to struggle while reducing costs.
The long hot summer was a difficult time for food-focused companies, and the average weather we tested in August will show that it was a breathing moment.
The increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, along with new holdings, was 2.7% in July and showed a gradual market launch of brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker control is an example of a collection and analysis of 47 working groups for British pubs, bars and restaurants with revenues of £9 billion.
One in five children on social media have hidden accounts from their parents
According to the survey, one in five children, some as young as 11, have social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers.
He showed an increase in fake pages on Instagram, based on a survey of 20 000 high school students.
This news showed the danger of increasing sexual records.
20% of students were able to show their basic accounts to parents.

In the Scottish Athletics Council, Elid Doyl will be the voice of the competitors
British athlete of the year, Elid Doyl, was elected to the Scottish Athletic Council as an independent director at the annual meeting of the Higher Organs.
This step by the most famous athlete in Scotland, Doyl, was a great opportunity for the sport's administrators to use the experience of the last decade, as said by the head of the board, Jen Beattie.
Eilid is highly respected in the athletics organisations of Scotland, Britain and all countries, and we believe that if Scotland's athletics is included in the board of directors, it will only bring great benefits", said Beattie.

It was a difficult task, but she has fully recovered, learned to walk again, and is still exercising today!
I thank you very much for encouraging me with these words.
The network has been active for ads comparing mammals to cows
The company also agreed with the public opinion that breastfeeding mothers should be compared to breastfeeding cows in advertising.
Elvie technology consumer company has released the world's first silent nightlife , a humorous video-presentation, which aims to make life easier for breastfeeding mothers.
In the palace of the cow with the pasture, four mothers dance to the tune of the song and this song has the words: 'Yes, I am my own, but you do not see my nest and if you do not see my nest, it is not the cow's snake, but my bed.'
He continued: Surr, surr, I feed children, surr, surr, I save my wives.
But the ad, which was posted on the company's Facebook page, sparked controversy on the network.
This was a wake-up call for 77000 viewers and hundreds of comments from the audience, who expressed a disagreement about the milk industry's fear.
It's a very simple thing to advertise user sayers in this app".
"We need to make them pregnant and give them milk, just as we do. But when they give birth, they are like a pig.
The name Elvie/Mother, which is a breast-feeding name, was placed on the bustgaaltter.
Another said, "It is clear that this is a painful injury to both mother and child".
Hey, what's the point of using them in advertising?
Others added, "It's far from real".
Others supported the ad, but one woman - a singer - seemed to be a big fan".
 I think this is a great idea.
If I were a breastfeeder, I would buy such a crane.
I felt like a cow when I poured the milk.
The ad was a little bit of a dream, but I took it anyway.

Hundreds of migrant children were quietly placed in tent camps on the border with Teham
The number of migrant children detained increased from the countryside, but the border crossing did not change within a month, which was due to the Trump administration's statements and measures that made it difficult for adopters to take children on their own.
Most of the adopters were formerly undercover immigrants, so those who expressed their rights to children put themselves at risk of not staying in this country.
When federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other family members would have to fingerprint and be sent to immigration authorities, they were threatened in June.
Last week, high-ranking immigration and customs official Matthew Albenz arrested people before Congress, who were sent by the agency to take care of dozens of underprivileged children.
The agency later reported that 70% of those arrested were unconvicted.
Up to 80% of people, both sponsors and sponsors, live in this country illegally and most of them are foreigners.
So we are persecuting those people".
In order to expedite the processing of children, the judges introduced new rules, some of which, according to the staff of the shelter, were to appear in court within one month of their arrest, rather than 60 days.
They may come to immigration court by videoconference rather than by themselves to defend their legal status.
Anyone who refuses to help will be immediately expelled from the country.
The fact that the children who arrived in the last month were kept in custody for a long time, despite the words of the workers of the priory, increased the risk of childhood disturbing, escaping, and violence.
According to the lawyers, this risk is present in large institutions such as the Torniльо, as the large area of the camp is a danger for children.
If you move the children without emotional preparation, if you don't say goodbye to friends, the psyche of the children will be damaged".
Syria calls on the US, France and Turkey to withdraw as soon as possible
Despite 8 years of war in the country, the UN General Assembly's Minister of Foreign Affairs, Walid al-Mughalim, has called on Syrian refugees to return home.
Deputy Prime Minister Mogullim said that foreign troops living illegally in Syria will also be subject to appropriate measures.
"They must leave without conditions".
The war in Syria ended in 2011, when 360 000 people died and millions were forced from their homes".
He continues this holy war in Damascus, the liberation of Syria by terrorists and illegal aliens", said Mughallim.
The United States also maintains, trains and advises about 2,000 Syrian armed forces; in general, the United States incites both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs against President Bashar al-Assad.
France was subjugated by over 1000 armed forces in a war-torn country.
The conditions for the return of refugees are good, said Mughallim, who blamed some Western countries for spreading irrational threats that urged refugees to stay away.
We have called on international communities and humanitarian organizations to support their return, he said.
"They politicize a humanitarian issue".
No support for the reconstruction of Syria will be provided without a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war", warned the United States and the European Union.
According to United Nations diplomats, the recent agreement on the establishment of a buffer zone during the recent Idlib insurrection between Russia and Turkey has provided an opportunity for continuing political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement did not prevent a large-scale offensive by the Russian-backed Syrian army against the three-million-strong province.
However, Mughallim noted that the agreement had "clear terms"; it offered the hope that war movements would be "cut off" against the jihadists, including the fighters of the Nusra Front, which was linked to Al Qaeda.
United Nations representative Staffan de Mistrura hoped to soon establish a post-war Syrian constitution and organize the first meetings of a new committee composed of representatives of the government and opposition, which would be convenient for elections.
The committee's work should be limited to the present constitutional articles, and the Syrian government's participation in the committee was stipulated in the statement.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to this logic, Trump will win a new election in 2020 unless the presidential term expires early due to impeachment or riots, as most liberal audiences had hoped.
This is undoubtedly the most dramatic presidential finale in history!
At this time, there are no signs of the worms being tired.

Foreign currency enters the toughest mid-term election
It is not surprising that the 17th District of Pennsylvania saw a flow of money due to congressional districts being grouped and that two presidents were therefore fighting for the same seat.
In Pittsburgh, the newly renamed neighborhood was home to Republican Democrat Conor Lamb, who won a seat in the spring elections.
Lamb is currently running against the representative of the old 12th district, similar to the new 17th Pennsylvania district, the second incumbent, Republican Keith Rotfus.
When the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled in January that the old regions had been unconstitutionally changed in favor of the Republicans, the maps were removed from the income.
The contest for the new 17th District included a financing struggle between the major financial parties of the Democratic Election Committee of the Congress and the National Republican Election Committee.
Lamb's name became famous after winning the special election for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district in March.
The Republican has held the seat for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump has won the region by 20 points.
Political experts favored the Democrats.
The US fined El Salvador for aiding China, but later refused
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama recognized Beijing, while Washington opposed it.
In June 2017, Trump met with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varella and the partners stayed for a while in a Panama hotel until Trump's organization transferred leadership.
For recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan, State Department officials were able to recall representatives of American diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama  said department spokesman Heather Nauert earlier this month.
Perhaps the fines came only at the expense of El Salvador: In 2017, El Salvador received about $140 million in U.S. aid, including for drug research, development and economic support.
The proposed fines, which included a reduction in financial support and targeted visa restrictions, would be very heavy for Central America and its high unemployment and murder rates.
During the internal meetings, North American and Central American officials postponed the high-income meeting on security and economic growth to continue the previous year's meeting, which saw the possibility of reducing the number of migrants arriving in the United States.
But in mid-September, officials of the high administration indicated their desire to continue the conference, thus concluding the investigation into the imposition of fines for El Salvador.
Diplomats said Vice President Mike Pence was ready to speak at a conference in mid-October to highlight the importance of the administration.
Three American representatives then left Washington for El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without receiving any bad news or punishment.
Mr. Bolton's White House representative declined to provide more details about the debate, and three American employees, including two diplomats, agreed to discuss internal disputes anonymously.
Their statements were corrected by a pro-administration analyst who remained anonymous.
History reading
Another trick may be the report by lawyer Robert Müller about Mr. Trump's obstruction of justice, which is currently well documented in the public records.
According to reports, Müller also investigated whether Trump's campaign was allied with Russia to attack our elections.
If the congressional ownership were changed, Trump would answer to that body as he prepared to meet with the voters, and would eventually stand before a jury of his fellow members.
If there are many, I'm not saying that Mr. Trump's defeat will be inevitable and his European equivalents will fall.
We are going to have to make a choice on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the timing of the fight.
In 1938, German officers were ready to overthrow him if he supported the Czechoslovaks by resisting Hitler.
We were defeated and missed the opportunity to survive the terrible attack that had continued for years.
History repeats the turning point: The endless march of democracy is accelerated or slowed.
The American people are currently experiencing such turmoil.
What will we do if Trump expels Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the head of the Mueller investigation?
The newspaper reported that Rosenstein had made a mockery of himself last year after proposing to secretly record the president and assuming that he was unfit for office.
The Times is not the truth", said Rozenstein.
"If the investigation of the new Federal Bureau of Investigation asked about the fact that the investigation of Bret Kavano was incomplete or false, or was confirmed by the Supreme Court despite the violation and false testimony, how would we respond?
And first of all, in the midterm elections, are we going to vote for Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we don't pass this test, democracy will have a long winter to wait for.
But I am convinced that we will win, because I learned the lesson from Prague.
My mother, a Czechoslovak Jew, was deported to Auschwitz by the Nazi regime that had seized my embassy.
He survived, moved to America, and 60 years later, on Shabbat, I was sent to light a candle on a table with a symbol of the swastika.
With such a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

"Ranger" Graham Dorance welcomed his fight with Vienna "Rapid"
Earlier this month, the Rangers finished the game with a base score against Villarreal in Spain, and now, on Thursday, they are preparing to face Vienna Rapid, where if they beat the Austrians, their chances of entering the Europa League's G group are very high.
The knee injury prevented the first appearance of midfielder Graham Dorance, so we only saw him in a 2-2 draw against Villarreal, but he was confident that the Rangers would take advantage of that success and get even bigger successes.
"It's a good score for us, because Villarreal is a strong team", said the 31-year-old.
"We started the game and we got out with a score.
We might have made the most of it, but in the end, the basis can be a fair result.
They were stronger in the first half, and we showed better in the second half.
Thursday is another big European holiday.
I believe we will get three points, but it is going to be a very difficult game, because our rivals have got a good score in the last game, but I believe with those who support us we will win.
Thinking about my injuries and the changes that have taken place at the club, it has been a really tough year, but I have a good sense of where I stand now.
The team was in a good mood, playing with a good heart, training.
I'm sure we'll continue now, after we've left the last season and succeeded".
Women lose sleep for fear of accumulating pensions
Although the survey participants were well aware of the care they were receiving, few people spoke to family members about it.
Nationwide Half of the participants in the scientific paper said they talked to their spouses about long-term monitoring.

Indonesian earthquakes and tsunamis
Officials said at least 384 people died in the powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palú on Friday, and the death toll is expected to rise.
Due to the disconnection, the aid workers were unable to obtain any information from the Donggala district in northern Palau, a region closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated from the Palu after the disaster.
Some of the most important facts about the Palau and the Donga, located in Sulawesi:
Palú is the capital of the Central Sulawesi province, located on the narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi Island, with a population of 379800 in 2017.
The city was experiencing a devastating earthquake and tsunami when it celebrated its 40th anniversary.
Donggala is an unincorporated county in the northwest of Sulawesi, extending over 300 km (180 mi) of coastline.
As of 2017, the population of the province's administrative region, the county, was 299,200.
Fisheries and agriculture are the mainstays of the economy of Central Sulawesi province, especially the Donggala coastal region.
Nickel mining was also important in the province, but it was concentrated mainly in Morovoi, on the opposite bank of the Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency, the last 100 years have seen several tsunami disasters in Paluu and Donggala.
In 1938, the tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed more than a hundred homes.
In 1996, a tsunami struck west of the Donegal, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the seismic Pacific Balkans and is frequented by earthquakes.
The following earthquakes and tsunamis occurred in recent years:
2004: On 26 December, a powerful earthquake struck the western coast of the province of Achech, north of Sumatra, Indonesia, causing a tsunami. 226,000 people died in 14 countries along the Indian Ocean - more than half of them inhabitants of Achech.
2005: Late March - early April, there were severe earthquakes along the western coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake in southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, caused a tsunami on the southern coast, killing about 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near Padang, the capital of the Western Sumatra province.
More than 1100 people lost their lives.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands near Sumatra, causing a tsunami of more than 10 meters in length, destroying dozens of villages and taking away about 300 people.
2016: A small earthquake in the Pididjaya district of Achech caused a collapse and panic as people recalled the devastating effects of the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died in the destroyed buildings.
2018: A major earthquake struck the Indonesian tourist island of Lombbok, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists in dire straits.

Federal prosecutors seek the death penalty for suspected terrorists in the New York attack
The New York Federal Prosecutor's Office is seeking the death penalty for Syfullos Saipov, a suspect in the murder of eight people in New York - a rare punishment that has not been used in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, used a rental car Home Depot to attack a bike path along the West Side highway in Lower Manhattan, hitting pedestrians and cyclists.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors would have to prove that Saipov "knocked down" eight victims and "knocked down" causing significant bodily harm, according to the intent to seek the death penalty in the Southern District of New York.
According to court documents, the death penalty is possible in both of these points.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal grand jury wrote charges of 22 against Saipova, including the murder of eight people who assisted in the racket, which is usually used by the prosecutor's office in federal organized crime, the use of violence, and the destruction of a car.
The prosecutor's office said the attack was "intentional and involuntary", and that the case was "disgusting, cruel and immoral".
"Saipov, who was killed by a gunman, was killed by a gunman, and was later arrested by a police officer in the city of Saipur, the capital of the Russian Federation".
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been ten years since the last execution was carried out in the Southern District of New York.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was used in the Federal New York case was in 1953 against the family of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg; they were executed two years earlier for espionage of the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs were electrified on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, who was born in Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months following the attack.
Police said he told investigators that he had a good feeling about what he was doing.
On the basis of the indictment, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to attack after watching videos of ISIS on his phone.
Police said he also asked for the ISIS flag to be flown in the hospital room.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 charges.
David Patton, a supporter of Saipov, one of the federal public defenders, said that by the prosecutor's decision, "I have clearly lost hope".
"We think that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of a life sentence without the possibility of parole will be very difficult for those involved in these events", Patton said.
The defense team of Saipov requested the prosecutor's office not to ask for the death penalty.
Tory MP thinks Brexit talks should be left to NAIJEL FARAJGA
Nigel Faraj promised to "mobilize the people's army" during the protest today at the Tori conference.
The former leader of Ukip said politicians should "feel the heat" from the Euroskeptics - because one of Theresa May's deputies offered her to talk to the European Union.
Conservative ordinary MP Peter Bon said at the Birmingham march that Britain would stay out if Mr. Faraj was Brexit secretary.
But the problem of reconciling Mrs. May's deeply divided ranks was that Tory conservative factions joined the city in a separate anti-Brexite protest.
During the Prime Minister's Brexit campaigns, the anti-Brexit campaigns and the EU's attacks, the Chechens fought for the implementation of the compromise plan.
The Allies said that despite the rejection, he would try to reach a deal with Brussels, forcing the Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between his own package and "chaos".
Mr. Boun said in Solihull that "to leave means to leave", and told the rally participants that he wanted to "leave Checker".
He said that he needed to level the playing field and negotiate with Brussels.
"If he was responsible, we would have gone", she said.
The deputy from Wellingborough added: "I will defend Brexit, but we need to get rid of Checker".
Expressing his opposition to the EU, he said: "We did not fight world wars for submission.
We want to make our own laws in our country".
Bown rejected suggestions that public opinion had changed after the 2016 vote: The idea that British people had changed their minds and wanted to stay was not entirely true.
Tory's Brexit supporter, Andrea Jenkins, also told reporters at the march: That's all I'm saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"Checkers are not popular among the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for them, they are not popular among our party and activists, they really are rioting streets and seeking our election first.
Please drop the Cheekers and start listening.
In his address to May, he added: "Prime Ministers continue their work while keeping their promises".
According to Faraj, if the protesters want to betray the 2016 referendum resolution, they need to work to "feel themselves guilty".
"Now we are talking about trust between the people and our political classes", he said.
"They are trying to betray Brexit, and today we are going to tell them, 'We will not allow you to do this.'
The enthusiast addressed the public and added: "I want you to feel warmly about our political class that is about to betray Brexit.
"We are mobilizing the people's army of this country that won the Brexit, and we will not rest until we have an independent, governed and proud Britain".
Meanwhile, the opposing sides passed through Birmingham, then held a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A small minority of activists arrested banners against Tori's Brexit this week after the group began to work.
Labour leader Lord Adonis derided the Conservatives for the security problems they encountered with the party app at the opening of the conference.
"These people are telling us about the deployment of IT systems, that the technologies that remain in Canada, in Ireland, can be used for unlimited, free trade", he added.
It's only Persian.
There is no good Brexit", he added.
Warren plans to consider his presidential candidacy
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said after the November election that she "was thinking deeply about her candidacy for president".
According to the Boston Globe, the Massachusetts Democrat spoke on Saturday about his future in the western Massachusetts mayoral office.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, contested the November reelection against Republican Rep. Jeff Dilga, who presided over Trump's 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
He was at the center of the rumors that he could fight Trump in 2020.
After the incident occurred on Saturday afternoon, Trump met with the mayoral electorate for the 36th time after entering the administration in Holioc.
The participant asked him if he intended to participate in the presidential race.
Warren replied, "It's time for women to go to Washington and correct our broken government, including the women at the top".
The killer of Sims is arrested
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, reported that a suspect in the murder of U.S. basketball player Wade Sims, a Louisiana State University basketball player, was arrested on Saturday.
Police Department of Baton Rouge reported the arrest of 20-year-old Dayton Simpson at a press conference at 11 a.m.
On Friday, they posted a video of the shooting, asking for help identifying the person in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot in the early hours of Friday outside the campus of Southern University.
"Wade Sims was shot in the head and eventually died", police chief Murphy J. Paul told 247sports journalists on Saturday.
When Wade left to defend his friend, Simpson hit him.
Simpson was interrogated, and it was acknowledged that he was armed and had shot Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and was arrested by the East-Baton-Ruz police department.
The 198-cm-tall boy grew up in Baton Rouge, where Sims played in 32 games of 10 starts last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds.
Russian Grand Prix: Team division helps Lewis Hamilton win the world title by defeating Sebastian Fettel
When Mercedes team Valtteri Bottas was ordered to take Lewis Hamilton to the front of the race on Saturday, it became clear that such a split would play a big role in the race.
Bottтас got off to a good start from the pole and defended his position in the first two turns and helped his teammate by attacking Fettel and not putting Hamilton on the bench.
Futtel got into the boxes, and Hamilton would have stayed at the streamline, which would have been a decisive moment.
Mercedes passed the first round and came out behind Fettel, but Hamilton, after a little wheel-to-wheel, stepped forward: in this way the Ferrari driver, with a double speed, avoided the risk of not being able to defend himself in the third round.
Max Ferстаппен started the last line of the grid, finishing seventh at the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
Then I got to the finish line quickly and Kiimi took the lead, holding the tyres for most of the race, to take the fourth place of Raykkonen.
He eventually entered the 44th round, but as he finished fourth, he was unable to speed up the remaining eight rounds.
It was a very difficult day, because Valtteri did a fantastic job on the weekends and helped me to turn forward like a real gentleman.
The team did a great job of taking first and second place," Hamilton said.
It was a really bad body language .
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Daenne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday for ordering her not to leave a letter accusing Supreme Court candidate Christine Bleizi Ford of raping Bret Kavano.
The president, who spoke at a rally in West Virginia, did not directly appeal Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead explained that the events in the Senate were "evil, disorderly and deceitful".
"The only thing that could happen and the most memorable event in the Senate in recent days is anger, people showing themselves as evil, disorderly and deceitful", he said.
According to the releases and the classified information they had, they said, 'I didn't do it.
I didn't do that.
Do you remember?
Did you get it out?
Remember the answer... Did you spread classified information? - Yes, what?
Oh, no.
I'm not.
You just have to wait.
We were... No, we weren't", he added, as the senator sensed.
A letter was sent to Feinstein detailing the charges against Ford Kavanaugh, and it was circulated to the public in September, but Feinstein denied leaving his office.
"I didn't spread the accusations of Dr. Ford, the incident", said Feinstein to the committee, according to Zee Hill.
He asked me to keep my confidentiality and I kept it
But the president was not pleased with his refusal, and he commented during a Saturday night rally: "I can tell you this, it was really bad body language.
It may not have been, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen.
While continuing to defend the Supreme Court candidate accused of having three female connections, the president believed the Democrats had used these accusations to their advantage.
They need to restore power through various means.
Do you see their evil, their misery, who they make difficult, who they go through, they just need to take power and control", the president said in a statement.
Elite League: Dandi Stars 5: 3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Duayer scored two goals in a match against Dandy.
The Dundee Stars recovered their elite league defeat on Friday against the Belfast Giants on Saturday in Dundee, losing 5-3.
The Giants took the lead with two goals ahead of Patrick Duayer and his batters.
Before Duayer took over the leadership of the Giants, Mike Sullivan and Jordan Kowney were down on the home field.
The score was tied in favour of François Bouchar Dandi, before Lucas Lundwald Nielsen's two goals secured their victory.
In the Elite League, Adam Kiff's pupils suffered three defeats before Dundi won 2-1 on Friday night in Belfast.
This was the fourth meeting of the season for the two teams, who had won three previously.
With the help of Kendall MacFol's pass, given at 3:35, Duayer scored the first goal in the fourth minute with a David Rutherford goal pass, and two minutes later Bovilier doubled the lead.

An aviation dispatcher sacrifices himself to save the lives of more than a hundred people
An Indonesian aviation dispatcher was awarded the title of hero for safely carrying an aircraft with hundreds of people.
More than 800 people died in the tsunami that caused the earthquake on the island of Sulawesi on Friday, many of them missing.
The area was still experiencing severe aftershocks, and many people were unable to get out of the rubble in the city of Palú.
But despite the efforts of his colleagues, 21-year-old António Gunawan refused to leave the well-established dispatcher's hill at the Mutiara Sisi Al-Jufri airport of Agun Palú.
He was then in the position to check that Batik Air's flight 6321 was able to fly safely.
The dispatcher jumped out of the dispatcher's displacement.
He later died in a hospital.
The Indonesian Air Navigation Representative Johannes Syرائit said this step could save hundreds of lives, reports Australia's ABC News.
We had prepared a helicopter from Balippandan to Kalimantan to take her to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palugu.
When we heard this, our hearts were filled with grief".
At the same time, the government fears that the death toll could reach thousands, as the country's natural disaster mitigation agency reports that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Butung is limited.
"The death toll continues to rise, as most of the bodies remain under ruins, many of them cannot be reached", said agency spokesman Supopo Purvo Nuгроho.
The waves, reaching a height of about ten feet, broke Paul down, and on Sunday he was ready for a tomb.
Military and commercial aircraft and aid supplies were carried.
Riisa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: Every minute an ambulance brings a dead body.
There is no clean water.
Minimackets are wrapped.
Jean Geльфанд, head of the Indonesian International Red Cross, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross hastened to help the living, but we don't know what they will find there.
It's already a tragedy, but it could be worse".
Indonesian President Joko Widodo came to Paluga on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask you to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to evacuation.
Are you ready?   CNN report.
Earlier this year, an earthquake struck in Lombok, Indonesia, killing more than 550 people.
Micronesian plane crash: According to Air Niugini, one person was missing after the plane crash in the lagoon
The airline, which was on a flight that crashed into the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, reported missing one person after 47 passengers and crew were reported to have successfully evacuated from the sinking aircraft.
According to Air Niugini, the airline was unable to find a male passenger on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it had worked with local government, hospitals and investigators to locate the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to a request for more information about the age or nationality of the passenger.
After landing at the airport on Truk Island and the plane landing, local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew.
Officials said that seven people were taken to the hospital on Friday.
According to the airline, six passengers remained in hospital on Saturday, and all of them are in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the actual sequence of events remained unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in a lagoon near the runway.
Some witnesses believe the plane flew over the edge of the runway.
American passenger Bill Jens told me that the plane went down very low.
That's great," said Jane.
According to Jane's, the water was a stretch of land that he and others could use to get out of the plane's emergency exit.
He told me about the fear and screams of the flight attendants and that he had suffered minor head injuries.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors who worked nearby to improve the sea also helped rescue the aircraft before it sank to a depth of 30 meters (100 feet).
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in aviation accidents recorded in the PNG over the past two decades, but none of them have been in contact with Air Niugini.
Analyst shows the chronology of the night the woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecutor's office reopened the case of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Roullet testified for several hours as an expert witness in a reconnaissance analysis.
He told the jury how the 29-year-old accused, Quinton Tellis, and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, used cell phone tapes to collect their movements together on the night of their death.
Roullet said that he had shown Chambers from several cell phones that he was with Tellis on the night of her death - a fact that contradicts her previous statements, reports The Clarion Ledger.
The information showed that his cell phone was with Chambers, but Tellis said he was with his friend Michael Sanford; the police agreed to speak to Sanford.
Sanford said that I had been out of town on Saturday.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was in Sanford's car, Sanford said, "He's a liar, because my car was in Nashville that night".
Another mishap - Tellis told Chambers that she knew him about two weeks after his death.
According to cell phone records, they had known each other for only a week.
According to Roullet, some time after Chambers' death, Telllis deleted Chambers' messages, calls, and contact details from her phone.
"He wiped her out of his life", said Hale.
The final argument for the draft is due to begin on Sunday.
The judge said that he was waiting for the jury's hearing that same day.

Another black man?!
New York nursing home sued for taking her family from work for writing a racistic text
A New York babysitter who was fired from a discriminatory job and summoned her family to court took a text sent out loud, in which the mother wrote: This is another black man.
The family rejected the racist position, comparing the court process to "seizure".
The mother of two, Linsi Plasko-Flacksman, was devastated when her new babysitter, Giselle Morris, arrived on her first day of work in 2016 to learn that she was black.
She wrote to her husband, Lincy Placo-Flacksman, "Without a smile, without a black body".
But instead of sending the text to her husband, she sent it to Maurice twice.
Realizing his negligence, "uncomfortable" Placo-Flexman fired Morris for doing badly for their departing African-American worker and instead they waited for his Filipino wife, says the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for a day's work and returned home with Uber.
Morris now sued his family for firing him and, although without a contract, asked for $350 compensation per day for the six-month house he had initially hired.
I'm going to make them think that this is not working", he told Post on Friday, It's discrimination, he added.
The family responded that they were racist, and that hiring Morris was the right move, fearing that we would not believe him after he had offended her.
My wife sent something she didn't want to say.
He is not a racist.
We are not racists," her husband Joel Plaско told Post.
Or would you, even though you are ignorant, hand over your children to a man who is cruel to you?
A newborn child?
See what I'm saying?"
Comparing the trial to a "robbery", Placo said that his wife was only two months away from giving birth and that she was "in a very difficult condition".
Would you follow such a man?
This is not a very good job", the investment banker added.
The trial is still ongoing, with a public court quickly condemning the couple via social media, criticizing them for their behavior and logic.
New letter says Paddington publishers won't accept student-spoken noise
Born after the book was accepted, Bond's daughter Karen Jankeel wrote: "It is difficult to put yourself in the place of someone who first read it before it was published.
It's interesting to know about Paddington's great successes now".
He told her that his father's little toy bear inspired him to write a children's book, that he would be optimistic about the rejection of his job, and that it was "heavy-patchy" to celebrate 60 years since he had taken his father on the last road last year.
She called Paddington "a very important member of our family", and her father calmly added that he was proud of her achievements.
"He was a very calm man", she said, "not a boastful one".
Perhaps Paddington was real to her, like a successful kid: you're proud, but you have no part here.
I think that's how he felt about Paddington's success.
Although this was his dream and his creativity, he gave Paddington a proper assessment".
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye over the phone
When she landed, she was taken to Louis Pasteur's 2nd hospital - where doctors tried to save her life.
Nэд was often called and informed that his condition was bad and he could not be helped", said Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then Ned called me, he was going to die in the next two minutes, and I was supposed to say goodbye to him.
I said goodbye.
I said, Tashi, my daughter, I love you so much.
I'll see you soon.
I will be with you.
His heart continued to function, and he slowly stopped taking the medication he had been prescribed.
After a short time, he died, and everything stopped.
I had to sit back and wait, knowing that this had happened.
I could not weep, cry, or mourn, because I was in the house and among the people.
I really shouldn't have been a weaver.
At the last line, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, mourning the loss of her daughter, sat on the plane with all the passengers, forgetting the trials she had passed.
"No one knows", he replied.
I kept my head down, and tears were always flowing.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight I felt compassion for Ned.
That she needed my love and understanding.
I knew that he loved my daughter very much.
Postcards for mourning women to avoid suicide in print
Two women who have lost their suicidal loved ones try to help others avoid suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphries placed inspirational messages and postcards with phone numbers on the Welsh Bridge to call for help.
Davis' son Tyler suffered from depression at age 13 and committed suicide at age 18.
"I don't want my parents to feel like me every day", she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lidney, told me that her son was a hopeful chef with a smile on his face.
He was known to everyone for his smile.
Everyone seemed to be lightening up the room with her smile".
Yet before his death he had no work, for he was "truly in the dark places".
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old brother was found dead after his older brother committed suicide.
Davis says, "I worry every day that this will leave some strong impression".
Although Davis was friendly with people, he made postcards to let them know if there were any people to talk to.
Do not sit down and talk".
Mrs. Humphries, a longtime friend of Davis, lost her 15-year life partner Mark shortly after her mother's death.
"He told her that she was troubled, and she did not tell him that she was in a state of confusion".
 A few days before Christmas, we saw how his attitude had changed.
It was like he was in the barn at Christmas time. When he opened the presents, he didn't even look at them".
His death was a great blow to them, but they must overcome this: "This house is rife.
That's what separates us.
But we all have to keep going and fight".

The future of Brett Kavano is on the line, the Federal Bureau of Investigation begins work.
"I thought if I could get what he asked for - a limited time, limited investigation - we would be able to bring some interaction", Flake said on Saturday, expressing his fear that the committee was "in a disarray" against the background of the entrenched guerrilla end.
Why did Kavano and his Republican supporters not want an FBI investigation?
Their refusal is time-related.
The midterm elections on November 6 are just five weeks away - if the Republicans behave badly, they will be weakened in their efforts to accept a candidate for the country's highest court.
Kawano worked for George Bush at the White House and met his current wife, Ashley, who was Bush's secretary through Bush.
What happens after the FBI reports?
Currently, elections are held in the Senate, which has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet known whether Kawano will be able to get at least 50 votes in the Senate chamber, which will allow Vice President Mike Peska to stop the race and confirm it in the Supreme Court.
North Korean refugees under Kim are down by 6 percent
According to the South Korean deputy, the arrival of Kim Jong-un to power has reduced the number of refugees from North Korea arriving in South Korea.
Based on the data of the Ministry of Southern Integration, Pak Bён Сок reported that last year there were only 1127 refugees compared to 2706 in 2011.
Mr. Pak said that the strengthening of border controls between North Korea and China and the increase in tariffs for smugglers were key factors.
Pyongyang did not explain to the people.
Most of the people from the North were eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says that more than 30,000 North Koreans have been excessively illegally deported since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them crossed China, the longest border with North Korea, more easily than the well-preserved demilitarized zone between the two Koreas.
China considers refugees to be illegal migrants rather than refugees and often makes them return to their homes.
North and South sides still fought, but their relations improved markedly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries stayed in Phennia and met for talks on denuclearization.
This was after a historic meeting in Singapore in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un, who agreed to build a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yonho accused the U.S. sanctions of not making progress since then.
"Without any confidence in the United States, we will not have national security, and under these conditions we cannot unilaterally disarm", Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Bret Kawano "hysterical", and she declared him unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Minority leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court candidate Bret Kavano "hysterical" and temperamentally declared him unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi said this in an interview with the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas, on Saturday.
I can't imagine that if a woman behaved like this, they would call her a hysterical person, - said Pelosi about her reaction to Kavano's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavano emotionally denied the allegations that Dr. Christine Baizik raped Ford when she was young.
In the opening words, Kawano was very emotional, sometimes screaming and in pain, and he talked about his family and school years.
He also relentlessly condemned the Democrats in the committee and called the charges against him "a very bizarre and coordinated murder" - which, according to him, was organized by liberals who were unhappy with Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential defeat.
Pelosi believed that Kavano's testimony showed that he was anti-democratic, and therefore unable to serve on the Supreme Court.
"I think he's disqualified by such messages in a way that means Clinton and Democrats", he said.
Pelosi opposed the impeachment of Kavanaugh, and asked if Democrats would win a majority in the House.
"I say this - if he doesn't tell the Congress or the FBI the truth, he shouldn't be in the Supreme Court, but in the court that exists now", Pelosi said.
Kawano is currently a judge of the District Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, he was concerned about Kavanaugh's potential decisions against the "Easier Medical Care" law or Rowe Wade, who was considered a conservative judge.
During the hearings, Kawano did not answer questions about whether to overturn some of the decisions of the Supreme Court.
"This is not the time for a hysterical, prejudiced person to go to court and say, 'Everything is fine,'" Pelosi said.
Women and girls should have them.
It's a just diatribe, angry months and years, that she can't hold back from crying.
"We cry when we are angry", Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's that simple, is it?"
She continued, "One of the women who was a supervisor helped me a lot, and she would cry when she got angry, but when she got angry and started crying, she used the technique to tell this man, saying, 'You might think I'm crying too, but I'm crying.
I was angry.
And then he moved on.
I think that's amazing.
Because of the lack of understanding, tears are allowed as a partial source of revelation.
One of the most memorable memories of my male-dominated office work was that when I once cried with an indescribable rage, an old woman - a cold leader - who I was always a little scared of - grabbed me and dragged me into the podåz.
"Do not tell anyone what you have heard. " He told me.
They do not know that you are angry.
They will think you are sad and will rejoice because they have brought you down.
At the time, Democratic congressman from Colorado Patricia Schröder served with Gary Hart during his presidential election.
In 1987, after Mr. Hart had dropped out of the race after a relationship with a man on a boat called Monkey Business, Mrs. Schrёder, very disappointed, decided that there was no reason she hadn't thought of forcing herself to become president.
It was an unthinkable decision," he laughs at me 30 years later.
There were seven candidates in the race, and they didn't need another one.
Some called it "Beloснежка and the Seven Gnomes".
Because the campaign was late, he lagged behind in raising money, so he vowed not to compete unless he raised $2 million.
It was a losing battle.
He found that some of his supporters who gave the men $1,000 only gave him $250.
"Do they think I'll get a discharge?" he thought.
When she announced that she would not participate in the official campaign, she felt this way - she was so desperate for gratitude to those who supported her, for the system of collecting money and attracting voters, not delegates, and for the openness to sexuality - she breathed.
"You'd think my nerves were upset", said Schrёder about the press' reaction to him.
"You thought Kleenex was my corporate contribution.
What will they do to put my tomb?
He cried?
How the US-China trade war can benefit Beijing
Experts believe that the first steps of the US-China trade war were sound, and that the conflict between the two countries could be of long-term benefit to Beijing, even though the war is not over.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued the first warning earlier this year that China would tax its main exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation was this week with new tariffs affecting 200 billion dollar (150 billion euros) worth of goods, resulting in a tax on half of all goods imported into the United States from China.
Beijing has always responded in the same way: recently it added five to ten percent tariffs on 60 billion dollars worth of goods.
China has promised to stay with the United States, and the second-highest economy on earth is likely not going to disappear anytime soon.
Restricting Washington would mean giving in to demands, but it would be very embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping to publicly worship the United States.
But, if Beijing can play its cards correctly, U.S. trade war pressure can provide a long-term good support for China, reducing the interconnectedness of the two economies, experts say.
"If rapid political decision-making in Washington or Beijing could create economic conditions in different countries, observers would be much more dangerous than that", said Abigail Grace, Asia researcher at the new American Security Center, analytics center.
Foreign Minister says Syria is "ready" to return refugees
Syria is reportedly ready for the free return of refugees and is seeking help in the reconstruction of a country devastated by more than seven years of war.
Foreign Minister Walid Al-Mughalim, who spoke at the United Nations General Assembly, noted the improvement in the conditions in the country.
"Today, the earth is more stable and safe because of the progress made in the fight against terrorism", he said.
The authorities continued to rebuild areas destroyed by terrorists to restore a normal life.
Due to terrorism and some economic measures against everyday life and lifestyle, all conditions were created for the free return of refugees to the country.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million people fled Syria since the start of the war in 2011.
There are six million people in need of humanitarian assistance in the country.
Al-Mu'alim said the media would support the Syrian regime in rebuilding the ruined country.
But he found that he would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that supported the attackers.
Paris won the European Ryder Cup
In 2018, the European team won the Ryder Cup in Paris, France, at the Le Golf National, defeating the US team by a score of 16,5-10,5.
The U.S. lost six straight European titles and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
The team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn won the European crown after scoring the necessary 14.5 points to beat the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mikelson, who wrestled most of the tournament, threw the ball into the water in the 3rd pair of 16th lunka, thus winning the match to Franчесco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari excelled in all his tours, with the current tournament format being a 1-4 player that went 5-0-0 since 1979.
American Jordan Smith defeated the lowest-ranked player in the European team, Dania Torbjern Olesen, 5-4.
World's best player, Dustin Johnson, was defeated 2-1, by England, who had last played in the Ryder Cup, against Jan Pultter.
A veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spain's Serhio Garcia was the best winner of the European Tour with a career tally of 25.5.
"I don't usually cry, but I can't help myself today.
It was a difficult year.
So I want to thank Thomas for choosing me and for trusting me.
I am so happy, so happy that the cup is back.
It's about the team, and I'm so happy that I can help", Garcia said emotionally after winning in Europe.
He gave the torch to fellow American golfer John Ramm, who won the American golf legend Tiger Woods on Sunday in singles golf by a score of 2 to 1.
"I'm proud of Tiger Woods' win because I grew up watching this guy", said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a Ryder Cup record of 13-21-3.
He won 14 major titles, only Jack Nicklaus was able to beat, a rare statistic for one of the greatest players of all time.
The U.S. team was trying to find the ferways over the weekend, leaving Patrick Reid, Justin Thomas and Tony Finals behind, who played high-level golf in the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furic said after the team's disappointing performance, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
There was a time when Europe was warming up a little bit in the morning.
We gave up.
I cut my hat in front of Thomas.
He is a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We're going to unite, we're going to work with the Ryder Cup Committee of America, we're going to move forward.
I love these 12 young men and am proud to serve as a captain.
You must do your job.
We were defeated".
