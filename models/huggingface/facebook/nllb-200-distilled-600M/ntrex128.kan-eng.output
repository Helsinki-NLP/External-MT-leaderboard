Welsh AMs are concerned about 'looking like a fool'
Some AMs are concerned about the suggestion to change their titles to MWPs (Members of the Welsh Parliament).
The problem arose from plans to change the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
AMs across the political spectrum have expressed concern that this decision could be ridiculed.
"It's a twp and a pwp", said one Labour AM, "which has caused concern in their group".
For readers outside Wales: Twp means foolishness in Welsh and pwp means mala.
One playmate AM said the group was "dissatisfied" and suggested alternative names.
One Welsh Conservative said his group had an "open mind" about changing the name, but also said it was just another form of moping or being stupid from MWP.
In this case, Yorkshire pronounces the Welsh letter w as u in English.
The Assembly Commission, which is preparing legislation to change the current names, said: "The final decision on the details of what members of the Assembly should be called is to be made by the members themselves".
The Government of Wales Act 2017, authorised the Welsh Legislative Assembly to change its name.
In June the Commission published a public opinion on the proposals, which revealed that there was strong support for the legislature to be called the Welsh Parliament.
The Commission, for the title of AMs, was in favour of the name of Welsh Parliamentarians or WMPs, but the name MWP was the most popular public support.
As the AMs suggest alternative options, but a unanimous decision could be a headache for the incumbent officer, Ellen Jones, who is expected to submit a draft copy of the legislation on the changes within a few weeks.
The legislation on reforms will include other changes to the functioning of the Legislative Assembly, including rules to disqualify AMs and the design of the committee system.
AMs have the right to vote in the final vote on the question of what they should be called when discussing legislation.
Macedonians vote to hold a referendum on changing the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday to decide whether or not to change their country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The referendum was held to settle a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which had its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has also insisted that the name of its northern neighbour represents ownership of its territory and has objected to its efforts to become a member of the EU and NATO from above.
President of Macedonia, Gyorgi Ivanov, who opposes the vote to change the name, said he did not respect the vote.
However, popular voters including Prime Minister Zoran Zayev argue that changing the name is the price of EU and NATO membership.
St. Martin's bells are silent as Harlem churches struggle.
The elderly who spoke to me say that historically, there was a bar and a church in every corner.
"Today, there are neither".
He said that bars can understand the mystique.
He said that people today are interacting in different ways.
Today bars are no longer the comfortable houses that people visit regularly.
As for churches, they worry that the money they have sold will not last as long as the leaders thought, and that not today, but tomorrow they will return to where they started.
He further said that the churches could be removed and apartment buildings with condominiums could be built and people who do not have the inclination to help their neighbors could live in these buildings.
Most of the people who buy condominiums in these buildings are white and want the day when these churches close together to come soon, because people who come to live in these condominiums say that it is far from being a member of these churches.
Both churches were built by white religious groups before Harlem became the capital of the Black - that is, before becoming a metropolitan community in 1870 and St. Martin's becoming such a community decades later.
The original white Methodist religious group left in the 1930s.
A religious group of black worshippers who were nearby took possession of the building.
The Rev. John Howard Johnson led a black religious group that took over St. Martin's. The Rev. John Howard Johnson led a struggle against the retailers on 125th Street, Harlem's main street, who refused to hire or promote black people.
The building was badly damaged in a fire disaster in 1939. But Father Johnson's parish followers had plans to rebuild the building, so Carillon took over the job.
Father Johnson's son and St. Martin's heir, the Reverend David Johnson, proudly called Carillon "the hours of the poor".
In July, experts who played Carillon called it a different name: "cultural property" and "irreplaceable historical instrument".
It was also the world's first carillon played by a black musician, Dinisio A. Lind, said Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan. Lind moved to Riverside Church 18 years ago to play an even bigger carillon.
According to the Hon. Meriwether, St. Martins did not replace him.
The situation in St. Martin's over the past few months has been one of complexity for architects and contractors, some of whom were called by lay leaders of the church, others by the Episcopal Diocese.
In July, the governing body of the parish of Le Lédère, Westry, wrote to the diocese expressing its concern that while the diocese has no responsibility whatsoever to hire architects and contractors who send the diocese, the diocese is directing Westry to pay its costs.
Some parishioners complained that the role of the diocese was not transparent.
A shark injured a 13-year-old boy while diving in a labster in California
Officials said a 13-year-old boy who jumped into the water on the day the labster was caught in California, the opening day of the labster season, was attacked and injured by a shark.
The attack occurred shortly before 7 a.m. near Bacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Speaking to KSWB-TV in San Diego, Chad Hamle said he heard a boy shout for help while diving for about half an hour with friends on Saturday morning and went aboard a boat with a group to get the boy out of the water.
"At first, Hamel thought it was the exclamation of the boy holding the lab star, but when he listened carefully, he realized that he was shouting in pain, 'I've been bitten!'
I was bitten!'
And Hamel came near to the boy, and saw him, and said, Behold, his neck is broken.
"I called out to everyone out of the water: 'There is a shark in the water!'" Hamel continued.
The boy was taken by helicopter to Reddy Children's Hospital in San Diego and his condition is critical, the hospital said.
It was not known which species of shark was responsible for the attack.
Speaking to the media, Life Guard Captain Larry Jales said a shark had appeared in the area a few weeks ago, but it was confirmed that it was not a threatened species.
Further explaining, Jails said the victim had traumatic injuries to the upper part of his body.
For interrogation and security purposes, beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swamies in Esinitas was closed for 48 hours.
There are 135 species of sharks in the area, most of which are not considered endangered, Jails said.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK beauty market
It will also offer strong competition to boots, super drugs and debannums through its department store-style, skilled assistant-led beauty eels.
The firm, which is entering the UK's ever-growing £2.8bn beauty enhancement market with declining sales of fashion and homeware, will set up and test its largest beauty isles in 11 stores across the country and aims to open more stores next year if it passes the test.
Supermarkets are competing to use the space reserved for TVs, microwaves and homewares for cosmetics, and investments in cosmetics are now being made.
For the first time, SANSBRIES has announced plans to offer 3,000 beauty products including brands like Revlon, SC, Twizer Man and Dr. Papa.
Currently in use, Loreal, Mabelin and Bert's Beas products also have a brand status similar to those found in shops such as Boots.
The supermarket is also reestablishing its boutique make-up line with the aim of selling vegetarian-friendly products in bulk.
Fragrans will also discount one of the two stores in Sainsbury's, Croydon, South London, which opened last week and the second store in Sellie Oak, Birmingham, which will open later this year.
In these days, with the growing practice of online shopping and buying small food items from convenience stores every day, it is necessary to work hard to convince people to visit supermarkets.
According to Mike Coop, CEO of Sainsbury's, their outlets will often look like department stores and supermarket chains will compete with the competing Aldi and Liddle by offering more services and discounted non-food items.
SANSBURIS has been putting outlets in hundreds of stores and has also introduced several Habitates which bought both ranges two years ago, which has led to increased grocery sales and thus making more profits from the stores' purchases.
In the past, the supermarket's efforts to revive its cosmetics and pharmaceutical divisions have failed.
Sainsbury's began a joint venture with Boots in early 2000, but the collaboration between them ended due to a contentious dispute over how to share the revenue from drugstores in its supermarkets.
Sainsbury's set out a new strategy after selling its 281-store pharmaceutical business three years ago to Cecilia, owner of Lloyd's Pharmacy Stores, for £125 million.
Lloyds will play a key role in the project by adding more luxury skincare brands including La Roche-Pose and Veissi in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sales Director at Sainsbury's, said: "We have transformed the look and feel of our beauty isles to give a more glossy store environment for our customers.
We have also invested a lot in providing special training to our colleagues who are always available to advise.
Our range of brands is designed to meet everyone's needs and with a charming atmosphere and convenient locations, we have emerged as a hub of old-fashioned, self-aware beauty products".
Peter Jones, a 'underground' because of the current exit from the £11 deal
TV presenter Holly Wilby has been fired after Dragons Den pulled out of Peter Jones' £11 million £11 million lifestyle brand deal with plans to deal with her new leases with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Villaby has no time for his brand of homewares and accessories, Truly.
The pair's business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old anchor of this morning's show told Instagram that she was going out of the deal.
Jones was angered when Dragons Den withdrew from the lucrative lifestyle brand business deal with Peter Jones, who is currently working on her new bumper lease with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources said Jones was angry at the news after a critical meeting at Jones's business office in Marlow, Hampshire, on Tuesday, said that TV's golden girl could not afford time for Jones's homewear and accessories brand trouley due to her new £1.5m business deal.
The deal was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was estimated to increase Wilby's assets by £11 million.
Recently, 37-year-old Wilby announced on Instagram that he was leaving Truly, and Jones left the UK for his holiday home.
According to one source: "Hali always gave priority to the trout.
It supported her future for a long time and kept her popularity going for a few more decades.
Her decision to withdraw from the contract thus surprised all concerned.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, since the launch was scheduled for the next day.
The GoDown at Marlowe HQ is packed with ready-to-sell goods".
Experts believe the departure of the host of Britain's most popular show This Morning will cause millions of noise damage and further delay its launch, as the company has invested heavily in clothing and homewares ranging from cushions and candles.
And this can end a long-standing friendship.
Jones and his wife Tara Cap have known Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin for ten years.
Along with Wilby and Cap, he co-founded Truly in 2016 and Jones, 52, took over as president in March.
The pair spend the holidays together and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in the Bold Wins TV production company.
Wilby will be a brand ambassador for M&S and a presenter in the Ant-Mac Partlin space, host of the upcoming ITV show I Am a Celebrity M.
Last night, a person close to Jones said, "We don't like to comment on his business operations".
The first rough words were, 'Then we started to love.'
He joked that the news media would criticize him for making a note that some consider unfit for the presidency and for having such a positive opinion about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said in a tongue-in-cheek tone in the voice of his "news anchor"
"I have not left anything behind".
He said Kim was keen to meet for the second time after his first visit to Singapore in June, and Trump called it a big step towards making North Korea a nuclear-free nation.
But the talks on de-nuclear are broken.
Three months after the summit in Singapore in June, North Korean high-level ambassador Ryang Ho told world leaders meeting at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the US had "not responded appropriately" when North Korea had previously decided to take arms embargo measures.
Instead, he said, the US aims to increase pressure by imposing sanctions.
Trump expressed a more optimistic attitude in his Yali address.
"Our relations with North Korea are very good", he said.
"We had the idea of war with North Korea.
Millions of people were killed.
Our relations are now in excellent condition".
He said that the efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results, which will enable the completion of rocket tests, facilitate the release of hostages and bring back the remains of American soldiers to their homeland.
He also spoke about his relationship with Kim and supported his unusual behavior.
Trump, reaching out directly to the crowd in front of him, said, "It's easy to be president, but instead of helping 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded space, we want to let about 200 people stay there".
The Indonesian tsunami and earthquake devastated the island, killing hundreds of people.
For example, they were told that after the earthquake in Lombok, no foreign NGOs were needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population was evacuated, it did not declare a national disaster necessary for international assistance.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it very clear that they do not need international assistance, so this is a bit of a challenge", said Q. Sumbong.
While a team is preparing to travel to Save the Children Palu, it is not certain whether foreign personnel will work on the ground.
Shri Sutopore, spokesperson for the National Disaster Agency, said: Indonesian authorities are evaluating the situation to see if international agencies will be allowed to contribute to the relief effort.
Despite the ongoing earthquakes in Indonesia, it is clear that the country is not prepared to deal with a natural disaster.
Tsunami housing has been built in Ashe, but it is very rare to find them in coastal areas.
Although the tsunami was expected, the lack of tsunami warning sirens in Palu prevented the loss of lives.
In normal times, traveling between many of Indonesia's islands is challenging.
Natural disasters make transportation more difficult.
A hospital in Lombok has travelled to the ship's port to treat the earthquake victims, but it will take at least three days to reach the new disaster site.
President Joko Widodo had focused his campaign on improving Indonesia's poor infrastructure, and thus spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
But Joco is running out of money for re-election next year.
The Joko is also facing sectarian riots in Indonesia, with many Muslim community members following their narrow view of the faith.
Christian and Muslim gangs clashed in the streets with machetes, arrows, and arrows, as well as other weapons of mass destruction, killing more than 1,000 people and driving thousands away from their homes.
View: Daniel Stirridge of Liverpool scored an amazing goal against Chelsea
Daniel Stridge missed out on a loss to Liverpool Pool Chelsea in the 89th minute of the Football Premier League on Saturday at Stanford Bridge, London.
If it was a 1-0 goal, Stirridge had received a pass from Jer Dan Shakire when Chelsea were about 30 yards out of goal.
He tapped it to his left before scooping the ball to a distant post.
Because of his tightness, the ball bounced higher than the box and fell to the top right corner of the net.
Finally the ball jumped over the head of Kepa Arizabalan who was jumping to stop it and fell into the net.
"I was trying to get the ball in control by standing in a proper position and players like Shock always play the ball as far as possible, so I tried to get as much time as possible", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Canté approaching, but I touched only once and then wet the ball".
Chelsea scored 1-0 in halftime as Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The Blues striker hit the ball to Matteo Kovacic before heading to midfield and running towards the Liverpool pool.
Kowasik made a quick give-and-go in the midfield.
Then he threw the ball very beautifully and made the Hazard fall into the box.
Hazard also went to the tip of the post-network and pulled the ball from his left foot to make it past Allison Baker of the Liver Pool.
Liverpool will face Napoli at the Champions League group stage at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy, on Wednesday afternoon at 3pm.
Chelsea will face the Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3pm in London.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has risen to 832.
The country's disaster agency said on Sunday morning that the death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832.
The 7.5 magnitude quake on Friday created waves of 20 feet high and many people were trapped under the rubber pile of collapsed buildings, agency spokesman Sutopo Purvo Ngrogoho told a news conference.
The city of Palu, with a population of over 380,000, was filled with rubber waste from collapsed buildings.
A 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder after a woman died from a sword.
A murder investigation has been launched after a woman's body was found in Burkan Head, Merseyside this morning.
The body of a 44-year-old woman found near Grayson Museum at 7.55am on John Street was found to be from wounds sustained by a gunman.
Police have urged people in the area to tell them if they have heard or seen anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: 'The investigation is in the early stages, although I would ask you to contact us if you see or hear anything suspicious on John Street in Burknham.
Also, the main thing to ask taxi drivers is that they may have captured something from the dash cam footage of their vehicle that could provide important information for our investigation.
The woman whose body was found was a resident of Burkan Head and her body was found in the grounds of a property, police spokesman said.
Friends of the deceased woman arrived at the scene this afternoon and asked where the body was found this morning.
The police said that the inquiries were ongoing and that the police had tried to inform the close relatives of the deceased.
A taxi driver at Grayson Muse tried to enter his flat but no one was allowed to enter or leave the building, police said.
He knew what had happened there, and he kept silent.
Residents will be allowed inside the building in a few hours.
I was told by a police officer that the entire area is being treated as a crime scene.
A woman came to the scene with tears in her eyes.
'It was a terrible event,' she says from above.
By 2 pm, if two police vans were inside the cordon or police fence, another van was standing outside.
Several police officers under the Cordon were monitoring the blocks of flats.
Any person with information will be asked to DM @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact CrimeStapper anonymously by entering log 247 of 30th September at 0800 555 111.
The Cramwell Statue of Parliament is a recent 'New History Creating' memorial to the controversy
The ban would have provided justice for many of the cultural and religious artifacts of England destroyed by Cramwell's mad Puritan followers in the Taliban-style.
But the Crick's advice was described by the Cramwell Society as "stupid" and an "attempt to distort history".
John Gold Smith, president of the Cramwell Society, said: "It was necessary to discuss in the current debate that the statue of Oliver Cramwell outside the Palace of Westminster would be the subject of controversy.
Cramwell did not command or execute the sculpture-painting operation during the English Civil Wars.
Cramwell's ancestor in the previous century may have sacrificed him for his acts.
Sir William Hameau Thorncroft represented Cramwell as a mirror of 19th century public opinion and a part of the history of personality that many believe can be revered today.
The late 19th century was a time when Cromwell was highly respected, as he worked to protect Parliament from the external pressures of the monarchy.
But whether it is fully accurately represented is a subject of ongoing historical debate.
The conflict of the mid-17th century led to the further development of our nation, and the only known figure representing one side of that division is Cramwell.
His achievements as Lord Protector should be celebrated and remembered".
A Chinese farmer was bitten and killed by a murderous pig
According to local media reports, a pig attacked and killed a farmer in a market in southwestern China.
The man, who had been bloodied at a piggy yard in Lupen-Shui, Ghizhou province, was identified only by his nickname "Yuan" and had his arteries cut off, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, a farmer in Xining, Qinghai Province, China, prepared to vaccinate all pigs in a pig farm.
According to one report, he came to the market on Wednesday from neighboring Yunnan province with his cousin to sell 15 pigs.
The next morning, his brother's relative saw the corpse and saw the doors of the piggy barn open next door.
He told the pig that the pig's mouth was covered with blood.
According to the report, a forensic examination confirmed that a 550-pound pig bit the farmer.
"My brother's legs were covered in blood and disfigured", said Jiang Ewing, a relative of the deceased, nicknamed "Wu", to the Evening News.
Security camera footage showed Yuan going to the market at 4.40 am on Thursday to feed his pigs.
About an hour later his body was found.
The animal that killed Yuan was not his or his cousin's.
While police were gathering evidence at the scene, the pig was detained to prevent anyone from attacking, market manager Evening News told.
According to reports, Yuan's family members and market officials have been in talks to make compensation for his death.
Although such incidents are rare, there have been previous reports of pig attacks on humans.
In 2016, a pig in Massachusetts attacked a woman and her husband in their garden and severely injured the man's chest.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig farmer in Wales was scared to death by his wife when she tried to hurt him near his tractor.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, pigs are not usually inclined to attack, but the taste of blood can "trigger" them, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News.
"They're playing.
They're like little children, very curious... they're not meant to hurt you.
If you show them proper respect, that is enough".
Hurricane Rosa is expected to cause heavy rainfall in the southwestern US.
According to weather forecasts, the intensity of Hurricane Rosa is waning as it winds against the cool waters of Mexico's northern coast.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will bring heavy rains throughout northern Mexico and the southwestern US.
As of 5 a.m. eastern time on Sunday morning, Rosa was a Category 1 hurricane, with winds of 85 mph, and was seen as far southwest as 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, the ring is taking shape over the Pacific Ocean and heading eastward toward the west coast of the US. A tropical storm will approach the island of Baja California on Monday, penetrating the southwestern US and pushing tropical moisture northward.
Rosa will rain 10 inches of rain on Monday in parts of Mexico.
Subsequent tropical humidity in response to the approaching storm will bring widespread rainfall in the southwest in the coming days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rainfall in the desert creates a dangerous mahapura, causing waste to spill and landslides.
Extreme tropical humidity causes rainfall of 2 to 3 inches per hour, mainly in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in the southwest, primarily in much of Arizona.
Tropical rainfall is expected to cause flooding due to falling conditions.
It is very dangerous to wander on foot in the desert because of tropical rain.
Heavy rainfall causes deep canyons to turn into steep rivers and thunderstorms cause locally strong winds and dust to appear.
The approaching spiral storm will bring heavy rainfall locally along the coastline of Southern California.
A little more than half an inch of rain could cause some waste to flow and make roads slippery.
This will be the first rainy season in the region.
Some tropical rainfall springs head to Arizona on Sunday evening and Monday morning, then spread everywhere on Monday and Tuesday evenings.
Heavy rainfall will continue from Tuesday to Wednesday in all four directions.
Arctic cooling in October will cause temperature fluctuations throughout the US, while warmer climates in the tropics will continue.
Sometimes this causes large changes in temperature at short intervals.
Several variations in temperature were observed in the central US on Sunday.
Temperature variations are expected to be 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, as well as St. Louis and De Moyne, Iowa.
In the coming days, summer heat will continue to spread and spread widely.
The central and eastern parts of the US are expected to start in October with warmer temperatures, and temperatures from the southern plains to the northeastern parts are expected to reach 80 degrees.
New York City will reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows that the early days of October are likely to be higher than average temperatures in the eastern US.
The court hearing of Brett Kevanno was watched by more than 20 million people
The exciting testimony of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kevanno and his wife, Christine Blasey Ford, accused of sexual assault in 1980 was watched by more than 20 million people on six television networks.
Meanwhile, political strife continued by preventing broadcasters from broadcasting the hearing, which was set to end on Friday: the result of an agreement with Arizona Senator Jeff Flake to conduct a weeklong trial on the allegations.
She told the Ford Senate Judiciary Committee that it was 100 percent true that Kewano grabbed her while drunk and tried to take her clothes off at a high school party.
Kevano said in his strong testimony that it was 100% true that it did not happen.
More than 20.4 million people have been able to watch it, as Nielsen reported on Friday.
The company was calculating average viewing rates for CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available to other networks, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, which broadcast the evidence.
And Nelson often has a bit of a problem counting the number of people watching in offices.
In one sense, the number of viewers watching the interview was the same as the number of viewers watching a football game or Academy Awards.
Several people on the Fox News Channel have expressed support for Kevanno's appointment, Nelson said, leading all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the entire day's court hearing.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
Nielsen said CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, and that the company had a net loss of $1.7 billion.
After the hearing, the interest of the people doubled.
Flake was the focus of the Dombrata on Friday.
After a statement from the General Republican Office that he voted for Kevano was released, he was targeted by CNN and CBS cameras as he entered the elevator on Friday morning to attend a judicial committee hearing and opponents shouted out slogans against him.
He did not look up for several minutes because he was humiliated during a live broadcast on CNN.
One woman said: "I am standing here with you".
"Do you think he speaks the truth in the country?
He was told, "When so many women are weak, you are strong".
According to Flack, a statement was issued from his office and he said he had a lot to say at the panel hearing before the elevator doors closed.
Cable and broadcast networks then broadcast live, with the Judiciary Committee voting to send the entire Senate to vote on the matter of Kevanno's nomination.
But Flake said he would only do so with the understanding that the FBI will investigate the allegations against the nominees next week at the request of the minority Democratic Party.
Flake was partially persuaded by a speech by his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and then several senators, Flake made his decision.
The Flake decision was strong, as it was clear that Republicans could not vote to approve Kevanno until the trial was over.
President Trump has assigned the FBI to investigate allegations against Kevano.
British Prime Minister May accused critics of 'playing a political game' on Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of "playing a political game" against the backdrop of her plans to leave the European Union, regardless of Britain's future and national interest.
Prime Minister Theresa May has visited the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
In an interview published alongside May's interview on the front page of the newspaper, his former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, said May's statement that the Chechers have a Brexit plan and that Britain and the EU should collect their tariffs was "completely absurd".
Wade Sims shooting case: Police arrested suspected Dayton Simpson in connection with LSU player's death
Police have arrested a suspect in connection with the case of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player who was fatally shot at LSU.
Baton Rouge Police Department said 20-year-old Dayton Simpson has been arrested on suspicion of second-degree murder and is being charged with murder.
Officials released a video of the collision between Sims and Simpson and said Sims lost his glasses during the collision.
The CBS affiliate WAFB reported that police found glasses at the scene and said Simpson's DNA was found on it.
After Simpson was questioned, police said he admitted to shooting Wade.
According to the lawyer's report, his contract letter was worth $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office, which issued an initial report on Friday, said the death was caused by a bullet through the head into the neck.
The department has congratulated the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Task Force, State Police Crime Lab, Southern University Police and citizens of the region for their cooperation in the investigation leading to the arrest.
Joe Aleva, LSU Athletic Director, thanked law enforcement in the area for "effort and perseverance".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-6 forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade, Wade, said the team was "shocked" and "in shock" by the death.
"You're always worried about this", Wade said.
The volcano has burned ashes in Mexico City
Ash from the Popocatepetal volcano has reached the southern parts of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention on Saturday warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after increasing activity in the pits and seeing 183 gas emissions and ash over 24 hours.
The centre was monitoring many sounds and vibrations.
Images on social media showed thin layers of gray coating on car windshields in the Mexican city of Xochimilco, near Mexico City.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in activity in the volcano, 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital, since a 7.1 magnitude earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Police clashed with Catalan separatists ahead of the independence vote anniversary
Six people were arrested after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police in Barcelona on Saturday, and thousands of people joined opposition demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the polarizing vote on Catalonia's secession.
A group of masked separatists who had been stopped by riot police threw eggs at them and painted them powder and created dust clouds on the streets, usually crowded with tourists.
The clashes began again when the police used their batons to control the clashes.
For several hours, the pro-independence groups were shouting "Don't forget, don't forgive", while the Unionist protesters shouted "Long Live Spain".
According to local newspapers, 14 people were treated for minor injuries during the protests.
Tensions in the pro-independence region have increased a year after Madrid considered the October 1 referendum illegal, but it was celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The number of people who came was very low, but the majority of voters chose to be independent.
According to Catalan officials, nearly 1,000 people were injured in violent clashes last year after police tried to block voting at polling stations across the region.
Pro-Independence groups held a demonstration to stop the demonstration in support of the National Police on Friday night.
The show was successful, but it had to take a different path.
Narcisse Terms, 68, an electrician who participated in separatist protests with his wife, said he was no longer confident about the possibility of Catalonia gaining independence.
"Last year we saw one of the best moments of our lives.
I saw my parents crying with joy because they were able to vote, but now we are stuck".
Despite a hard-fought victory in the regional elections last December, Catalan independence parties have struggled to keep pace this year as many of their prominent leaders are in self-imposed exile or detention awaiting trial for their role in the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
John Puig, 42, a mechanic, recorded the protest on his phone in support of the police, and said he felt the clash was provoked by politicians on both sides.
"It is becoming more tense", he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueros, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in pre-trial detention since the end of last year, announced that he would contest the European Parliament elections next year.
"To stand as a candidate in European elections is the best way to condemn the repression in democratic values and the repression we have faced from the Spanish government", he said.
London Derry: People arrested after a car broke into a house
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 have been arrested after repeatedly breaking into a house in London's Darry.
The incident occurred at around 19:30 BST on Thursday in Ballinagaard Crescent.
Debt Inspector Bob Blemings said the gates and building were damaged.
At some point, the CDB may have even been thrown over the car.
Menga Strike defeated Livingston 1-0 against Rangers
Daly Menga's first goal for Livingston was a win
The promotion-winning Livingston surprised Steven Gerrard by giving up only the second of his 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club to the Rangers.
Daly Menga's strike made a difference as Gary Holt's team tied for second to Hibernian.
Gerard remained unbeaten in the season premiership and next Sunday they face the eight-point lead Hearts.
Prior to that, Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston has extended their unbeaten run in the division to six games, and Holt has yet to taste a defeat since replacing head coach Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed opportunities against tough visitors
Holt's team had to be ahead of them before they scored, as their straight walk caused all sorts of problems for the Rangers.
Although Scott Robinson struggled in his attempt when the goal was scored, Alan Lythgoe was only able to direct his effort broadly as he leaped across the goal to prevent Craig Halkett's head.
The hosts allowed the Rangers to play in front of them, knowing that they could disturb the visitors at other times.
And the decisive goal came in the same way.
The Rangers gave up the free-kick and Livingston scored an opening, while Declan Gallagher and Robinson came together to face Mangar, who took a touchdown and scored from the middle of the box.
By then, although the Rangers dominated the parade, home defense was unstoppable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was mostly uninjured,
That pattern continued in the second half, though Alfredo Morelos grabbed a save from Kelly.
Rangers goalkeeper Alan McGregor turned down the opportunity to Scott Pitman and Flicked Litch Go wide from another Living Stone set play.
Crosses were continuously brought in and continually cleared at Livingston Box, but two penalty claims - after the challenge of Halkett on sub-station Glenn Middleton and one to the handball - were removed.
'Wonderful' from Livingston - Analysis
Aladdin Lamont of BBC Scotland at the Tony MacArony Arena
A wonderful performance and result from Livingston.
For one man, he was the best, and he continued to exceed expectations on this upward path.
His style of play and staff have not changed since he returned to the top flight, but Holt has to be commended for the way he has equipped the team since he arrived.
There are many heroes.
Captain Halkett was enormous, he bested the well-organized defense, but Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall always busy.
However, the Rangers lacked motivation.
Sometimes he played as well as he was under Gerard, but he was below those standards.
He was short of the final ball - he had only broken through the home side once - and it was a wake-up call for the Rangers, who are now in the middle of the table.
Erdogan received a mixed welcome in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for lunch in Berlin, there was a smile and blue skies.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - which aims to straighten relations between NATO allies.
He disagrees on a number of issues, including human rights, press freedom and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then moved to Cologne for the inauguration of a massive new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Although police cited security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 from gathering in front of the mosque, many supporters attended to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - many of them Kurds - expressed their protest, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
These double protests reflect the division of visitors who are praised as heroes by some German Turks and abused as dictators by others.
Deptford road accident: A cyclist killed after being hit by a car
A cyclist has died in a car crash in London.
The accident occurred at about 10:15 BST near the junction of Best Wood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, south-east of the city.
The driver stopped and the paramedics took care of him, but the man died on the spot.
The accident occurred after another cyclist died in a hit-and-run incident a month ago on Childers Street, a mile from the crash site on Saturday.
He said Metropolitan Police are working to identify the person and inform his relatives.
Road closures and bus turns have been placed and motorists have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in riots
Six prison officials were injured in the incident at the high security men's prison, the Jail Office said.
Chaos broke out at around 09:30 BST on Sunday at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire and is still going on.
Specialist "Tornado" officials have been called in to control the riots involving eight prisoners and one unit.
Officers were treated for minor facial injuries at the scene.
A Prison Service spokesperson said: "Specially trained prison staff have been deployed to deal with the ongoing incident in HMP Long Lartin.
Six crew members were treated for their injuries.
We cannot tolerate violence in our prisons, and it is clear that those responsible will be referred to the police and will spend more time in jail".
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 inmates, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, the prison governor was reportedly treated in hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And riot officials were jailed in October last year when staff were attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa poses a flash flooding threat to Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City (unreached areas may benefit)
Tropical depressions are rare to hit Arizona, but this increases the risk of flash flooding as Hurricane Rosa is likely to leak its remaining energy over the Desert Southwest next week.
The National Weather Service has already released flash flood observations on Monday and Tuesday in southern and eastern Nevada, southern California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City cities.
Rosa is expected to arrive directly over Phoenix on Tuesday, with rainfall late on Monday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix said in a tweet: "Since 1950, only ten tropical storms have maintained tropical storm or airborne downward trend within 200 miles of Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) is a hurricane within 40 miles of the AZ border".
Recent National Hurricane Center models have estimated 2 to 4 inches of rainfall, with separate measurements of 6 inches in Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
Other areas of the Desert Southwest, including the Central Rockies and Great Basin, are likely to get 1 to 2 inches, with the individual sum likely to be up to 4 inches.
For those out of flash flood risk, the area could prove to be a blessing in the rain because it is a drought-stricken area.
While flooding is a very serious concern, this rainfall may be somewhat beneficial as the South West is currently experiencing drought conditions.
According to the U.S. Draft Monitor, 40 percent of Arizona's population is experiencing at least one severe drought, the second highest category", weather.com reported.
First, the path of Hurricane Rosa leads to a landslide on the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Still in the storm's grip with maximum sustained winds of 85 mph on Sunday morning, Rosa is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is moving 12 miles per hour to the north.
The storm is facing cold water in the Pacific and therefore its strength is decreasing.
Thus, it is expected to make landfall in the force of a tropical storm in Mexico on Monday afternoon or evening.
Heavy rainfall may occur in parts of Mexico, which can pose a significant flood risk.
"From Baja California to northwest Sonora, rainfall is expected to be 3 to 6 inches, and it could be as high as 10 inches", reports weather.com.
Rosa will then move northward across Mexico before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday as a tropical storm, and it will pass through Arizona and south to Utah by late Tuesday night.
"The main threat expected from the Rosa or its remnants is heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and the U.S. Desert Southwest", says the National Hurricane Center.
These rains are expected to cause fatal flash flooding and cause debris to flow through deserts and landslides in mountainous areas.
Mid-Summer Norton attack: Four people arrested in connection with attempted murder
Three teenage boys have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with a stab wound at Somer Set.
A teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Mid Somer Norton around 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to hospital where he is said to be in a "stable" condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested last night in the Red Stock area, Avon and Somer Set Police said.
The authorities have urged anyone who may have any mobile phone footage of the incident to come forward.
Trump said Kavanagh was angry at the Democratic Party.
"Voting Justice Kavanagh is a vote to reject the ruthless and extreme tactics of the Democratic Party", Trump said at a campaign rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanagh was angry with the Democratic Party for submitting his credentials.
Kavanagh testified before Congress on Thursday, firmly and emotionally denying the allegation that Christine Blasey Ford sexually assaulted her when she was a teenager decades ago.
Ford also testified at the hearing about his allegations.
The president said on Saturday that the Americans witnessed Kavanagh's "extraordinary and quality and courage".
"The vote to confirm Justice Kavanagh is a vote to confirm one of the most accomplished legal experts of our time, a lawyer with a remarkable record in public service", he told a crowd of West Virginia supporters.
Speaking about the importance of the Republican vote in the midterm elections, the President indirectly mentioned Kavanagh's nomination.
"We have five weeks until the most important election of our lifetime.
I'm not competing, but I'm really competing", he said.
"That's why I'm fighting for the best candidates".
Trump argued that Democrats aim to "opposing and deter".
A senior GOP leadership aide told CNN that the first major procedural vote of the Senate session on Kavanagh's nomination is expected to take place after Friday.
Hundreds of people have died in the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami and the number is expected to rise further.
At least 384 people were killed and many floated away as giant waves hit the beaches when a massive earthquake and tsunami struck Sulawesi, an Indonesian island, officials said on Saturday.
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu, and six-meter (18-foot) high waves hit the beach in the evening, pushing many to their deaths and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami came after a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat came yesterday, people were still active on the beach and they did not immediately run away and they became victims", said Sutopo Purwo Ngroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian disaster relief agency BNBP, at a press conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami not only brought cars, logs, houses, it hit everything above ground", said Ngrohho, adding that it travelled in the open sea at 800 kilometers (497 mph) per hour before hitting the coastline.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the Disaster Agency showed many buildings and shops destroyed, bridges torn down and a mosque surrounded by water.
The quake's tremors continued in the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's massive earthquake was about 200 times greater than the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
It said the geography of the city at the end of a long, narrow bay may have magnified the size of the tsunami.
Ngrogo described the damage as "widespread" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
He said that the bodies of some of the victims were trapped under the ruins of collapsed buildings and 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Ngrogo said the deaths and damage were likely to be the highest in Donggala, a region near the epicentre of the earthquake, 300 km (190 mi) north of Palu on the coast.
"Communications are completely weakened without any information", Ngrogo said from Donggala.
More than 300,000 people live there", the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were moving to the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, but it could get worse", it said.
The agency faced widespread criticism on Saturday for not reporting the tsunami hit Palu, but the waves hit the alert, officials said.
In an amateur footage shared on social media, a man on the top floor of a building can be heard shouting loud warnings about a tsunami approaching people on the street below.
Within minutes, a wall of water hits the shore, dragging buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami led to major power outages, which also cut off communications around Palua and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue operations.
The army has started sending cargo flights to Jakarta and other cities for aid, officials said, but those displaced are in dire need of food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport has been reopened for relief activities only and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit the evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
Indonesia's tsunami scores are more than 800.
This is so bad.
The World Vision staff of Donggala have arrived safely in the city of Palu where employees have taken shelter in the tarpaline shelters installed on their office premises, and they have seen the scenes of destruction on their way, Shri Dosheba said.
"They told me that they saw many houses destroyed", he said.
This is so bad.
Although relief groups have begun serious disaster relief work, some complained that deeply skilled foreign aid workers are being prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian rules, funding, supplies and personnel from abroad can only be allowed there if the disaster site is declared a national disaster zone.
It has not yet happened.
"It is still a provincial-level disaster", said Alia Ariani, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
After the "government" said, 'Well, this is a national disaster,' we can open up for international aid, but there is no status on it yet".
As the second night after Friday's earthquake and tsunami comes to Palu, the friends and families of the missing are still hoping that their loved ones can become the sparkling miracles of the natural disaster's thick storyline.
On Saturday, a little boy was removed from the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who had been trapped under the rocks next to her mother's body for two days.
Jendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended in Indonesia earlier this month.
The people trapped at the Rowa Hotel are his students, including Mr. Mandangi.
"As a senior in the field of paragliding, I have my own emotional burden", he said.
Mr. Jendon recalled that just hours after the news of the Rowa Hotel crash spread in the paragliding community, he had been sending WhatsApp messages to the competitors of the Paluva who were attending the beach festival in a rush.
His messages were changed to a gray check mark instead of a pair of blue check marks.
"This means that messages have not been delivered", he said.
Thieves took $26,750 during an ATM refill at Levi's in Newport
According to a news release from the Newport Police Department, robbers stole $26,750 from Brink workers on Friday morning while refilling ATMs in Newport.
The driver of the car was clearing the ATM at the Enter Tenment Complex and preparing to deliver more money, Det. Dennis McCarthy wrote in a press release.
While he was drunk, another man "run off the back of Brink's employee" and stole a purse of money dedicated to the delivery.
According to a press release, witnesses identified several suspects as fleeing the scene, but the police did not specify the number of those involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identities should contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changed his name to Yes
Rapper Kanye West has changed his name to Yes.
In a tweet on Saturday, he announced the change: "I am officially known as Kanye West".
West, 41, was nicknamed Yes for a time and used that name for the title of my eighth album, released in June.
The change comes ahead of their appearance on Saturday Night Live, where they are expected to introduce their new album Yanni.
The show's creators said that he replaced singer Ariana Grande who cancelled the show for emotional reasons.
In addition to being an acronym for his current professional name, West has previously stated that the term has religious significance to him.
"I believe that 'yes' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you,' as West said earlier this year while discussing the title of his album on the radio host Big Boy.
"So I am you, I am us, that's us.
It's gone from being a monotheistic, secondary conjecture to just being a yes - and it's a reflection of our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
This album is a reflection of who we are".
He is one of several well-known rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs was formerly known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
Former West organizer, Jay-Z, has also added hyphen and capitalization or is running without it.
Mexican Amlo vows not to use military force against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andrés Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed that the nation will never use military force against civilians as it approaches the 50th anniversary of the bloody crackdown on students.
Lopez Obrador promised at the Tletelolco Plaza on Saturday that "the military will never be used to suppress the Mexican people".
On October 2, 1968, soldiers opened fire on a peaceful demonstration in the plaza, killing 300 people, as leftist student movements were taking root across Latin America.
Lopez has pledged to support young Mexicans by providing monthly grants to studying in the Obrada and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are attracting young people to criminal groups.
The US should double its AI fund
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, investors and AI expert Kai-Fu Li, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple, say the US should double its spending on research in this field.
While the US does not have an overall formal AI strategy, these notes come after various parts of the US government make AI announcements.
Meanwhile, China introduced its plan last year: It aims to become the No. 1 AI innovator by 2030.
"It's a good start to double the AI research budget as all other countries are way behind the US and we're exploring the next innovation in AI", Lee said.
In an interview with CNBC this week, Lee said that doubling the funding could double the chances of the next big AI achievement in the US.
Lee, published his book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Sinovaction Ventures, which has also invested in Face++, one of China's leading AI companies.
He worked on the AI system at Carnegie Mellon University in the 1980s, as well as the one that beat the American Othello Player, and later he was an executive at Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee accepted past U.S. government technology competitions such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge and asked when the next one would be to help identify future explorers.
Researchers in the US have to work harder to win government funding, Lee said.
"It's not China that is taking the educational leaders; it's the corporations", Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have recruited scholars from universities to work on AI in recent years.
Li said that changes to immigration policy will also help the US to increase its AI efforts.
"I think that the green cards should be issued automatically to PhDs in AI", he said.
The State Council of China released its next generation AI development plan in July 2017.
Li said that while the National Science Foundation and other government agencies in the US are providing funding to people in educational institutions in the same way that the National Science Foundation and other government agencies are devoting money to US researchers, the quality of educational work in China is declining.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which aimed to engage industry and academic partners, and the White House announced that it would create an artificial intelligence select committee.
And this month, DARPA announced an investment of 2 billion in the initiative called AI Next.
The NSF is currently investing over $100 million per year in AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation that sought to create the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has seen no progress in several months.
The Macedonians voted in a referendum on whether to change the country's name
Macedonian people voted on Sunday in a referendum on whether the country's name should be changed to "Republic of North Macedonia", a move to resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that was blocking membership attempts to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a territory called Macedonia, claims that its neighbor to the north is claiming its own territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on a proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority.
President Gorz Ivanov has said he will not vote in a referendum and has raised doubts as to whether the boycott campaign will meet the minimum 50 percent required for the referendum to be valid.
The question in the referendum was: "Do you support NATO and EU membership by ratifying the treaty with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Jorán Javé, argue that it is a price to pay for access to Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the repression of Yugoslavia, through institutions such as the EU and NATO.
"Today I am here to vote for the future of the country, to enable young people in Macedonia to live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because this is the foundation for a safe life for all of us", said Olga Georgijeva, 79, in Skopje.
While not required by law to do so, many MPs have said they are committed to making the outcome of the vote decisive.
The name change would require a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The state Election Commission said that no irregularities were reported as of 1 pm.
However, the voter turnout was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent of registered voters of 66 per cent in the last parliamentary election in 2016.
"I'm here to vote for my children, for our place in Europe", said 62-year-old Gzos Tanewski, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Jave, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko voted in a referendum in Macedonia on changing the country's name, which will pave the way for NATO and EU membership on 30 September 2018 in Strumica, Macedonia.
In front of the Parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kovdarkov was preparing a small platform and putting chairs in front of tents set up by the voters.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads up, not through the back door", said Kavarkarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don't want us to be Macedonia, we can join forces with others like China and Russia to be part of Euro-Asian integration".
Prime Ministers Jave said that NATO membership will bring much needed investment to Macedonia with an unemployment rate of over 20%.
"I believe the majority will be in favor of this as more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO", Jave said after running his ballot.
He said that the result of "yes" is "confirmation of our future".
A survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research said that 30 to 43 percent of voters would participate in a referendum - less than the required turnout.
Another poll by Macedonia's Telma TV found that 57 percent of people planned to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
It takes 50 percent of the people and one vote to win the referendum.
The failure of the referendum represents the first serious blow to the pro-Western government's policy since taking office in May last year.
View: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero goes through the full Brighton defence for goal.
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling dusted Brighton's defenses in a 2-0 win over Manchester City in a match at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England on Saturday.
Aguro made it very easy on his score in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker took a pass in midfield at the start of the series.
He ran between three Brighton defenders before attacking in an open field.
Aguro was then surrounded by four green shirts.
He went around a defender and then overtook even more people at the edge of the Brighton box.
Then he pushed the pass to the left when there was Sterling.
Using his first touch in the English forward box to return the ball to Aguero, he used his right boot to trick Brighton keeper Matthew Ryan into hitting the right side of the net.
"There are some problems with Aguero's feet", City Manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about playing them 55, 60 minutes.
It is now.
He was lucky to score a goal at that moment".
But Sterling was the one who gave the Sky Blues an early advantage in the Premier League.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguro took the ball deep in the Brighton area in that game.
He sent a beautiful through ball along the left side to Leroy San.
San took a few touches before taking Sterling to a distant post
The forward from the Sky Blue team, before falling down, threw the ball into the net.
The city will play Hafenheim in the Champions League at 12:55 pm on Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinnheim, Germany.
The Rookies want Scherzer to play.
With the Nationals out of the playoff contention, there was little interest in another start.
But Scherzer, who has never been a competitor, wants to play the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, imposing a condition that only the Rockies, who are in the lead for a game in the NL West, have play-off implications.
The Rockies have yet to receive a wild card with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still looking forward to their first division title.
Even if we're playing just fine, people can rub their fingers in the weather in Denver, and other teams can play at the highest level I can this year.
Why should I not compete?
The Nationals are due to announce another starter for Sunday, but, in such a scenario, Scherzer is likely to be allowed to pitch.
Scherzer, who is about to make his 34th start, has started his Bullpen session on Thursday and will take a normal break on Sunday.
The Washington right-hander is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump's lead in West Virginia
The Supreme Court has indirectly mentioned the controversy over his choice of Brett Kavanagh, the President, when speaking about the importance of Republican votes in the midterm elections.
"Everything we have done will have results in November.
We are five weeks away from the most important election of our lifetime.
It is very important that I am not running for this election, but it is as if I am running for election, which is why I am fighting for candidates".
Trump continued, "You're seeing the most horrible scenario, you're seeing a bunch of hateful Democrats, you're seeing what's happening right now.
They are ready to take power from us in any way, even if it is a lowly one.
They ride on anyone to gain power and control, they only need power and control. But we do not give them power.
He said the Democrats are using the "opposition and disruption" strategy.
"You have seen in the last four days" Democrats are "angry and inferior and disgusting and dishonest".
He also mentioned Sen. Dianne Fine Stein, a leading Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, when the crowd shouted.
"Do you remember her answer?
Have you leaked a record?
Oh, what.
No, no, no, their body language was bad, the worst body language I've ever seen".
Labour is no longer a large church.
The Bible says that "they are not willing to talk about what is in their minds".
When the fighters of my local party Momentum voted for me, it was a real surprise.
Moreover, I am the latest Labour MP to have left us behind for saying what is in our minds.
She was treated in the same way for her speech against Jewish prejudice by my colleague in Parliament, John Rane.
In my case, I was criticized by the censor for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
Jeremy had disagreements with previous leaders on responsible economic policy, national security, the importance of Europe and other issues.
The notice of the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday said: "We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
As I have seen in the last eight years as a local Labour MP, the GC meeting was held on Friday night.
Sadly, today's congregation is not like most other congregations. The promise of "vibrate, harmonious" politics has been forgotten.
The Labour Party is increasingly not tolerating dissent, and each opinion is considered on the basis of whether the party's leadership is accepted.
Whether it is national security or the single market of the European Union, in general, I, my colleagues who have shared the same opinion in the past, now expect a change of attitude.
Whatever I say, well, every time I speak publicly, there is a barrage of complaints on social media that I should be abandoned, that I am causing trouble to the politics of the Centre and that I should not be in the Labour Party.
This is not just my experience.
I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments made about me were politically motivated.
I am amazed at the professionalism and commitment of my colleagues who face sexual and racial abuse every day.
The most boring thing about politics of this time is that the low level of violence has gone away.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we don't have that broad mindset yet, and we are being squeezed by every "disbelief" stance or policy change.
Over the past two years, I have received many suggestions to keep my head down, not talk too much, and to have a "everything is fine" attitude.
But I am not here to make politics for this.
Since I joined the Labour Party as a student 32 years ago, I have opposed the negligence of the Thatcher government which has destroyed the entire schoolroom and it has played a significant role in providing good public service to those in need, whether local councillor or government minister.
I have not kept anything hidden in my politics, including the last election.
No one in Nottingham East is at all confused about my policy positions and my disagreements with the current leadership.
I just want to say to those who supported the rally on Friday that the country is moving towards a Brexit that affects families, business, and our public service, so I don't see the need to spend my time and effort to show my honesty to the Labour Party leaders.
But whether I am not a Nottingham Momentum, but a Labour Party member or not, a message to the people of my constituency is this: I am proud to serve you and I believe that it is in your best interest to work in a way that no optional cancellation threats or political advantage Sindhu positions will deter me.
Chris Leslie is the MP for Nottingham East
AYR 38 - 17 Merlos: A defeated AYR lead
Two attempts late seem to have affected the final result in some way, but there is no doubt that AYR is worthy of an unprecedented victory in the amazingly entertaining Tenent's Premiership Day match.
They are the only ones who have now taken the lead and have not lost out of the top 10.
In the end, he was successful with his over-defence and opportunity to cheer on the home side and coach Peter Murchie at every turn.
"We have played so far and we have not been defeated. I am happy about that", he said.
"Congratulations to AIR, they took better chances than we did", says Robin Christy of Melrose.
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute attempt was converted by Frazier Climax, sending the AVR forward. However, the yellow card that Scottish captain Rory Hughes received turned the game towards the Warrior, allowing Melrose to make the numbers, and Jason Baggott received an unconverted try.
Klymo made a penalty to A.Y.R., before the interim, and a converted solo attempt to make A.Y.R. 17-5 at break.
However, Melrose started well after the interval, and the bagat converted Patrick Anderson try narrowed the gap by five points.
After playing for a long time, Raurid Knott was injured and was stretched off, and when the climax resumed, the climax was achieved by the AYR leading the way through the Stafford McDowell Trial, which converted the climax.
The temporary captain of the AIR, Blair McPherson, then received a yellow card and was forced to pay an extra man today due to the unconverted try of Bruce Calvin at the end of the re-excessive stress.
Whenever a yellow card was issued to Strawman Hutchin's son to trap Klymo without the ball, McPherson stopped the AVR from moving forward, as the home side returned from the penalty line-out.
Clymo had converted the box kick from David Arm Strong to Kyle Rowe when Greer sent Henry to Flancker for a fifth try on the home side, as he had done since the resumption.
Still Game Star is looking forward to a new opportunity in the restaurant industry
After learning that he has been named a director at a licensed restaurant company, Still Game star Fort Keeran is looking forward to stepping into the hospitality industry.
The 56-year-old, who plays Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC show, wrote the script and is co-starring with long-time comedian Greg Hemphill.
The duo has already announced that the upcoming ninth series is the last, and Keirnan seems to be thinking about her life after Craigslist.
According to the official record listing, he is a director of Adrift Morne Limited.
Although Scottish Sun sources have stated that he wants to engage in Glasgow's "Thrilling Restaurant Trade", the actor has declined to comment on the news".
'The sea is ours': Bolivia Island expects the road to the Pacific to be reopened by the court
The Navy is guarding the naval headquarters at La Paz.
Sea-blue flags are flying over government buildings.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are committed to the mission: "The right to the sea is ours.
It is our duty to recover it".
The island of Bolivia gave up its coastline to Chile during the war in the 19th century. Thus, Bolivia's desire to sail the Pacific is still alive.
After five years of trial, Bolivia is awaiting a ruling by the International Court of Justice on October 1.
"Bolivia has a spirit and a mission of integrity and thus, has expected a positive outcome", said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadailla.
The ICJ ruling is seen on the big screen by Bolivians across the country. Bolivia believes that the ruling will be handed down by a panel at The Hague after decades of negotiations that call for negotiations to transfer maritime power from Chile to Bolivia.
Bolivia's popular president, Evo Morales, who is seeking re-election next year amid a contentious struggle, is also very much looking forward to Monday's decision.
"We are close to the process of withdrawing the Pacific Ocean", he said last August.
However, according to some analysts, it is unlikely that a pro-Bolivian court will decide and if the court does, the change that could occur is very small.
The United Nations Council in the Netherlands has no authority to decide on the Chilean territory and cannot predict the outcome of any possible negotiations.
Six months after the final ruling, the ICC's ruling was announced, and Chilean expert on international law Paz Zarate said "the case is not complicated".
The last four years have seen a situation that has not been consistent with Bolivia's mission.
"The Bolivian government has hijacked the problem of access to the sea", says Zarate.
She says Morales's statements have lost the respect that remains for Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to negotiate in one scenario, but after that it will be very difficult to negotiate.
Since 1962, the two countries have not exchanged ambassadors.
The Bolivian representative at The Hague, former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltze, has denied allegations that the court's decision-making process is speeding up.
"The ruling on Monday will provide an opportunity to forge a new relationship with Chile and bring an end to 139 years of mutual disagreement", he said.
Morales, still the most popular president of Latin America, denies that he is using the idea of the ocean for politics.
"Bolivia's access to the Pacific Ocean will never be missed", he said.
"This ruling is an opportunity to correct the past".
North Korea has said that it cannot disarm without trusting the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yang said that our country will never destroy a nuclear weapon without trusting Washington first.
He was speaking at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to follow the promises made by the leaders of both countries at their meeting in Singapore.
His statement was made in the wake of US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's statement that nuclear diplomacy is expected to resume after three months of talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Singapore.
While the ban continues, Ri said that it is a dream that North Korea could be defeated by the US objection to the Korean War.
PANGANGANG is not the first to disarm, Washington is wary of declaring a treaty
Kim and US President Donald Trump both want a second meeting.
However, since the PANGANG believes that only weapons are needed for its security, there is widespread opinion that it will rebuild weapons.
Pompeo is scheduled to visit Pangyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump meeting.
A fascinating headgear unveiled at the Paris Fashion Show is coming to the High Street near you.
If you want to change your hat collection or prevent sunburn, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown unveiled their unique large-size SS19 collection at the Paris Fashion Week in an impressive style set.
The strangest hats this summer were popular on Instagram and were noticed by designers and also featured on Cat Walk.
Valentino has designed a model head with a wide wingspan with a curved overhang.
Other large-sized accessories include a fancy pumpkin, a tooth hat, and a pineapple. However, they are not designed to keep your head warm.
A selection of bizarre Halloween masks has been unveiled by Tom Brown.
Many attractive masks are like sewn lips and look more like a honeyball lector than a hot couture.
One creation is a scuba diving gear, with snorkels and glasses, and another is a mask, a melted ice cream cone.
And if you're a big fashion fan, you can find your favorite here.
Style lovers have speculated that it will draw you to the nearby High Street because of its attractive buns.
The large size hats are La Bomba-style. The straw hat with a two-foot-wide brim can be seen on everyone's head from Rihanna to Emily Rathak Jowsky.
The non-practicing cult-label hat has gained a lot of social media attention, including cat walks, and is as big as a model wearing a swimsuit in a straw beach bag.
The Burn Orange Rafia bag features a Rafia fringing and a white leather handle. It is a unique product of the Jacques La Rivera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
As celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told Female: "I expect big hats and beach bags to arrive on the High Street next summer.
John Edward: Language skills are needed for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a record of academic excellence and this was further enhanced by individual and cumulative success in sports, arts, music and other community settings, including another unique test result in 2018.
Scotland Today, the schools, which have 30,000 children, are represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SICS), and strive to provide quality services to their children and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare children to grow into higher education, their chosen profession and global citizens.
In the educational sector of designing and implementing school curricula, we can observe that modern languages are becoming increasingly popular and are in demand in schools.
Nelson Mandela says: "If you talk to a person in a language they understand, it goes to their head.
If you speak to someone in his own language, it will make his heart thrive.
It reminds us that when we want to build relationships and build trust among people from other countries, we should not rely solely on English.
From the latest test results this year, we can see that the languages with the highest pass rate have been the leading candidates in independent schools.
68% of students studying foreign languages have achieved a higher grade A.
According to data collected from 74 SIS member schools, 72% of Mandarin students have obtained a top A grade, 72% of German students, 69% of French students and 63% of Spanish students have obtained an A grade.
This suggests that independent schools in Scotland are promoting foreign languages as a vital skill for children and young people in the future.
Languages are now considered as an independent school curriculum as a subject of choice and STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) subjects elsewhere.
According to a 2014 survey by the UK Commission on Employment and Skills, 17 per cent of employers are not proficient in language.
Thus, more and more language skills are required for young people to shape their careers.
More jobs require language skills, which has become a very necessary skill in the global world.
If anyone chooses to learn a second language apart from a career, he or she will have the real benefit of having this kind of lifelong skill.
The ability to communicate directly with people from abroad will naturally put a person at the forefront of competition.
According to a 2013 survey of more than 4,000 UK adults, 75 percent of people do not speak a foreign language when they are in conversation and only two-figure percent, or 15 percent, speak French.
This is why it is so important for today's children to invest in language learning.
If there are many languages in developing countries, this provides a great opportunity for children to find good employment.
In Scotland, each school teaches different languages.
While many schools focus on classical modern languages, in 2020 other schools will teach the most important languages to the UK, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter what your children's interests, there will always be many languages to choose from in independent schools and there will be teachers who are skilled in them.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment and, regardless of their prospects, they build an environment that nurtures the skills and prepares children for success.
There is no denying that language continues to be a very important factor in the global business environment and therefore it must be reflected in education.
Of course, modern languages are truly a means of international communication.
Independent schools will continue to provide this choice, diversity and expertise to young people in Scotland.
This is the action that must be taken.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
Lebron is set to open Sunday for the Lakers in San Diego.
Fans' expectations for LeBron James' first game against the Los Angeles Lakers have finally ended.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the preseason opener against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday.
But it remains to be decided how many minutes they will play.
Walton said on the Lakers' official website that it may be more than one but less than 48.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudeau tweeted that James can play for a limited time.
After practice earlier this week, James was asked what his plan was for the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
He had said that at this stage of my career, I do not need Pre-Season Games to be ready.
Trump's West Virginia rally time, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump has launched campaign rallies in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of five rallies scheduled for next week, and they will also be staying in places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
Following his election to fill the Supreme Court vacancy, Trump is now seeking support as Republicans risk losing control of Parliament in the midterm elections in November.
What time is Trump's West Virginia rally tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trump's West Virginia Wheeling Rally time is 7 p.m. ET today night, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia rally online below via a live stream on YouTube.
The Supreme Court nominated Brett Kavanah is likely to be heard at a rally this week, which is expected to hold up the Senate vote for those investigated by the FBI for sexual misconduct.
But the primary focus of these rallies is to encourage Republicans in the November election.
The five rallies next week are seen as an incentive for volunteers and supporters to protect and expand the Republican majority in the Senate and Parliament.
Trump's campaign spokesman told Reuters that controlling the parliament is the most important part of his agenda and that he wants to enter as many states as possible and thus be very busy during the campaign season.
The evening rally, scheduled for Wednesday at the Wesbanko Arena in Wheeling, will also invite Ohio and Pennsylvania supporters and receive media coverage from Pittsburgh, West Virginia Metro News reported.
Trump is visiting West Virginia for the second time in a month on Saturday, having won the state in 2016 with more than 40 percent of the vote.
Trump has sought to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrissey, who has been relegated in the election.
Simon Haider, a political scientist at West Virginia University, said Trump's appearance for election incentives was not a good sign for Morris.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA has worked hard to keep expectations high, facing singles on Sunday
After three one-off sessions, a Saturday afternoon squat was needed for the Ryder Cup.
The situation of a swinging pendulum made the sport a complete variation, but it was a race that the athletes really believed in and competed in.
So, where does the wind blow now?
"They were six points ahead, but now it's down to four, so we're a little ahead", Jordan Speeth said.
Europe is certainly ahead by four points, with 12 points remaining.
Speeth says Americans feel that they have low wind speeds and that they need encouragement from a number of factors. Speeth and Justin Thomas have been all day, each down to four to three points.
Speith has played for Green from Tea and is a leading model.
As they walked around, the celebration screams were heard. When he and Thomas came down two after two, the match went to a complex stage in all four rounds.
His put was the same as the game 15 victory, indicating that the American team did not leave.
"This shows that you are very worried about your game", said Speith.
This is why all the players have now left.
There are now 18 holes to achieve.
The only players to score more than Speith and Thomas in the last two days were Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable story of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's weird but favorite pair is four to four and they can't go wrong.
The only couple who did not shoot the buggy on Saturday afternoon was Maliwood, who left the buggy on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and returned to the nine on Friday morning.
The race and the energy they have suggested that the players will win the match on Sunday, which is supported by the public. Europe's victory at Le Golf National at sunset is more pronounced than Fleetwood or Molinari.
In different holes at the same time.
It is not right to talk about European victory right now.
The morning Four Ball Hero Sergio Garcia shortwork was created by Bubba Watson and Web Simpson while playing with Alex Noren.
A bogie and two doubles at the Front Nine encouraged the Spaniard and Sweden to the hole as never achieved.
On Sunday, no one will help you get out of your hole.
Four balls and four sums are very attractive to watch because the interaction between the pair and the advice they give and the advice they don't give and the changing strategy is important.
Europe played well as a team and took a significant lead on the final day. However, this Four Somme session showed that Team USA has the ability to make a dubious fight on the interstate site.
Europe took a 10-6 lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe took a healthy lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup after a 10-6 lead against the United States on Saturday in Four Balls and Four Somme.
Encouraged by the pair Tommy Fleetwood and Francisco Molinari, the pair have won two victories against Tiger Woods, who are trying to match Talley, to date, to four points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European is trying to regain the trophy after losing to Hazeltin two years ago, with the United States 3-1 after missing the morning Four Ball.
The U.S. Four Somers won two matches, but failed to make up for the shortfall.
The Jim Furyk side needs eight points to hold the trophy from Sunday's 12 singles match.
Fleetwood became the first European rookie to win four consecutive points, and he and Molinari, known as Maliwood, became the second pair in the history of the Ryder Cup to win four points in the first four matches after the amazing weekend.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the Four Balls, American rookie Bryson defeated DeChambeau and Woods by a still impressive 5-4.
Woods, who lost two matches on Saturday, was often a specialist player. However, he has lost 19 of 29 matches at Four Balls and Four Somme and seven in a row.
After a break from the morning Four Balls, Justin Rose, Dustin Johnson and Brooks Copper came together with Henrik Stenson in the Four Somme to beat 2-1 and ranked first and third in the world.
This was not an easy road for Europe.
Three-time winners Jordan Speeth and Justin Thomas set a milestone for the Americans, scoring two points on Saturday.
The team won the Four Balls 2-1 against John Ram and Lan Paulter of Spain and defeated Paulter and Rory McCall Roy 4-3 in the Four Seasons after losing the opening two holes.
Only two times in the Ryder Cup have the four points shortfall in singles been achieved.
After being the second favorite in two days, every Sunday attack seems to be more than that.
North Korea has said it will not destroy weapons for no reason without trust.
The North Korean Foreign Minister said Saturday at the United Nations that the ban has exceeded his faith in the United Nations and that his country cannot automatically destroy nuclear weapons in such a situation.
At the UN Annual Meeting, Ri Yang Ho said that in recent years, North Korea has taken several good steps: halted nuclear and missile tests, shut down its nuclear test site and also suspended nuclear and nuclear technology.
He said, "But we have not received any response from the US on this.
"If we have no confidence in the United States, we will not have confidence in our national security and we will not be the first to destroy nuclear weapons in such a scenario.
He also spoke of the North Korean complaint that Washington is opposed to the proposal of phased nuclear disarmament, and his statement that he is not as completely opposed to the destruction of nuclear weapons as before was of particular importance.
Referring to a joint statement issued by the current US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Singapore on June 12, Ri said that Kim had reached the level of denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and that the US was committed to North Korea's security.
North Korea wants to officially end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States demands that Pyongyang first destroy its nuclear weapons.
The United States has refused to lift the stringent international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States is encouraging nuclear destruction first, but increasing pressure to achieve its goal through prohibition, and not only is the United States opposed to ending the war", said Re.
"We are going to kneel down because of the ban. This is the dream of those who don't know about us.
But the problem is that the continuation of the bans is increasing the trust between us.
As U.S. leaders mentioned earlier this week at the United Nations, Ri made no mention of the second meeting between Kim and Trump.
Referring to the three talks between South Korean leader Moon Jae-in and Kim Jong-un in the last five months, the Minister said: "If the United States had not been the main player in this nuclear disarmament proposal, South Korea would not have achieved this complexity.
However, this year's speech was a completely different tone than last year's speech at the United Nations. The United Nations was caught up in what President Trump called the "Rocket Man" suicide attempt on Kim after North Korea targeted the United States with its rockets.
Trump, who last year said he would destroy North Korea "completely", praised Kim's courage to destroy nuclear weapons this year at the United Nations, but said he still had to work hard and that the ban would continue until North Korea had destroyed its nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had not set a time for this, but that it would take two years, three years, or five years.
China and Russia have argued that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
But U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the United Nations Security Council on Thursday: "We must continue to vigorously enforce the Security Council's sanctions until we know of the full, ultimate, nuclear deterrence that has been tested".
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions on North Korea since 2006 to reduce funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri outside the UN General Assembly and said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but this last trip was not good for him.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying progress had been made, as he had been condemned for placing pirate-like demands on North Korea within hours.
North Korea pledged at a meeting with Moon this month that it would destroy the missile site and nuclear complex if the United States took "appropriate action".
Kim said that in addition to Trump's security assurances in Singapore, he was also interested in "such measures" he was looking forward to and continued good relations with Washington.
Harvard students are taking a course on getting enough rest.
A new course is opening this year at Harvard University to help undergraduates who fall asleep due to caffeine-fueled 'All-Niters' cope with the growing culture of macho in their studies.
Students who are educated at the best university in the world do not have a basic understanding of how to take care of themselves.
The course was designed by Charles Seisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a Brigham and Women's Hospital specialist, who believes it is the first course of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to take this course after giving a speech on the negative impact of insomnia on learning.
'At the end of it, a girl asked: 'Why is this being said to me after all these years, when I am a senior student?'
I was surprised when she said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep", she told the Telegraph.
The course, which was first launched this year, explains to students how good sleep practices can help them achieve academic and athletic achievement, as well as improve their overall well-being.
Paul Barrera, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after seeing students sleep deprived during the week.
Long-term courses involve interactive activities.
One section has a picture of the dorm room, where students click on coffee beans, screens, coaches and books to learn about caffeine and the effects of lighting and how insomnia affects sports and the importance of sleep.
In another section, insomnia is discussed as increasing the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the enclosure with interactive signs encourages participants to reflect on the routine.
We know that this will not change the behaviour of students immediately.
We believe that just as you have a right to know how to smoke, you have a right to know about sleep, too", said Prof. Sisler.
A culture of pride in reading all night long still exists, with insomnia becoming a growing problem due to the increasing pressure on modern technology and students.
He said that good quality sleep should be the secret weapon for combating stress, fatigue and anxiety in students, and also helps to avoid weight gain, as insomnia makes the brain hungry and it is constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from California who is studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Seisler design the course and took one of his classes last year during his freshman year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to start courses across the campus.
He hopes that the next step is to ask all postgraduate students to complete the same programme before joining the competitive institution.
Students should set an alarm for when to go to bed and when to wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of the blue light emitted by electronic screens and LED lights. These lights will emit your circadian rhythm from the kilter.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Menga goal defeated by Gerard
The losing streak continued with Steven Gerrard's Rangers team losing 1-0 to Dolly Menga in a match at Livingston.
The Ibrox were attempting to record their first win since a 4-1 victory at St. John's Stone in February, but Gary Holt's side caused Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games, losing to Ladbrokes Premier Ship captain Harts by eight points, who left their side.
Menga scored seven minutes before halftime and the Rangers, who played without motivation, did not seem to be able to match up at any point.
While the Rangers are now down to sixth, Livingston has risen to third and is only behind Hibernia by goal difference.
Linus Mann Calum Spence is being treated for a head injury from a head injury caused by a throw from a distance.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team which led Ayr to the Bet Fred Cup semi-final.
Holt, on the other hand, retained the same Livi 11 as the Hearts had scored last week.
Although the Rangers dominated the ball, Livingston did most of the catch.
Menga's first-ever lay-off sent Scott Pitman through the goal of Alan McGregor, who had to score just two minutes but the midfielder missed the opportunity.
Keegan Jacobs got Skipper Craig Holgate after the free-kick but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow was only hitting the back post.
While the Rangers retained control, their final third game was more of a hopeful game than a confidence game.
Alfredo Morelos felt that a quarter-hour mark penalty should be obtained for the conflict between him and Steven Lales but the referee Steven Thompson did not consider Columbia's appeals.
The Rangers only managed two first-half shots but were troubled by the strikes of Former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly Lassanna Kaulibali and Owie Azaria.
Livi's 34th minute starter may be against the game, no one can beat him.
The Rangers failed to face Jacob's deep set-piece again.
Scott Orfield did not respond when DeKlan slapped the Gallagher ball to Scott Robinson, waiting for the manga to pick up for a simple ending.
Gerrard switched the calibre for Ryan Kent during the break and it was an immediate hit as the winger had a slot at Morelos but the impressive Kelly ran from his line to block him.
But Livingston continued the game with a crowdlike performance with a large, big shot of Litgo and Halkett.
Holt's team could have led the final stages but McGregor stood up to reject Jacob before he headed wide from the Litgo corner.
The Rangers' replacement player Glenn Middleton had another late penalty claim from a dispute with Jacob but again Thompson turned away.
Panchanga: inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our Sunday Morning Panchayat: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and counting... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm Hans Geiser was born in Germany.
Geiger invented a method to detect and measure radiation, eventually the device became known as the Geiger counter
Since then, Geiger Counter, the main founder of science, has become the basis of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado" starring Kaufpock scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What in the world is that?"
Rogers: "It is a geyser counter used to detect radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put on these earphones, you can really hear the effects of the molecules that radiation produces in minerals.
Evans: "Now tell me, are you really burning!"
"Hans" Geiser died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
This invention has kept his name alive.
A new cancer vaccine may boost the immune system of the cells of the brain
A new cancer vaccine teaches and destroys the immune system of the cells of the brain
As part of treatment, vaccination helps the immune system to identify stem cells
This method involves removing immune cells from the patient and replacing them in the laboratory
They can then re-inject a normal protein for many cancers.
The clinical vaccine is showing promising results in cancer patients.
A woman who received a vaccine therapy that teaches her immune system to recognize the rag cells saw her ovarian cancer more than 18 months away.
This method involves removing immune cells from the patient and replacing them in the laboratory so that they can give the normal protein se to multiple cancers called HER2, and then re-inject.
"The results show that we have found the most promising vaccine", said Jay Berzowski, a professor at the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland.
HER2 "causes the progression of many cancers", including breast, ovarian, lung, and colorectal cancers, explains Jay Berzowski.
'Teaching' patients to take immune cells and target cancer cells has helped in the treatment of leukemia.
Support for Trump from Caine West, who wore a mega hat after the SNL.
It wasn't good.
The audience criticized Kevin West for praising US President Donald Trump during Saturday night's live and for asking him to run again in 2020.
After performing her third song at Ghost Town at night, she wore a Make America Great Cap to mock the Democrats and voiced her support for Trump.
'When I talk to white people, they ask me many times: 'Why do you like Trump, isn't he a racist?'
If I was concerned about race, I would have left America.'
The SNL began with a sketch by Matt Damon, in which Hollywood star, Christine Blasey, satirized Brett Kavanagh's statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee investigating allegations of sexual assault by Ford.
Although it was not a broadcast, West's satirical video was uploaded on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is unclear whether West tried to rock them by posting.
He also said that West is having a hard time justifying his hat in the conference.
'They oppressed me behind the scenes.
He said, 'Do not wear a hat and go up to the stage.'
I was abused!
He said that he was not in a good mood.'
"You can't tell me whether to wear this Superman hat or not, I asked if you want me to keep going. I asked if you want me to keep going.
"I'm not going to lie to you".
His statements were abused by audiences at least twice and embarrassed the cast members of SNL. According to a Variety report, one cast member said: 'The whole studio was silent.'
West took the stage to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
Dressed like a perrier bottle, West surprised many with his song I Love It.
The Conservative group TPUSA supported West. Cadence Turner tweeted: 'For the brave souls: Thank you for performing at the group level.'
But Karen Hunter tweeted: "Simply put, West was as good as he was".
'But I don't believe in supporting someone who says idealism that is harmful to my community (buying their music or clutching or supporting their 'art').
They are free.
So are we".
Shogo also announced on Twitter that 'he has changed his name and his name is now officially Caine West.'
He was not the first person to change his name, but also his name was changed to Daddy, Puff Daddy, Puffy or P. Diddie.
Another rapper Snoop Dogg was named Snoop Lion. Similarly, the late music legend Prince changed his name to a symbol and later returned to the original name of Prince.
Accused of murder in connection with the attack on a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with murder after being stabbed by a man at a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Bellyhacamore, police said.
The accused will appear in Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The Public Prosecution Service will conduct an investigation into the allegations.
The Harrington Kiddy of Game of Thrones Star Kit against the toxic masculinity
Kit Harrington, best known for his role as Sword Elder John Snow on the HBO violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor, who is angry at the idea of Macho Hero, said that because of such roles on screen, boys often face the possibility that they will only get respect if they are firm.
In a Sunday Times Culture interview, Kit said that he felt that 'something went wrong' and said that action was needed against toxic masculinity in today's #MeToo era.
Kit, who is married to the co-star of his Game of Thrones series, Rose Leslie, 31, said he was willing to express this.
He also felt that while he personally felt strongly about this feeling, there was a gap in masculinity somewhere.
'What do we teach men as they grow up, and is this related to the problems we face today?'
He said that the reason for the toxic masculinity to grow to this level is because of the television.
He continued: "What is Inspura and Bodhit?
What is the factor that makes young boys think of themselves as men in what they see on TV and in the streets?
I think this is one of the biggest questions of our time. How can we change this?
The truth is that something is wrong with the boys.'
He said in an interview that when the sequel ends next summer, he won't be bothered by any Game of Thrones.
From November, Kit will play the role of Sam Shepherd in the sequel True West, a story about a filmmaker and his brother a bandit.
He said he would like to meet his wife Rose to get out of Game of Thrones.
He said, 'I met my wife on this show, so this is how it provided me with my future family.
Rose Kitt's role as the love interest Wigriet in John Snow, the fantasy series won an Emmy Award.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate
HIV/AIDS: China has seen a 14% increase in AIDS cases
China has increased the number of people living with HIV and AIDS by 14%.
Officials said more than 8,20,000 people are affected by AIDS.
More than 40,000 cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
The significant change is that the majority of cases are found to be related to sexual contact.
Traditionally, blood transfusions have been the reason for the rapid spread of HIV in China.
Chinese health officials in Yunnan state said the HIV outbreak was almost zero.
Year-on-year, there has been a 100,000 increase in the number of people living with HIV in China.
In China's LGBT community, sexually transmitted HIV is a serious problem.
Although homosexuality was legalized in China in 1997, discrimination against LGBT people continues.
According to studies, about 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women.
Diseases are spread by the lack of proper treatment in such relationships.
To eliminate this problem, China has provided comprehensive access to HIV medicine since 2003.
Maxine Waters accused of not leaking information, 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiracy charges' against GOP senators
U.S. Republican Maxine Waters on Saturday protested allegations that one of its staff posted personal information on Wikipedia pages of three Republican senators and Lamakers.
He said right-wing pundits and websites are spreading propaganda about this.
Waters said in a statement on Twitter that "liars, lies and more horrible lies".
The information released reportedly included the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Arin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information was found online on Thursday, posted by an unknown person during a Senate panel hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against Brett Kavanagh on Capitol Hill.
The matter was leaked shortly after Kavanagh was questioned by three senators.
According to the IP addresses reported by the conservative sites Gateway Pandit and Red State, the origin of the posts was the Water Office and the content may have been published by members of the Water staff.
'This unknown allegation is entirely false and malicious,' Waters said.
'My personnel, their identity and security are all being exposed by these fraudulent and false allegations.
'This unknown allegation is completely false and malicious,' he said.
Waters' statement was immediately met with online criticism, which was criticized by former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
'This refusal is outrageous,' Fletcher wrote.
This shows that Waters is not eligible to become a member of Congress.
If someone is accused of something that is not true, he should not be angry.
They don't have to be so violent.
They do not have to say that the accused are malicious.
They must be calm and patient.'
Fleischer seemed to be comparing Waters's response to the Democratic criticism of Justice Kavanagh, who appeared to be furious by Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running to remove Waters in the midterm elections, shared his thoughts on Twitter.
'This is great news in truth,' he tweeted.
Waters said in a statement that the fraud claims have been notified to the relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies.
'It will be revealed who is behind this episode,' Waters said, 'and the people who have taken actions that are destructive and dangerous to my staff will be held accountable by the law for their actions.'
Johnny English Strikes Again - The Spy Movie by Sappé Rowan Atkinson
Johnny English Strikes Again Review - The Sappé Rowan Atkinson Spy Movie British cinema as it is today. The Brexit theme is not without its share of importance. It has also spread to the comedy Johnny English series.
Is it a sarcastic self-parody that we have clearly done poorly as a new export of the nation?
In any case, Johnny English, a pop-eyed, rubber-faced cripple, has a second chance at updating his stuff - a name that suggests he has designed a comedy structure for non-English speaking cinematic areas above all else.
He was of course a Daft Secret agent who was somewhat cowardly despite his glamorous excuses, having contributed his earliest contribution to a note of the Charities of Fire theme tune at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
He is originally an international figure of the secret actinson who has appeared in now-forgotten barc clackard tv commercials, who has been confusing people by waking up.
There are a few happy moments on this recent JE tour.
As I approached Johnny English's helicopter, I really liked to see the medieval suit and rotor blade he was wearing hanging around him.
Atkin's Son, gifted with physical humor, was now being performed, but the comedy seemed powerless and bizarre, especially compared to the "serious" 007 and Mission Impossible-like films that now contribute to the comedy as a part of the plot.
I feel that the humor in it was more aimed at children than adults and I felt that the vices of Johnny English's illusion were not creative and focused and that the personality of Bean was focused on the muted image of Atkin Son.
Now the more timely premise is that Great Britain is in serious trouble.
The cyber-hacker has infiltrated Britain's top-secret web network, revealing the identities of all UK agents in the field, which has disappointed agent officials on duty.
This will be the last straw for a bold and arrogant prime minister who is already suffering from complete disintegration from political disgrace: Emma Thompson does her best with this quasi-Theresa-May role but there is nothing more to work on the script.
Her intelligence advisers tell her that since each of the undercover agents has made a deal, she will have to bring someone out of retirement.
The main implication is to inflate Johnny English, who is now a school teacher at some luxury institution, but provide undocumented insights into how to operate in secret: some of the best fun of this is to provide a school like the English spy rock-type academy.
English is brought back to White Hall for an emergency description and merged with those suffering from side kick bowling for a long time, which is again performed by Ben Miller.
Bow is now a married man who has hit the submarine commander with a jelly-hunky-sticks role, in which Wiki Pepper Dine is a bit of a waste.
Hagyake Bateman and Robin make terrible mistakes in Her Majesty's Secret Service, where they face Olga Kurilenko's beautiful Femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
Not only that, but the Prime Minister is at risk under a tech billionaire who claims to solve Britain's computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, managed by Jack Lacey.
English and Bo begin their act of their ironic high-zinks in the guise of clocks as they set fire to a French restaurant; they smuggle on a luxury cruise ship in Volta; and English triggers pure chaos to use a virtual reality headset to introduce himself to the interior of the Volta house.
The last sequence of the show will certainly take all the stops, but it is friendly and lively.
Something that is moderate enough.
And I couldn't think like other Johnny English films: Can the British film industry really give Rowan Atkinson a role that does justice to his talent?
Britain is working four days a week but is making a plan to pay for five days but it is being denied by workers.
Jeremy Carbin's Labour Party is considering a radical plan that would require Britons to work four days a week - but pay for five.
The party wants company bosses to pass on the savings made through the Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution by giving employees an extra day off.
It sees employees enjoying three days - a weekend - but taking home the same amount of pay.
The idea is in line with the party's economic agenda and plans to turn the country in favour of workers, the sources said.
The Trades Union Congress has approved a change to four days a week to reflect the benefits of a changing economy for workers.
Labour Party officials told The Sunday Times: 'A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
'This kind of action will not happen overnight but a four-day workweek is an aspiration to align with the Party's approach to economic balance and the overall industrial strategy of the Party in favour of workers.'
As the Green Party pledged four days a week during its 2017 general election campaign, Labour will not be the first to approve such an idea.
However, this ambition is not fully endorsed by the current Labour Party.
As one Labour Party official put it: 'Four days a week is not party policy and is not considered by the party.'
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell held a Labour Conference last week to push the vision of a socialist revolution in economics.
Mr. MacDonnell said that the decision to withdraw power from the 'faceless directors' and 'beneficiaries' in utility organisations has been taken.
Shadow Chancellor Plans Current shareholders in water companies may not get their full stake back, as the Labour government can make 'reductions' based on perceived wrongdoing.
He also ensured a plan to create in-clusive ownership funds to recruit workers on company boards and private sector organisations to hand over 10 per cent of shares to employees who will pocket annual dividends of up to £500.
Linda Say Graha, John Kennedy, says "60 Minutes" that the FBI's Kavanagh investigation could change their minds,
The FBI investigation into the allegations against Justice Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on the Supreme Court nomination for at least a week and has raised questions about whether the bureau's findings could motivate any Republican senators to draw their support.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, "60 Minutes" reporter Scott Pelly asked Republican Sen. John Kennedy and Lindsay Ransom if the FBI could catch anything that would change their minds.
Kennedy appeared more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
"That is, either", said Kennedy.
"He said that I am going to the trial, I have spoken to Judge Kavanagh.
When it happened, I called them, and the charge came out, 'Did you do it?'
He was determined, determined, uncertain".
However, Rasham's decision was as firm as a stone.
"My mind is shaped about Brett Kavanagh and it takes the charge of dynamite", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but this I do know: Brett vehemently denied it, referring to Christine Bresley Ford.
"And not everyone they name was verified by them.
It is 36 years old.
I saw no new change".
What is the Global Civic Festival and have you done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday New York will host the Global Civic Festival, an annual music event that features a star-studded performance and an equally impressive mission; ending world poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Civic Festival will not only bring the Great Lawn of Central Park to enjoy acts like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendes but also raise awareness of the true purpose of the event.
The Global Civic Festival, announced in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Initiative, an international advocacy group with the hope of ending poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
To receive a free ticket to the event (unless you're willing to pay for a VIP ticket), concerts had to complete a number of tasks or other meaningful ways to help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty, such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, phone call, or whatever.
But how successful has global civilization been in 12 years of achieving its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a real way to convince people to call or another case called "click vision" - do people think they're making a real difference by signing an online petition or tweeting?
Since 2011, Global Civilization claims to have recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, which has different goals.
It said that these actions have helped to encourage world leaders to declare commitments and policies equivalent to $37 billion, with a view to impacting the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the Group cited 390 commitments and announcements arising from its activities, of which at least $10 billion in funds have already been distributed or raised.
The group estimates that safe funds have directly affected around 649 million people worldwide so far.
Some of the key commitments to nutrition include the Russia-based partnership, which promises to provide $35 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the county after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from global citizens.
"With the support of the Russian government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a landmark in history", Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracy Ulman told the audience at a live concert in London in April 2018.
After the Russian government took more than 5,000 steps to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project called Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions, the group said.
In response to one of the most frequently asked questions on its website, "How do you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizens' Answer: "It's a very long and difficult road - sometimes we fail and fail.
But we will succeed as the larger civil rights and anti-racist movements ahead of us, because together we are more powerful.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Sean Mendes, Card B, Janelle Money will perform at this year's event in New York, hosted by Deborah-Lee Fernes and Hugh Jackman.
The US Navy could be used as a "blockade" to disrupt Russian energy exports - Interior Secretary
Secretary Ryan Zinke has revealed that the washington will be used by its US Home Fleet if "necessary" to hide Russian power in markets, including the Middle East, as the Washington Examiner said.
Zinc alleged that Russia's main involvement in Syria, which is operating at the invitation of a legitimate government - is an excuse to explore new and powerful markets.
"Because they are in the Middle East, I believe they want to be an intermediary power in Eastern Europe, in the south-central part of Europe", he said.
And according to the official, there are ways and ideas to deal with it.
"With our fleet, the United States has that ability to ensure that sea lanes are open and blockade if necessary, to ensure that their power does not go to market", he said.
Zinka was addressing attendees at an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, which describes itself as "the voice of consumer energy" in the United States.
He went there to compare Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, saying they were effectively the same.
"The economic choice over Iran and Russia is less, more fuel control and replacement", he said, referring to Russia as "a smart horse" with an economy that relies on fossil fuels.
The Trump administration has replaced Russia with the intention of exporting its liquefied natural gas to Europe, a very cheap option for European consumers.
For that effect, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump, try to convince Germany to exit the "unnamed" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, was a "prisoner" of Berlin Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is set to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is just a financial project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is motivated solely by economic reasons and is an example of dishonest competition.
I believe we share the view that after meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak cannot be a means of driving pressure and consumers can choose suppliers.
The US position has been reversed by Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry body, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US to refrain from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I had a big problem when a third state interfered with our energy supply", said Dietter Kemp, head of the German Federation of Industries (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Prime Minister Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Mass Chutes Senator says Elizabeth Warren had "hard work" when she ran for president in 2020
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday that she would face "hard work" to run for president after the midterm elections.
At Town Hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering competing.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government and the issue of women being better off", she told Hill.
"After November 6, I will work hard to run for president".
During the Town Hall, Warren pressured President Donald Trump, "They're taking this county in the wrong direction.
"I am concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", he said.
Warren has spoken out openly against Trump and his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's criticism.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "We need an FBI investigation before the vote".
A survey released on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's units do not think they should compete in 2020.
According to a survey by the Center for Political Research/Boston Globe of Suffolk University, 58 percent of Massachusetts voters stated that "possibly" a senator should not run.
Thirty-two percent of the people supported such a competition.
A poll of the competition conducted by former Governor Deval Patrick showed high support for 38, percent of people with potential driving and 48 percent support.
Other top Democratic names discussed in relation to the 2020 feasibility study include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden has said he will formally conclude by January, the Associated Press reported.
Donald Trump called for Trac Pauline's PTSD from Sarah Pauline's office at a meeting
Track Paulin spent a year in Iraq after joining on 26 September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
"I can relate to what my own son is doing, what he is doing when he comes back, to other families experiencing PTSD severity, and to the families of our soldiers who have returned injured", she told the audience at a meeting for Donald in Lusa, Oklahoma.
Paulin called his capture "the elephant in the room", and regarding his son and other war veterans, "they come back a little different, they come back with a firm mind, they wonder respectfully what their companion is soldiers and airmen and every other member of the military has contributed to the country".
He was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska on Monday and confiscated a weapon in connection with domestic violence, allegations of domestic violence against women, interference with domestic violence reporting and reports of domestic violence and rape, a spokesman for the Das Benet Wasilla Police Department said.
18 States, D.C. Support for the New Asylum Policy Challenged
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy of refusing asylum to those fleeing predators or domestic violence.
Friends of the Court on Friday filed a brief petition in Washington from representatives of 18 states and districts to challenge the policy and support asylum seekers, NBC News reported.
Grace v. Nancy Plaintiff, full name. The case against federal policy filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August, has not been disclosed.
She told her partner that she was abused by the children of her violent gang members, but that US authorities denied her asylum request on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Attorneys for states supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as creating a large number of applicants for U.S. asylum, with nations facing wide ranging problems with looting and domestic violence.
The new U.S. Asylum Policy reversed a 2014 decision by the Immigration Appeals Board that allowed undocumented immigrants who did not flee domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law", as District of Columbia Attorney General Carl Reisin said in a statement Friday.
"All asylum claims under federal law must be determined on the basis of specific facts and circumstances and such listing violates that principle", court's friendliness summarized.
The lawyer briefly argued that a policy of denial of entry to immigrants would hurt the U.S. economy, saying they were likely to become business partners and "supply the necessary labor".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions Migration ordered the judge to no longer provide shelter to victims fleeing domestic violence and mass violence.
"Asylum is available to those who leave their homeland due to exploitation or fear of leaving because of their race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion", Sessions said of the June 11 policy.
Ashleyam will never be able to solve all the problems faced by people all over the world every day, even all the serious problems.
Desperate rescue efforts are partly due to the doubling of the death toll in the race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was more dire.
"It is very stressful", said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, who is comforting a fever-stricken boy at a centre for his relocation to Palu city.
"Every minute an ambulance brings bodies.
Clean water is very scarce".
The residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, picking up their waterlogged household items, and seeing if anything was worth using.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals were flooded by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
Some of the wounded, including Dwai Harris, who suffered from a broken back and shoulder, rested outside the parish military hospital, where patients were being treated outdoors because there was not much room.
He told his wife and children that the earthquake had shaken his fifth-floor hotel room.
"We don't have time to keep ourselves.
I got stuck in the remains of the wall", Harris told the Associated Press, telling the family that he had gone to the wedding and was in town.
"My wife begged for help, but then she kept quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they are safe".
The US ambassador accused China of "threatening" through propaganda ads
After a Chinese daily published a four-page ad in an American daily describing the benefits of China-US trade relations, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using American media to achieve its objectives.
US President Donald Trump accused China of trying to influence the US congressional elections, which are set to begin on November 6, after the US newspaper Paid Supplement appeared on Iowa's best-selling daily Des Moines Register on Wednesday.
US officials told Reuters that Trump's allegation that Beijing is trying to influence the US election was part of an effort to pressure China.
It is common for foreign governments to publish advertisements in newspapers to promote business, but Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in a trade war and are moving forward with increasing taxes on goods sold to each other.
Chinese and American manufacturers have said that China has imposed every tax on American manufacturers in a way that would benefit exporters in states like Iowa who support Trump's Republican Party.
According to Terry Branstad, a former US ambassador to China and longtime governor of Iowa and a major agricultural exporter to China, China has been bargaining for American workers, farmers and businesses.
According to Bran Stad in the Sunday Des Moines Register, 'China is also trying to get its wheat by advertising in our open presses right now.'
"The American tradition of free press has allowed China to buy flour, as evidenced by the advertisement in the Des Moines Register", wrote Bran Stedd.
"In contrast, if you visit China at the Newsstand in Beijing's Wall, you will not find any kind of opinion against the economic troubles there.
"One of China's leading newspapers was reluctant to publish my article", he said, but did not name which.
Analysts warn Republicans who are excluding women voters in the Kavanagh case
Analysts have warned that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanagh, who faces multiple sexual assault charges, will face intense opposition from voters, especially women, in the upcoming midterm elections as several top Republicans defend him.
The sentiment on this issue is so high that most Republicans are officially saying they want to vote.
There's no going back on those things", Grant Richter, professor of political science at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, said in a Saturday article.
He said he doubts that Senator Jeff Fleck's last-minute attempt to conduct an FBI investigation is enough to anger angry voters.
"Women may not be able to forget what happened yesterday - whether it's tomorrow or November, they won't", said Karen Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MovOn, to The Washington DC Daily on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters demonstrated in the Senate's hallway shouting "November is coming!" Yet Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee have decided to proceed with Kavanagh's nomination.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of Democrats is unprecedented", said the conservative political analyst Stu Rothenberg to the News Site.
"It is already being said that this is a matter of dispute, and it is true.
But it can be higher, especially among women who change their party living in suburban areas and young voters aged 18-29 who don't like the president who don't vote".
Analysts had previously said that Republicans may face strong public opposition to continue the nomination, even before Ford made a public statement about allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee.
According to NBC News, in the first half of last week, former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele said "it's complicated to the GOP".
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote or whether Kavanagh gets a seat, Kavanagh gets a seat, but how Republicans handled the matter and how they took care of her", Guy Sicille, director of Priorites USA, told a news channel.
The Americans seem a little confused about the statements made by Ford and Kavanagh, and most are a little more Ford-favorite.
According to a new survey by YouGov, 41 percent of people believe Ford, while 35 percent believe Kavanagh.
Additionally, 38 percent of respondents believe Kavanagh lied during his interrogation, compared to 30 percent who believe Ford lied.
The FBI is currently investigating Ford's allegations after bringing the Flack case forward.
Ford has been accused of sexual assault in a drunken car when he was 17 years old by the Ford Senate Judiciary Committee .
Ramirez allegedly showed off his penis when Kavanagh attended a party while they were both studying at Yale in the 1980s.
Set up a World Wide Web search engine for Google and Facebook
World Wide Web searcher Tim Berners-Lee is set to launch a new startup to kick off Google, Facebook and Amazon.
A technology legend, Li is set to build a new project called Inputt, Open Source Platform.
With Solid, it is possible to control where users collect data and who can read what information.
In a special interview with Fast Company, Inrupt jokingly said that the original purpose was to make the world cry".
"Let's do this now", he said of the startup.
"This is a historic occasion".
Using solid technology, people can create their own "personal online data store or pod".
It is to provide contact lists, to-do lists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It works like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify. It's all available here at the same time in the same browser.
The unique feature of a personal online data store is that it is entirely user-related.
The company has called it 'personal empowerment through data.'"
According to company CEO John Bruce, the idea behind Inrupt is to provide the company with the resources, methodology and appropriate skills to make solid everywhere.
The company currently has a community of developer staff and volunteer coders hired to work on the project, including a security platform purchased by Berners-Lee, Bruce, IBM.
Starting this week, technology developers from all over the world will be able to create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inverted website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team "will not talk to Facebook and Google about suddenly introducing a way to change their business".
"We do not need to ask their permission".
In a Saturday post on Medium, Berners-Lee said, "Inrupt's goal is to build a commercial power and operating environment that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on solid".
In 1994, he led a revolutionary change in the Internet with his research into the World Wide Web at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been a very influential voice in the net neutrality debate.
In addition to launching Inrupt, Burns Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
Berners-Lee has said he is very optimistic about the coming age of the Web.
Bernard Van: A memorial to the Victorian Cross winner in World War I
The Victorian Cross was awarded to a priest who was a World War I veteran and was commemorated in his 100th year in his birthplace.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Van was awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions on 29 September 1918 in the Battle of Bayleigh and the Battle of Leighcourt.
But four days later he was shot and killed in the back of the head from a distance. He was not left to enjoy receiving the Victoria Cross, the highest military honour.
His grandchildren inaugurated the memorial stone on Saturday at the Kauaiat in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Van, said that the erection of the stone in his memory, 100 years after receiving the Victoria Cross, was truly symbolic.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Van with his battalion moved to Canal de Saint Quentin, where a fog of traffic was breaking and the enemy machine guns were sounding a barrage of gunfire".
He then went down to the battlefield to show great bravery, taking the lead and using a field gun alone to repel three of his opponents.
Lieutenant Colonel Van was shot and killed by a German assailant on 4 October 1918, a month before the end of World War I.
"I can be extremely humble about this", said Michael Van, 72, "although I can't repeat what my grandfather has accomplished in his life".
After the military coup, he and his brother Dr. James Van completed the foundation stone, which was organized by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Van said, "It is an honour to be part of this event" and "It is a tribute to the heroic courage of the hero and it has been wholeheartedly supported by so many people".
Pepa Pig has been found by MMA fans who waited all night to watch Bellator 206.
Imagine that you were up all night watching Bellator 206, but you were not allowed to attend the main event.
Bill of San Jose had a total of 13 fights, including six on Maincard and was shown overnight live on Channel 5.
At 6am, Gerard Moussaci and Rory MacDonald were preparing to hit the ground running when Peppa Pig came to the UK fans in shock.
It was natural that some of the audience who had booked until the morning for this fight were angry.
A fan tweeted that 'This is a bad joke' about the children's cartoon show being broadcast.
"The 6:00 a.m. fight was not appropriate under the government's broadcasting policy, so they had to broadcast the children's program", said Dave Squarz, senior vice president of marketing and communications at Bletcher.
""Pep the Pig, yes".
The President of the Bellator Company, Scott Cocker, said that in the future he will also be preparing a schedule for the event with UK viewers in mind.
"I think we can probably set the replay time to fit the UK", Cocker said.
"But it is six o'clock there on Sunday morning. But we cannot set it until our Sunday time, their Monday time", he said.
However, we are trying to adjust this.
Yes, they were all angry when we had to stop the broadcast, the messages were in flood, they were all messy.
We are trying to fix this, we thought it might be a technical problem.
But this is not the case, they are following the instructions of the government.
I can assure you that this will not happen next time.
He said that we could bring the total to five fights instead of six fights, which we had done before.
This is a sad situation".
Desert Island Discs: A minority on sex with Tom Daly
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he feels inferior to his sexuality, but that's what motivates him to achieve and what makes him successful.
It was not until he was 24 years old and in high school that he realized that everyone was not like him.
Speaking at the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs hosted by Lauren Laverne, he spoke about gay rights to provide hope for others.
He said that being a parent of children has made him less concerned about the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, who regularly oversees the show, took several months off.
Daily, who appeared as a cast member on Laverne's show, said that although she felt inferior to others, it was not normal to like boys and girls.
He said: "I have been empowered to succeed in feeling inferior or different until now".
He wanted to create an environment where no one would feel anything about him even if they knew about his sexuality.
A two-time Olympic bronze medalist, she became a high-profile LGBT campaigner, this time forcing most countries to remove homosexuality from the criminal record during the Commonwealth Games in Australia.
He said he was happy to be living freely and working to inspire hope in others.
In 2013, she began to fall in love with a man named Dustin Lance Black, a U.S. filmmaker.
Daly married Oscar-winning Lance Black last year, who was 20 years older than her, but she felt that age gaps were not a big deal.
"A lot happened at a young age", recalled the young man who won his first Olympic medal at age 14. Three years later, his father died of cancer.
The couple became parents of a son, Robert Ray Black-Daley, who changed the way Daley lived.
"If you had asked me last year, I was talking about winning a gold medal.
"You may know, there are bigger things in life than Olympic gold medals.
Robbie is my Olympic gold medal".
He was named after his father, Robert, who died of brain cancer in 2011 at age 40.
According to Daily, his father Robert was not interested in dying. He always asked if he could get a ticket to sit in the front row of the 2012 London Olympics.
"But how can I tell you that you can't be on the front line", asks Daley.
And his breath ceased, as I held his hand; and I thought, He shall live until his breath cease; and after his death he shall not be.
Maruvasha Daly won the bronze medal at the 2012 Olympics.
"All my life I dreamed of diving in front of my country's Olympic spectators, where there was no greater joy than winning a medal".
It was also the inspiration for their first song, Heather Small's Proud. The song not only resonated during the preparation for the Olympics, but also filled with excitement.
Desert Island Discs on Sunday at 11:15 BST on BBC Radio 4.
Ryder Cup break for the lost Michaelson on Saturday
American Phil Michaelson was scheduled to play his 47th Ryder Cup game on Sunday, but if he wanted to make a milestone this time around, he would have to get back to the rhythm.
Michaelson, who is competing in a record 12th biennial tournament, was rested by team captain Jim Furyk at Saturday's Four Balls and Four Sams.
A standout player for the United States, as well as a bright spot in the Raiders Cup, the four-time Major Winner spent the day as a cheerleader and focused on improving his game.
At the height of his career, Lee, a 48-year-old player who was not directly successful, was no role model for the National Golf Course.
Although the course is not as challenging, Michaelson will face British Open champion Francesco Molinari in Game 9 on Sunday, having won all four of his matches this week with Tommy Fleetwood.
Michaelson's performance in the Hot Start squad will be a complete highlight for the Americans, who have scored four points off 12 singles starts.
Furyk said nothing but confidence about his teammate.
"He fully understood what his role was today. He hugged my back and said he was ready for tomorrow's match with his arms around me", Furyk said.
"They have a lot of confidence.
He was inducted into the Hall of Fame and has made a great contribution to these teams in the past.
I did not think that he would play only two games.
I thought I could win more, but it happened this way, and we thought it was the right decision.
They want to be here like everyone else".
Michaelson will break Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup games played on Sunday.
This marks the end of his Ryder Cup career, which does not match the height of his personal record.
Michelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven half-centuries, although his presence has brought some ambiguity to the team, Furyk said.
"He's a funny, satirical, funny guy. He likes to make fun of people, and he's the best guy on our team", he explained.
The younger players were having fun going to them, and even this week, I think it will be fun to watch.
They offer more than just game.
European leader Thomas Jorn says a large-scale lead will soon disappear
European captain Thomas Jorn knows from experience that a major lead in the singles match on the final day of the Ryder Cup tournament can easily turn into an unpleasant ride.
Dan made his debut in a 1997 match at Waldorma, where the team under the captaincy of Save Ballesteros had scored five points over the Americans but only got the final line from the narrow edges to their nose in the front, a victory at 141⁄2-131⁄2 innings.
After seeing the class of 2018 win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday to lead 10-6 in the National Golf League, you will remember that we had a great lead at Waldermara; we had a great lead at Brooklyn, where we lost, and at Waldermara, where we won, but only, said Jorn.
So history shows that this is not over for me and for everyone on the team.
Tomorrow will be very boring for everyone.
Go out there and do the right thing.
It's not over until you get points on the board.
We have one goal, and that is to try to win this trophy, and that's where the focus remains.
I've said everywhere, I'm focusing on the 12 players on my team, but we know very well what's on the other side - the best players in the world".
Jorn said that he was happy to see how his players have performed on the tough golf course: I will not let go of this.
Tomorrow will be different.
Tomorrow is the coming personal exhibitions, and that's another thing to do.
It's good to be with a partner when everything is going well, but when you stand out separately, your ability as a golfer is fully tested.
The message is that you have to contact the players, and you will get better results from them tomorrow.
For now, let your companions go and expect the best from them".
Unlike Beazorn, opponent number Jim Furyk is performing better than his players as a part-ner, despite Jordan Speeth and Justin Thomas scoring three out of four.
Furyk himself is on the edge of both stages of that last trade, having been part of the winning team at Brooklyn before ending the loser as Europe "walked out on Medina at Medina".
"When I was asked how Ben Krane Shah, the captain in 1999, put his players together for the last day, I remembered every bad word of it", he said.
"We have 12 big matches tomorrow, but you want to start as fast as you saw in Medina at Brookline.
When that is fast, it puts a lot of pressure on those midfielders.
You know, we're going to line up and we're going to raise the boys the way we want, and we're going to try to do some magic tomorrow".
Thomas is tasked with trying to lead the fight back and will face Rory McLeary in the first match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Paulter facing other Europeans in the top half of the order.
"I went with this group of guys in this order, because I think it's going to be covered in every way", said Jorn about his singles options.
The German warship was again postponed
A new fleet of German Navy warships was to be deployed in 2014 to replace Cold War-era warships, but local media reported that it would not be possible until the following year due to faulty systems and snowball costs.
According to Direct, a military spokesperson, the flagship of the brand new Baden-Wittenberg-class frigates, "Rhine Land-Fall" has now been postponed until the first half of 2019.
The ship was due to join the Navy in 2014, but some post-delivery issues ruined the future of the ambitious project.
Four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships ordered back in 2007 by the Navy will replace the Bremen-class battleships.
They are known to contain some classified technologies such as powerful artillery, anti-aircraft and anti-ship missile range and low radar, unmanned and acoustic signatures.
Other key features include long service periods, the possibility of new warships being deployed from major local ports for up to two years.
However, due to the constant delay of the most advanced warships - which are said to allow Germany to project power overseas - they will already be outdated by the time they enter service, says Direkt.
Tragically, the F125 refused to be retained as an official ship of the German Navy last year and made headlines by returning it to the Blohm and Vos shipyard in Hamburg.
This will be the first time the Navy has returned the ship to the Shipbuilder after delivery.
The reason for the withdrawal was little known, but the German media cited several critical factors about it, such as "lack of software and hardware" that would render a warship useless if deployed in battle.
The Badon-Würnenberg-class ships are operated by about 120 naval sailors, and software shortages may have a partial major impact - half the manpower used here compared to older Bremen-class warships.
Also, the ship is overweight and that will reduce its performance and limit the ability of the fleet to add future upgrades.
The 7,000 thousand tonne "Rhine Land-Fall" is believed to be twice the weight of the equivalent class of ships used by the Germans in World War II.
Apart from faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project - including staff training - is becoming an issue.
It is said to have initially reached €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) from €2.2 billion.
These difficulties are particularly important in obtaining new warships under the recent warnings that the German navy is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, admitted that the navy was actually "leaving the deployment-capable ships".
Over time, the problem grew like a snowball, the official said, as old ships were cancelled but no replacement ships were provided.
He regretted that no Baden-Württemberg-class navy could rejoin the Navy.
The National Trust is making a mockery of the secret life of bats
New research is underway in the Scottish Highlands estate, which aims to reveal how bats use land for their hunting.
The findings on the behaviour of unique flying mammals are believed to shed new light and guide future conservation activities.
A study by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland followed common and soprano pipistrels, including brown-length ears and dubentoon pods.
Special recorders are kept at key locations of their movements to track the activities of the bats in all seasons.
NHS staff and volunteers are also conducting surveys on mobile using handheld filters.
Expert sound analysis of all the recordings will confirm the frequency of the cries of the bats and what species are doing.
A habitat map and report are made to create a detailed landscape picture of their behavior.
NTS Nature Conservation Advisor Rob Dewar, hopes the results will reveal which habitats are most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work such as grassland creation and better understanding of how to manage wilderness for bats and other related species.
The population of the Bawali has declined significantly over the past century across Scotland and the UK.
They are threatened by building and development works, which affect chicken and habitat loss.
Some chemicals in fly papers and building materials can cause damage, as can wind turbines and lighting on pet cats.
The bats are not really blind.
However, since they are accustomed to hunting at night, their ears are more helpful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use state-of-the-art echo-location techniques to identify flaws and obstacles in their flight path.
NTS is also very serious about the Baoli, which has over 270 historic buildings, 38 major parks and 76,000 hectares of land across the country.
It has ten trained experts who conduct continuous surveys, verify and sometimes defend.
The organisation established the first and only conservation reserve of bowls in Scotland at Dumfries and Threw Estate in Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten bowling varieties.
As the estate manager David Thompson says, the estate is the right area for him.
"We have a good area for the buffaloes in Thrive", he said.
"We have old buildings, lots of big trees and all the good habitats.
But we don't know enough about bats, so we're working here and helping to understand more about what they need to do to thrive in other places".
He stresses the importance of testing the litter before managing the site, as 400 female species and younger generations have been wiped out without adequate maternal care, possibly the entire population.
The bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass or harass them or destroy their offspring.
Elizabeth Farrell, Scottish officer of the Conversion of Bails Trust, has encouraged the public to help.
He says: "We still have to learn about our cattle and how many of our generations have not yet learned about their populations".
Ronaldo denied rape claims because of a lawsuit brought against German Mag Jean
Cristiano Ronaldo has identified the rape claim against him as "fake news", saying people use their name to "promote themselves".
His lawyers are ready to sue the German news newspaper Der Spiegel, which published the charges.
Portugal and Juventus Forward have accused an American woman named Catherine Mayorca of raping her in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
Der Spiegel reported on Friday that he was alleged to have paid $375,000 for keeping quiet about the incident.
Speaking in a live video on Instagram with his 142 million followers just hours after the claims were reported, 33-year-old Ronaldo said it was all "fake news".
"All, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
He said today, fake news, five-time Blane Divor winner in front of the camera.
"They are doing this to make themselves known by my name.
It's normal.
They're making a name for themselves using my name, but that's part of the job.
I am very happy and all is well, only another player is included, he laughed.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers have prepared to sue Der Spiegel, which he called "an unacceptable report on suspicions in the area of privacy".
The lawyer Christian Skirtz is seeking "compensation for moral damages in the amount corresponding to the violation, which is one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years".
The incident was reportedly reported in a suit at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas in June 2009.
After meeting at the nightclub, papers filed in the Clark County District Court in Nevada reported that Ronaldo and Mayoga went back to the player's room and then raped her.
After the alleged incident, Ronaldo fell at my feet and told her that he was "99 percent a good guy".
Records say Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had a sexual relationship, but they agreed.
Mayogra went to the police and gave pictures of her injuries in hospital, but she later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was "scared of retaliation" and worried about "public humiliation".
The 34-year-old said she was shocked by the alleged incident and was now trying to cancel the settlement.
At the time of the allegations, Ronaldo was on his way from Manchester United to Real Madrid and agreed a €100 million deal with Italian giant Juve this summer.
Brexit: The UK will forever regret the loss of carmakers
UK Secretary of State for Business Greg Clarke said he "lastingly regrets" the UK's loss of its status as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit.
Toyota has told the BBC that if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, it will temporarily halt production at its plant in Bernaston near Derby.
"We need a deal", Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of the border delay of the Brexit event without any deal could cost jobs.
The Bernaston plant, which manufactures Toyota's Yarris and Avensis, produced about 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My opinion is that if Britain is hit by the EU at the end of March, production at our factory will stop", said Marvin Cook, Toyota's managing director.
Other UK carmakers have expressed concern about leaving the EU without any deal on how cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, will work.
For example, BMW has announced that it will close its mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The problem with the car manufacturers is that there are risks to supply chain issues in the absence of a deal on Brexit.
Toyota's production line is operated on a "only-time" basis, with spare parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU.
The industry says that if the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be disruption at the border due to delays and a lack of spare parts.
Toyota has said it is impossible to stock a day's worth of stock at its Derbyshire plant, thus stopping production.
Mr. Clarke said Theresa May's Checker's Plan for Future Relations with the EU is "precisely calibrated to avoid those checks at the border".
"We need to make a deal. We want to have the best deal we can allow as I say to enjoy the current success", he told the BBC Radio 4 programme today.
"The evidence from not only Toyota but also other manufacturers is that we must be fully capable of continuing the most successful supply chains".
Toyota cannot say how long production will be halted, but in the long run, he warned, the additional costs will reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately hurt jobs.
Peter Tzwalaris, who worked at Bernaston for 24 years and was a United Union conveyor at the plant, said that his members were very concerned: "In my experience once these jobs are lost, they cannot come back.
A government spokesman said: "We have put forward a precise and reliable plan for our future relationship with the EU".
The White House says Trump's meeting with Rosen Stein could be delayed again
As the fight against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, Donald Trump may "push back another week" on his meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the White House said on Sunday.
Due to Russian election interference, Rosen Stein is overseeing the work of Robert Mueller, a special counsel investigating ties between Trump aides and Russia and interference with justice by the president.
Washington air has been in the news for months about whether or not Trump will take on the Deputy Attorney General and endanger Muller's freedom for that.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported, Rosen Stein discussed the possibility of removing the president through the 25th Amendment to record conversations with Trump.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But he also went to the White House last Monday in anticipation of reports that he would resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump at the United Nations in New York was announced on Thursday.
Trump said he would "not prefer" shooting Rosen Stein but the meeting was delayed to avoid a conflict with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Dr. Christine Blacey Ford, one of the women accused of Kavanagh and sexual abuse, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into claims against Kavanagh, further delaying the full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting, Rosenstein said: "It is not scheduled, it may be this week, given all the other things going on in the Supreme Court, I can see it pushed back another week.
But we will see it and I want to keep the press updated".
Some reporters contend with that claim: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
The host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that not having called a press conference was not because of a lack of interest in getting attention. He explained why: "I don't disagree with what they point out".
He then suggested that direct connectivity between Trump and the press be increased.
"The president has more question-and-answer sessions than any president", he said, not citing evidence, saying: "We've seen such numbers".
Briefings still happen, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the president of the United States, it's more than just talking to me.
We try to do a lot of the same thing and you've seen a lot of it in the last few weeks and when you talk to the President of the United States it will be at a press conference".
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or attending open sessions or press conferences with visiting elites.
Solo press conferences are very rare.
This week in New York, the president performed with reporters who may have been freewheeling and sometimes bizarre.
The Health Secretary writes to EU workers in NHS Scotland about Brexit fears
The Secretary of Health has written a letter to EU staff working at NHS Scotland expressing their gratitude for the country and their desire to remain in post-Brexit position.
Jean Freeman MSP sent a letter lasting less than six months until the UK withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish Government is already committed to meeting the cost of settled status applications for EU citizens working in its improved public services.
In her letters, Ms Freeman wrote: "After the summer has ended, talks on withdrawal between the UK and the EU have continued, and are moving towards decisions expected this autumn.
But the UK government is increasing its readiness for a no-deal scenario.
I know this is a very uncomfortable time for all of you.
That is why I would like to express how much I respect the contribution of every staff, regardless of their nationality.
We will provide valuable experience and skills to strengthen and improve the work of healthcare to benefit our colleagues across the EU and beyond, and the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is completely your home and we would very much like you to stay here".
Kristen Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christian Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery on his head on Saturday, Mike Argan of Tennessee, after a 31-27 loss to the Wonder Built Commodores.
Rod Reed, Tennessee State's head coach, told reporters the injury occurred halfway through the season.
"They came to the party, what a mess", Reed said.
The coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen before placing him on the stretcher and returning him for further evaluation.
A Tennessee state official told Chris Harris of WSM in Nashville, Tennessee, that he was out of surgery for Aber Crombie at the Wonder Built Medical Center.
Harris "has no details yet on the extent of the injury" and the state of Tennessee is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Harris "has no details yet on the type/scale of the injury" and the state of Tennessee is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
He had five total tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, bringing his season totals to 18.
A higher stamp duty is charged when foreign buyers buy property in the UK
Foreign buyers are charged a higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK with the extra money used to help the homeless under the new Tory schemes
The move will neutralize the success of the drive for carbon, which attracts young voters.
In the UK, stamp duty increases are imposed on non-taxpayers
The Treasury expects to increase to £120 million a year - to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty rate when they buy property in the UK - extra money being used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
The move is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Carbin's drive to attract young voters with promises to provide affordable housing for young voters and target high-income earners.
The government has proposed to increase stamp duty on non-paying individuals and entities in the UK, with additional fees imposed on non-payers.
The additional fee - which, in addition to the current stamp duty, includes the higher levels introduced in second homes two years ago and the opportunities to buy - may be as high as three percent.
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year with this move.
Non-UK residents buy 13 per cent of new properties being built in London, which is driving prices up the ladder and making it difficult for first time homeowners to own a roof.
The large number of foreign buyers spending much of their time outside the country has made many affluent areas of the country - especially the capital - "ghost towns".
The new policy came into effect just weeks after Boris Johnson called for stamp duty cuts to help more young people have their first home.
He accused large construction companies of raising property prices by taking land and not using it and urged Mrs May to abolish quotas for affordable housing to correct Britain's "housing disgrace".
Mr. Karbin has announced a series of proposed housing reforms including rental control and ending "no fault avoidance".
He demanded that councils be given more power to build new houses.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my Prime Ministership to restoring British love - life should be better for every new generation.
This means that our sluggish housing market needs to be repaired.
Britain is always open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is not as easy to buy houses as hardworking British residents who are not in Britain and foreign-based companies.
For many, home ownership has become a long-term dream, and the slumbering slumber on the streets is a reality".
Jack Rose: Running Scotland is my ultimate ambition.
Jack Rose, head of Sunderland, said that at some point in life, it was his "ambition for the castle" to become Scotland manager.
Having embraced the challenge of reviving the North East club, the 42-year-old Scott is currently third in League One, three points down from first place.
He returned to the Stadium of Lights this summer after guiding St Mirren to the Scottish Premiership last year.
"I want to play for my country as a player.
I got a B-Cap and it was like this", Ross told BBC Scotland's Sports Sound.
"But I grew up watching Scotland with my father in Hampden from a young age, and that has always been something that has stuck with me.
He said that I will only get that opportunity if I succeed in running the club".
Among those who have previously managed Sundarland before Rose are Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardise, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo de Canio.
The former head of Aloha Athletic says he was not afraid to join such established names in such a big club. He had previously rejected offers from Barnes-le-Dreyfuss and Ipswich Town.
"The only criterion for measuring this time is how do I get this club back to the Premier League?
Due to the structure and facilities of this club, there is no doubt that it is a Premier League club.'
"It's not an easy task to get there, but I think I'll be successful here if I can get the club back there".
Rose had a career in business for only three years, having served as assistant chief at Dumberton and as coaching staff at Hearts for 15 months.
He then helped Alloa recover from a third-place finish. By the following season, he had converted Saint-Myrène from the postseason to the championship title winner.
Rose says that she now feels more comfortable than her previous careers at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren, and Hamilton Academy.
"It was probably a really turbulent time", he recalled his time in Aloha.
"I was honest and believed that management was more important to me than playing.
It's strange because I did the job right, I made a lot of money, and I got to a very high point.
But playing is really hard.
There are many things you have to do once a week.
I cannot escape it in terms of work stress and stress, it will continue. However, maintenance work seems to be the right thing to do.
I always wanted to manage and now I do. I feel that this is the most comfortable thing I can do in my entire adult life".

The summer heat has boosted the sales of struggling UK pubs, but at the same time, has increased pressure on the restaurant network.
Pubs and bars saw sales rise 2.7 percent in July - while restaurants saw sales fall 4.8 percent, figures show.
Peter Martin, of the business consultancy `CG, who collected the figures, said: "Due to the continued sunshine and England's longer-than-expected participation in the World Cup, pub sales rose 2.8 percent in July, as compared to the previous June, but restaurants have faced even more difficult days.
The decline in restaurant turnover of 1.8 per cent in June was even more severe in July.
Pubs and bars that are mainly beverage-selling have performed better than restaurants in terms of business.
Although the sun has also affected the main food festivals, it is not as serious as the restaurant owner.
It seems that people want to go out for a drink.
Sales of alcohol in managed pubs and bars increased by 6.6 per cent per month, while food sales decreased by three per cent".
Paul Newman of the Leisure and Hospitality Analysts' Institute `RSM says: "These results are a continuation of the trend we have seen since late April.
When it comes to outdoor or outdoor market sales, the climate and impact of major social or sporting events remain the biggest determinants.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to be in constant distress, as sales are falling by 4.8% year-on-year, while operating costs are rising.
This long summer should not have come during times when food-focused restaurants are in crisis. It is time to decide whether the average temperatures we experienced in August provide the necessary relief".
The total sales growth of all pubs and restaurants, including those that were newly launched in July, was 2.7%, reflecting the slowing product launch of brands.
The UK's 'Kaffer Peach Tracker', a performance data analytics firm that monitors sales in the pub, bar and restaurant industry, has now established itself as an industry standard by collecting and analyzing performance data from 47 management teams with a combined turnover of over £9 billion.
One in five children has secret social media accounts that their parents do not know about
One in five children - some as young as 11 years old - secretly have secret social media accounts, the survey revealed.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed an increase in "fake insta" pages
The news has raised fears that sexual content is being posted
Twenty percent of students said they have a "major" account to show their parents
One in five children, while some are still 11 years old, are secretly creating social media accounts that adults do not know about.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid growth in "fake insta" accounts - a reference to photo sharing site Instagram.
The news has raised fears that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty percent of students showed their parents that they are running a "main" account, a "clean" account, and also have private accounts.
According to a mother who discovered the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter for her own safety, the teenager urged her on social media to "rape me".
In a survey conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference of Independent Schools (HMC), 40 per cent of children aged 11 to 18 said they have two profiles, with half of them admitting to having private accounts.
As HMC head Mike Buchanan says: "It is alarming that many teens are being tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers cannot be found".
Elide Doyle is the "voice of athletes" at the Scottish Athletics Board
Elide Doyle has been elected to the Scottish Athletics Board as a non-executive director at the Governing Board's Annual General Meeting.
Doyle is Scotland's most popular track and field athlete. President Ian Beatty, who praised his selection process, described the last decade as a great opportunity to use Eliud's extensive experience internationally to guide the sport.
"Elid is held in high regard by the entire Scottish, British and world athletics community and I am confident that Athletes in Scotland will benefit greatly by bringing him to the board", said Betty.
Doyle said: "I am excited to be a voice for athletes and I really hope I can contribute to the direction of the sport in Scotland".
The American, who won a total of four gold medals in the 200m and 400m at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, is now a regular on the BBC.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago on this day I was suffering a stroke.
I could not walk.
The doctor said that only time could determine whether or not I recovered or to what extent.
It was a hard work, but a full recovery. I have learned how to walk again. Today I am doing agile exercises!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Pro-anti-breast pump advertising that compares mothers to her
Both opinions against the breast pump company's advertisement comparing mothers to her have been expressed online.
The world's first silently wearable breast pump has been released by consumer tech company LV. The new pump also released a bizarre music video advertising how it gives new mothers a chance to express themselves.
The video features four mothers dancing on a grass bed: Yes, my milk will call, "But you can't see the tail. If you think this is for her, it's wrong. These are my breasts".
The lyrics go on: "Pump, pump... I will give milk to the children... pump and pump and call it women's milk".
The ad posted on the company's Facebook page has sparked a lot of controversy online.
The video has already been viewed by 77,000 people and hundreds of comments. Viewers have received mixed reviews, saying it has taken the "terrible" dairy industry for granted.
"The decision to use her for this breast pump ad is poor.
Like us, these foxes are pregnant and nursing, but their calves are like those born to be stolen".
The LVE breast pump is concealed in the bra of breastfeeding mothers (LVE/mother)
Another commented: "I know that it is difficult for both mother and child.
But why not use this breast pump for the baby-carers to advertise?"
Another said: "There is no head-on advertising".
Innerro has defended the ad. One woman commented that the song is actually "funny".
"It's a common idea.
If I was still breastfeeding, I would buy one of these.
It is true that during pumping, it is felt that the water is being pumped.
Advertising may sound a little crazy, but it is a little real.
Innerro wrote that this was a genius product.
Another commented: "It's funny to mothers who feel like they're really their own people by pumping them (in workplaces and toilets)".
This is not a commercial that praises or defames the dairy industry".
Finally, the women dancing in the ad show that they are wearing a breast pump inside their bra.
The premise behind the campaign is that many mothers who use a breast pump think they are babies.
The LV pump, however, works completely quietly, with no enemies or tubes, fits well into the breastfeeding bra, gives women freedom of movement, picks up children, and can go outside when pumping.
"The LV Pump was a revolutionary product that needed a bold and provocative start", said Ana Ballarin, Partner and ECD at Mother.
We wanted to talk about breast pumping and its challenges by demonstrating equality between women and dairy cows who express themselves, and by saying this in a fun and relevant way, we can tell how to create a new sense of independence.
This is not the first time that LV Pump has appeared in the headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two catwalked using a product for designer Marta Jakuboski.
Hundreds of children quietly migrated to a tent camp on the Texas border
The Trump administration's strict administrative measures are making it difficult to provide parents for refugee children, and there has been a sharp increase in the number of children being held at the border crossing in a month despite the same number.
Traditionally, those who want to raise such children are themselves refugees, and their lives are at a disadvantage.
The risk increased further in June, when federal authorities said that individuals or families who want to raise children must provide fingerprints, so that such fingerprints are later provided to immigration authorities.
Last week, senior Immigration and Customs Enforcement official Matthew Albanes told Congress that his agency had arrested dozens of people who had tried to raise unaccompanied minors.
The agency later reported that 70 percent of those arrested had no criminal background.
"Some 80 per cent of the individuals are either sponsors or family members of sponsors who have been living here illegally, most of whom have a criminal background.
So we are trying to catch these guys", Albenes said.
To speed up the resolution of child cases, the authorities have introduced new rules that require children to appear before the court within a month of their arrest.
Most of them do not have to appear in person, but instead present their legal status via video call, which is heard by an immigration judge.
Those who do not qualify for exemption will be deported immediately.
Children are also subjected to anxiety and depression after being in custody for long periods, which can lead to violent feelings and a tendency to escape.
Lawyers say that such facilities are more likely to be in large facilities like Tornillo, which are too large to provide care for children in need.
The tent workers feel that moving children to the tent city without giving them any time to prepare emotionally, and finally not allowing them to say goodbye to friends, will only increase their pain.
Syria says it has withdrawn troops from the US, France and Turkey
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Ma'ullam called on Syrian refugees to return home as the Syrian war enters its eighth year.
Ma'aleem, also Deputy Prime Minister, said that the illegal rooting of foreign troops on Syrian soil is an excuse for them to fight terrorism and warned against them.
"They should immediately leave unconditionally", he said during the assembly.
According to Ma'aleem, the "war on terror" in Syria is now "almost over", with 360,000 people killed and millions displaced since 2011.
He said Damascus will continue its fight until it takes over Syrian territory and will fight against terrorism and illegal foreign troops.
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, most of whom are training Kurdish and other Arab forces opposing Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
More than 1,000 French troops are stationed in the war-torn country.
Speaking on the issue of refugees, Maullam said that now is the time for all of them to return home. He said that some Western countries are creating unnecessary fear and preventing refugees from returning home.
"We call on the international community and human rights organisations to allow such withdrawals", he said.
"In fact, he is also politicising on issues of humanity".
The United States and the European Union have warned that no aid will be given to Syria's reconstruction unless a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
The UN ambassadors expressed hope that the negotiations on the establishment of a buffer zone in Idlib, the last strong rebel base between Russia and Turkey, would create the right atmosphere for the start of political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey avoided the possibility of a Russian-backed Syrian army attack on the state where millions of people live.
Maullam said the agreement had a "clear deadline" and that the Syrian offensive would be directed against all jihadist groups, including the al-Qaeda-backed Nusra Front, and would be completely destroyed.
UN Ambassador Staffan de Mistura is optimistic about the formation of a new committee, made up of members of the government and opposition, which aims to shape the post-war constitution in Syria and lead to elections.
Maullam mentioned the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, saying that there was no interference in any way, and said that the purpose of the Constitutional Drafting Committee should be limited to reviewing the provisions of the current Constitution.
Trump will be president again, how?
It is not a promise or a scam that Trump will lose the presidency, but it is a rationale that Trump will be president of the United States again in 2020.

Of course, stories from Washington on TV can determine Roe's future more than anything else.
Change is a luxury that can only be achieved by the most disadvantaged.
Yet watching experts discuss on TV the $15,000 dollar Austritch Leather Jacket of Paul Manafort (Washington Post wrote Garment Thick with Hubris) ... watching the effects of Stormy Daniels' description of Trump - that's not enough information for us.
I can't see Super Mario the same way.
According to Brent Montgomery, chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment, author of 'Powne Stars', there is a feeling of a reality show every night. Trump is feeding the debates, whether it's a conflict with the NFL or a praise for Kim Jong-un.
He said that even if one episode is missed, you are far behind.

The tight midterm election has seen a lot of money thrown out by the house races.
It is not surprising to see Pennsylvania's 17th cash flow, thanks to the reorganization of congressional districts that reduced the ranks of two contenders for the same seat.
The recently recreated suburban Pittsburgh district of Hounds won another district seat in a special election last year by Democrat Rep. Connor Lamb.
Lamb is currently running for another seat, Republican Keith Roth Fuss, representing the old Pennsylvania 12th District, which overlaps with the new 17th.
The maps were recreated after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally jerry-mandated in favor of the Republicans.
The new 17th contest has touched the campaign finance slugfest between the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC), the major party finance arms.
Lamb rose to prominence in Pennsylvania after being widely watched in a special election in Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
The Republican had contested the seat for a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political pundits have given some intensity to Democrats.
The USL El Salvador was fined for supporting China, then supported
The diplomats noted that Beijing in Washington had already identified the Dominican Republic and Panama.
Mr. Trump held a close meeting with President Juan Carlos Varella of Panama in June 2017 and stayed at the Panama Hotel until the partners expelled the Trump Organization's management team.
"The State Department officials have decided to withdraw the heads of U.S. diplomatic operations in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama from further decisions to recognize Taiwan", Department spokesman Heather Naurt said in a statement earlier this month.
But the fine was only considered against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in US aid in 2017, including drug control, development and financial support.
The proposed penalties, which include cuts in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, will hurt the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings continued, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to follow a similar meeting last year, a step in efforts to prevent immigrants from entering the United States.
But by mid-September, he made it clear that the conference of top administrative officials should continue, effectively ending any consideration of the fine to El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now addressing a conference scheduled for mid-October, diplomats said, as a sign of importing administration seats.
And three American ambassadors quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without fresh harsh messages or punishments from Washington.
Mr. Bolton's White House spokesman declined to comment on the details of the discussion, three US officials, including two diplomats, explained, who agreed to discuss internal discussions on the status of anonymity.
His accounts were confirmed by external analysts close to the administration and also spoke about the status of anonymity.
The study history
The next target may be a report by Robert Mueller, special counsel on Trump's obstructions of justice, which now has ample evidence of public record.
Mr. Muller reportedly changed his investigation into whether Trump's campaign was aligned with Russia in the attacks on our elections.
As Mr. Trump prepares to go back before the electorate, Congress needs to change hands and finally the verdict of his peers is final.
It was a lot of things and I'm not suggesting that Mr. Trump's downfall is inevitable or that he has no equal in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we all have choices that will affect how long the fight will last.
In 1938, German authorities were ready to revolt against Hitler, with only the West opposing him and supporting the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We have failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the subsequent massacre.
The course of history revolves around such reflection points and the inevitability of democracy accelerates or delays.
Americans now face many of these conspiracy elements.
What should we do if Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the person controlling the future of Mr. Muller's investigation, is taken over by Mr. Trump?
Last year, the paper reported that Rosen Stein had been a gangster since he suggested the president be secretly documented and decided he was ineligible for office.
Mr. Rosenstein says that the Times account is incorrect.
"How do we respond to the newly requested F.B.I. Is Brett Kavanagh's investigation incomplete or legitimate or has he been confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and dishonest evidence?
And most importantly, will we vote in the interim for Congress to hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fail in such tests, democracy will have to be in disarray for a long time.
But I hope that we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had occupied my embassy.
She survived, then immigrated to America and 60 years later sent me to light the Sabbath candles on that table with the Swati.
As my legacy, can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Ranger Graham Dorrance was optimistic before the Rapid Vienna Conflict
Rangers host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, a victory against the Austrians, after an impressive performance in Spain earlier this month against Villarreal, will put them in a strong position to qualify from the Europa League's Group G.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrance from achieving a 2-2 draw with Villarreal for the first time but he believes the Rangers can use that result as a springboard for most things.
"It's a good thing for us because Villarreal is a good team", said the 31-year-old.
"We went to the game believing we could get something and we got away from a point.
Maybe we could have won it in the end, but the overall draw is probably a fair result.
They probably played better in the first half and we came out in the second half and were a good team.
Going to Thursday, it's another big European night.
Hopefully, we can get three points but it was a tough game and they had a good result in their last game but, with the crowd behind us, I am sure we can move forward and get a positive result.
The past year was definitely tough, and in the midst of everything that happened with my injuries and the changes at the club, there is now an emotional aspect to the venue.
The team is great and the guys are really enjoying it; training is great.
Hopefully, we can now move forward, we were beaten last season and now we have a chance".
Women are losing sleep in fear of savings during this retirement period
Although the survey participants had a clear idea of how to take care of themselves, few people talked about it with their family members.
He said that in a nationwide study, half of the individuals were talking to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 per cent said they had spoken to their children about this.
"People want family members to take care of themselves but they are not taking steps to engage in dialogue", said Holly Cinder, vice president of the nationwide life insurance business.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: If you do not give your congratulations ahead of time, you will not be able to prepare your family.
Talk to your counsellor and family to discuss where and how to receive care, as such options can play a key role in determining cost.
Bring in your financial advisor: Your advisors can also help you to suggest ways to pay for such expenses.
Your future fund options for long-term care may include a hybrid cash value life insurance policy, a traditional long-term care insurance policy, to save these expenses as long as you have the money or to help self-insure your property.
Get your legal documents: Face legal battles on the pass.
Get a health care proxy to know about your medical care so that you can assign a trusted person and ensure that your professionals follow if you are unable to communicate.
Also, consider the Power of Attorney for your finances.
If you are unable to make financial decisions and pay your bills, you can choose a trusted person.
Remember the details: Imagine that your elderly parents need a medical emergency and are on their way to the hospital.
Do you know the answers to questions about medications and allergies?
You can prepare yourself by providing details in writing.
"It's not just a game of finance, but who are the doctors?" asks Martin.
"What are the medicines?
Who takes care of a dog?
Put that one idea into practice".

The earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palo on Friday, officials said.
Due to the damage to communications, the relief authorities were unable to obtain any information from the Dongola Regency in the northern zone of the share, the area being close to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
More than 16,000 people have been evacuated from the quarters since the disaster.
Some highlights about the island of Sulawesi and Dongola are:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, located at the end of a steep bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 as of 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
The regency, Dongla, extends over 300 km (180 mi) along the coastline on the northwestern side of Sulawesi Island.
The Regency, the administrative region at the bottom of the region, has an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
The Central Sulawesi region's major economic backbone is fishing and agriculture, which is the main occupation, especially in the coastal region of Donga.
Nickel mining is also important in the area, but it is mostly concentrated in the coastal region of Morowali, opposite Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Relief and Works Agency, the last 100 years have seen several tsunami attacks on the towns of Shar and Donga.
In 1938, the tsunami in Donga killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
The tsunami caused the deaths of nine people in the Western Donga in 1996.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Ring of Fire, an earthquake zone, which is so constantly affected by earthquakes.
Here are some of the top earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in recent years:
2004: A powerful earthquake on the west coast of North Sumatra, Akhe Region, Indonesia, on December 26, affected 14 countries, resulting in 226,000 deaths in the Indian Ocean coastal region, more than half of which occurred in Akhe.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes occurred on the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: Indonesia's most populous island, Java, collapsed southward with a magnitude of 6.8, killing about 700 people in a tsunami that struck the southern coast.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck near Padang, the capital of West Sumatra Region.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck the Manthavi Islands of Sumatra, creating waves 10 meters high, destroying dozens of noisy villages and injuring about 300 people.
2016: As people are reminded of the devastation of the devastating earthquake and tsunami of 2004, the earthquake struck again in P.D. Jaya Regency and caused destruction and panic.
No tsunami was affected this time, but more than 100 people have died from the collapsed buildings.
2018: Large earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, mostly in the northern part of the island, killing more than 500 people.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily plagued thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's eldest son is arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Pauline, the eldest son of former Alaska Governor, and Vice Presidential candidate Sarah Pauline, have been arrested on assault charges.
A man named Pauline 29 in Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, opposing interference and detention in a domestic violence report, according to a report released by Alaska State Troopers on Saturday.
According to a police report, when a woman's acquaintances tried to call the police to report alleged crimes, he took her phone from her.
Paulin is being remanded to the Mat-Su Pritrial facility and is being held in an unsecured $500 bond, KTUU reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared "certainly, not guilty" when his appeal was heard, the network reported.
Paulin faces three Class A misdemeanors, which means he could face up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with a Class B misdemeanor, one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been filed against Paulin.
In December 2017, his father, Todd Polly, was charged with assault.
His mother, Sarah Pauline, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently pending in the Veterans Court of Alaska.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interfering with a report of domestic violence and being a drug addict in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend alleged that he had hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after her son's violent behavior was triggered by his service in Iraq for PTSD.
Indonesian earthquake and tsunami: Hundreds of people killed
384 people have been killed in the earthquake that struck Sulawesi, Indonesia, on Friday.
A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck and a tsunami destroyed thousands of homes.
The power and communication networks have been disconnected with the expectation of increasing deaths in the coming days.
The earthquake struck in Central Sulawesi, northeast of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
Influential videos are circulating on social media.
Hundreds of people gathered for the beach festival in Palo City, during which the tsunami struck the coast.
Federal prosecutors have asked for a rare death sentence for a suspect in the NYC terrorist attack
New York's federal prosecutors have sentenced to death Syphyllus Cypow, a suspect in the New York City terrorist attack that killed eight people -- a rare sentence not carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saypov, 30, was accused of using a rented truck from the Home Depot to attack a bike lane on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan.
To justify the execution, prosecutors must prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious bodily injury, according to a notice of intent to seek the execution, filed in New South District.
According to court records, both counts carry the death penalty.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Saipov on a 22-count charge, including eight counts of aiding and abetting robbery, which is commonly used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases and violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "considerable planning and pre-emptive preparation", prosecutors described the conduct in Saipov as "horrible, cruel and fraudulent".
"Saifullo Habbillahovic Saipov caused injury and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelín, Nicholas Cleaves, Anne-Larry Decadut, Darren Drake, Ariel Erliz, Hernán Feruchi, Hernán Diego Mendoz and Alejandro Damián Pagnuco, who were killed in the attack.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The last time the Southern District of New York had a death sentence was tried was a decade ago.
Defendant Khalid Barnes was convicted of murdering two drug dealers but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time a New York federal case was executed was in 1953 when a married couple, Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, were executed after plotting to run a church for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
On June 19, 1953, Rosenberg was sentenced to death for the electric chair.
A resident of Saipov, Uzbekistan, showed a lack of compassion for days and months, according to court records.
He said he felt good about what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saipav told the authorities that he was inspired after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
He also requested that the ISIS flag be displayed in his hospital room, police said.
He also pleaded not guilty to the charge of number 22.
David Patton, one of the Federal Public Defender representatives representing Saipa, said he was "clearly disappointed" with the court case's conclusion.
"Instead of life in prison without the possibility of parole, the death penalty will be long overdue for all those involved", Patton said.
Saipa's detention team had asked the judge not to execute him earlier.
Tory MP says Nigel Farage should be put in charge of Brexit
During the protest at Tory Conference today, he swore to Nigel Farage that he would 'armour the People's Army'.
For her suggestion that she should be in charge of negotiations with the EU as suggested by Theresa May's MP - she said politicians from Eurosceptics should 'feel the ECB' according to former UKIP leaders.
Conservative backbencher (leader of the opposition party) Peter Bon said at a rally in Birmingham that the UK would have already withdrawn had Farraz not been Brexit Secretary.
But the challenge facing Mrs May is different. She stressed the individual struggle of those who want to stay in the movement against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to track his Chechers compromise plan amidst attacks by Brexiters (Brexit Bengals), remaners (who prefer to stay here) and Europeans.
The Allies insisted that she move forward to make a deal with Brussels despite the strong opposition - and urged Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and 'disorders'.
Bone told a live-means-leave (BD) rally in Solihull that he wanted to make 'Chuck Checkers'.
He suggested that Faraz be made a peer and given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
'If they had taken charge, we would have already left,' he said.
The Welsh MP said: 'I stand for Brexit but we have to choke the checkers.'
Expressing his opposition to the European Union, he said: 'We did not fight in world wars in peace.
We want to make our own laws in our country.
Bonn rejected suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 election: 'The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay out of Brexit is completely false.'
Tory Brexitist Andrea Jenkins was also at the rally, telling reporters: 'My little advice: Prime Ministers, listen to the people.
"The Chechers are not popular in the public sector, the opposition does not vote for them, it is not popular in our party and our working class, really these activists are fighting in the streets and electing us first.
Please drop the checkers and start listening.'
In a message to Ms. May, she said: 'Prime Ministers keep their promises and they keep their positions.'
He said that if the rallying politicians are to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum, they should be 'hot-touched'.
"It is now a matter of trust between our-people-and our political class", he said.
'They are trying to betray Brexit and we will not let them do that.'
Addressing the enthusiastic crowd, he said: I want you to warm up to our political class that is betraying Brexit.
'We are equipping the army of the people of this country who gave us victory in Brexit and will never rest until we make our country a proud United Kingdom, an independent, self-governing country.'
Meanwhile, Remainers marched through Birmingham Ham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
After the group started this weekend, activists threw tories against Brexit banners.
Labour leader Lord Adonis spoke to conservatives about the security issues he faced on the party app as the conference began.
'These people will tell us that they can have IT systems with Canada etc. and all the technology with Ireland, including a conflict-free border and an open border for free trade etc.'
'It is a complete joke.
There is nothing better than Brexit.
Warren plans to make a 'hard decision' to run for president of the United States
"I will make a tough decision to run for president", Senator Elizabeth Warren said after the U.S. election.
The Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke at the town hall in western Massachusetts about his future moves.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Rep. Jeff Daehl of GOP State, who was co-chairman of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She has been the focus of speculation that she might defeat Trump in 2020.
The event, held at Holyoke on Saturday afternoon, was the 36th meeting Trump held with the units using the Town Hall format since taking office.
The people who attended the meeting asked her if she was planning to run for the presidency.
"It's time for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that includes a woman in the top ranks", Warren replied.
The LSU team's Sims murder - the killer's arrest
Police in La Baton Rouge announced on Saturday that a suspect has been arrested in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wade Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge Police Department announced that the detention of Dayton Simpson 20 was at 11 am ET.
He released a video of the shooting of the murder on Friday, asking for help identifying the person in the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot dead near the campus of Southern University in the early hours of Friday.
"Wade Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and eventually died", police chief Murphy J. Paul told media on Saturday, 247 Sports reported.
Wade came forward to rescue his friend and shot Simpson.
Simpson was questioned about this and admitted to being in the gun scene and to having shot Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without resistance and taken into custody by the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, who grew up in Baton Rouge and is 6-foot-6-inch tall, played in 32 games, including 10 starts, last season, averaging 17.4 minutes per game, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton finishes the World Cup round after a victory over Sebastian Vettel after a team order
It became clear from the moment of qualifying against Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the Mercedes team's orders would play a major role in the race.
From the pole, Batas got off to a good start and almost ruled Hamilton out for any points as he defended his position in the first two laps, thus inviting Wettell to attack his team's player.
Wettle first went to the pits and let Hamilton drive in the traffic behind the group, which was crucial.
The Mercedes then pitched a lap and the Wettle pulled out behind, but Hamilton went ahead showing some action from wheel to wheel, which allowed the Ferrari driver to freely pass through the inside unwillingly after a double move to protect the third corner, thus putting him at risk of exiting.
Max Worsteppen started from the back row of the grid and finished seventh at the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday.
He held his tires to finish the race quickly and push Kimi Raikkonen to fourth place, leading the majority of the race.
He eventually got to the pit on lap 44 but was unable to speed up the remaining eight laps as Rykonen finished fourth.
It was a difficult day because Walter did all the work out of the weekend and was a truly gifted person.
The team did such an extraordinary job to have one or two", Hamilton said.
That's really bad sign language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinz Ten at a rally Saturday to emphasize that she did not leak a letter written by Christine Blasey Ford alleging that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted her.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president responded that Ford did not directly address the evidence presented before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead showed that what was happening in the Senate was "selfish and disgusting and false".
"One thing that has been happening in the Senate over the past few days and the beautiful thing is what it feels like when you see angry, angry and average and disgusting and lying people", he said.
"You see the release and the leak and then they're like, 'Oh, I didn't do it.
I did not do it".
Do you remember?
Diane Feins, have you leaked?
Remember her answer... did you leak the document - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no, not at all.
I didn't leak".
Okay, wait a minute.
We leaked... no, we didn't", he added to the impression of a senator.
In July Ford sent a letter to Feynman explaining the charges against Kavanagh, and it was leaked before September - but Feynman denied the leak came from his office.
"I have not leaked Dr. Ford's story", Feins told the Ten Committee, The Hill reported.
"She asked me to keep it a secret, and I kept it a secret as she asked".
But his refusal does not seem to have caught up with the president, who commented at a rally Saturday night: "What I'm saying is, it's really bad language.
Maybe she didn't, but that's the worst spoken language I've ever seen".
Defending the Supreme Court's nomination for alleged sexual assault of three women, the President alleged that Democrats were using the allegations for their own ends.
"He has decided to withdraw power by any means necessary.
You see all the selfishness, all the disgust, who they hurt, who they are not afraid to drive to get power and control", the president reportedly said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars win 5-3 against the Bell Fast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars won the return match on Saturday 5-3 against the Bell Fast Giants in the Elite League.
The Giants led by two goals from the start with the impressive strikes of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beaulieu.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Kawhi helped their team to tie the Dwyer Giants lead.
Two Lucas Lundwald Nelson goals were tied by Francois Bouchard Dundee before the victory was confirmed.
This was Adam Keefe's third Elite League defeat of the season to Dundee by a 2-1 defeat in a match at Bellfast on Friday night.
This was the fourth meeting of the season between the teams, with the Giants winning their previous three games.
Dwyer scored the opening goal with Kendall McFall in the fourth minute at 3:35, doubling the Beaulier lead when David Ruther Ford provided an assist four minutes later.
In the tight start, Sullivan brought his team to the field at 13:10 and then cut the gap to 15:16.
Dwyer confirmed the Giants' lead to the first break by hitting the second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
Thus the hosts regrouped and Bochard added them to a point once again with a power play goal in 27:37 minutes.
Cooney and Charles Corcoran together helped Nelson lead Dundee to their first ever game lead at the end of the second period and secured the win in the final period by halfway through their team's fifth period.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will face Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday in their own courtyard.
Air Traffic Controller dies after hundreds of people on board escape from the earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller is now being hailed as a hero for sacrificing his life to help hundreds of passengers fly safely from the ground.
The earthquake and tsunami that struck Sulawesi on Friday killed more than 800 people and left almost a hundred missing.
The city of Palu has been devastated by the disaster and most of the people are still believed to be trapped under the rubble.
While all his colleagues fled in fear, the 21-year-old Antonin Gunawan Agung, who was shaken by the earthquake, did not leave the control tower of Mutiara Sisi al-Jufri Airport, Palau Airport.
He was still in the tower to ensure that the flight, which was flying over the runway at the time, was safe.
He jumped out of the tower, thinking that the tower had fallen.
He died in the hospital.
"His decision saved hundreds of lives", said Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Johannes Sirite, reports ABC News in Australia.
We brought a helicopter from Ballikappan in Clementon and prepared to take him to a large hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"We are heartbroken to hear this news", he said.
Meanwhile, the country's disaster management agency said access to the towns of Dongla, Siggi and Boateng was limited, with officials worried that the death toll could reach thousands.
"Many bodies are still in ruins, but many are believed to be in danger of surging as they cannot be reached", said agency spokesman Sutopo Purvo Ngrogo.
Waves of up to six metres have destroyed the portion and a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are bringing supplies for relief and relief.
A 35-year-old woman named Lisa Kusuma told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance brings bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
Mini markets are being looted everywhere".
John Gell, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "Indonesian Red Cross Resistance activists are running to help survivors but we don't know what they will find there.
It has already proven to be a disaster, but it could get worse".
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived at the rally on Sunday and told the country's military: "I urge you all to work day and night to complete every tax-related task.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
More than 550 people were killed in the earthquake that struck Lombok, Indonesia earlier this year.
Micronesia plane crash: One person has now been reported missing after the Lagun plane crash
The airline operating the plane that crashed into the Pacific Ocean encirclement of Micronesia has officially said one person is now missing, he said, after all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking aircraft.
As of Saturday afternoon, it was not possible to count male passengers, Air New Guinea said in a statement.
The airline said that with the help of local authorities, hospitals and investigators, we are trying to find the person.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details on the age or nationality of the passengers.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while attempting to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Seven people have been admitted to hospital, officials said on Friday.
The airline said that six passengers were hospitalized on Saturday and all are in stable condition.
It is not yet clear what caused the accident and what happened.
Both the airline and the US Navy landed in the Lagun area just behind the runway, he said.
Some witnesses said the plane crossed the runway.
Bill Jens, an American traveler, said the plane had come down too low.
"It's very good", said Jens.
Jens said he and others managed to run into the water below the waist level to find an emergency exit on the sinking plane.
He said that the flight attendants were scared and shouting, which caused a minor head injury.
The Navy said sailors working nearby to repair the pier also rushed to rescue and help with the use of a floating boat to push people ashore before the plane sank in about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
The figures from the Aviation Safety Network indicate that 111 people have died in a PNG registered airline crash in the last two decades but no crashes have included the name of Air New Guinea.
An analyst reports that the woman of the night was burned alive at the time.
The prosecution, which was investigating a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014, reserved its argument on Saturday.
Forensic analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of U.S. intelligence analytics.
He explained to the jury how the night Jessica died, 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers (the murdered) used cell phone records to track their movements.
Roulette said he received location data from several cell phones, which showed that Teles was with Chambers on the evening of the murder, contrary to what he had said, The Clarion Ledger reported.
Aropi claims to have been with his friend Michael Sanford at the time. But data shows that at the time his cell phone was with the chambers, the police went to interrogate Sanford.
Sanford came to testify on Saturday and testified that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors heard that Tallis said he was in a truck in Sanford that night, Sanford was lying because my truck was in Nashville that night".
Another oddity is that Teles Chambers said that I was introduced to him about two weeks before he died.
Cell phone records indicate that they had only met a week earlier.
After Chambers' death, Tallis said he deleted Chambers' messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He's erased her from his life", Hale said.
The Defence has decided to begin its closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said that the hearing is expected to go to the jury after that day.
The High Breed: What Is Conscious Hip Hop?
Hip hop trios have taken on the challenge of overcoming negative attitudes towards the genre through their music through positive messages.
The High Breed, Prum Bristol, Claim Hip Hop have moved away from their original political messages and are now betting on solving social problems.

Artists such as The Fugees and Common have seen a recent resurgence in the UK through artists such as Acala and Loukee.
Another black man?!
A nurse in New York sued a couple who had been texting about "racial" issues
A New York nurse mistakenly received a message from a woman that said "another black man" was a message of discrimination.
The couple denied the accusation that they were racist and compared the lawsuit to "sweating".
When new childcare dad Gisele Maris arrived at her first day of work in 2016, she was bored by two mothers, Lindsay Plasco-Flacksman, who discovered she was black.
"No, another black man", Mrs. Plasko-Fluxman sent a message to her husband.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Miss Morris twice.
After realizing her embarrassing mistake, Placebo-Flacks fired Man Maris, who had "suffered from crushing discomfort", was sent home, accused of misconduct by the African-American nurse, and was expecting a Filipino, the New York Post reported.
Morris was paid for a day's work and then sent home to Uber.
Now, she is suing the couple for racial discrimination based on texting and even asking for compensation of $350 a day for six months, without a contract, she was a live-in gig employed to work initially.
"I want to show it, look, you don't do that", he told the Post on Friday, "I know it's racial discrimination".
The couple, who said that it was a reasonable act to dismiss Maurice, maintained that they were committed to a claim that they were racist, alleging that they could not trust her after they insulted her.
"My wife sent her something she couldn't tell her.
She is not a racist.
Her husband Joel Placko told the Post that we are not racists.
"But will you give your children to a woman who is abusive?
What about your newborn baby?
Tell me".
Describing the case as a case to "lease", Plazko said his wife was only two months away from giving birth and that "she is in a very difficult situation".
"Are you trusting such people and following them?
It is not such a good thing", said the investment banker.
While the legal case is still pending in court, the court of public opinion is at the forefront of condemning couples on social media, with the number of people blaming them for their behavior and reasoning increasing moment by moment.
The publisher of Padding Tone feared it would be difficult to accept the idea of a talking bear, a new letter says.
Bond's daughter, Karen Junkel, who was born after the book was published, wrote: "It is so difficult to play each other's roles that I read this book for the first time before it was published.
It is a wonder when you think about what is behind the incredible success of Paddington".
She said of her father, who was inspired by a bear toy and worked as a cameraman for the BBC before writing a children's book. She trusted her work even when her book was rejected.
Apart from Padding Tone, according to her Padding Tone also "as an honorary member of our household", she would say of its amazing success.
She added: "He was one of the least talkative of all people who ever spoke, never complaining about his accomplishments".
"But Paddington was a real person to him. It's like, if your baby is a successful person before you, it's like: You're not proud of what you didn't do, it's just like.
I think that's how he saw the success of Padding Tone.
Even if it was his creation and idea, he would give full credit to Paddington himself".
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye by phone.
Immediately upon landing, her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where all efforts by doctors to save her life were in vain.
"Nad was calling repeatedly. To say it was really serious, she wasn't expecting to take the call", said Mrs. Ednan-Lapper House.
"Then I got a call from the NAD to tell her she was going to die within the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I said.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, darling.
I will soon join you".
I'll be with you.
The medications given to pump her heart slowly slipped out of her place and she abandoned her body.
She had recently died and her body was being neutralized.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing that everything was predetermined.
I could not scream or cry or cry because I was surrounded by family members and others.
I really needed to hold them together".
Finally Mrs. Ednan-Lapper House, now mourning the death of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers - forgetting the fire extinguishers she was experiencing.
"No one knows", she replied.
"I bowed my head down, and I shed tears throughout the journey.
It's hard to describe, but it expressed this unspeakable compassion for Nod while in flight.
He needs my guidance and love.
I know how much he loved her".
The wallpaper of a woman mourning suicide on a bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones are working to prevent others from committing suicide.
Two women, Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys, are putting inspirational messages on the Welsh Bridge, as well as giving out a phone number, asking anyone who needs help or comfort to call.
Mrs. Davis' son, Taylor, began to suffer from depression when he was 13 years old.
"I pray that no parent should experience the pain I experience every day", she said.
MS Davies, 45, who lives in Lidney, said her son was a promising chef with an infectious sense of humor.
"Everyone was amazed at his laughter.
His smile was a touch of every room".
He also left his work before he died, so that he was in the real darkness.
In 2014, Taylor's brother, who was only 11 years old at the time, was the only brother he met after taking his own life.
"I always worry that something bad is going on", said Mrs. David.
Mrs. David created the cards because, "There are people to talk to you, to share your grief with you, and to have a friend, even in your grief.
Do not sit alone and be silent - you must speak now".
Ms. Humphries, Davis' girlfriend of several years, has lost Mark to her 15-year-old life story, following the death of his mother.
"She never told me that she was depressed or sad", she said.
"We noticed a change in his behavior a few days before Chris Mas.
He was in the room on Christmas Day - when the children opened their Christmas gift boxes, he didn't even look up at them".
She said that his death was an unbearable shock, but they tried to get out of it: "It hurt their family deeply.
It made us different.
But we accepted it and fought".
If you are suffering from any sadness or depression, please call 116 123 (UK and Ireland) or email jo@samaritans.org.
The FBI is continuing its investigation, so Brett Kavanaugh's future is in jeopardy.
"I think we get what he's asking for - the time of the investigation, the scope is very limited. We can bring a little unity", Mr. Flake said. He also expressed concern that the committee will "divide".
Why do Kavanaugh and his Republican friends want an FBI investigation?
Their retreat is due to the present time.
The midterm elections will be held on November 6, which is just five weeks away - as expected, Republicans will not get the right result. They will be severely weakened in their attempt to elect the person they want to the world's highest court.
George W. Bush called the Senators, lobbying to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Bush at the White House, and through whom we met his wife, Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI submits its report?
The Senate currently has 51 Republican and 49 Democratic members.
I don't understand yet. Mr. Kavanaugh must get at least 50 votes on the Senate floor, so who allowed Mike Pence, Deputy Speaker to end the tie and inform the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean refugees under Kim's rule is 'shrinking'
A South Korean MP said the number of North Korean refugees fleeing South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un took office seven years ago.
South Korean Integration Minister Park Byung-seung also provided additional figures, stating that the number of refugees in 2011 was 2,706, up from 1,127 the year before.
Park said the reason for this was the tight border zone between North Korea and China and the doubling of the human smuggling charges.
PANG YONG has not made any official statement on this.
Most of the North Korean refugees have been granted South Korean citizenship.
Seoul reports that about 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the 1953 Korean War.
Most people have fled the country through the Chinese border, which shares a long border with their country rather than the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers those who have fled as refugees rather than illegal immigrants, and in most cases, such refugees are returned to North Korea.
North and South Korea are still technically at war, but relations between the two have improved in a few months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss disarmament.
The development follows a historic meeting in Singapore in June with Kim Jong Un and US President Donald Trump, where they discussed how to disarm the Korean Peninsula.
On Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yang-woo condemned the US contribution to development.
"Without the confidence of the United States, we cannot unilaterally disarm our national security ourselves", said Ri at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "crazy", and thus ineligible to serve on the Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "crazy" and said he was temporarily ineligible to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi expressed these views in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that when a woman ever walks like that, they're called 'crazy,'" Pelosi said Thursday, responding to Kavanagh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Cavanog emotionally denied the allegations of sexual assault when Christine and Blacey Ford were both teenagers.
He denied allegations that the abuse occurred when Kavanagh and Christine Blasey Ford were both teenagers.
He explicitly condemned the Democrats on the committee, arguing that the charges against him were "murder of rogue and organized characters" organized by the Liberals, which is why he expressed outrage that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi expressed his belief that Kavanagh's testimony proved his opinion that he could not serve on the Supreme Court, as it highlighted his view that he was biased against Democrats.
"I think he's disqualifying himself because of those statements and his statements about Clinton and Democrats", he said.
Pelosi was disappointed when asked if he would try to impeach Kavanagh if he was confirmed and if Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I say this - if they don't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, they're not only going to appear in the Supreme Court, they're not right to be in court right now", Pelosi said.
Kavanagh is currently a judge in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi said he was concerned about the Affordable Care Act or the judgments given by Cavanagh against Roy V. Wade as a Democrat because he believed Cavanagh was a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanagh did not answer questions about whether he would reverse some of the rulings made in the Supreme Courts.
"It's not the time to expect a person with a mental illness and bias to go to court and say, 'That's not great,'" Pelosi said.
And women have to control it.
It was the anger of a righteous person, and even after months and years, that anger comes out, and she cannot keep from crying.
"We cry when we are angry", Stineam, 45, told me later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do you?"
She continued, "A female officer helped me so much that she said she would cry when she was angry, but she developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and started crying, she would tell the person she was talking to, 'I'm crying because you might think I'm sad, that's all.
I am angry".
Then she continued.
And I thought it was amazing".
Tears are considered a way to expel anger because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
My first memories of my job were in a male-dominated office, where I once cried with inexplicable anger, when an elderly woman grabbed my necklace and pulled it out. I was a little scared that it was someone pulling me like this - who was pulling me up the stairs.
She told me, "Never show them that you are crying".
"They do not know if you are angry.
They may feel that you are sad and may rejoice in your sadness".
Patricia Schroeder, a Democratic Congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when she was caught in an unmarried affair on a boat called Heart Monkey Business and turned away from this embarrassment, Mrs. Schroeder became so disappointed that she found no reason to back down from the presidential race.
"It was not a well-thought-out decision", she said with a smile 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the contest, and they need another one last.
Someone called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".
She had already begun the campaign too late. She had been behind in raising donations. She had vowed to raise $2 million.
It was a losing battle.
She learned that some of her countrymen gave men $1,000 and gave her only $250.
She wondered, "Do they think I'll get a discount?"
When she announced she would not start a campaign, she spoke out of emotion - thanking people who supported her, making it very difficult to raise money and reach a goal. She expressed frustration with the system.
"You may think I have a nervous breakdown", recalled Mrs. Schroeder, describing how the press reacted to her.
"You thought Clenex was my corporate sponsor.
I wonder, what could they write on my grave?
"She cries"?""
How the US-China trade war has done good for Beijing
The trade war between the US and China is not raging today, and experts have expressed the opinion that while the war is far off, the gap between the countries could be beneficial to Beijing in the long run.
US President Donald Trump issued the first warning earlier this year by imposing taxes on key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant development is the imposition of tariffs on $200 billion (£150 billion) worth of goods this week, effectively taxing half of all goods from China to the US.
Beijing has also retaliated every time, most recently imposing a five to ten percent tariff on $60 billion worth of US goods.
China has pledged to join the US in the Sawa join, and the world's second largest economy is unlikely to shrink much anytime soon.
Rejecting Washington means being targeted for demands, but publicly bowing to America is a great embarrassment to Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing can play its game properly, the pressure of the US trade war will support China in the long run positively by reducing interdependence between the two economies.
"Experts believe that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create a situation that could shock both countries' economies, and that is more dangerous than previously believed", said Abigail Grace, a fellow researcher at the Center for New American Security, a think tank that monitors Asian affairs.
Syria 'prepared for the return of refugees', Foreign Minister
The government, which has pledged to rebuild the country after seven years of war, has called for the refugees to come and help voluntarily.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Ma'ullam said that the situation in the country is improving.
"Today the situation is very stable and safe. I would like to thank you for the progress made in the fight against terrorism", he said.
The Government will continue to work to restore the areas devastated by terrorism.
It is time for those who have left the country to live and care for their animals as a result of terrorism and unilateral economic policies to return to their country voluntarily.
According to the United Nations, an estimated 5.5 million people fled Syria in 2011.
There are six million people living in this country who need our humanitarian assistance.
Al-Ma'ullam said the Syrian government welcomes those who help rebuild the country.
He stressed that he would not accept help from countries that helped the rebellion in his country or from countries that provide conditional assistance.
The European team won the Paris-Ryder Cup
Team Europe defeated Team USA by 16.5 to 10.5 points at the Golf Conference at Le Golf National on the outskirts of Paris, France, to win the 2018 Ryder Cup.
The US has now lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
The team, led by Danish-born captain Thomas Jørn, regained the European title after reaching the 14.5 points needed to beat the American team.
US star Phil Mickelson, who struggled without a form for much of the tournament, drowned his tee-shot at the par-3 16th hole, which he lost to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari shone through all rounds, becoming one of only 1 out of 4 players to have scored 5-0-0 since the tournament's current format began in 1979.
Jordan Speith, from the United States, was eliminated in the 5th and 4th round by Thurb Jorn Olesen, the lowest-ranked player in the European team from Denmark.
World No. 1 player Dustin Johnson probably lost 2 and 1 to England's Ian Poulter, who played his final Ryder Cup.
An eight-time Ryder Cup veteran, Sergio Garcia of Spain is the all-time winner of the European Championships with 25.5 career points.
"I usually don't cry but today I couldn't stop myself.
This has been a tough year.
I thank Thomas for choosing to trust me.
I am very happy, very happy to have won the Cup back.
"I am happy, I am happy to have contributed to the team's victory", said Garcia, who was emotional about winning the European Cup.
He handed the puck to his countryman John Ram, who defeated US golfer Tiger Wood 2-1 in the singles on Sunday.
"I'm really incredibly proud. I can't believe I beat Tiger Woods. I grew up watching them", said Rahm, 23.
Woods has lost all four matches in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
It's really strange that Tiger Woods has these figures, the most of any player since Jack Nick Los, who has won 14 major titles.
The American team was very busy this weekend. But only Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau played the greatest game of their kind throughout the tournament.
Speaking after his team's disappointing performance, American captain Jim Furyk said, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought well.
This morning we were a bit hot for the European team.
But we ruined it.
Hats off to Thomas.
He's a wonderful captain.
All his 12 players played very well.
We'll get back together, I'll work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and we'll move on.
I love these 12 players and am proud to serve as a captain.
I greet you.
We played well".
