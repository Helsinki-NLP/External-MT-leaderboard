It's time to wake up.
The baby cried all night.
She didn't like living in the city.
This size is too big for me.
It's not gonna change anything.
Do what you want.
The man you saw last night is my uncle.
I hate winter.
I gave Tom a chance.
We played golf in spite of the rain.
What kind of test is that?
He told me his life story.
I decided to be happy because it is good for my health.
I'll wait here until he gets back.
The teacher is teaching.
What do you see in him?
What do you see?
It's not what you think!
You can get a dog in that doghouse.
He likes sweet tea.
You need to do the same.
It's simple and intuitive.
How many hours a week do you work?
Yeah, two of them.
They're not helping.
Please contact me when you arrive in Boston.
She asked me who came first.
Sooner or later, we all die.
How long will it take?
It's a shadow.
Where is the German embassy?
Be friendly.
This rose is wonderful.
But he knew it couldn't go on.
I guess not.
I want that too!
She looks but sees nothing.
He can't eat anything sweet today.
She's eating.
I'd like to travel around the world.
Do you like Italian?
I got five years in prison.
I'm not a girl.
But a universe that is simple enough to be understood is too simple to create a mind that can understand it.
We didn't have to rush.
Please?
It doesn't matter which team wins the game.
He's on the run.
This dress is too big for me.
Go stand by your car.
Bring her a plate of lettuce.
We are at war.
She didn't answer.
I heard Mary wants a divorce.
Is this a hedgehog or a plum?
Dad's coming home tomorrow.
This mountain is covered with snow all year round.
Never give up hope.
Can you pass the salt?
This book belongs to the library.
I want to die with Getter Jan.
We make cheese and butter from milk.
When I was in high school, I got up at six o'clock every morning.
You guys are the best shooters.
How can you say that?
Be careful!
You've obviously done this before.
Did you get the letter?
Two years ago, I couldn't play basketball at all.
What's the difference?
It's your fault.
She refused my request.
Which do you prefer?
I like Korean food.
I was invited to lunch.
You're still green.
There's nothing in here.
You never know what's gonna happen in the future.
We make these cookies in the shape of a wafer.
Everybody likes dolls.
What did you do to deserve this?
Look at the example given above.
Her hat looked very funny.
I wanted to be a philosopher.
You're not fast enough.
We left the door open.
Can you come at nine?
Why did you call?
They discussed the problem.
If I hadn't had his help, I would be dead.
He was almost asleep.
I have one brother.
Why are you here?
Do you like this color?
Isn't it weird that Tom isn't here yet?
Millions of people lost their lives in the war.
Compare your foot with the one on the board.
She welcomed him with joy.
They need our help.
Did you get Tom's message?
I don't like the way he talks.
I don't know what's happening to me anymore.
I learned a lot from him.
He killed that man.
Don't get your hopes up.
That brown hat is old.
He plays golf every Sunday.
Be creative.
I couldn't understand what he was saying.
Close the gate.
I'm always tired.
He's a funny guy.
Get back to your seat.
Be friendly.
Isn't this a beautiful morning?
At least it's a story.
I'm getting more and more gray hair.
He turned off the light.
I'm not sleepy.
The sky is blue.
The old woman collapsed and couldn't get up.
They fell asleep after the movie.
You can use my vocabulary.
I want to talk to your uncle.
Tom likes you.
He rarely stays home on Sundays.
When would you like to see him?
Tom began to cry for help.
His son is eight.
If I had wings, I'd fly to you.
Where the hell are you going?
He promised me he'd be more careful in the future.
What time did you hear the shot?
I forgot to buy one pillow.
I've heard a lot about you.
Don't go out now. We're about to eat lunch.
Italy is a very beautiful country.
It's an old man with a brain.
Eat your bread!
Although he lives in the United States, Tom can't speak English.
The school is five kilometers from my home.
I gave up my guns.
Who ate all our food?
I know her bread will be good.
Please come.
Women are changing the world.
In Singapore, it is a crime to spit on the floor.
I wanted Mary to love me instead of Tom.
You can sit on the chair.
We need more sugar.
The room was filled with the smell of roses.
Evil sometimes wins.
Tom has already had three cups of coffee.
I don't understand German.
Yes, please.
I'll help you.
It's your fault.
What are you doing there?
What does that mean?
The apples on the other side of the wall are the sweetest.
What's that?
I'm studying Japanese.
It doesn't make sense.
It had the head of a woman, the body of a lion, the wings of a bird, and the tail of a serpent.
Tell me how you solved that problem.
Would you like to dance with me?
Even if I wanted to, I couldn't explain what happened there.
I'm afraid of heights.
I don't know where to go.
If it's not, then let's go.
Who's coming with me?
I agree.
Compare the facts.
I'm not hungry right now.
I'm going to France for a vacation.
You can sit wherever you want.
You're an engineer.
The door opened slowly.
It's a story.
Do you play any sports?
It's time for you to start your own business.
Let's wait here.
That girl I told you about lives here.
Please just go.
I can't believe she's older than my mother.
Look back and you'll see a black cat.
His family traveled a lot.
Do you know him?
I don't know whether to turn left or right.
I'll clean up the kitchen later.
He came from a small town in the mountains.
I was talking to my friends.
All your cats are gray.
I still remember the days when we used to go on excursions together.
When we go to sleep, we say "good night".
The scandal ruined his career.
Cats are complex individuals.
He was so poor that he couldn't even buy bread.
I suggest you ask Tom.
This bag is not small.
There's nothing wrong with that.
If you invite him, he'll probably come.
I know you know that I know.
Be home by six.
The bread is fresh.
I'll be back in half an hour.
I don't want to be a bad guy anymore.
Are you a lawyer?
Where's your school?
The candles lit up the room.
I'm sorry about that.
Fold the paper in half.
What does he say in the letter?
The woman is eating bread.
I'm eating an apple.
A solitary man takes pleasure in watching ants.
Who's that man sitting at the other end of the table?
Are you pregnant?
I'm really tired now.
His steps accelerated.
The silence of this vast expanse always frightens me.
Why do you need a new umbrella?
He drew a straight line on the wall.
You need a car?
Take off your hat when you enter the classroom.
They do nothing but complain.
She was in a hurry.
Please contact me when you get to Boston.
Tom got up at seven.
This is for us.
He's listening to the radio.
The boy wants to know the truth.
Tom ate the whole pizza by himself.
You need to take care of yourself.
You need to be patient, Tom.
How are you?
Your journey begins here.
Can you believe what he said?
Tom asked where you were.
I'd like to help, but I'm very busy.
Tom couldn't stop thinking about Mary.
I think we should call Tom.
Don't be late for the bus.
All the apples are there.
You'll have to pay.
What time should we go to the station?
The more I think about it, the less I like it.
I'll take you to the new loft.
Everybody knows her.
She is incredibly naive.
Where in Turkey do you live?
Tom disappeared.
I can't.
Get out of the classroom.
Three dogs sleep on my mom's carpet.
Tom has already finished the work he needed to do.
If you can't have children, you could always adopt.
That's exactly what I was thinking.
Although she ran as fast as she could, she still missed the bus.
They need friends.
Beef, please.
Can you wrap it up as a gift?
Do you like living like this?
Hot today, isn't it?
Are you sure you don't have a home?
Do you play chess?
Her boyfriend is Turkish.
Answer me, please.
My mother can't come.
There are many alludari in Bavaria.
Do you know if he has a girlfriend?
I don't have a family.
Parents expected too much of their son.
What would you like to order, gentlemen?
He did it.
He entered my room without permission.
You can't just walk away.
Come on, move it out!
You can sit on the chair.
If you don't have a home, where do you live?
Our union can be perfect.
He told me I could use his car.
Almost all the students like English.
The test was so difficult that we didn't have enough time to finish it.
That's all of it.
You have to work fast.
If you believe that society has created nothing of value, you can say that you believe in mass destruction.
English is spoken around the world.
All their efforts were futile.
Where's the mirror?
This girl sings quite well.
Life is unfair.
Each person paid a thousand dollars.
Jill is the only girl in our club.
Students don't have to go to school today.
The sun disappeared behind the clouds.
His parents were pleased with his success.
This is our home now.
I'll call them tomorrow when I get home.
He helped me fix my watch.
No one made you help me.
John doesn't know what to do next.
He suffered from a severe headache.
I want a dog.
I have to find my pen.
Nigeria was once a British colony.
Don't throw stones in the river.
I speak German well.
She's painting her room white.
I can't leave until he gets here.
I asked her to dance.
Have you done your homework yet?
John is a professor of French literature at Oxford University.
Did you understand what he said?
What color is her hair?
The sooner you get back, the happier your father will be.
Are you ready to begin your journey?
Your clock is ten minutes late.
They tricked you.
I thought you said it was yours.
How much money do you have hidden under your bed?
We believe in God.
I'm from the air.
There's the man I've been waiting for.
He didn't pay the debt and disappeared.
Mr. Brown speaks Japanese very well.
No, he's not my new boyfriend.
I like to watch baseball and football.
Everyone except her smiled.
The queen stood by the king.
This bridge was built two years ago.
She's my first love.
You must keep your promise.
Tom looks different today.
What's the rent for the room?
We have to get out of here.
Tom doesn't want to do that ever again.
I asked her to wait a minute.
How long have you been learning Esperanto?
They're not a threat.
Her advice encouraged me to go abroad.
You're the only one who can help me.
What places did that tour go to?
It started to rain heavily. So we played inside.
Your carpet is all white.
But I don't want to.
I'm sorry I can't see you tonight.
Tom has a sister who is a lawyer.
I look like my mother.
You look just gorgeous tonight.
Doctor, can you hear me?
You know that, right?
I hope to see him on Monday.
Tom changed his clothes.
The tropics are hot, so be careful not to catch fire.
Did you find your letters?
For the love of God!
He doesn't remember if that room was empty or not.
The store sells expensive accessories for women.
I don't like being wrong.
It's not theirs.
I didn't wake up early.
Stay where you are.
The house is hers.
The doctor advised him to stop working so much.
Are you for real?
You've been busy.
I can't live like this anymore.
He'll do anything to make money.
I just want to talk.
What kind of music does Tom like?
That tree grows near her house.
Do not speak in the reading room.
How are you doing, miss?
I would exchange the yen for dollars.
I hate winter.
I think Tom is going to kill Mary.
There are only two right answers.
If I were rich, I would have given you some money.
When and where did you meet her?
Where the hell did you put them?
Tom didn't show up.
Don't be so serious, it's just a game.
He told a funny story.
I don't have time right now.
Tom is the captain of our team.
This carpet is very long.
Listen to what the teacher says.
Why isn't anyone eating my potatoes?
I asked Tom to play the guitar.
What does that remind you of?
She literally translated it.
What a night!
I can't find Tim.
She named him Charles.
I'm not sure if it's a boy or a girl.
Life is beautiful.
She takes them to school.
Tatoeba was temporarily unavailable.
No one believed what you said.
I didn't know what to say.
Do you think I should go alone?
Just answer the question.
I don't ever want to owe anyone anything.
Look at the train going over the bridge.
I'm not the only one who likes Tom.
I'm really bored now.
No, I don't think it was me.
Where are we?
I'm only 25.
Her hat looked funny.
Don't worry about her, she's too young to understand.
I bought this suit just for this occasion.
It's the same.
Be careful, all right?
It's the only explanation.
I can't believe I'm actually here.
You don't know the way?
I like that one a lot.
Tom will need help.
I printed a hundred pages.
I see and I hear.
Don't forget your ticket.
Raise your hand before you answer.
Change the flag, please.
Isn't it true that you have a gun?
I was in bed all day yesterday.
The war interrupted their research.
When spring comes, the days get longer day by day.
I'm listening to the radio.
Sweet dreams!
Leave my car alone.
This is Tony's book.
I should have come earlier.
Tom only eats what he wants to eat.
Who stole this apple?
He lost his ticket to the cinema.
What would you do if you were in his position?
I don't like summer.
What's your address, by the way?
She was lying on the bed face down.
African elephants are larger than Asian elephants.
What I've always said.
He heard him crying in the middle of the night.
Could you get me a glass of water, please?
He grabbed her hand.
Eat your bread!
If God didn't exist, we'd have to create one.
You should do it yourself this time.
My family was very unpleasant to me.
You're not getting it.
She has green eyes and light brown hair.
Does Tom have experience?
She left her umbrella on the train.
I'm a vegetarian, you know.
You have to go there.
What's the reason?
I can't see anything from here.
Since I did not receive a reply, I wrote to her again.
She's outside the wall.
Don't expect too much from me.
They missed a great opportunity.
Fight for your right.
He always talks to me when he sees me on the street.
Look at the book on the table.
I had one beer and I got very drunk.
Tom didn't think he needed a bodyguard.
Someone opened the door.
Do you have any questions about this lesson?
We saw her go into the park.
You don't seem busy.
It didn't look like you wanted the book.
I have a red bicycle.
He's short and fat.
I want to go to Tokyo.
The journey was tiring.
He's much smarter than me.
Tom still doesn't seem interested.
The weather is terrible today.
I didn't want this to happen.
The dog is trying to get out.
Like I said, I'm not doing anything.
There's a little brown puppy underneath that desk.
Stop them.
Anna is very fond of chocolate.
I know Mike likes basketball.
I have to suck a whole bucket of apples into the jar.
He died of old age two years ago.
Take the chair to your room.
The cab suddenly turned left.
Yes, I understand, thank you.
I'll be there in ten minutes.
He was accused of murder.
If you don't go to school, then you'll never learn anything.
If anything happens, call me immediately.
Would you like to eat some baked potatoes?
Is there any danger?
It's dangerous for you to sail in this river.
My friends are amazing.
Gold can't buy everything you want.
We have enough water.
Who will inherit the throne?
She worked hard.
Don't be afraid of change.
Please open this box.
Is it healthy to eat fish?
My baby wants to talk.
I asked her what kind of music she liked.
There were no witnesses to the incident.
Is she satisfied?
But he knew he had no choice.
Do you remember this game?
She went missing without a trace.
I'm here a lot.
She continued her speech.
Mike's not a good baseball player.
Backpacks are often used for desert travel.
Mary is a librarian.
Have a good weekend.
I saw his car through the window.
Are you ready?
I'm glad I'm not a woman.
Stop wasting your time and get back to work.
The more the better.
Ten years is a long time.
Is this your car?
I can't believe you're still hungry after all this.
It is only natural to want to be happy.
We have to move very carefully.
Did you get Tom's message?
My arm hurt yesterday.
If I were rich, I would have given you some money.
I don't have a computer at home.
My father doesn't eat much fruit.
Can you give me a discount?
She kissed my cheek and said good night.
My friend is here.
Where are you living now?
The older you get, the harder it is to learn a language.
Tom doesn't drink coffee, but he smokes cigarettes.
Not everyone likes dogs.
I'm going to stay here for a few days.
I feel sick.
Why would you say such a stupid thing?
You can't beat me.
I don't think I could do that.
Is that really true?
She's crying.
See you in hell.
He's my father.
He doesn't want to wait for you.
He took his family to the zoo.
Tom refused to go to the hospital.
It's exactly half a nine.
This car was made in Japan.
Is this your first time in Japan?
Tony was happy.
My father asked me to open the door.
Take him to the photobot!
Your brother wasn't at school today.
Tom will never let you down.
I was in Canada then.
I made this food myself.
Write with a pen.
Someone wrote their name on the wall.
Anyone who can sway to the wrong direction will sway to the wrong one.
They're out of sugar.
I love your daughter.
Tom hopes he won't eat leftovers again tonight.
Someone opened the door.
I'm not your mother.
Why isn't Tom in the car?
My name is Ricardo.
When did you get the telegram?
You shouldn't be swimming in that pool.
When will the snow melt?
He thought I was very tired.
I don't think she wants to eat anymore.
You're either with us or against us.
Please help me! I'm dying!
Tom knows Mary likes him.
I like this music.
She's scared the dog away.
He went to the barn, but stopped at her house.
The snow falls quickly.
We're having lunch here.
Of course I should read this book.
Tom isn't in jail right now.
Tom and Mary went to the museums.
The ship has gone beyond the horizon.
Good morning, my lovely dog.
God blesses those who repent.
I can't work with you standing there.
Maryl had a lung problem.
We were one big happy family.
What color car did she buy for herself?
The child cried all night.
Can you see me?
She testified against him.
My father grows rice.
We speak Japanese.
The result was disappointing.
I came in through the window.
The meat is not ready.
Give me a piece of chalk.
She needs to get some sleep.
Do you hear anything?
Is she your mother?
It's getting dark, can you turn on the light?
He no longer trusts the doctor.
It was the first time I visited a museum.
We had a great time.
I think Tom will want to sit down.
What a great family.
Are you still in Florida?
You shouldn't have eaten that raw fish.
Get ready, tomorrow is the last day.
We looked out the window, but we didn't see anything.
When was the last time you saw Tom?
The capital of Sweden is Stockholm.
They talked about love.
Tom doesn't ever want to do that again.
I don't know.
Left alone, a child would feel very lonely.
I don't know anything here.
Our team lacked mobility.
The cat crossed the street.
The canvas is a mirror.
Why don't you want to help the police?
I want to meet your father.
Please continue.
He was busy.
I'm a widow.
I saw him.
I'm studying the Lodge.
"Good morning", said Tom with a smile.
My hand hurts.
He needs a ladder.
You shouldn't go.
You shouldn't trust him.
There are seven days in one week.
You have to choose your own path in life.
Without air and water, no one could live.
He was on the ground and almost fell.
They work eight hours a day.
I eat and drink.
I do that every Sunday morning.
She quickly opened the letter.
Are you busy at the moment?
I take back everything I said.
Where did you get all those keys?
I went in through the window.
Take Tom to the hospital.
I have a white cat.
He wrote down our names in a hurry.
Our son died in the war.
He is not satisfied with the result.
Of course you're wrong.
I can't tell who's coming first.
I don't want to talk to you because you broke my heart.
Don't trust him
We may as well all go
Who is that person sitting at the other end of the table?
This idea is very attractive.
They're going shopping.
Everything that is genius is simple.
Her students are learning too much.
Tom raised his hand.
Put your shoes on. Let's go to lunch.
The birds have gone south.
This tea is very tasty.
I don't agree with him.
It's my fault.
Not bad, but I'm a little tired.
That's a great idea.
He's very proud of his toy.
That'll do for now.
I'm not scared at all.
A woman wants to know the truth.
Is that word used a lot?
Lithuania is acceding to the European Union.
I want to be a linguist.
Where's the cat?
I'm sorry for what I did.
She became a postwoman.
I learned to ride a bike when I was six.
He took out a piece of chalk.
Let me do that.
I like jazz.
I'm sure he is innocent.
Open the window and let in some fresh air.
Have you ever had a cough?
It's snowing heavily.
Have you seen my mother?
I know his name.
Tom doesn't want to live like that.
Do you approve of what she's doing?
He came here before the end of the classes.
Do you know their address?
What the hell are you doing?
He looked down at his dirty shoes.
Her cat was lying on my pillow and wouldn't get off.
There are some good hotels in the city.
What's this letter from?
He doesn't want to study today.
We are all different.
You don't know how much I love you.
I wrote her a long letter.
He couldn't do what he wanted to do.
I'm feeling a little weak today.
Life is fun.
She came?
I don't like being wrong.
Be careful, all right?
I bought the camera for thirty dollars.
This is great.
This is not a method, this is a provocation.
Answer in English.
He wants to see us again.
The water's very shallow.
Where do you live?
My friend doesn't use sugar.
I fell down the stairs.
He's a good interrogator, you know.
Bob was doing the dishes at the time.
My brother is two years older than I am, but he is three centimeters shorter than I am.
I can only tell you what I know.
I'm thinking about you.
What's your home address?
He'll be free tomorrow.
Have you seen my wife?
Your daughter overheard us talking.
Tom will die soon.
I'm used to going to bed late.
I've met him before.
Look at that house with the red roof.
My apartment is on the fourth floor.
She was already pregnant.
We are basketball players.
These clothes suit you.
Don't blame her for that.
You know you're stronger than I thought?
I love her so much that I can't leave her.
Can you come with us?
I don't care about him.
Tom couldn't find a reason why he needed to go home early.
Put your hand up.
He didn't sell the house.
No one has ever seen God.
She saw someone waiting for her outside the school.
You don't seem to be busy.
Where's Mary?
The new contract allows us to demand whatever we want.
Tom is still a prisoner.
Go and open the door.
I said I'd call another cop later.
God, help me!
She told him she was happy.
She needs him more than he needs her.
Have a good time!
Tom, I'm back. I'm going to the bathroom.
You wanted to see me?
It's not a mistake.
The airport is quite far from the city center.
You can turn the radio off now.
You can turn off the radio now.
You're a very sweet man.
Ankara is in Turkey.
You're a very nice man.
I've been to Boston a few times.
You're a very nice man.
