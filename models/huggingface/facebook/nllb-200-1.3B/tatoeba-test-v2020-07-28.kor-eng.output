I'm finished.
I asked Tom for help.
They believe there is life after death.
She is a medical doctor.
He boasted about his success that he worked hard.
When did you wake up?
He poured milk into the cup.
The contest of the Crown of Korea is a culturally difficult task to make understandable to foreign readers.
I took French classes with Tomkorkor.
I can't be systematically one.
These students are Koreans.
It hardly snows here.
I am not a user of (언어?)모국어korkor.
He claims to have overcome all failures.
He lives in peace.
I won't allow it.
The situation is worse than we thought.
He came!
Hello. How are you?
Tom can stay, the rest of you have to leave.
She couldn't make a living on her income.
Slowly.
How do you say it?
I don't want to go there.
Tom wants to quit.
