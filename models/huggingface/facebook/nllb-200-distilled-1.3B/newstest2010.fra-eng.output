Barack Obama will be the fourth American president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.
US President Barack Obama will fly to Oslo, Norway, to spend 26 hours there and become the fourth US president in history to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.
Among other things, the diploma, medal and $1.4 million check will be awarded to him for his outstanding efforts to strengthen global diplomacy and cooperation among nations.
The White House chief and his wife Michelle will be landing in the Norwegian capital in the morning and have a busy schedule.
He will first visit the Nobel Institute, where he will meet for the first time the five members of the committee who chose him in October from 172 individuals and 33 organisations.
The presidential couple's schedule next includes an interview with King Harald V of Norway and Queen Sonja.
The visit will culminate in a solemn ceremony this afternoon when Obama will receive the prestigious award.
He will be the fourth U.S. president to receive the award, but only the third to be presented in the Committee's own courtroom.
The White House has informed in advance that Obama will speak about the war in Afghanistan at the award ceremony.
The president doesn't want to avoid this topic because he knows he's getting this award for being a president who's at war in two countries right now.
He has only a few days ago stepped up the war effort by sending additional units to Afghanistan, which none of his critics will forget to point out.
At the ceremony, Obama will also receive a gold medal, a diploma and a cheque for 10 million Swedish kronor (about 1.1 million euros).
He plans to donate it to charity, but he has not yet decided which ones.
His busy schedule will then take him and his bride to a banquet that includes the king and queen of Norway, the head of government, and 250 other guests.
Obama was rather reluctant to this price at first.
For example, he mentioned feelings of inadequacy.
He also repeatedly said that the prize was not for himself alone, but for all who share his values.
From the outset, he said that he saw it as a "call to action".
A conservationist charged with blackmail
The Litoměřice police have charged the chairman of the Litoměřice Nature Conservation Society with blackmail.
On several occasions last year he appealed for several construction site proceedings and asked for money from investors for his personal gain in exchange for withdrawing his appeal, said Alena Romová, a spokeswoman for Litoměřice police.
The chairman of the Litoměřice Nature Conservation Society is Lubomír Studnička.
He is currently in custody and faces up to three years in prison.
Waste sorting bins are not in Brno
In Prague, you can sort your drinks, but in the villages of South Moravia you can find sorting bins on every street corner.
What about Brno?
In this case, it would take several minutes to find the right bins.
I'm not saying we wouldn't sort garbage in Brno.
But I feel that the city councillors in our city, the second largest city in the country, are not paying enough attention to this problem.
Brno is in the stone age of sorting waste not only because citizens can still sort only paper, glass and PVC, but especially because of the number of bins dedicated to this waste.
Have you ever tried throwing a plastic bottle downtown?
It's a science, and it takes time and nerves of steel.
The only place I've found so far is Moravian Square opposite Potrefena Husa.
I don't blame Mr. Onderka and his colleagues, but it seems like a small price to pay.
Not to mention the fact that in other parts of town it's not a sinkhole either.
So, finally, a lot of my friends don't sort their garbage.
You lazy little shit.
It's a long walk to the dumpsters.
I'm not surprised they're doing that.
I, myself, after a party, offered to go throw out some glass and PVC bottles.
Except I didn't see any painted dumpsters on Kounicova Street.
Fortunately I found the right spot by taking the tram.
But the garbage was overflowing.
After all, it is the centre of Brno, which is supposed to represent the city best, right?!
It is probably that ecology and a so-called aestheticism are not of much interest to the Brno socialists.
They would rather buy the city a place in the top hockey league which is a disgrace to the city in the whole country, than buy a few extra bins and propose sorting more raw materials for a cleaner Brno.
I'm glad I was able to back up my impression with official statistics after hanging around the internet for a while.
According to EKO-KOM, Brno is indeed the worst in the whole South Moravian region.
Paroubek's budget has taken away from the silver pensions and sick leave
After the left has risen, despite the advice of the government, farmers or civil servants there may be a lack of money for pensions, sick leave or housing savings.
But also for interest on government debt or international legal proceedings.
This will increase the problems of those who will govern in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists imposed the increase on certain classes, they relied on the government borrowing for sensitive expenses, pensions or sick leave. "It's just putting things off, undermining the ground", Janota said.
It is important to know that the interest on borrowed money is increasing and that sooner or later it will have to be paid back.
The government has no real choice in where to get the money.
If he doesn't cut social security or his spending, he'll have to raise taxes.
To all those who have been raised by the left: the firemen, the teachers, the farmers.
And then to their children.
People will touch them and not have to worry about their pensions or health insurance, of which 1.8 billion have gone.
But at the cost of a greater public debt - so next year there will be not 163 billion in the coffers, but more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, the debt will grow faster and faster and with it the interest-related expenditure.
The state will need money to pay it back and it will not be enough to raise VAT slightly or reduce maternity leave as the government did in its anti-deficit package.
The Commission has also proposed that the Commission should be given a mandate to carry out the work of the European Parliament.
These are mainly already decided and started sections where it is not possible to modify the projects to reduce costs.
At most, keep them, which is not free either.
This means delaying or stopping 30 major construction projects, and the collection of EU funds is also at risk, warned Karel Hanzelka, spokesman for the Ministry of Transport.
ČSSD proposed to solve the financial deficit very cleverly - it would draw on the dividends of ČEZ (the electricity supplier and distributor), which is mostly owned by the state, and feed into the transport fund.
The problem is that the amount of dividends is never certain and is by no means a bottomless pit.
Last year, 18 billion was shipped from the CEEC into the budget.
Each year, dividends are used to pay for the removal of ecological damage, to supplement pension accounts or to provide a reserve for the pension reform that is being prepared.
The EU's own budgetary policy is to be based on the principle of subsidiarity.
And that's far from the end of the transfer carnival.
The budget for various compensation for victims of communism and crime, even for housing savings, has been cut by almost three billion.
It is not certain that the State can act without this money.
It's a lottery.
If we lose an international case, we will have to pay anyway, says Janota.
The Minister will then have to save on the part of the department or, in the worst case, touch the government budget reserve.
The State Treasury's proposed budget of two billion is also missing 100 million, which should allow for online tracking of the expenditure of each administration.
The first phase will start in January.
If the finance minister does not find money elsewhere, the project will have to be stopped and sanctions will be imposed, Janota warns.
Your next smartphone will run two operating systems.
In the future, Americans are thinking about a mobile phone that will allow the user to switch from one operating system to another with a single push of a button.
The projects that have been revealed look promising.
Just one button and you can switch from Windows Mobile to Android in seconds.
This is precisely the aim of the American company VMware, which is mainly involved in the development of computer virtualization software.
We're going to allow you to manage two user profiles at once on your mobile phone.
You can switch between them, you can differentiate between personal and professional.
Both will work at the same time, Srinivas Krishnamurti of VMware said in an interview with Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November last year and a first demonstration was held a few days ago.
It'll be on the market in 2012.
Virtual reality on smartphones is not fiction.
VMware has already successfully presented a trial version to journalists, a smartphone with two operating systems.
This is a modified Nokia N800 with 128 MB RAM, which ran the Windows Mobile and Android systems mentioned simultaneously.
The development of new technologies for mobile phones is booming.
VMware is now working with European and US operators to test virtualization on smartphones, and customers are expected to have access to the devices in 2012.
Mountain snow shortages bother hotel owners
The abandoned runways are not a problem for the operators of the lifts alone.
The lack of snow discourages people from booking skiing stays in hotels and guesthouses.
As a result, it is always possible to find free rooms for all dates in winter, including Christmas and New Year.
We have a lot of visitors to our site.
Internet users are browsing the offers, asking for prices but not daring to commit to booking at the moment.
And if they call us, they immediately ask if there will be snow or mud at Christmas", said Martin Jandura, operator of the news portal Spindl.Info.
If you want to spend your dream New Year in Špindlerův Mlýn, you should not hesitate to book.
If you prioritize savings and then the quality of the accommodation comes second, then you can try waiting a few more days.
The hotel owners in Špindler are currently offering only one week's New Year's holiday.
I think they'll try to place them for a while longer, but they'll give in too and accept shorter periods.
And then the number of rooms will decrease rapidly", Jandura said.
The tourist agency Ingtours Vrchlabí also offers free beds for all winter periods.
The Christmas week is the most important one for us at the moment, it's not completely sold out.
There's still, say, half the rooms on our offer.
That is why we have already prepared some last minute Christmas holidays at a lower price", said Ingtours' manager Petr Schiefert.
The Vrchlabí tourist office can also offer New Year's Eve in Krkonoše, but there are fewer vacant places.
The first fourteen days of February are just as good, the remaining winter holidays sell out on average.
This year, the interest in winter holidays was negatively affected by the fact that there is still no snow on Krkonoše.
People are waiting for it to fall.
No one wants to spend the winter in the mountains without snow.
If the tracks overlap during the week, Christmas will be complete too", Schiefert thinks.
In contrast, occupancy at the Horizont Hotel in Pec pod Sněžkou was slightly higher than last year.
We've got an improvement of about five percent.
We have a few seats left for New Year's and Christmas.
There is a lot of interest during the January holidays from Poles and February is selling well too", reports Karel Rada, manager of the best hotel in Pec.
The Omnia Hotel near the central parking lot in Jánské Lázně is also 80 percent full during the New Year period.
On the contrary, half the beds are empty at Christmas in the newest hotel in Jánské Lázně.
This year we were pleasantly surprised by January, when we have already reached 60% occupancy.
February is a little weaker at the moment but as soon as the snow falls, the interest in staying in the Krkonoše will certainly grow further, said Omnia Hotel manager Erik Sporysch.
However, hotel owners in the Krkonoše should not expect more snow.
Thursday will be cooler and if there is rain, it should snow in the mountains.
But the weather is expected to warm up after that, reports Jiří Jakubský of the Hradec station of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
United States: Repetition is the mother of wisdom
It is even comical that Barack Obama, a renowned wise man, has repeated his predecessor's strategy on the Afghan issue, which he himself considered to be simple.
When he finally let loose his long-awaited doctrine, it turned out he had copied it to carbon paper from Bush's Iraq script from three years ago.
Not content with using the phrase "as in Iraq" several times in the text itself, he did not hesitate, moreover, to use the title of Bush's January 2007 speech as the title of his own speech: "A New Road Forward"
At the same time, he personally criticized Bush's idea of sending new reinforcements into a civil war-torn Iraq as being "irresponsible and a decision with catastrophic consequences".
The following months, however, showed that Bush's strategy, which was based on the recommendations of the campaign commanders, was the only one possible and likely to succeed to such an extent that the newspapers at present do not mention Iraq at all.
This did not improve Bush's reputation, but objectively speaking, it left his successor with a far more favorable end than could have been hoped for.
Barack Obama hopes that in Afghanistan, the miracle will happen again
It was again the campaign commanders who asked him for an increase in the military contingent, including the commander of the Afghan operation, General Stanley McCristal, who even harshly criticized the reluctance of the White House despite the subordination habits.
He asked for 40,000 men so he could make the situation more favorable.
The president hesitated for three months, but for want of a better option, he at least conned the general of 10,000 soldiers.
He managed to get the promise of 5,000 more from Europe, even though he had originally counted on 10,000.
What seems to be the most problematic aspect of the whole Obama strategy is his intention to withdraw the troops from Afghanistan within 18 months and to complete the whole process within three years.
Many doubt that a halving of the increase will produce the same results as the progress in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars of recent years, Iraqi society is relatively well organized and its leaders honor agreements.
The situation in Afghanistan is the exact opposite - no one can be counted on and no treaty is respected.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare Afghan security forces, accustomed to changing leaders day by day as they see fit.
Political institutions, though officially established, will remain as a powder in the eye for the proliferation of patriarchal ethnic relations.
Balancing the interests of the various ethnic groups is particularly complex given the lack of clarity about the relationships, which are further complicated by Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Even the establishment of a "state of prompt action", which is the basic aim of the operation, does not seem very real.
The time horizon of Obama's strategy is puzzling because of his voluntarism.
Over the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only gotten worse and is now on the brink of chaos.
Only a purely romantic, unrealistic heart can be convinced that the little soldiers sent into the turmoil of war for their "immediate return home" will bring about a real miracle.
From a political point of view, setting a date for the withdrawal of troops is purely irresponsible since the Taliban will view it as an indirect admission of American defeat.
The latest NATO summit showed that the European willingness to participate in military operations in Afghanistan is moving in the negative direction.
European politicians do not know or want to explain to their voters how security in Germany or Italy is linked to a war in the Hindu Kush mountains.
Another factor that could radically alter the situation is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the tightened sanctions do not have an effect on the Iranians, the Americans will find themselves faced with the very difficult question of solving the problem by military force.
The answer will have to be found, for example, when, according to Obama, America will successfully withdraw its troops from Afghanistan.
Any such solution will, however, lead to a dramatic reversal of the situation in Afghanistan.
The only rusty thing for Obama is the fact that there are three years left until the presidential election and therefore there is still plenty of time for him to plan a new strategy, in case it turns out to be a total fiasco.
Goldman Sachs executives will no longer receive cash bonuses
Senior executives at the American bank Goldman Sachs will no longer receive cash bonuses this year.
The company announced this in response to strong criticism of its wage practices.
The top 30 leaders will receive shares instead of money, which they won't be able to sell for five years.
The shares can be taken away from the managers in case they take too many risks.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs is thus leading the effort to link pay with long-term performance on Wall Street.
I suppose Wall Street is well aware of the global direction to take, said former investment banker Douglas Elliott of JPMorgan.
The problem lies in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs has come under fire after it set aside nearly $17 billion for bonuses in the first three quarters of this year.
The total amount of bonuses for the current year is likely to exceed $20 billion despite the measure announced today, according to Reuters.
With the onset of the financial crisis, high bank bonuses have become a sensitive political issue in many countries.
Britain announced on Wednesday that it planned to impose a single tax of fifty percent on bankers' bonuses over 25,000 pounds.
France is preparing similar measures.
This year, women won Nobel Prizes in every field except physics.
A record number of women have been awarded the Nobel Prizes in technical sciences and literature today in Stockholm by King Charles XVI Gustav of Sweden.
In addition to the four scientists, there was also the German-born Romanian writer Herta Müller.
Two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, were awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine with fellow American Jack Szostak for their research on chromosomes.
The Chemistry Prize was awarded to Israeli Ada Jonath with Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz for elucidating the structure and function of ribosomes
The latest winner was the American Elinor Ostrom, who shared the Nobel Prize in economics with her compatriot Oliver Williamson for their analysis of economic governance.
The only technical discipline that didn't have a winner this year was physics.
The prize was awarded today to scientists Charles Kao for his research in the field of optical fibres and George Smith and Willard Boyle for their invention of the CCD chips, which are now the basis of all digital cameras, fax machines and astronomical glasses.
Each laureate received a diploma, a Nobel medal and a certificate of monetary award.
The amount of the grant is SEK 10 million per category (about EUR 1.1 million).
If one of them has more than one winner, they will share the prize.
The long-awaited Nobel Peace Prize has already been awarded this afternoon in Oslo, Norway to US President Barack Obama.
In his speech, he acknowledged the controversial nature of his award as he is only at the beginning of his career and is also leading a country engaged in two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
He concluded his policy by saying that in some situations war was necessary to achieve peace, even if it cost a lot.
Minister Janota is considering resigning.
President Václav Klaus will receive Finance Minister Eduard Janota on Friday morning, who is weighing his stay in the government because of his disagreement with the state budget for next year as voted by the Chamber of Deputies.
It is estimated that the budget and possibly Janota's cabinet position will be on the agenda for their meeting on Friday.
Klaus is also critical of the budget.
He said the deficit was too large, which further worsened the public finance crisis.
The meeting was reported by presidential spokesman Radim Ochvat.
Janota then wants to discuss his position with Prime Minister Jan Fischer on Monday.
The budgetary legislation which Klaus is about to sign shows that the Czech Republic is facing a deficit of CZK 163 billion.
However, the House of Representatives on Wednesday approved the proposals of the left on money transfers and increased salaries for civil servants, the functioning of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government blamed the Social Democrats' proposals on the fact that they would indirectly increase the budget deficit.
For this reason, a violent disagreement arose between the left on the one hand, the government, Klaus and the right on the other, a disagreement that called into question the future of Fischer's cabinet which had been formed by agreement between the ODS, ČSSD and the Green Party.
Critics say the budget, as voted by MPs, eliminates the austerity package passed by the Fischer government, which he says should curb the government's debt.
Klaus, who can ratify the state budget law but is not obliged to do so, said today at a breakfast discussion with businessmen that politicians have long neglected the "serious problem" of the "irreversible deficit" of public finances.
He said there was no viable solution.
Only a strong government could bring about improvement, if it could rely on a wider consensus of political parties, according to the president.
SDS chairman Mirek Topolánek said the budget was appalling and the government should question its future existence.
ODS vice-president Petr Nečas told ČTK that the idea of an administrative cabinet supported by ČSSD, ODS and the Greens is clearly no longer working.
In response, Prime Minister Fischer called such words "drastic verdicts".
The head of the ČSSD Jiří Paroubek reacted to Topolánek, saying that the budget deficit prepared for this year by the former Topolánek government is staggering and will exceed 200 billion crowns.
On Wednesday, the ČSSD declared the ratification of the state budget for next year a success.
The People's Party was also satisfied.
Morgan Freeman is playing Mandela in Clint Eastwood's new film
Despite criticism that the lead roles are played by American actors, South Africans say that Hollywood's new film Invictus - Unconquered will expose the world to much about the country, its struggles and victories.
The story is about sports, race relations and Nelson Mandela.
Morgan Freeman, the Oscar-winning American actor, stars in the film about the life of Nelson Mandela, a tireless fighter against South Africa's apartheid regime and the country's first black president.
Freeman said that a ninety-one-year-old Mandela asked him to play him in the film.
Matt Damon plays another important role.
I said, "If I'm going to play you, I should be able to see you personally.
The 72-year-old actor who won an award for his role in Clint Eastwood's boxing drama Million Dollar Baby, for example, played the leader of an anti-slavery movement who became a slave himself, a fictional US president, even God in the film Evan Almighty but never someone as alive and as important to so many people as Mandela.
The former South African statesman was jailed for 27 years for his hard work in ending apartheid in South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and became president of the country for four years.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus is a Latin word meaning unconquered and is the title of a poem by English author William Ernest Henley published in 1875.
The challenge was to speak like him.
The film tells the true story of Nelson Mandela and South African rugby team captain François's joint efforts to unite the country.The newly elected President Mandela knows that his country is still and still divided racially and economically after apartheid.
He was convinced that he could unite his people through sport and decided to unite the rugby players who were among the outsiders in the world ranking.
The South African team will eventually advance to the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked for a few years to bring Mandela's story to the big screen.
I had no other goal but to play this role in a way that made it as close to reality as possible, Freeman said.
The biggest challenge for me was of course to speak like him.
The actor said that if he and the international politician were in the same area, he would try to meet Mandela, have dinner with him, be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing for him was shaking her hand.
I realized that when I shake your hand, I get your energy, it's transmitted, and I feel like I know how you feel", he said.
It's important to me to try to become a different person.
Matt Damon stars in the film as François Pienaar, the captain of a national rugby team in which there are a majority of white players.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in rugby's tough midfield.
For him, his first encounter with Pienaar at his home was a big surprise.
I remember when I knocked on the door, he opened it and the first thing I said to Francois Pienaar was, 'I look much older in the film.'
Despite the differences between the actors and the actual models, Invictus under the direction of director Eastwood received positive reviews and there is even talk of ambitions for the Oscars.
Film critic Todd McCarthy of the Daily Variety summed up his appreciation: "It's a very good story, a very well-made film".
In movie ratings on the website rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76 percent of the positive ratings.
The mystery of the aura in Norway solved: Russians test a rocket
A strange luminous phenomenon of unknown origin was observed over Norway.
The Russian Defense Ministry only yesterday admitted to testing an intercontinental ballistic missile near the Norwegian border.
The launch, however, was again a failure and the "Bulava" missile that was originally intended to be the pride of the Russian military is gradually becoming the nightmare of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Its repeated presence during rocket tests did not have the expected effect on the success of the test flights.
Most of the time, Bulava either didn't fly, or it was damaged in flight.
Russian newspapers refer to "Bulava" as "missile that does not fly"
A Missile That Does Not Fly But Shines
This 13th trial was initially running normally.
It was only at the end of the flight that there was damage to the aircraft again.
It's obviously the third stage rocket engine that exploded.
This time, "Bulava" flew from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donskoy, which was sailing under the surface of the White Sea.
This type of missile can be fired from a moving boat and submerged
This is why the mysterious light over Norway caused by an unidentified flying object was most likely caused by a faulty "Bulava".
The Norwegians did not doubt for a moment that it was a Russian rocket.
The generals argue that this time, there is absolutely no question of failure.
The first two stages of the rocket were sustained and the failure only affected the third.
In the previous cases, the engines failed on the first floor.
Although none of the test launches went without a crash, the Defense Ministry's leadership believes that only six of the 13 were failures.
This nearly 50 percent success rate fills the generals with optimism, and they still say that one day the Bulava will fly smoothly and even carry ten hypersonic nuclear warheads weighing a total of 1.15 tons.
The legendary 51-year-old Fetissov has signed a one-year contract with CSKA Moscow.
Legendary defender Vyacheslav Fetissov will be back in a professional game at 51.
The former world, Olympic and Stanley Cup champion will lend a helping hand to his CSKA Moscow team in need and will probably make his debut in Friday's match against Petrograd.
Fetissov, who ended his career at the age of forty in 1998, is currently the president of CSKA.
After Denis Kuliash's injury, we urgently need another defense attorney.
Fetissov is training regularly and has agreed to help the team.
We still have to settle some details about the form, says the club's coach Sergey Nyemtchinov, quoted by the AP.
It was not immediately clear whether the legendary hockey player's comeback will be for one game.
I think Fetissov is one of those who are able to strengthen the minds of other players, Nyemtchinov said.
According to AP, if Fetissov returns to the ice, he will become the oldest Russian professional hockey player.
In the NHL, legendary forward Gordie Howe played one full season for Hartford and had 15 goals and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous Fetissov, Kassatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov quintet is one of the best hockey players and among the most successful.
He won two Olympic gold medals with the Soviet Union, seven world championships, and won the Canada Cup and the World Junior Championship.
In the latter part of his career, he also earned a spot in the NHL where he twice held the Stanley Cup.
He has been a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame since 2001.
Hyundai has listened to the unions and cancelled all overtime
The management of the Hyundai factory in Nošovice has reached an agreement with the unions to cancel all overtime.
It is precisely because of the frequent overtime that the unions declared a state of emergency strike on Monday.
The spokesman for the Hyundai plant, Petr Vaněk, confirmed it.
The management, however, wants to agree with the unions on a Saturday working day again this year.
We cannot abandon our production plan, it is essential, which is why volunteer overtime was proposed on Saturday 19 December knowing that there would be two shifts, Vaněk said.
The website Sedmička.cz reported that the company offered a 400 CZK bonus to employees who would be part of Saturday's team.
It will also be awarded a posteriori for the day worked on 28 November.
The company, according to Vaněk, decided to change the way it motivates its employees in exchange for overtime.
Either they receive the extra for overtime or they can take a substitute holiday on 28 December and thus extend their end-of-year holidays, Vaněk said.
In addition, all employees present on Saturday will be compensated for transport and lunch expenses.
Given that overtime was the most urgent and hot topic in the comments and demands of unions as well as employees who spontaneously stopped production last week, management made the immediate decision to cancel all overtime for December, Vaněk said.
Until last week, workers at the car factory were forced to work almost daily two hours over their eight hours.
The unions intend to lift the state of strike after the agreement is signed.
The next negotiation between the management of the car factory and the unions is scheduled for Friday afternoon.
Trade union leader Petr Kuchař said on Wednesday that they were ready to end the strike if their demands were agreed and a joint document was signed.
The situation at the factory reached a peak last Wednesday when nearly 400 workers spontaneously went on strike over continuous overtime.
They also protested against poor pay and alleged abuse.
The management defended itself by saying that employees had to work overtime to meet the requirements of car production.
When the strike was announced on Monday, the unions also demanded that workers who had stopped production be exempt from any sanctions.
The trade unions are asking the company to reduce the time spent in overtime to a minimum.
In addition, they want a salary of 5,000 crowns (about €209) for these this year.
The Hyundai car factory in Nošovice currently employs 2 000 people.
It started mass production last November.
It has produced about 80,000 vehicles up to September this year, with a production capacity of 200,000 cars per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that works on "hard" HIV viruses too
A team of Czech and German scientists is testing new combinations that can slow the spread of HIV in the body.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also acts on viruses that have already developed immunity to the drugs.
This reality is in some cases overridden by the fact that the combination does not act as intensely on common variants of the virus as some already available drugs.
There is no cure for AIDS at present.
Nevertheless, the lives of patients can be greatly extended by a combination of drugs that prevent the HIV virus from multiplying in the body.
However, their consumption has a number of side effects.
In addition, suppressing this multiplication results in the development of so-called drug-resistant viruses that are no longer effective against drugs.
The work of experts from three institutions, the Czech Academy of Sciences, VŠCHT Prague and Heidelberg University, paves the way for a way to address virus resistance.
They showed that substances called metallocarborans act on the protein responsible for the multiplication of the HIV virus.
Metalocarborans are an assembly of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
This combination blocks the development of the virus in a way that is different from all the drugs used so far and that is why they could overcome the problem of resistance.
The researchers' work leads them to discover new "improved" substances, based on their knowledge of the molecular mechanics of their binding to virus proteins.
Metallocarborans have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi-walled cages are formed by the boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms and connected by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
A treacherous and resistant virus.
HIV protease is a protein in the HIV virus that is essential to the life cycle of the virus.
Without the division of the HIV virus by the HIV protease there would be no formation of mature infectious virus particles.
Stopping the HIV protease also stops the virus from spreading into the patient's body, the researchers said in a press release from the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry at the Czech Academy of Sciences.
In their work published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, the scientists describe a series of combinations where two pairs of cages (see table) are connected by a short organic chain, which is then systematically modified.
A little weaker, but more reliable.
The effectiveness of this series of substances on HIV proteases has been tested in test tubes and on resistant variants obtained in HIV-infected patients.
On the common version of the enzyme, the effect of the metallocarborans is not as strong as on clinical drugs, however it does not weaken on resistant versions against which common drugs are often ineffective.
Therefore, metallocarborans, with their unique mechanism of action and other properties such as their biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of further chemical modifications, are interesting combinations to further investigate in the development of effective HIV drugs, says Pavlína Řezáčová, director of the Structural Biology Laboratory at the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics at the Academy of Sciences.
The SDS is attacking Fischer, who is defending himself.
The chairman of the ODS (Democratic Civic Party), Mirek Topolánek, called the budget ratified for the following year "terrifying" and said that the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should question its existence.
The Prime Minister called the SDG's words a drastic verdict.
He says it takes time to analyze.
ODS spokesman Petr Nečas said the idea of an administrative cabinet supported by ČSSD, ODS and the Green Party was clearly no longer working.
Nečas said the head of government should decide whether to rely on the minority in the Chamber of Deputies who are concerned about tackling the growing deficit, or whether to stay in office with the help of the parliamentary left.
Nečas warned that the positions of the SDG and the Social Democrats on the issue of public deficits are diametrically opposed.
The House of Representatives on Wednesday approved the budget for 2010, but the amendments proposed by the left included 12 billion crowns.
The House increased money for civil servants' salaries, the running of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government's complaint about the Social Democrats' proposals was that they indirectly increased the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic is expected to run a deficit of DKK 163 billion.
The ODS left the House before the vote, in accordance with the government's wish that an amended budget is a less bad option than an interim budget.
Disappointment and Uselessness
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and a sense of worthlessness, while Prime Minister Jan Fischer indicated that the government will consider the current situation again.
Nečas is convinced that if Janota threatened to resign if the amendments were ratified, the situation could be different.
According to Czech TV, Janota made an appointment with the prime minister on Monday after he joined the government:
He also said he was questioning whether he would continue in his role.
The reason is his disappointment with the budget negotiations.
If Fischer decides to continue to fight the budget deficit, Nečas believes that the ČSSD representatives, who imposed the budget changes, have no place in the government.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will resign if the House passes other deficit-increasing legislation such as health insurance, pensions, or the reform of the Services Act.
Topolánek: The ministers appointed by the ODS are not involved.
This is a matter for Prime Minister Fischer and the whole government.
The ministers appointed by the SDG have done nothing harmful, Topolánek stressed in a text message from the United States.
He recalled that the deputy ministers of some ministries complained about TOP 09, which voted against the budget.
Nečas stressed that if Fischer decides to resign in the face of a fight against the amount of the public finance deficit, "it is quite logical and correct that he will rely on the left majority that is currently in the House".
But he cannot expect the support and tolerance of the Democrats.
I have not thought about it and once it is on the agenda I will devote myself to it, defence minister Martin Barták, who was elected to the government by the Democrats, told reporters in the House.
Prime Minister Fischer flew to Brussels in the afternoon for a European Council debate.
The SDO backtracked at the Prime Minister's request.
Nečas pointed out at the same time that the ODS would probably have voted against the amended budget on Wednesday if it had not explicitly asked the Democratic MPs to allow the budget vote.
We do not feel like orphans, we are not little children, he said when asked whether the ODS had not been criticised by the party chairman in the House or in the country during the budget negotiations.
I didn't realize my vote would have been missed.
I knew already at the time I resigned that what would follow in the coming months would be a bolshevization of the House and the destruction of all that was positive, Topolánek himself said.
According to the new ČD timetables, there will be fewer trains for the same fares.
The Czech Railways will abolish or limit from 13 December certain express or regional trains with less load and will reinforce some others.
The total transport coverage will be two per cent lower on the day the new timetables come into force than today.
Most tariffs will remain unchanged, including the basic and reduced tariffs.
For example, the residents of the Ostrava region will have more connections to the capital, the railways will add a pendolino train.
On the contrary, an express train will stop serving Bratislava.
There will also be fewer high-speed trains on the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice line, the direct Prague - Letohrad line will be drastically reduced.
At regional level, the greatest decrease in transport is in the Hradec Králové region, with a total of 8%, while Prague and its surroundings can boast an increase.
Two night trains on the Prague - Tábor - České Budějovice line are also cancelled and the operation of some express trains on the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice line will be reduced to only a few days a week.
Among the biggest changes is the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague: for the time being, the inhabitants of Milovice have to change to Lysá nad Labem.
This is the fifteenth line of the Esko suburban system, which is being opened thanks to the completion of the electrification of the line between Lysá nad Labem and Milovice.
The long-distance lines to the capital will have their final destination at Prague's main railway station (Praha Hlavní nádraží).
ČD will introduce more SC Pendolino lines between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Šumperk/Jeseník will depart at two-hour intervals.
Travellers will no longer be able to take the Pendolino to Bratislava from December 13.
The bill this year for regional railways: 200 million additional crowns.
The express trains are ordered and paid for by the Ministry of Transport and will pay the Railways next year a total of four billion kroner to cover the visible losses, the same amount as this year.
This year, regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
The railways have recently signed a ten-year contract, so far the duration was still one year.
The railways are very pleased with the system, which is also why they have not used a price increase on the vast majority of tickets.
The changes will only affect ČD Net day tickets and eLiška discounted internet tickets.
For travellers without a discount card, the price of ČD Net will increase from 450 to 600 kroner.
The price of eLiška will now depend on the distance travelled, whereas it was previously valid between cities in a chosen region and was a one-off rate of 160 kroner.
Philippine rebels still holding more than 50 people, children released
Rebels kidnapped 75 people in the southern Philippines today, including some elementary school students and their teachers.
The AFP news agency reported this, but originally said only 65 hostages.
The 17 children were released after eight hours, along with one of the teachers.
The hostage situation took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
It is reported that some 19 rebels used the hostages as human shields in their escape from the police.
Local negotiators are now trying to reach an agreement for the release of the remaining hostages.
According to AFP, the rebels belong to the New People's Army (NPA), the armed wing of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to AFP, the police first prosecuted the kidnappers after violence caused by a settlement between two family clans.
Martial law has been declared in the southern province of Maguindanao in the Philippines following a recent massacre in which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the November 23 massacre related to the governor's election were 30 journalists.
The governor of this southern province of the Philippines was arrested on suspicion of involvement in the massacre, as was his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of the influential Ampatuan lineage.
Mindanao also includes active Muslim separatists.
However, they renewed peace talks with the Philippine government on Tuesday.
The history of South Africa is about everyone, according to Morgan Freeman aka Mandela
Clint Eastwood's new Hollywood film is coming to theaters in the U.S. in the coming days, titled Invictus (the official Czech title is Invictus: Neporažený), and tells a part of the life of former South African President Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-famous anti-apartheid fighter went to Morgan Freeman, who was chosen years ago by Mandela himself to play him.
The second male role of the legendary South African rugby champion was given to Matt Damon.
With the film's release, the feedback from critics and audiences is heard.
Nelson Mandela is here .
His full name was Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela, and he was born on 18 June 1918 in Mvezu, South Africa.
In 1988 he received the Sakharov Prize for his freedom of thought, and in 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize alongside de Klerk.
He was President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
The film is expected to be released at a time when South Africa is preparing for the World Cup and the media is being rocked by worrying reports of increasing racial conflict and discrimination by the majority black ruling class.
According to the AP, the new film is currently receiving a positive response in South Africa, despite frequent reservations about the leading roles of Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman is nevertheless, in his own words, proud of the film.
I've been dreaming of this role for many years and I've prepared well.
I also met Nelson Mandela many times personally so that I could - as they say - regain my energy, he said at the film's official premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it's a good thing if we have the opportunity to remember through the film the personality and message of Mandela.
This is the history of the Republic of South Africa, but it concerns every individual, he added.
Wearing the rugby team jersey
The film is based on the story of the novel by British writer John Carlin, the title being loosely translated.
Morgan Freeman tries to bring together two racial groups in a long-divided population, and like Nelson Mandela in 1995 he walks into the World Cup, which South Africa had won, wearing the South African national team jersey.
For showing up on the grass in a jersey, which is considered sacred in South Africa, Mandela was given a long standing ovation fourteen years ago by the mainly white audience and was recognized by the white populations.
Hopefully, the soccer league will succeed in uniting people back into one nation, said rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" on the national team in 1995.
It remains to be seen whether the tense situation in South Africa will improve.
White South Africans, however, are skeptical, as Christopher Dawson, a rugby fan who fled to Britain, recently told LN.
The championship will start on 11 June 2010.
A tens of millions of kroner worth of transformer on fire in Louny region
A fire in the morning engulfed a Čeps company's transformer in the distribution centre near the village of Výškov na Lounsku.
According to Lukáš Marvan, spokesman for the Ústí Fire Department, there are six units working on the fire.
They originally planned to let the transformer burn out, but they changed their mind and extinguished the fire with a mixture of water, foam and a special substance.
The cause is a technical malfunction, an internal short circuit in the transformer.
No one was injured and company spokeswoman Pavla Mandátova said the incident did not endanger the safe operation of the transmission system.
The damage is estimated at tens of millions of kroner, the exact figure will be known once the fire is extinguished.
According to Mandátova, the destroyed transformer will have to be replaced with a new one.
It adds that in the 10 years of operation of Čeps, nothing like this has happened and that incidents of this type are isolated.
The electricity supply was not interrupted, says Soňa Holingerova Hendrychova, spokeswoman for ČEZ for North Bohemia, and the operation of households, administrations and industries was not affected by the fire at the processing station.
A.s. Čeps is the sole operator in the Czech Republic of 400 kV and 220 kV transmission sets and power lines.
It maintains, renovates and develops 39 distribution stations with 67 transformers transferring electricity from transmission to distribution sets and 4339 km of line routes.
Jančura will file a defamation suit against three ČSSD prefects
Radim Jančura, owner of Student Agency, will file a defamation suit against three social democratic prefects today.
And specifically against Michal Hašek from the South Moravian region, against Radko Martínka from the Pardubice region and against the prefect of the Olomouc region Martin Tesařík.
Jančura reported this in Radiožurnál's Dvacet minuta.
The complaint relates to the company's attempt to operate regional railways in certain regions.
However, all regions eventually signed long-term contracts with the Czech Railways.
All three of them attacked us and claimed that we were being sloppy, when we only made an offer for what they wanted.
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech Railways which is not true because we know the prices of the Czech Railways which were signed last week.
So all we have to do is defend ourselves.
This is in exchange for the slander against the Student Agency company, Jančura told Radiožurnál.
It also said it had evidence that no region had acted in accordance with European law.
We are preparing a complaint to the European Commission.
Hašek considers that the complaint lodged by Mr Jančura is a continuation of his media spectacle which serves as free publicity for his company and for himself.
I am of course prepared to defend my name and the name of my region and I call on the other prefects to do the same.
I think this will be an opportunity to make it clear that it is Mr Jančura who is manipulating public opinion and using false and misleading arguments about regional rail transport, says Hašek.
Jančura has already announced last week that he will invest a few million kroner in an advertisement that will mention the unfavourable approaches of the regions.
He told Radiožurnál that he will stop the campaign after Christmas and plans to resume it after New Year.
He said the campaign would target corruption in the broad sense.
Jančura began his campaign after the regions agreed to entrust Czech Railways with the operation of the railway links for an order of around 150 billion crowns, without issuing a tender.
According to Jančura, such a course of action is illegal and contrary to the position of the European Court of Justice.
According to him, his criticism of rail transport in the regions even led to threats from a ČSSD deputy to Jančura.
The only threat was that if we didn't stop, we could lose our bus licenses.
He ran as a member of the ČSSD, I don't know who he is but I won't say his name, Jančura told Radiožurnál today.
Vaccination against pneumococcus will be free and optional
The pneumocoke vaccination will reverse the old habits as early as January.
It will be the first to be free and at the same time optional for families.
There are already voices saying that mandatory vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free pneumococcal vaccination are in full swing.
The pharmaceutical institute already sets the maximum price for vaccines that health insurance will pay.
The experts also have a clear view of the vaccination process.
Another shot.
Free vaccines for the children of August.
Since January, children born last year from 2 August onwards can be vaccinated against pneumococcus free of charge.
The condition is that they haven't been vaccinated yet.
If you started vaccination last year or earlier, you will have to pay for the next vaccinations yourself.
The first dose of vaccine should be given between the 3rd and 5th month of life.
Last year, already a quarter of families voluntarily vaccinated their children against pneumococcus.
Yet parents paid 1,600 crowns or more for a dose.
The vaccination of the youngest requires four doses.
Experts estimate that health insurance spends between $300,000 and $450,000 a year on vaccines.
However, they save on the medical care that unvaccinated children would require.
The State has so far spent about 500 000 kroner a year on all the vaccinations of children.
Reimbursed vaccination was introduced with the 'Janota package'.
Pneumococcal infections are the cause of inflammation of the middle ear and also of serious infections, including meningitis and blood poisoning.
Hospital surveys indicate that up to 28 children under 10 years of age have died from pneumococcal infections.
In addition to the Czech Republic, about 40 other countries have introduced reimbursed vaccination.
Will vaccination be compulsory?
There are suggestions that vaccination may be mandatory in the future.
From January, it must be paid by insurance and optional.
For example, the president of the Nahlas Association Rudolf Kalovský said that mandatory vaccination would be more positive.
Her association has long promoted pneumococcal vaccination.
At an international conference our association attended, the experts were not really satisfied that we have a voluntary vaccination.
It's not ideal.
On the other hand, we are glad that we have been able to impose at least this.
I think that is the direction we should now take, said Kalovský.
But the health department doesn't want to change the pneumococcal vaccination process.
We are not at all considering it at the moment, said its spokesman Vlastimil Sršeň.
Doctors say that voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks.
Hana Cabrnochová, president of the Society of Pediatricians, acknowledges that voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks.
"In a situation where the vaccine costs so much I understand the decision to make vaccination optional", says Cabrnochová.
Experts expect that by next year, more than 80 percent of new parents will have their babies vaccinated.
Pneumococcal vaccination is also a breakthrough because it is the first childhood vaccination to be funded by insurance and not by the state.
Cabrnochová explains that insurance should free up funds for prevention, thus saving on possible future medical care.
Doctors will have to buy their own products
This is, however, related to the concerns of practising paediatricians, which concern the purchase of vaccines.
The original intention was to have the vaccines purchased by insurance companies, with doctors receiving them in the same way as other government-provided vaccine products.
Some MEPs, however, feared that this would allow insurers to "deduce health insurance".
So doctors will have to buy the products and wait for insurance to pay them back.
It is estimated that individual paediatricians will have to spend nearly DKK 40,000 a month on vaccines, which is a considerable sum.
It will be far from easy, according to Cabrnochová.
The son of an American artist involved in a "museum robbery"
The son of Frank Frazetta, a well-known illustrator, was accused of trying to steal paintings worth $20 million (£12 million) from his father's museum.
In Pennsylvania, police say Alfonso Frank Frazetta was arrested while loading 90 paintings into his vehicle and trailer.
She said Mr. Frazetta and another man used a mechanical shovel to force their way into the museum in the Pocono Mountains area.
Mr. Frazetta Senior, 81, is famous for his drawings of characters such as Conan the Barbarian and Tarzan.
At the time of the incident, the artist was in Florida, the Associated Press (AP) news agency reported.
AP quoted a police official as saying that young Mr. Frazetta may have been motivated by a family feud.
According to a police statement, Mr. Frazetta Jr., 52, claims to have been allowed by his father to "enter the museum, by any means, to transport the paintings to a storage facility", the agency reported.
Mr. Frazetta Senior denies giving such permission, the agency said.
Labour supports an increase in the budget tax.
Ministers defended the tax increase and spending cuts announced in the pre-budget report, despite criticism from the opposition, businesses and trade unions.
The Tories claimed that Alistair Darling "missed" an opportunity to show he was serious about reducing the deficit by postponing his decisions until after the election.
The Chancellor has also drawn widespread criticism for his attacks on low and medium wages.
Among its main proposals is a 0.5% increase in Social Security and a 1% ceiling on public salaries from 2011.
The Wrath of Social Security
The unions protested that low wages were being penalized by a recession they were not responsible for and warned that "problems" were looming.
The reduction in Social Security - which will provide about £3 billion a year - has angered the business world, as he says it is a tax on jobs when the aim should be to revive the economy.
The increase, which is reserved for those earning more than £20,000 a year, will affect around 10 million workers.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to this effect.
Social insurance will increase by 0.5% from April 2011
The economy will fall further than the 4.75% expected this year
New 50% tax on bankers' bonuses
Increasing corporate income tax for small companies has been abandoned
Reduction of taxes on electric cars and wind turbines
Pension increase of 2.5%
According to the Treasury estimates, a person earning GBP 30,000 will lose GBP 90 per year and a person earning GBP 40,000 will lose GBP 190 while a person earning GBP 10,000 per year will earn an additional GBP 110.
Ministers said their goal of halving the deficit by 2013 involved "difficult decisions" but insisted that 60% of the additional tax burden would fall on the top 5% of employees.
Treasury Secretary Stephen Timms dismissed a tax increase and said a decrease in spending was a "drop in the ocean" compared to what was needed.
"These figures are important, they will allow us to halve the deficit, which is absolutely essential over the next four years", he told the BBC.
Mr Timms said he was confident that economic growth would resume by the end of the year.
However, Labour's forecasts for economic growth - which will influence how much it will need to borrow and how quickly the deficit will be filled - were called into question after the Chancellor was forced to revise his first figures.
In his speech, he said the economy would likely shrink by 4.75% this year - much worse than the 3.5% decline predicted in April - while borrowing would be 3 billion GDP higher than previously estimated.
"Opportunity was lost".
The Conservatives, who will launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday warning against Labour's "debt crisis", have said the plan to borrow £789bn over the next six years is not viable.
Ministers have failed to present a credible plan on how to repay, they added, "cynically" avoiding difficult choices until after the elections - due in June 2010.
"They didn't come up with anything meaningful about what they were going to do", said Philip Hammond, chief secretary of the Treasury of the Shadow Cabinet. "They had the opportunity to do it and they missed it".
"The important announcements will be made after the election, regardless of who wins"
Roger Bootle, Deloitte, and his wife
Labour insists that schools, hospitals and the police will be protected from further cuts, unlike Tory proposals which would lead to a faster and larger reduction in the deficit.
But the Lib Dems claimed that the money raised from tax increases and spending cuts would be used to support next year's spending and not to reduce the deficit, arguing that the plans were "built on wind".
Nick Robinson, BBC's political editor, said the timing of the announcements - such as the inflation hike for certain disability benefits in April, mentioned above - would leave the Chancellor facing accusations of propaganda, with the money simply being recovered the following year.
However, Labour insists that additional help is being provided when people need it most and that the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
"False budget"
Although ministers did not release details of spending beyond 2011, economists said it was clear that restrictions on public spending would only begin to be felt in the medium term.
The highly respected Institute for Fiscal Studies has said that the Chancellor's figures imply, in the future, substantial cuts in many areas, potentially including transport, higher education, science and defence.
"The pain is actually just deferred", said its director, Robert Chote.
"The most important announcements will be made after the elections, regardless of who wins", added Roger Bootle, Economic Adviser to Deloitte's accountants.
"This was a false pre-budget report.
FBI investigates "arrests of Americans in Pakistan"
The FBI is investigating the arrest in Pakistan of five American journalists suspected of extremist links.
The men were arrested during a raid on a house in Sarghoda in the eastern province of Punjab, the US Embassy in Pakistan told the BBC.
The FBI said it was investigating whether these were the same men who were reported missing from their home in Virginia last month.
The US State Department said it was also looking for information on these people.
Three of them are described as being of Pakistani descent, one of Egyptian heritage and the other of Yemenite origin.
If they are US citizens, of course, we would like to know what the charges are and the conditions under which they are being held,' said spokesman Ian Kelly.
FBI spokeswoman Katherine Schweit said the agency was aware of the arrests and was in contact with the families of the missing students.
"We are working with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identity and the nature of their activities there, and whether it is really the students who are missing", she said.
The Pakistani embassy in Washington said the men were arrested at a home belonging to the uncle of one of them.
She said the house was already under surveillance by the local police and that no charges had yet been filed against the men arrested.
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton declined to comment on the arrests, Reuters news agency reported, but said the United States needed to "work more with Afghanistan and Pakistan to try to root out the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people".
The five students were reported missing from their home in Northern Virginia by their families in late November.
Amnesty condemns the "abuses" in Iran
Human rights have been violated more than ever in the past 20 years, says a report by Amnesty International.
The report shows "repeated violations" by the regime before and after the presidential election campaign in June.
One man quoted in the report said he was beaten and burned with cigarettes. Another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran has denied previous criticism of its lack of respect for human rights.
The authorities claimed that such criticism was politically motivated.
Thousands have been arrested and dozens killed in Iran after the disputed election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad led to the largest public demonstrations since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Dozens have been sentenced to prison terms and prosecutors say at least five people have been sentenced to death.
Jon Leyne, the BBC's correspondent in Tehran, now in London, says that at the start of the protests, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei acknowledged some of the allegations of abuse, ordering the Kahrizak detention centre to be closed.
But since then, the authorities have not tolerated any criticism, says our correspondent.
"False Confession"
Amnesty International reported on the case of a 26-year-old computer science student, Ebrahim Mehtari, who claimed to have been accused of 'Working with Facebook networks' and protesting the election results.
"They often slapped me in the face", he was quoted as saying.
"I was burned with cigarettes, under my eyes, on my neck, on my head... they threatened to execute me and humiliated me".
After five days, he signed a false confession and was released and left on the street, still bleeding and half-conscious, Amnesty said.
In August, the losing candidate in the election, Mehdi Karroubi, claimed that some protesters detained after the election were tortured to death in prison and others were raped.
Iranian authorities have denied the rape allegations, but admitted that abuse had taken place.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former prisoner who said he was locked in a container with 75 other people for more than eight weeks in a detention centre in Kahrizak.
Amnesty has agreed that the Iranian parliament and judiciary should set up a committee to investigate the post-election unrest and the government's response, but said the mandate and powers of these bodies were unclear and that the results of the parliamentary committee had not been made public.
The group said at least 90 people had been arrested in the past three weeks in an attempt to prevent further protests.
Ski slopes built in the city park
Over 100 tonnes of artificial snow was used to turn the Bristol site into a race track.
The eventPiste in the Park attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders to compete for cash prizes.
At the top of the Brandon Hill Park runway, a small stepping stone preceded a 100-meter runway.
John Hickman, a fourth-year medical student, said that the view from the top of the runway was beautiful but the one from the top was quite intimidating.
It's a beautiful view, with all the city lights twinkling down below.
Here are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the country - real talent", he added.
Prizes were awarded for the best flights - or figures - performed on the track.
After the party on Thursday night, the snow will be left to melt.
Always them and us
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
Roger Bootle, Deloitte, and his wife
Some readers will be attracted by this new book, admirers of the author's latest work, "Why the French Don't Like the Scarf" (2006), an elegant and well-documented study of a problem that has divided and worried the country for about 15 years and whose effects are still being felt today.
Mr Bowen's latest book presents a much broader and more ambitious plot.
A good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and the media say about Islam in France, but what is happening in the country at the moment.
He spent many months in mosques, schools and institutes that now provide in France what Mr. Bozen calls "Muslim spaces" for the 5m-6m Muslims.
He is very good at listening to and reproducing the discussions between teachers and students on the issues that concern them most.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or at the town hall (or both)?
Should evolution and gay rights be taught to young Muslims?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim?
Can a Muslim use an interest-based banking system to get a loan?
It is these practical problems, he says, that are the daily lot, rather than the political dramas that are the media's concern.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, all unknown to the general public, except perhaps Tariq Ramadan, an Arab Muslim born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open up the debate on how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They don't push the debate to the end.
The Conservatives do not believe in the idea of a French or European Islam.
The intellectuals and activists interviewed by Mr. Bowen generally agree with their counterparts who advocate a purist Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia, which today makes up a small fraction of Europe's Muslims.
Mr Bowen believes that the values of Muslims and the secularism of the French could be compatible.
But a compromise can only be achieved if both sides work together.
He wonders how much French politicians (and the intellectual elite who are so virulent about secularism) are really committed to pluralism.
He said Muslims were not spoiled compared to Catholics, Protestants and Jews who also had to make historic compromises with secular republicanism.
Rather than a growing pragmatism, he detects a "narrowness of key values".
After reading this book, one is tempted to say "yes, but not yet".
The darkest view in the world
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other place on the planet.
The ice that makes up the planet is melting at an alarming rate, taking with it life that cannot survive anywhere else.
Oil, gas, shipping and fishing are sailing into new open waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now writers in their wake.
In "On a Thin Layer of Ice", author and illustrator Richard Ellis paints a natural history of the northern polar bear.
He was familiar with the history and complicated policies of whaling, and he described the long tradition of Arctic explorers who proved themselves by hunting the polar bear.
The encounter with Admiral Nelson, then a brave 14-year-old aspirant who had only the tip of his musket to fight with, is certainly a myth, but the rest is true.
The cubs, caught swimming alongside their mother, who had just been killed, were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
In the early 20th century, a famous show brought together 75 bears at once.
Even today, the size of a zoo is still usually one millionth of the area needed for an adult in the wild. The climate is rarely indicated: a polar bear living in Singapore turned green because of algae growing in its thick fur.

Mr Ellis tells the stories of other writers and historians and often looks back on the threat that hunters pose to the survival of the species.
Although banned in Norway, America and Russia, the killings continue in Greenland and Canada where helicopter hunters and motorbike-riding Inuit use powerful assault rifles to hunt their game.
Ironically, it is in the northernmost waters of these two hunting nations that the ice will remain the longest.
In his new book, "After the Ice", Alun Anderson, a former editor of New Scientist, offers a clear and frightening summary of Arctic science and a captivating glimpse into what the future might hold there.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can accurately measure the rate of change.
It's not for lack of trying.
In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the pioneering voyages of Fridtjof Nansen provided the first information on the melting of the ice sheet.
Cold War submarines then mapped the changes in the terrain beneath it.
Satellite monitors and icebergs are a great help, but most of the work is done by hardened men camping in the cold.
Anderson contemplates the extraordinary and tiny world of the Arctic ice-based system, formed by the net of briny water pressed by freezing.
But everything from the bear mentioned above to the microscopic wonders in the ice will be lost with the summer ice loss, predicted between 2013 and 2050.
"In a few months, it may be our turn"
Marines, among the 6,000 who laid wreaths on the graves in Arlington
First-class De'Angello Robinson, 19, made a seven-hour bus ride to lay a simple wreath on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who made the journey from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina to Arlington National Cemetery to decorate the graves, this day was dedicated to greeting the men and women who once stood in their place.
"In a few months, where we are sent from, we may be in their place", Robinson said of the fallen soldiers.
If that happened to me, I'd like someone to do the same for me, so I'm just trying to show respect.
He was one of 6,000 volunteers who gathered Saturday morning to lay wreaths at the graves of veterans in different sections of Arlington Ceremony Cemetery.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, owner of the Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, initiated the commemoration and others decided to decorate several hundred graves in Arlington Ceremony Cemetery.
Now, continuing an 18-year tradition, Morrill and his wife Karen make the trip every year, stopping in different cities along the way to hold commemorations in honor of military personnel and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a nonprofit organization, Wreaths Across America, to promote the event in all other states.
This year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 wreaths on graves in Arlington Cemetery, around the Pentagon, on graves at Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, in Battery Park in New York City, and at the United Airlines Flight 93 Memorial Site in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year in a row, the Walmart Foundation has donated over $150,000 to buy and transport the crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70, of Westminster, said she made the trip to Arlington to honor her late husband, a career military man.
Although her husband was not buried in Arlington, Hunt said she saw the gesture as a way to thank those who had sacrificed.
It's a small gesture that civilians can make to support our troops, she said.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Wrapped in several layers of warm clothing, the volunteers walked through the lawns and rolling hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers chose ancient graves, dating from the First and Second World Wars, as well as the Vietnam War, because these are not as frequently visited as the new graves, organizers said.
The mood was optimistic, as children played and couples held hands, wearing the fresh pine crowns over the gray graves.
Each round crown was a dark green color, with a small red butterfly knot on top.
Nearby, silence hung over Section 60, where most of the Iraq and Afghanistan veterans are buried.
The United Service Organizations donated 1,000 crowns to decorate the section but the dark mood of the current wars filled the area.
Weeping was heard, prayers were said, and family and friends supported each other in the cold.
Some read out loud the names engraved on the stone while others stooped to see the small black and white information cards, buried in the wet earth for those whose graves were not yet finished.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers weeping at her son's grave.
She left Zanesfield, Ohio, and had driven eight hours to meet up at the grave of Marine Gunnery Sergeant David Shane Spicer, who was killed in action in July.
No one should ever forget what made us free... my son paid for it, she said.
"Long after I'm gone, I want someone to remember him".
US citizen arrested by Cuban authorities
The Cuban government has arrested a US citizen who was distributing mobile phones and laptops in the country, the US State Department said.
The national, who has not yet been identified, works for Bethesda-based Development Alternatives Inc.
The company works on projects for clients such as the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular authorities and the U.S. Interests Section in Havana are trying to get in touch with the detainee who was arrested on December 5.
The exact charges have not been made public, although under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or foreign visitor can be arrested on the pretext of being "dangerous".
All so-called revolutionary activities, including moderate protests and critical writing, carry the risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and speech are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has a growing community of bloggers, led by Yoani Sánchez, a popular commentator who often writes about how her husbands and she are followed and harassed by government agents.
Sánchez made several requests to leave the country to receive awards but the permits were always denied.
The detention of an American citizen may increase tensions between the Communist Brotherhood government in Cuba and the Obama administration, which is pursuing a "soft" approach to improving relations with the island.
The arrest was first reported by The New York Times on Friday night.
The new US policy insists that the Cuban government move forward with concrete steps, such as releasing political prisoners and creating more space for the opposition, so that the US can retaliate.
Cell phones and laptops are allowed in Cuba, although they are both new and desirable consumer goods in a country where the average salary of a public servant is $15 a month.
This year alone, the Cuban government has granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones, which are mainly used for texting or 15-minute conversations, which is equivalent to a day's pay.
Internet use on the island is extremely limited.
It is available in luxury hotels and for foreign visitors in the country, as well as in some government buildings, such as universities.
Cubans who want to log in often have to give their name to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
It's rare to see an American detained in Cuba.
Most of the few Americans imprisoned in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug trafficking, says Gloria Berbena, press secretary for the U.S. Interests Section in Havana.
Berbena said she couldn't provide any more information about the arrest.
Arresting and holding him is a big mistake.
An activity that in any other open society would be allowed -- free mobile phone distribution -- is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, director of the Americas program at Human Rights Watch, which recently released a harsh report on freedoms in Cuba, called "New Castro, even Cuba", referring to the installation of Raul Castro as the country's leader to replace his ailing older brother Fidel.
According to Vivanco, an accused is often arrested, tried and imprisoned on the same day.
He said any solution would probably be political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, just as the two countries begin to start a better dialogue.
Pakistani authorities thwart plot to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, Pakistani authorities spotted an organization allegedly plotting to send five men from Northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill US troops, saying they hoped the case would dismantle a large network of terrorist recruiters who scour the Internet looking for radicalised young men.
Investigators claimed they were hunting a hidden insurgent figure known as Saifullah who invited the men to Pakistan after discovering them when one of them made comments endorsing the terrorist wave on the Internet video site YouTube.
When they arrived in Pakistan, Saifullah guided them and tried to help them reach the remote area of Pakistan's tribal belt, home to al-Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence official briefed on the case said Saturday that Saifullah had failed to convince al-Qaeda commanders that the men were not part of the CIA plot to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they were isolated for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the forbidden mountains of the northeast that had become a haven for terrorism.
They were considered undercover agents.
Therefore, they were rejected, said a government official who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the confidential nature of the case.
The official said the men were determined and were still trying to get the necessary permits to enter al-Qaeda camps when they were arrested by Pakistani law enforcement.
The case of these five men -- who remain in Pakistan and are being questioned by the FBI -- highlights the crucial role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists and perhaps more importantly, in determining who to trust.
Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, the U.S. intelligence community has made it a priority to infiltrate men into the al-Qaeda network.
The recruiters of the organization act as gatekeepers, denying entry to those who do not show serious commitment and those who may prove to be spies.
Analysts say potential American recruits are being closely watched by al-Qaeda.
But they're also very attractive to the group because of their potential access to U.S. targets and their propaganda value.
However, Evan Kohlmann, an expert at the US-based NEFA Foundation, said that terrorist groups must also be more careful in the last few years in choosing the people they accept as US intelligence services have become experts in recruitment methods.
If you try to infiltrate someone into these groups, what better way than to follow their recruitment model that so many other people have already followed?
The model is the one that's increasingly on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of protesters in Copenhagen call for climate action
Tens of thousands of protesters marched in the streets here on Saturday, demanding more climate action from negotiators working at the city's Bella Convention Center.
The number of protesters was estimated at 100,000,but the police estimated at 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a small number of masked activists lit some explosives near a group of government buildings in the city centre.
On a day when little happened at the UN-sponsored climate talks, thousands of activists marched through the city, holding signs in English that said 'There is no Planet B' and one in Spanish that said 'The Earth says it's had enough.'
Several celebrities joined the protests, including top Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said that traveling to her mother's home country of Peru opened her eyes to the heartbreaking problems the country is facing due to the impact of climate change that is already occurring".
That's one of the reasons I decided to join the big march -- to spread the word and call on leaders around the world to make just, ambitious, committed decisions, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it must be undertaken, it can no longer be avoided.
Police prevented protesters from getting too close to the Bella center and said they had arrested 19 people on the grounds that they were wearing masks or carrying pocket knives.
Police prevented protesters from getting too close to the Bella center and said they had arrested 19 people on the grounds that they were wearing masks or carrying pocket knives.
According to a passerby who asked not to be named because of his involvement in climate talks, activists wearing masks and black clothes set off several explosive devices near Copenhagen's main canal which is surrounded by a few ministries.
They were fired near buildings, he said, adding that they were first rockets, followed by "some big explosions".
Inside the Congress Palace, people gathered around TV screens to watch the march throughout the afternoon.
But it seems that the protesters have failed to awaken the consciousness of key authorities such as Su Wei, China's climate representative.
When asked if he thought a protest would have a positive impact on international deliberations, he replied in English: "Actually, it's something I wasn't aware of.
He then continued in Mandarin, stating "The event is important, I can't hear what's happening outside".
He noted that walking could seem harmful or helpful depending on the prospects.
It shows the interest of the general public and different sectors in the subject of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "you can also say that they disrupt negotiations or that they harm the freedom of others".
Test results reveal persistent differences between races
Last week's federal report on math performance brought good news for Washington D.C. public schools.
Although the District still lags far behind the top institutions, the report shows that Grade 4 and Grade 5 (cm1-cm2) are making much greater progress over the previous two years than in cities such as Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what the latest figures from the National Assessment of Educational Progress show is the persistent gap between the performance of African-Americans and whites, both locally and nationally.
The average grade of white children in Grade 4 (cm1) in Washington, D.C. has increased over the past two years from 262 to 270 (on a 500 scale), but the average of their African-American classmates has increased only three points, from 209 to 212.
The achievement gap actually increased between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of African Americans in Grade 8 (4th) generally remains constant, falling only one point, from 245 to 244.
The average white score was not included in the test results because the sample was not large enough.
The overview of a six-year period is no more encouraging.
In 2003, the gap between blacks and whites in Grade 4 (cm1) class when the District's first NAEP report was published was 60 points (262 to 202).
Although the children's scores in both groups increased during this period, the difference narrowed to only 58 points.
Last week, some advocates in the District expressed concern that the rise celebrated by Schools Group Director Michelle A. Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (Democrat) was being driven by white students who were already good elements.
That would mean we've raised the aggregate by considering the elements at the top of the scale, which is problematic and embarrassing", said Jeff Smith, director of D.C. Voice, a nonprofit group that advocates for equality in the District's education.
I don't jump for a point or two", said Kwame R. Brown, a Democratic relative, a D.C. Councilman whose daughter is in the fourth grade at Eaton Elementary.
Often critical of Rhee's management style, Brown said the message from the test results is that the city's middle schools desperately need attention.
Really, you always want to see the positive signs and I respect that.
But what is scary is that we don't devote enough time and energy to our middle schools.
Rhee said the District must continue to find better ways to meet the needs of struggling students.
This fall, for example, some teachers were trained to use a new reading method, the Wilson Reading System, for students in the late elementary and early middle school grades who did not integrate the basics of reading earlier in their schooling and who are quite behind their peers.
Every day, the math curriculum for grades Kindergarten through 6th emphasizes real-life games and experiences, as implemented in the District by former District Superintendent Clifford Janey, who also has to be credited for the progress of the NAEP reported last week.
I just think we need to keep working to provide better interventions to these students below the classroom level", Rhee said.
Others believe that the NAEP results raise the question of whether Rhee can continue to raise the overall performance of the system while providing money and resources for schools with poorer performance to narrow the gap.
This is a dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, an education trainer at the University of California, Berkeley, who studies the results of city tests.
The conventional political solution is to devote your resources and management reforms to schools in the poorest neighborhoods of Washington.
This targeting may therefore have political repercussions that hamper this important programme.
But the problem, of course, is that like the other school superintendents, she tries to take advantage of the middle class of whites and blacks.
We are focused on ensuring the development of a good school system.
We need to strengthen our neighborhood schools so that all families, no matter where they come from, can be assured that their children can get a good public education.
Janey, now the Superintendent of Newark Schools, said in an interview this week that one of the key elements to narrowing the achievement gap was the duration of traditional public school, now 180 days in the D.C. District, to compete with charter schools.
It takes about 200 days to have the strength to change, said Janey, who reached an agreement with her teachers' union last year to get 185 days, which he considers a "starting point" for getting another raise in the next contract.
Making higher education a promise for the future
The bus stopped at Gettysburg College with a long whistle.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, gets off the bus and blinks for a moment at the white columns, brick facades, and green lawns.
Graciela's parents had only been able to finish high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a college campus.
So, as she and other eighth graders in the group explored Gettysburg where tuition is $38,690 a year, her attitude was less of an impressed than enthusiastic new student.
Graciela, who wanted to study medicine, exclaimed as the guide led them to the entrance of the science building.
Youpi, really? she said thoughtfully, when she was told the low ratio of law professor - student.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh place the kids visited on their three-day journey of discovery, and now they had completely integrated the message:
The question is where.
While this question still raises many questions for the large number of American children born to Hispanic immigrant parents who dropped out of high school and became parents in their teens, hundreds of thousands are also benefiting from a college education that will allow them to enter the middle class.
In fact, "one in five 'second generation' Hispanics are in high school - a remarkable achievement when you consider that so many of their immigrant parents, mostly from Mexico or Central America, entered the United States without finishing high school.
Their success is important, say researchers, paving the way for future generations to play an important role in the country's workforce.
Researchers who study schoolchildren say that they have a natural affinity for school and an innate need to succeed.
Many parents also set high goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
Mentoring programs also play a very important role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her get to college -- especially if her efforts are regular and long-term.
When you look at children from low-income families with parents who don't have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, any intervention, at any time, won't help them, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at Davis, University of California, who studied Latin American students.
We need to think about providing a support network for these children from kindergarten through high school.
The federal programme that funded the visit of Graciela universities is a good example.
Known as GEAR UP, it provides more than $300 million a year to local school systems to organize college-preparatory programs that begin when students from low-income families are in middle school and continue through high school.
Since 1999, more than 10 million students have taken the program, with more than 60 percent entering college, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
Iraqi oil ministry gets contracts with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has managed to attract major oil companies to rebuild its troubled infrastructure in two auctions that ended Saturday.
The 10 agreements obtained by the Iraqi Ministry of Oil with foreign oil companies suggest that oil companies from China, Russia and Europe are about to play a major role in restoring Iraq's oil industry, which has been crippled by decades of war and sanctions.
American companies left with a stake in only two of the 10 fields put up for auction.
Seven American companies had paid to participate in the second auction that began on Friday.
The only one who put up a bid lost.
Two American companies won contracts for the fields that were auctioned in June.
The low representation of US oil giants in the opening up of the oil sector in Iraq has surprised analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors after six years of war, and instead of American companies, Asian and European companies are leading the way, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, an Internet news website.
It's gonna be a long time before another offer comes in Iraq.
Security concerns, corroborated by massive coordinated bombing on Tuesday, and political instability as US military troops withdraw have held back US oil companies from entering Iraq with more force, which has the world's third largest crude oil reserves, analysts say.
US companies were, in some cases, at a disadvantage because of their rivals, particularly the Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies, whose labour costs were significantly lower and who were more willing to take risks because they did not have to answer to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only U.S. companies to win contracts with the Department.
The major American companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which had strong ties with the Iraqi Ministry of Oil and provided technical advice, left empty-handed.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the two major shareholders in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The state-owned Chinese National Petroleum Corp. bid for more contracts than other companies and walked away with large stakes in contracts for two main fields.
We all know that China is becoming a major economy, as well as a technological powerhouse, said Assam Jihad, spokesperson for the Ministry of Petroleum.
We are confident that Chinese society will be on par with its competitors and will fulfil its commitments in Iraq.
The companies pre-selected to bid made bids which were then compared to the barrel rate that the Ministry agreed to pay to incentivise production above current levels for each field.
One of the main organizers of al-Qaeda was reportedly killed in Pakistan
It appears a U.S. missile that hit along the border with Afghanistan killed one of al-Qaeda's operational planners this week, U.S. counterintelligence officials said Friday.
If confirmed, this would be the second deadly attack on one of the terrorist leaders this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arab men suspected of being killed by a pair of missiles fired from their car near Miran Shah town in North Waziristan province on Tuesday, US and Pakistani officials in the region said.
Local authorities claimed the missiles were fired by a CIA-type drone inside Pakistan's anarchic tribal border.
They were driving a white car, heading towards the Afghan border, when the car was hit, a member of Pakistan's civilian intelligence service said, speaking on Miran Shah's phone.
Officials said suspected local militants rushed to the scene and quickly seized what was left of "totally dismembered bodies".
It was completely impossible for local authorities to verify the identities of the victims, but two US counterterrorism officials provided unspecified evidence that Somali was among the dead.
Somali was described as one of al-Qaeda's senior military organizers who led the group's terrorist operations outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
Its role was to organise plots around the world, said one official who wished to remain anonymous, citing the sensitive nature of airstrikes inside Pakistan.
Given its central role, this probably included conspiracies to attack the United States and Europe.
He followed the strategic directives of al-Qaeda leaders and translated them into action plans for possible terrorist attacks.
A second official from the US said Somalia had advanced rapidly in the ranks of al-Qaeda and had very good relations with other extremist groups in the region.
He may not be known to the American public, but that doesn't diminish the threat he poses to us and our allies, the second official said.
If confirmed, Somali would be the second senior al-Qaeda figure or second Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, leader of a militant faction in the tribal belt, along with three other operatives.
The rate of CIA drone attacks has dropped since the summer from about six operations a month to two, according to figures from the Long War Journal, a website moderated by a nonprofit group.
This decline may be due to improved tactics by terrorist groups that have advanced to reduce their vulnerability while also ruthlessly killing suspected informants, the site claims.
UN special envoy to Kabul withdraws
The UN special envoy to Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday he would resign from his post in March, at the end of a tumultuous mandate marred by allegations of widespread corruption in the UN-backed presidential election.
Eide's departure comes as the Obama administration has decided to send 30,000 additional troops to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said he supported the increase but expressed concern about the US timetable for a troop withdrawal that would begin in 18 months and would force other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the development of our security forces in Afghanistan, send the right signal to Afghans and remind them that they can trust the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
Our commitment has to be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international officials assisting the political transition in Afghanistan.
The military increase must be copied by civilians, he said.
Eide said he was not resigning but would simply honor the commitment he made to his family in March to only spend two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to notify the U.N.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now knows he has time to find a replacement.
I just said it was best to start looking for my replacement, Eide said.
When I came here, there was a gap of two months between my predecessor's departure and my arrival.
According to UN officials, Ban has already begun looking for a replacement.
The officials claim that the names of Staffan di Mistura, an Italian-Swiss national who recently headed a UN mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who previously led UN peacekeeping operations, were mentioned.
Eide's reputation in Afghanistan was put to the test after his former aide, Peter W. Galbraith, accused him in September of favouring President Hamid Karzai in the presidential election and concealing evidence of massive election fraud.
Eide denied the allegations but said that Galbraith's accusations - for which he was thanked - "had hurt the mission because there was already a good deal of skepticism about international election observation".
Eide said he had proposed the appointment of a civilian representative to coordinate the relief efforts of US forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged UN officials to allow his successor to hire more personnel from the United States and other Western countries than are assigned to the mission in Afghanistan, saying this would give them more confidence in how their money is being spent.
Eide expressed frustration about the limits of her powers in Afghanistan, saying that the UN's heavy hiring regulations hindered her ability to bring in new talent.
UN rules are such that I have been able to recruit only one person since May, he said.
It's a disaster and it can't last.
Gates: Iran must face further sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said on Friday that major world powers would soon impose "significant additional sanctions" on Iran because of its failure to engage in talks on nuclear ambitions.
Gates, speaking to a crowd of 300 US troops in northern Iraq during a weeklong visit to war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, played down the possibility of military action against the Islamic Republic.
He said there was no good option in Iran, in response to a soldier's question about the possibility of such an outcome.
One of the things that weighs most on me, if there's one thing I've learned in Iraq over the last six years, it's the unpredictability inherent in war.
The Obama administration is considering a package of sanctions that would target Iran's military and political elite, but Gates has signaled that some of these sanctions could also affect ordinary Iranians.
He said that a "set of motivations and punishments" might be needed to persuade the Iranian government that it would actually be less safe with nuclear weapons" because "its people would suffer greatly" from these sanctions.
In a statement on Friday, White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said the administration joined European leaders in warning that Iran would face "probable" consequences if it did not bring its nuclear program back into full compliance with the UN Security Council and its watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Iran insists that it wants to develop its nuclear experimentation solely for peaceful purposes.
At the Geneva talks on 1 October, it indicated that it would resume dialogue on reducing its nuclear programme and agreed to give up a significant part of its stockpile of enriched uranium in exchange for desperately needed fuel for a medical research reactor.
The administration pushed for such an agreement as a way to build trust on both sides and buy time for negotiations.
Since then, Iran appears to have moved away from attempts at a deal - partly, experts say, because Iran's leadership is divided over whether or not to engage with the United States.
Frankly, I think that Iran's hardening towards some of the proposals of the international community that they actually agreed to in early October has led the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, to come together on what they had not considered, in terms of significant additional sanctions against the Iranians, Gates said.
President Obama has set December 31 as a deadline for Iran to respond to the proposals, before he turns to other options, including pursuing what Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "enhanced sanctions".
In a statement Thursday in New York, Iran's mission to the United Nations condemned what it called "baseless allegations" by some members of the Security Council about Iran's nuclear activities and said it agreed to continue talks with the United States and five other major world powers "to achieve a satisfactory long-term solution".
Gates, who was due to fly back to Washington late on Friday, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki in the morning before flying to the oil-rich Kurdish region to meet with the troop commanders in Kirkuk, Kurdish and Irbil.
Tensions persist between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq, particularly over borders, property rights and income sharing.
Gates urged both sides to reduce potential conflict to avoid any delays in U.S. plans to reduce U.S. troop numbers from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also wants to calm Kurdish anxiety about the pending withdrawal, with US officials quoting Gates as telling Massoud Barzani, President of the Kurdistan Regional Government: "We will preserve your security, prosperity and autonomy within a unified Iraq".
We will not abandon you".
Changing Direction in Aging China
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters preaching, "Mother Earth is too tired to take more children" and "Another baby is another grave".
They learned the lesson so well that Shanghai government officials, alarmed by the city's low birth rate and aging population, radically changed course this summer and began encouraging young couples to have more than one child.
We've already given all our time and energy to one child.
We have no time left", said Wang, 31, a human resources manager with an eight-month-old son.
More than 30 years after China's one-child policy was introduced, creating two generations of notoriously good-cheeked and spoiled one-children, dubbed the "little emperors", a population crisis threatens the country.
According to the UN, the average birth rate has fallen from six children per couple to 1.8 children per couple when the policy was implemented.
Population distribution, while the number of residents aged 60 and over is projected to explode, from 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent in 2050.
This imbalance is even worse in wealthy coastal cities with highly educated populations, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over made up almost 22 percent of the population of Shanghai's registered residents, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission, said fertile couples should have babies to "help reduce the proportion of the aging population and prevent a shortage of labor in the future".
Shanghai is on the verge of becoming "as old - but not as rich, however - as developed countries like Japan and Sweden", she said.
A gradual decline
The one-child policy, which was written into the country's 1978 constitution, is arguably the most controversial requirement introduced by the Communist government to date.
Couples who violate this policy risk paying hefty fines -- up to three times their annual income -- and facing discrimination in the workplace.
The Chinese authorities have assigned the police the duty to help the country avoid a dangerous trend for its natural resources, while human rights lawyers have denounced abuses in the implementation of this policy.
In rural areas, some officials have forced pregnant women to have a second child and have them abort.
In addition, many couples have resorted to selective abortions, leading to an abnormally high ratio of boys to girls.
In recent years, the authorities responsible for the population have gradually softened their position on the one-child policy.
In 2004, they granted more exceptions to the rule -- including for city dwellers, members of ethnic minorities, and cases where the man and woman are already single children -- and in 2007, they softened many of their tough slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute of Population Research, Peking University, said that the central government authorities recently discussed even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one partner is an only child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage births.
In no time, the one-child poster was replaced by copies of regulations detailing who was entitled to have a second child and how to apply for permission.
The city government sent family planning officers and volunteers to meet with couples in their homes and slip flyers under their doors.
He also promised to provide psychological and financial advice to those who would like to have more than one child.
According to the head of family planning, the answer was disappointing.
A Disappointing Answer
Although officials in a rural city on the outskirts of Shanghai say they have seen an increase in requests for applications from couples wishing to have a second child after the campaign was launched, the more urban district reported no change.
The municipality of Huinan, for example, with a population of 115,000, still receives only four to five applications per month.
Shanghai officials, disappointed, say that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010 is still expected to be only about 165,000 -- slightly higher than in 2009 but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee in Shanghai's Caolu Municipality, said financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people don't want to have more children.
They want to provide for their first child, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would love to have two children and are legally allowed to.
But like many Chinese, they only have the minimum health insurance and the government-issued life insurance.
Without social protection, they say, the decision would be irresponsible.
Westerners mistakenly view the one-child policy as a rights issue, said Yang, a civil engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant with the couple's first child.
It's true, we're being denied the chance to have more than one child.
But the problem is not just the law.
It's the money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons for their hesitation.
Wang, HR Manager, said she only wanted one child because she was an only child herself. "We were the center of the family and used to have everyone take care of us".
We're not used to taking care of anyone else, and we really don't want to take care of anyone else".
Chen Zijian, 42, owner of a translation company, says it more bluntly.
For middle-class couples working together, who are lowering the birth rate, he says, you have to be selfish to be successful.
People in their 20s or 30s grew up seeing their parents fight in the early days of capitalist China and don't want to have that lifestyle themselves, he says.
Even a single child demands a lot of time from his parents, he says.
A mother must give up at least two years of her social life.
Then there's the space issues -- "You need to change your apartment" -- and planning -- "When your child is only nine months old, you need to write a resume to get a place in the best kindergarten".
Most of her friends are ready for this experience once, Chen says, but not twice.
Our generation is the first to enjoy a higher standard of living, he says.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
The UN group has draft plans for reducing emissions
The UN-sponsored climate conference -- characterized so far by disorganized assignments and mutual recriminations -- came back into the spotlight on Friday, with the release of a paper highlighting ambitious greenhouse gas reductions over the next 40 years, with industrialized nations shouldering most of the burden in the coming days.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, has highlighted the remaining obstacles as well as illuminating the way forward.
But it was seen as a major step forward in the time-consuming negotiations, with more than 100 world leaders arriving in Copenhagen next week.
The report, prepared by a UN task force, does not say how much the rich countries would give to the poor to help with the current and long-term climate change.
And it offers a wide range of options for key issues, including how developed and emerging economies could reduce their carbon emissions and what would be the upper limit of global temperature rise that officials would be willing to tolerate.
It gives the process a great deal of flexibility, said John Coequyt, Washington representative of the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who wrote six pages of the document, studied a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what the UN's Executive Secretary-General on Climate Change, Yvo de Boer, described as "the full picture".
It provides guidelines for a possible agreement in which industrialized nations would collectively reduce their emissions by 2020 by 25 to 45 percent from 1990 levels, while major developing countries, over the same period, would reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 percent.
Together, the countries would reduce emissions by between 50 and 95 percent by 2050.
The European Union also revived negotiations on Friday, pledging to provide $3.6 billion a year over the next three years to help the poorest countries adapt to the impact of climate change -- to withstand floods and drought or to prevent deforestation.
However, on Friday, the same verbal altercations occurred, which have dominated the negotiations since last week.
Todd Stern, US Representative at the Climate Negotiations rejected any discussion of forcing industrialized countries to reduce greenhouse gases, compared to voluntary efforts by major emerging economies, if these were not financed by developed countries.
This change is a signal that the Obama administration is getting tougher on China than the Bush administration was two years ago.
The US will not sign an agreement without efforts and actions from major developing countries, said Stern, who also regretted that the text did not stress enough to ensure that the cuts could be verified by outside observers.
Stern made his comments an hour after China's Deputy Foreign Minister He Yafei said the top US negotiator was either "lacking common sense" or "extremely irresponsible" for saying earlier this week that the US would not help China financially to fight global warming.
With the future economic trajectories of the major world powers at stake, flaws have emerged both within the Third World and between the industrialized world and the emerging economies.
The current battle is more about saving individual economies than saving the planet, with China and the US fighting over their respective obligations while poorer nations insist that the two dozen most influential countries ignore the scientific imperatives to act more boldly.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said it was not surprising that the major powers were fighting over who should bear the costs of reducing greenhouse gases, even as vulnerable countries became more aggressive in their attempt to hold the big emitters accountable for their actions.
It is really a game in which a new economic hegemony is being developed, said Ulate, who is also Climate Advisor for Mexico and Central America for Conservation International.
Some of these countries more vulnerable to the impact of climate change have indicated that they will continue to press for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most of the main participants say that negotiations will lead at least to a political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States, which has 43 members, drafted a 24-page draft treaty early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, head of the European Commission's climate unit, said the action of the small island states has "put political pressure on the whole political process", partly because they are now united and are calling on emerging economies such as China and India to act.
The debate became an urgent affair, as delegates focused on the fact that they had to solve most of the outstanding problems before the heads of government could reach an agreement.
High-level officials such as India's environment minister Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese vice minister got off their planes and rushed to the Bella Center building to attend closed-door meetings and information conferences, so they could make complaints that would be considered in the following week.
The real picture of the rally -- where 13,000 people walk in and out of the Congress Palace every day -- of activists playing guitar and putting on nightly shows mocking countries that they say are betraying each other and proposals are written and distributed on paper rather than by email -- is a real challenge.
The intensity is only increasing: almost all the important ministers are here and 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen no later than Wednesday.
We are entering the court of the great", said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, vice president for global policy at Conservation International.
The heavyweights are coming.
In Britain, the first train running at 225 km/h will redefine Monday syndrome
At 5:13 a.m. on Monday morning, a whistle will blow through the night to signal the departure of a train that will revolutionize transportation in Britain.
The country's first high-speed commuter train will reach 225 km/h, as it runs from Ashford, Kent, to London St Pancras, covering 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Secretary of State for Transport, will be joined by Dame Kelly Holmes on board the first Javelin commuter train outside London.
He hopes the new service will allow Britain to be part of a fast and reliable international rail network and will link the major conurbations of the Midlands, North and Scotland to London.
Small, lost holes will become thriving suburbs, business travel times will be much shorter, and the switch from air and car to train will reduce national carbon emissions while reducing traffic jams on the roads.
In theory, the three main political parties are in favour of this project.
But the ten billion pounds needed to build a new railway network, the inevitable scheduling battle and fears of environmental hazards risk holding back Britain's high-speed railways.
According to The Times, High Speed Two (HS2), a company set up in January to produce a feasibility report for the government, will hand over its paper to Lord Adonis on December 30.
This will allow it to obtain a detailed map of the route of the next planned stage of the high-speed network.
The new line between London and the West Midlands will be drawn within 15 feet of the urban area and sites where environmental impact may be controversial.
In the countryside, the plan will be drawn up to 25 meters from the final route.
It is also planned that HS2 will present three options for a larger high-speed network, going north.
Lord Adonis will answer in the spring.
The preferred options are highlighted in a Y-shaped configuration for which a high-speed line will go to the West Midlands.
The line will split in two at or near Birmingham, with one branch going west of the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another going north-east to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line will run through Scotland.
"It seems to be the best performance option", said one railway professional.
When it's complete, the travel time between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first branch, which will not open until 2025, will allow all passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to an hour's journey currently.
The proposals will allow the train to travel at 400km/h, making the UK network the fastest in the world.
The initial route is designed to accommodate trains 400 m long and carrying 1100 people.
Up to 18 trains per hour can run on a London - Birmingham line.
A terminal with a capacity of 20000 passengers per hour would be needed.
Given the space constraints, it is planned to enlarge an existing station to accommodate the high-speed network.
The rail industry experts say that only St Pancras International or Euston offer this possibility.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he thinks the project should go ahead, but longer public consultations and planning procedures mean that a final decision will not be made until a general election.
Even if he starts the machine, the network will have to be built piece by piece.
Trains will first be required to run off high-speed lines on existing tracks north of Birmingham, keeping travel times between London and Scotland over three hours.
This seems to be the best solution for the transition from airplanes to trains, and is a reference point for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers pay back the £75,000 loan for the Tory orange shop
Alan Duncan, the leading Tory MP, has made the taxpayer pay thousands of pounds a year to cover the cost of an orange grove he built in his home in his riding.
The party leader who was demoted by David Cameron for complaining that MPs were "underpaid" has increased his loan of £75,000 to build an oak extension to his second home in Rutland.
He was authorized to charge the taxpayer extra interest, amounting to hundreds of pounds a month.
The Commons authorities received the complaints at the time and were not questioned by Sir Thomas Legg, who is overseeing the members' expenditure.
Mr Duncan, one of the wealthiest Members of Parliament, owns a two-storey house in a village in his constituency of Rutland-Melton.
The houses next door were sold for almost a million pounds.
The ground floor includes a kitchen, living room and dining room, but the tax office says Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year, he added a veranda to the house, describing it in his plans as an orange grove.
Neighbors describe it as a "veranda for fun".
Mr Duncan was not asked to explain the increase in borrowing during a recent investigation by the Commons Privileges and Standards Committee into his pre-borrowing arrangements.
The committee cleared him last month of any charges of breach of the rules after an investigation into his expenses.
In 2004, Mr Duncan changed the legal security of the £271,406 loan from his London property to his riding house which he bought in 1991, the year before he became an MP.
Documents released this week show that Mr Duncan was claiming about £1,400 a month in borrowing interest until March last year.
In April, his demands increased by over £1,800 a month.
The interest rate on Mr Duncan's RBS loan was unchanged at that time, suggesting that all the increases were intended to finance the GBP 75,000 loan.
The standard variable rate of RBS has fallen from 7.94% in December 2007 to 4% in March this year and has not moved since.
The latest publication from the Commons authorities shows that Mr Duncan was still asking for £1,250 in May.
Mr Duncan lost his position as Shadow Cabinet Secretary in September after an undercover journalist allegedly filmed him saying that MPs had to survive "on budget" after the spending scandal.
"In fact, it's now national, you have to live on a budget and you're treated like a...
He said: "I spent my money on my garden and asked for a small part, based on what was right.
and I could have asked for a hell of a lot more, but I didn't".
The MP, a millionaire from his former job as an oil trader, began to have to explain his expenses in May after it emerged that he had asked for thousands of pounds for his garden, before agreeing with the fees office that this "could be considered excessive".
An activist dug a £ hole in Mr Duncan's lawn to protest after it was revealed he had been asking for £4,000 for three years.
Asked about the loan increase last night, Mr Duncan said: "It was for major improvements, approved by both the expense bureau and Legg".
He added: "There is no problem of dodging or making or using rules or anything.
It was very clear, in the rules, authorized, etc.
It couldn't be clearer or simpler".
Fellows, come and see the Brighton Advent Calendar.
Brighton beach cabins have found a new way to promote the winter months, an interactive Advent calendar.
Beyond, an alternative church group that encourages spiritual exploration through creativity, invited 24 homeowners to decorate their cabin for each day of December, using Christmas carols as a theme.
The event began on December 1, when visitors were allowed to visit the last booth, from 5:30 to 6:30 p.m. daily, with free pastries and hot wine served.
The Christmas songs chosen so far include "I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First Christmas", for which the booth features work by Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant in Hove, is an unpaid priest in the Diocese of Chichester and Director of Beyond.
He said: "We want religion to be closer to people in a post-Christian society.
"Why, as a church, do we wait for people to walk into an old, strange building?
"The idea for the Advent calendar from the beach cabin came just after a conversation with a few friends over dinner.
Brighton is such a creative and vibrant place and we try to experience and represent that through spirituality".
Strong mobilisation in Copenhagen and around the world for climate
Tens of thousands of people demonstrated on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding agreement on fighting global warming, worldwide and in Copenhagen, where police made several hundred arrests.
At least 30,000 people, according to police, and 100,000 according to organizers, marched in the cold in the Danish capital on the sidelines of the UN Climate Conference, which is expected to reach an agreement by Friday that could come into force on January 1, 2013.
Connie Hedegaard, the Danish chair of the climate conference, said the growing global climate mobilisation, illustrated by these demonstrations, had helped make "the political price" of failure in Copenhagen very high.
The incidents in the Danish capital took place shortly after the march had started, when a group of 300 protesters, all dressed in black, smashed windows with cobblestones and hammers, an AFP reporter reported.
Riot police quickly responded without mercy.
In total, police said they had arrested 600 to 700 people, mostly members of what they said were the "black blocs", the ultra-violent groups that were at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, eastern France, in April.
The Climate Justice Action (CJA) coalition, one of the organizers of the rally, denounced the conditions under which hundreds of activists were arrested "without distinction", noting that about 100 of them "were still held in the street on Saturday night" handcuffed and kept in a sitting position despite the extreme cold.
The party, rather a good kid, took the lead at the Bella Center, the site of the negotiations.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the building, without trying to enter.
A stage was set up for the planned speakers, before a candlelight vigil attended by former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu.
Most of the protesters had come by bus and train from major European cities, but many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in raincoats, had formed an early morning rally in Copenhagen at the invitation of Friends of the Earth, who were to form "blue tides" for "climate justice".
Today we are taking to the streets to demand compensation for the ecological debt to the South, said Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino activist with the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We cannot keep saying we have time, said the Beninese singer Angélique Kidjo.
There are rivers that dry up in Africa, streams where you can walk like you've never walked before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which began in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the alter-globalism movement has come closer to environmental organizations.
The French MEP José Bové, a figure in the alter-globalism movement, said he had come to Copenhagen to "link climate justice and social justice": "Today, there is no separation between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world".
The Asia-Pacific region, home to many islands particularly vulnerable to warming, had sparked protests.
Some 50,000 people, according to organizers, took to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, a few hundred people, mostly students, marched in red, holding banners touting solar energy.
In Hong Kong and Jakarta, as well as in Canada, rallies of a few hundred demonstrators were also held to demand vigorous action against climate change.
In France, demonstrations organised by the 350 network drew a few hundred people, notably in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
In Geneva, a few dozen people gathered.
Abkhazia elects president, Georgia says it is a "farce"
Abkhazia elected its president on Saturday, a little over a year after Moscow recognized the pro-Russian separatist region of Georgia, while Tbilisi denounced it as a "farce".
Some 131,000 people were scheduled to participate in the first election after the August 2008 Russian-Georgian war for control of South Ossetia, another breakaway Georgian territory recognized by Russia.
The polls closed at 5:00pm GMT.
The turnout was 58 percent hours before the closing, according to Abkhazian election commission officials.
The first provisional results were to be announced in the night from Saturday to Sunday.
The five candidates, including outgoing president Sergey Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which condemned the holding of the election.
This election is a sham.
For his part, Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili "regrets that Abkhazia has fallen under the total occupation of Russia", said his spokeswoman, Manana Manjgaladze.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognized the independence of this territory of 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considers it part of Georgia illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After seceding from Georgia in the 1992-93 conflict that killed thousands, Abkhazia is seeking to show through this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a step in our new life, our new era as an independent state, said Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian who said she voted for Mr. Bagapch.
She was among the voters who went to the polling station in a school in the capital, Sukhumi, in a beautiful white building with some palm trees in front of the entrance.
The issue of Russian domination is at the heart of the presidential election in this region with its lavish scenery on the Black Sea.
Large signs showing Mr. Bagapch with Russian President and Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and Vladimir Putin are scattered throughout this small territory of 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, in the west of the country, the district head Beslan Archba warmly welcomed the Russian officials who had come to monitor the election.
We, the Abkhaz people, are grateful, he said at a small ceremony, alluding to Moscow's support, particularly the decision to recognize Abkhazia's independence.
I hope that your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations", replied Alexei Ostrovsky, a member of the Russian parliament, raising a glass of vodka.
The opposition, represented in the election by former vice-president Raoul Khadjimba and two businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticized agreements with Moscow last year, such as the one ceding control of Abkhazian railways to Russia for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, says he supports neither the current government nor the opposition.
A 50% majority plus one vote is required to win the election.
If no candidate reaches this threshold, a second round must be held within two weeks.
Climate: protests around the world, incidents in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people marched across the world on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding agreement at the Copenhagen Climate Conference, where police caught almost 700 people on the sidelines of a massive protest.
Thirty thousand people, according to the police, a hundred thousand according to the organizers, marched in the cold afternoon in the Danish capital, which hosts delegates from 193 countries until December 18, in search of an agreement that will come into force on January 1, 2013.
The whole party, the whole party, the whole party, the whole party, the whole party, the whole party, the whole party, the whole party, the whole party, the whole party, the whole party, the whole party, the whole party, the whole party, the whole party, the whole party, the whole party, the whole party, the whole party, the whole party, the whole party, the whole party, the whole party, the whole party, the whole party, the whole party, the whole party, the whole party, the whole party, the whole party, the whole party, the whole party, the whole party, the whole party, the whole party, the whole party, the whole party, the whole party, the whole party, the whole party, the whole party, the whole party, the whole party, the whole party, the whole party, the whole party, the whole party, the whole party, the whole party, the whole party, the whole party, the whole party, the whole party, the whole party, the whole party, the whole party, the whole party, the whole party, the whole party, the whole party, the whole party, the whole party, the whole party, the whole party, the whole party, the whole party, the whole party, the whole party, the whole party, the whole party, the whole party, the whole party, the whole party, the whole party, the whole party, the whole party, the whole party, the whole party, the whole party, the whole party, the party, the whole party, the party, the party, the party, the party, the party, the party, the party, the party, the party, the party, the party, the party, the party, the party, the party, the party, the party, the party, the party, the party, the party, the party, the party, the party, the party, the party, the party, the party, the party, the party, the party, the party, the party, the party, the party, the party, the party, the party, the party, the party, the party, the party, the party, the party, the party, the party, the party, the party, the party, the party, the party, the party, the party, the party, the party, the party, the party,
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the center, without trying to enter.
A stage was set up for the planned speakers, before a candlelight vigil attended by former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu.
Moments after the march left, a group of a few hundred protesters, all dressed in black, with bricks and hammers, broke windows, an AFP reporter reported.
Riot police quickly surrounded them and intervened mercilessly, throwing many of them to the ground.
Police said they had arrested between 600 and 700 people, saying most of them were members of the "Black Blocs", the ultra-violent groups that were at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, eastern France, in April.
Late in the afternoon, a police officer was injured in the jaw by a paved road and four cars were set on fire near a squat in incidents that led to the arrest of about 20 people, police said.
We are watching the extremist groups, police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen warned, as law enforcement helicopters circled the sky.
The majority of the protesters, who came by bus and train from major cities in Germany, London, Amsterdam and Milan, were of European origin.
But there were also many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, and some Africans.

Geo-history comes out stronger from the reform of the general high school, according to Chatel
The Minister of National Education Luc Chatel said in an interview to be published in the JDD on Sunday that history and geography were coming out "strengthened" by the reform of the general high school, despite the abolition of their compulsory teaching in science terminals.
Now all first-year students will have four hours a week and the same curriculum for a shared common culture, says Mr Chatel.
The minister said that "hypocrisy must be removed" because, in his view, "School S is no longer a science school" but "in general, it concentrates the best students".
The ES and L courses cannot remain sub-fields of the S, he continues, stressing further: "I have also not heard many historians and intellectuals express indignation at the absence of history and geography as a final subject in technological high schools".
On Saturday, an Ifop poll published in L'Humanité revealed that almost seven in ten (69%) French people disapproved of the government's plan to remove compulsory history and geography in the S-level. Many intellectuals and teachers also criticized the removal, as did the left and some right-wing elected officials.
The Minister added, however, that there was "no question" of removing the philosophy from the S-terminal programme.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of teacher training, while 16 organizations (students and unions) called for a day of mobilization on Tuesday to protest the project, which they say sacrifices the pedagogical training of future teachers.
In the master's degree (M2), they will pass an admissibility test at the beginning of the year, which will cover their discipline, and then at the end of the year an admission test, which will cover their ability to teach, the minister explained.
They will also undertake practical training during the M2 year and then be a first year in front of the pupils as trainee teachers.
If you add up all the courses offered before the competition, you already get more presence in front of the students, or more than 300 hours, he continued.
Finally, the minister said he would propose "the individual right to training, which does not exist in the National Education".
He also reaffirms the plan to abolish the school card "by 2012".
At Normal Sup, experts have 15 minutes to convince about the climate
Fifteen minutes to talk about the issues at the Copenhagen summit: this was the challenge posed on Saturday morning by Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), invited by the Ecole Normale Supérieure de la rue d'Ulm.
Jean Jouzel, also a Nobel Peace Prize winner, opened the first of the "Ernest" conferences, a day of a series of expert talks, each 15 minutes long, filmed and open to the public, an AFP reporter said.
We wanted to do something that would catch people's eye and make them want to know more", said 22-year-old Edouard Hannezo, one of the organizers of the event, which is named after the fish that students gave to the school's swimming pool.
He said that about 20 speakers were chosen from experts in their fields and selected for their charismatic side.
On global warming, "you can talk in hours, but you can also talk about key targets in minutes", said Jean Jouzel, who spoke without notes but with graphs in front of about 50 people.
This is part of our role as scientists, he stressed, hoping that the listeners will remember that 'the Copenhagen conference is based on a very serious scientific dossier'.
Videos from these lectures will be posted on the school's website from 15 December.
The next "Ernest" day is scheduled for February, followed by others at a bimonthly rate.
Late payments: anger from prison officials, action planned
The prison supervisors' unions called for a "general mobilisation" on Friday to demand payment by the end of the year for bonuses and overtime, which was postponed to January for budgetary reasons.
FO-penitentiary (2nd supervisors' union) asked the staff who will not be on duty to demonstrate on Tuesday morning in front of the prison institutions and "block" them, to "denounce the theft of their debts".
The CGT-penitentiary (the third trade union) calls on them to "meet in general assemblies in the various prisons for a strong mobilisation", judging "shameful and unacceptable" the non-payment in December of "overtime, night, Sunday and holiday bonuses" worked in October.
And the leading supervisors' union, the Federal Independent Prison Union (Ufap/Unsa), "calls for a general mobilization . . . to raise discontent and anger".
The Directorate of Prison Administration and the Ministry of Justice explain that overtime has increased significantly in 2009 and not all of it has been budgeted, but assure that the remainder will be paid in January.
The Chancellery said late in the day that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to the supervisors' unions assuring them that the payment would be made next month.
I am aware of the efforts made by the staff to operate and modernize our prison system, the Minister of Justice wrote in this letter.
I have asked the prison administration to put in place without delay a package of measures to ensure that this situation, which is the result of a miscalculation of the number of overtime hours, does not happen again in the future, adds Ms Alliot-Marie.
The December salary will therefore be meagre, except for the executives who enjoy the famous bonuses for their jobs and objectives, lamented the UFAP/Unsa, for whom "budgetary constraints are a good thing".
This is a pure scandal, the interregional association FO of Marseille has said, announcing its decision to boycott "all meetings and conventions" until further notice.
The staff will not come to work on their Sundays and public holidays if the October ones are not regularised in December, the same for overtime, also threatens FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
At a time when we are increasing our tasks and missions without increasing our staff, it is more than regrettable to dare to attack the staff's money, says the CGT-penitentiary of Bordeaux.
According to the trade unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, with some less badly off than others.
But the number is not there, said Ufap's secretary-general, Jean-François Forget.
For Christmas, Obama says he's offering "cooler tricks" than he gets
President Barack Obama, who is preparing to spend his first Christmas with his family in the White House, told Oprah Winfrey that he had a simple rule when it came to gifts: "I give better things than I get".
In a special Sunday night show on ABC, the president and his wife Michelle offer a glimpse into how they plan to celebrate the holidays in their new, prestigious home.
Even Bo, the family's little four-legged companion, will be in on the action.
Michelle Obama said Santa also loves Bo, adding that the dog would "of course" get a gift, according to pre-release clips of the show.
And Michelle Obama has registered false against her husband's claims about the quality of the gifts he receives: "Of course not, I got you cool gifts last year", she teased the president.
Absolutely, was he forced to concede before he humorously responded by pointing to the first lady's pearl necklace: "Who gave you this?"
During this hour-long, casual show with the famous host who was a huge supporter of Barack Obama during the presidential campaign, the president and his wife also recalled their favorite gifts as children.
Barack Obama spoke of a ten-speed bicycle, but also a basketball that his Kenyan father, whom he rarely saw, gave him for Christmas.
I remember one time I met my father who came to visit us for Christmas and gave me a basketball, the president said.
It wasn't until much later in my life that I realized that he was the one who gave me that ball.
The first lady remembered her side of her dollhouse.
I really didn't know how to organize a house, so I had all the furniture lined up against the wall, rather than arranging it around the fireplace, but I loved this little dollhouse", Michelle Obama said.
Johnny Hallyday has undergone surgery, RTL says he's in an artificial coma
Johnny Hallyday underwent re-operation in Los Angeles due to extensive "injuries" after an operation in France, but the situation is "under control" according to his entourage, while RTL claims the singer has been placed in an artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rock star underwent a second operation on Wednesday night at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles after American doctors found "operation-related damage" to his herniated disc in Paris on November 26, his Paris press office said, adding that the damage "needed repair surgery".
The singer's press office, however, reassured that the situation was "under control", while announcing that a new medical report would be issued within 48 hours.
According to RTL, the singer's partner on his latest tour, Johnny Hallyday was put into an artificial coma to avoid "pain and complications".
Only after 48 hours, when the patient opens an eye, will we know a little more about his condition, RTL reports.
Asked by AFP, the press service neither confirmed nor commented on the information.
RTL also claims that "according to some sources" no drainage was laid after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker had surgery at the Monceau Park International Clinic for this herniated disc.
The procedure, which had been scheduled for several days, was performed by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known doctor in the art world.
He was not available on Thursday evening to comment on RTL's report.
Following the surgery he performed on Johnny Hallyday, the singer was hospitalized Monday at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles for an infection following the surgery.
The singer Eddy Mitchell, a close friend of Johnny Hallyday, said on RTL on Thursday that his friend was going through "a bad time", but assured that he was "no worries" for the rocker, who is "a fighter".
He called me just before he left for Los Angeles, and I told him it was bullshit because doing a 12-hour flight after an operation like that, it's not playable, Eddy Mitchell said.
On Wednesday night, the singer's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, wanted to reassure himself, saying that Johnny Hallyday was "responding satisfactorily to antibiotics" and that the infection was "curbed".
Mr Camus also said he had spoken with Laeticia, the singer's wife, and had not noticed any particular concern.
But the singer's health problems have only worsened since July when he was hospitalized for nine days after falling from his yacht.
Two months later, to everyone's surprise, Johnny Hallyday revealed that he had undergone surgery for "a small cancer of the colon" and then a minor infection.
In late September, the singer resumed his long "Tour 66" tour, billed as his farewell tour.
Fans and journalists have noted the singer's difficulty moving around on stage.
In mid-November, his family even had to deny another hospital stay.
Euro-2009/small pool: Bousquet's first on his fetish distance
The Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, three-time World Championships 2009 medallist in the long jump, won an international title on Thursday in a distance he particularly likes, the 50m freestyle, at the Euro 2009 short jump in Istanbul.
The first day of this competition where the suits are allowed for the last time saw only three world records broken as we waited for a surge.
One was improved by Evelyn Verraszto of Hungary in the 200 m 4x4 and the other two by Russia in the 4x50 m 4x4 men's relay.
A pity for Bousquet, who was looking at the world record in the 50m freestyle, which he holds in the large-pool (20.94).
In one of the two main distances of swimming, the 50 m freestyle, the 28-year-old Frenchman won in 20 seconds 53 in a final where ten swimmers started against eight usually, a first at international level.
Bousquet edged out Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84) but failed to lower the world record (20.30) as he had intended.
You can always dream better, and in the event, I said if the world record was within my reach, I would try.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers were wearing polyurethane swimsuits, which will be banned from 1 January.
The combined event, which has set 238 world records since February 2008, concludes its epic in Istanbul, which hosted the first in 1999 at the same competition.
The use of the suit did not work this time for German Paul Biedermann, two-time world champion in the large pool this summer in Rome, world records holder.
The young swimmer failed to lower his 400 m freestyle record (3:32.77) but still won by setting the second-best time of his career (3:34.55), ahead of Russia's Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and Denmark's Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
I didn't put my best foot forward on this race.
I knew I couldn't break a world record this time but I managed to defend my title and I accomplished my mission.
Lobintsev will be a serious rival in the future, Biedermann explained.
USA: A sarcophagus panel once owned by Zola sold for $1.5 million
A Roman sarcophagus panel that once belonged to French writer Emile Zola was sold on Thursday for $1.5 million, well above its estimate, art dealer Sotheby's announced.
This two-meter-long, two-inch-high, three-inch-high panel, dating from the third century C.E., was valued at between $150,000 and $250,000.
The marble "representing four Dionysian scenes in a sophisticated architectural setting, surrounded by satyrs and concubines, is a rare piece, there are only four or five in the world", Florent Heintz, vice president of auctions of ancient Roman and Egyptian art at Sotheby's, told AFP on Tuesday.
It was sold in a hundred lots.
The sale is still ongoing but it is certainly the one that has been the most bid for so far, Sotheby's spokesman Dan Abernethy told AFP.
The discovery of the acquisition of this marble by Emile Zola dates back a few days.
The panel remained in Rome for nearly 300 years in the famous collection of the Borghese family, then appeared successively in the home of the French actress Cécile Sorel, who had made it part of her bathtub in her Paris mansion, and in the home of Paul Reynaud, minister under the Third Republic in France and briefly president of the Council before Marshal Pétain came to power.
There was a shadow zone that lasted for about 50 years.
By searching the Louvre Museum database, Florent Heintz discovered that this panel was part of an "Emile Zola succession" opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of "Thérèse Raquin" and the "Rougon-Macquart" fresco.
Zelaya's failed attempt to leave Honduras for Mexico
Mexico on Thursday decided that conditions were no longer in place for the transfer of Honduras' ousted president Manuel Zelaya, who was denied safe passage by the coup government.
At the moment, after a late-night phone call with President Zelaya, everything seems to indicate that the possibilities for this transfer are not there, said Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa.
Arriving in El Salvador on Wednesday to bring Mr. Zelaya home, the Mexican government plane has returned to its home base, according to a source at the Directorate General of Migration.
The coup government wanted to force Mr Zelaya to "resign" and seek political asylum abroad to be granted safe passage.
But the deposed president refused, because he wanted to go to Mexico as a visiting head of state.
The coup government "has failed again by wanting me to resign . . . they wanted me to resign", Zelaya told Globo radio on Thursday, where he has been a frequent commentator since the beginning of the five-month political crisis in the Central American country.
I can stay here for ten years, here I have my guitar, added the ousted president, who has been a refugee in the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa for two and a half months, playing a few chords.
The Mexican embassy has submitted a request for safe passage, but unfortunately we cannot accept it because it does not contain a request for asylum, said Interior Minister Oscar Raul Matute of the coup government to Honduran radio station HRN on Wednesday.
I am not seeking asylum in any country, Manuel Zelaya said in an interview with Telesur, a television channel based in Caracas.
He also stressed that the EU had to be a force for good in the world.
The rumours of Zelaya's departure had mobilized supporters of the ousted president on Wednesday, who gathered around the Brazilian embassy, where the military has reinforced its siege.
The Brazilian Foreign Minister, Celso Amorim, criticized the position of the coup government.
He said that the EU had been a "serious and uncompromising partner" for the past two years.
Zelaya, who had grown close to Venezuelan Socialist President Hugo Chavez, was overthrown on June 28, the day he held a popular consultation to prepare for his re-election, against the advice of the Supreme Court, the army and Congress.
He had been exiled in Costa Rica, but had returned unexpectedly on September 21 and had taken refuge in the Brazilian embassy.
If he is released, he will be arrested and charged with "high treason", according to the coup government.
The coup leader Roberto Micheletti managed to organize a presidential election on November 29 to replace Mr. Zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo was elected in a controversial election recognized by the United States but contested by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil.
Three days later, Congress voted overwhelmingly against Mr. Zelaya's return to power until his term ends on January 27.
Wall Street rises, US trade balance fuels optimism
The New York Stock Exchange ended up higher on Thursday, with US trade balance figures showing a recovery in both US and US trading partners' activity: the Dow Jones gained 0.67 percent and the Nasdaq 0.33 percent.
According to the final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 68.78 points to 10.405.83 points, and the technology-dominated Nasdaq rose 7.13 points to 2.190.06 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500 index was up 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1.102.35 points.
Good news is coming from different parts of the economy, said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
But this is anecdotal, she said, believing the market was focused on "the glass half full".
Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners said investors were mainly focused on the US trade balance figures, "which show that business is improving in the fourth quarter".
The US trade deficit fell in October by 7.6% compared with September to $32.9 billion.
Analysts were expecting a widening deficit.
Both imports and exports have increased.
The big news is that the growth in trade volumes, especially for goods exports, reflects the growth in the economies of the United States' main trading partners, said Christopher Cornell of research firm Economy.com.
In contrast, new unemployment registrations in the United States rose unexpectedly last week to 474,000.
But over the past four weeks, the average number of new job seekers "has fallen to its lowest level in a year", noted Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market has fallen.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 3.482% from 3.423% on Tuesday evening and the yield on the 30-year Treasury note to 4.492% from 4.408% the day before.
Cuba: Hundreds of supporters of the government consume the "Ladies in White"
A few hundred supporters of the Cuban government on Thursday raped the wives of political prisoners who were gathering in Havana for World Human Rights Day, and prevented another demonstration for which a dozen dissidents were arrested.
Some 40 "Ladies in White", wives or relatives of political prisoners, were burned alive in the streets by supporters of Raul Castro's government as they marched towards the center of the capital to demand the release of political prisoners, an AFP reporter reported.
Down with the Yankees! "Mercenaries!" "The street belongs to the revolutionaries!" "Long live Fidel and Raul!"
The latter were escorted by plainclothes officers who came "to ensure their protection".
A similar demonstration against the "Ladies in White" in Havana had taken place the day before, with no injuries or arrests.
But in the Vedado district of Havana, about a dozen dissidents who were also preparing to march on Thursday for International Human Rights Day were stopped by plainclothes police, an AFP reporter reported.
The police forced the dissidents into civilian vehicles, which were then blown up by government supporters, the journalist said.
The arrests of dissidents in similar circumstances usually last only a few hours.
The Ladies in White, who won the European Parliament's 2005 Sakharov Prize, had organized an unauthorized march to "demand the release of all political prisoners", numbering 200 according to dissent, said one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband Hector Maceda is serving a 20-year prison sentence.
Mr Maceda is one of 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, 53 of whom remain in custody.
The Cuban authorities consider the opponents to be "mercenaries" or "agents" for their declared enemy, the United States.
In a rare occurrence, Cuban television reported on Thursday's demonstration by pro-government activists against "counter-revolutionaries".
Cuba, ruled by a single party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European and American NGOs of violating rights and freedoms, including freedom of expression.
A maniac kills an 80-year-old man with a knife and leaves five injured in Clichy-la-Garenne
A man with two knives killed an 80-year-old man and injured five others in the city centre of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine) at rush hour late on Thursday.
According to the initial evidence of the investigation, the 28-year-old attacker allegedly struck with two knives and for undetermined reasons, an octogenarian, in or outside a pharmacy at 85 Boulevard Jean-Jaurès, police sources and witnesses have been told.
The old man, born in 1929, according to an official of the Alliance police union, died in hospital from his injuries.
He then attacked a couple in or near the same pharmacy, whose wife was pregnant.
The husband, in his 30's, intervened and was injured.
The first two victims, who were seriously injured, were taken to hospital where the octogenarian died.
The other victim's life is in danger, with vital organs apparently affected, police sources say.
The pregnant woman then became unwell and was reportedly hospitalized "in shock", according to a police source.
The gunman, who appeared to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, then fled to the street, still Jean Jaurès Boulevard.
He is said to have injured two passersby, apparently by accident - a man in his 30s and a man in his 40s, the latter seriously.
The script was still confusing in the evening.
He was armed with two butcher knives that he carried crossed behind his back, explained a union official in the Alliance in the Hauts-de-Seine, Arnaud Pressé.
Several passersby, including young people, according to reports gathered by AFP, tried to control the madman.
I saw a guy in his 30s in a green jacket.
Three young men tried to intercept him.
They were unable to do so because the man was large, said Alberto, a waiter at a nearby bar.
He said a mob attacked him, including a municipal policeman who broke his wrist.
Still on Jean-Jaurès Boulevard, at the height of No. 61, two municipal police officers, including their manager, tried to intercept the gunman and were wounded by punches, according to police sources.
The incident took place in one of the main streets of Clichy-la-Garenne, where many shops are located.
Passersby came to tell me that there was an injured person outside.
I went out, saw a 70-year-old man on the ground, put him in a safe position, and saw a very large wound on his abdomen, said Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist.
Five minutes later, a second man in his 30s arrived, stabbed.
The man without papers was arrested by the National Police.
The Nanterre public prosecutor's office referred the case to the departmental police department of the Hauts-de-Seine (SDPJ 92).
The maniac was hospitalized Thursday night.
He had not yet been heard in custody.
A police source has not ruled out that he may be in a psychiatric hospital.
According to another police source, it took six officers to contain him at the Clichy police station where he was taken.
He was "in a state of hyperaccusation" like "all the madmen of this species whose strength is tenfold increased by the action".
US: Polanski's lawyer again calls for dropping the case
The lawyer for Franco-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski called again on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, West of the United States) for the abandonment of the prosecution against his client, currently under house arrest in Switzerland for a more than 30-year-old case of immorality.
Chad Hummel, the lawyer for the director of "The Pianist", testified before three judges in the California Second District Court of Appeal about gross procedural errors at the time of the events in 1977.
I call for the charges to be dropped here and now, Hummel said, adding that the behaviour of the judge in charge at the time, Laurence Rittenband, was "cold in the back".
According to him, Judge Rittenband -- who has since died -- would have discussed, before handing down his sentence, with a prosecutor who would have told him that Roman Polanski deserved to go to prison -- which is a serious procedural error.
This discussion was revealed in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired", from the mouth of the prosecutor in question, David Wells.
But Mr. Wells finally admitted in late September that he had "lied" to the documentary's author.
In the event that the court refused to dismiss the case, Mr. Hummel requested a trial, which would allow him to present the evidence of his case.
The prosecution, for its part, reiterated the argument already developed at first instance, namely that no dropping of charges could be seriously investigated until Roman Polanski appeared in court.
The 76-year-old filmmaker fled the United States in 1978 before his sentence was handed down for "illegal sexual relations" with a 13-year-old girl.
He never set foot in the States again.
Assistant Los Angeles County Prosecutor Phyllis Asayama said that Roman Polanski "must be here to appear at the hearing".
In this case, is the message being sent, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other defendants, that it is possible to escape?
She says the filmmaker "asks the court for a favor, while disregarding its authority".
One of the three judges - who now have 90 days to render a ruling - also pointed out "that there were other alternatives to escape".
Mr. Hummel was not the only one to ask for the Roman Polanski case to be dropped.
The lawyer for the victim, Samantha Geimer, has also called once again for the prosecution to be terminated.
Reminding her client that she could no longer bear to be harassed at every twist in the Polanski case, she added: "No one in this room can say that the proceedings were fair.
Thirty-two years is enough".
Roman Polanski was arrested on September 26 in Switzerland on a US warrant.
After more than two months behind bars, he was placed under house arrest in his cottage in Gstaad, awaiting extradition.
Wall Street ends up with no direction, held back by the rising dollar
The New York Stock Exchange ended without direction on Friday, in a market torn between better-than-expected indicators in the United States and the rise of the dollar: the Dow Jones gained 0.63%, but the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 65.67 points to 10.471.50 points, while the technology-dominant Nasdaq dropped 0.55 points to 2.190.31 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500 index increased by 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1.106.41 points.
To be honest, the market is very quiet, said Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
It is still within narrow margins, the volume of trade has become very low and I think that will remain so until the end of the year.
The trend was supported by the release of better-than-expected economic indicators, which "helped improve market opinion about the strength of the economic recovery", Charles Schwab analysts summed up.
In the United States, retail sales rose by 1.3% in November for the second month in a row and far more than expected.
US consumer confidence also recovered significantly in December, to 73.4 from 67.4 in the previous month, according to the preliminary estimate of the University of Michigan's index.
However, the indices were held back by a further rise in the dollar to its highest level in two months against the euro, which is "pushing down sectors sensitive to economic conditions", said Owen Fitzpatrick of Deutsche Bank.
The technological values have thus lost ground.
The bond market has fallen.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 3,540% from 3,482% on Wednesday evening and the yield on the 30-year Treasury note to 4,497% from 4,492% the day before.
Miss World election again in South Africa
After a month of traveling across South Africa, the 112 contestants for the Miss World title are set to cross the final straight line on Saturday to realize their dream: to be voted the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion television viewers.
At this major beauty pageant held for the second year running in the Johannesburg area, five of them have already won their tickets to the semi-finals.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma from Canada were crowned Miss Sport or Miss Top Model during their time in Africa.
It was a real whirlwind.
Visiting beautiful cities like Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Town was a wonderful experience.
I have seen and experienced so much!" exclaims Miss Sierra Leone.
The competition, which is being held for the ninth time in South Africa, is broadcast live on Saturday from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, starting at 17:00 (15:00 GMT).
I could not have dreamed of a better country to return my crown.
This experience was fascinating.
I am glad I have been twice", says Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the southern summer.
For the young Russian, her second visit to South Africa was marked by many exchanges with the candidates and the rediscovery of "the breathtaking landscapes in this country".
After a month of gala, rehearsals, press conferences and safari, the Miss Universe is now focused on the competition.
Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to follow in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, who was elected in 2000 and is running for office, and Aishwarya Rai in 1994, both of whom became Bollywood stars.
It's every woman's dream to be crowned the most beautiful woman in the world, but it's not just about looks.
We are ambassadors of our countries and I want to go home with the crown, Miss India says with a big smile.
According to the organizers, music and dance will punctuate this 59th edition.
The candidates will be marching in traditional costumes and, of course, swimsuits.
The show will be hosted by Chinese TV presenter Angela Chow, former South African beauty queen Michelle McLean and Miss World committee head Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it can welcome the world with a warmth and pride that is hard to match, says Julia Morley, president of Miss World.
The candidates, like last year, went on safari, visited the famous township of Soweto, but this time on a bike, and tasted the local cuisine.
In an exceptional way, they also met with South African President Jacob Zuma who shook their hand.
Not unusual for a head of state, Miss Sierra Leone notes.
Perhaps their best memory will be the draw in Cape Town (southwest) for the World Cup in June 2010, a way for the country to promote the event a little more.
I've been hanging out with people I never thought I could be close to.
I will definitely be back for the 2010 World Cup, says Miss Italy Alice Taticchi.
Johnny Hallyday's news is "very positive", according to his son David
Johnny Hallyday's news is "very positive", his son David said on Friday as he arrived at Los Angeles airport to see his father, who had been hospitalized for several days.
The news is very positive.
He is very strong, he is doing very well, David Hallyday told reporters as he stepped off the plane from Paris shortly after 1pm local time (21am GMT).
The singer's son, who seems relaxed, said he would go "very quickly" to Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted on Monday for an infection following a herniated disc operation on November 26 in Paris.
The singer was "put into a medically induced coma last night in Los Angeles for comfort, to prevent him from suffering and to administer his treatment", the press service said.
Johnny Hallyday had previously been placed in an artificial coma by doctors at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, where he was admitted on Monday for an infection following a herniated disc operation on November 26 in Paris.
The singer had to undergo a second operation on the night of Wednesday to Thursday because of the extensive injuries resulting from the operation.
His wife Laeticia went to the French high school in Los Angeles where their daughter Jade is studying on Friday morning to attend a school performance, an AFP photographer said.
The head of orthopedic and trauma surgery at the Pitié-Salpêtrière hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that he would visit the singer in Los Angeles on Monday.
The producer has violently implicated Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated on the singer on November 26 at the International Clinic of the Monceau Park in Paris.
We were told it was a massacre.
The surgeons in Los Angeles said they were outraged, Mr. Camus said.
I heard about a possible legal proceeding coming up, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus felt that Johnny Hallyday had "gone far too quickly to Los Angeles, with the permission of the Parisian surgeon".
I had this doctor in person online who assured me that there was no problem with this trip and that was amazing, given that I myself had two herniated discs, he added.
He had earlier reported on RTL that the singer had apparently "gone without a drain, without anything", after his Paris operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the art world.
He had operated on actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before her death, at a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine where he was practising at the time.
In 2007, he also operated on actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to repair a hematoma from a brain hemorrhage.
But he is also a notorious sulphurous doctor, convicted several times in court of medical liability cases, as well as tax evasion and fraud.
Olivier Metzner, the lawyer for the Order of Physicians, accused him of being "a man without scruples" who was "regularly" prosecuted by the Council of the Order, and who was "far from commendable".
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux spoke Friday through his lawyer, Mr. David Koubbi.
He said the procedure had gone "perfectly well" and that the post-operative examinations were "normal".
The operation "was not hemorrhagic and therefore did not require a drain", he added.
In any case, the singer's tour, whose health problems have been increasing since the summer, seems to be in between.
Obviously, a resumption of the tour on January 8 as planned seems very short, said Mr. Camus.
The UDF Association raises its voice and asks the New Centre to stop using its acronym
The UDF association, controlled by François Bayrou's MoDem, reacted on Friday to the attempt of the OPA of the president of the New Centre, Hervé Morin, on the signet of the former Giscardian party, by notifying him not to use it on any medium, or face legal prosecution.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to reclaim the UDF acronym, judging that François Bayrou did not deserve to defend his political legacy after reaching out to the left.
The Minister of Defence, whose party is a partner of the UMP, had planned to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
To support his approach, he received the support of the MP Hervé de Charette (ex-UMP formerly in the NC) who claims ownership of the UDF trademark for having been the first to register it in 2004 at the National Institute of Industrial Property.
But on Friday evening, the office of the UDF association, controlled by the friends of François Bayrou who do not want to be dispossessed, broke its silence to issue a notice to the minister and the member, ordering them to stop using the acronym and to transfer the ownership of the brand to them, or face legal action.
You have made many statements in recent days that you would propose to your political movement to 're-take' the UDF acronym, the association wrote in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the bureau, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez of the MoDem, as well as Senator Jean Arthuis of the centrist Alliance.
You also thought it good to post on your activist materials and on the front page of your website the name of this movement, the +New Centre+, the slogan +today's UDF+, the letter's signatories also note.
As you know, you have no right to use this symbol, the UDF office explains, which notifies the NC to remove "immediately the mention of the UDF name from all media and (its) website".
It also asks Hervé de Charette 'to transfer ownership of the mark to its rightful owners'.
If you do not, courts will be called to enforce the law and the legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories warn.
In their letter, they state that the UDF "has been a political movement in its own right since 1978" and recall that Mr Morin and his friends "made the choice" to leave in 2007 "to create a competing movement, as others did in 2002, to create the UMP".
The New Centre therefore has no right to use the UDF (Union for French Democracy) symbol.
They also recall that the last UDF congress voted in 2007 to join the MoDem for three years and to create an office to defend "the material and moral interests" of the formation founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the office continues, "when he registered the mark", he was "no longer a member of the UDF for three years", but of the UMP.
It is scandalously and fraudulently taking advantage of the lack of a filing of the acronym UDF to do so on its own account.
This indiscretion is becoming a crime, they denounce, before mocking the NC's strategy: "We think that in politics, as in life, it is more dignified to make a name for yourself than to try to escape anonymity by fraudulently taking a name you are not entitled to".
The case of Liliane Bettencourt: François-Marie Banier will be tried for abuse of power
The court in Nanterre decided on Friday to try the artist François-Marie Banier to determine whether, as the daughter of billionaire Liliane Bettencourt accused him, he took advantage of a state of weakness of the octogenarian to rob her of part of her fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his photos of celebrities, will be tried on April 15 and 16 for abuse of power, a crime punishable by a maximum of three years in prison and a fine of 375,000 euros.
This decision means that there will be a trial in this saga-worthy case of one of the richest families in France, in which mother and daughter tear each other apart while holding the reins of the L'Oréal cosmetics empire.
But the 15th Correctional Chamber also ordered that a medical examination of 87-year-old Liliane Bettencourt should be conducted by three doctors in a collegial manner.
The heir and main shareholder of L'Oréal has always refused to submit to such an examination, at least not under the conditions proposed by the Nanterre prosecutor's office during the investigation.
The doctors appointed on Friday will have to submit a report by March 10, 2010, stating in particular whether Liliane Bettencourt may have been in a state of weakness and at what times.
I think she'll submit to it.
I will speak to her about it, said Ms Bettencourt's lawyer, Mr Georges Kiejman, after the hearing.
The Court of Justice has ruled that the Commission has failed to fulfil its obligations under Article 85 (1) of the Treaty.
This is excellent news... The expert will show that he (Mr. Banier) manipulated this elderly lady who must be protected, he said.
For the past two years, Liliane Bettencourt's only daughter has been bringing criminal proceedings against François-Marie Banier, a photographer and artist who is a master of everything, accusing him of taking advantage of his mother's weakness for years to obtain a billion euros in donations, in the form of cheques, life insurance contracts or master paintings.
Liliane Bettencourt, for her part, has always denied being manipulated by the photographer, whom she considers a longtime friend.
While the court was expected to consider the admissibility of the action brought by Ms Bettencourt-Meyers, the lawyers' pleadings sometimes turned to the big family unwrap on Friday.
Thus, Liliane Bettencourt's lawyer referred to three letters sent by her client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to her notary, in which she said she distrusted Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers' husband.
In the letter dated 2003, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer: "Could you explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier once, twice a day for fifteen years.
Françoise, I haven't been able to talk to her since her marriage".
The Nanterre public prosecutor's office again considered that the complainant was not eligible to act, especially since a guardianship judge had in recent days refused to grant her request to initiate legal protection proceedings for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt 'has full legal capacity, is not under protection and has no guardian.
No one else has to act for him", said Public Prosecutor Marie-Chrisitine Daubigney.
The court finally decided that it would rule once the trial had taken place on the admissibility of Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers.
Is this a management revolution or the end of economic intelligence?
If nothing changes in the governance of the big French companies, our fight for the development of economic intelligence will have been in vain...
For more than a decade, the attitude of the management of large companies towards their employees has been reminiscent of the position of companies towards consumers before the marketing revolution: it is a question of getting employees to adhere to "values" determined from above, as it was in the past, of imposing on consumers products designed by the factory technicians.
By putting the customer at the heart of the business, the marketing revolution has put market-conquering strategies back in place... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products disconnected from customer preference factors is recurring!
A demobilization of employees can lead to a deadly demoralization.
The suicides at France Telecom, PSA and Renault are only the emerging part of a much broader phenomenon which affects managers in particular.
This demobilization seriously undermines the development of all the intellectual functions of the enterprise, particularly R & D and, even more, economic intelligence.
Indeed, the EI "requires from all stakeholders (...) a proactive approach and a forward-looking vision"; it requires a commitment on the part of employees that is totally counter to the rewards of authoritarian management.
This is why we call for a managerial revolution that puts employees at the centre of the company's concerns as much as the customer.
The relative usefulness of internal opinion polls
Will internal opinion surveys - such as the questionnaire submitted by Orange to its employees - lead to this revolution in management practices?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not. I'm not going to.
- Firstly, because I have seen that, when faced with a new situation, any structure eventually, after many detours, comes to make priority of what it has always done.
- Secondly, because authoritarianism - one of the pathologies of power - grows in proportion to the importance of its own failures.
- Well, because most leaders have a simplistic view of human behavior.
They come from the great engineering schools, they have a mechanistic interpretation of psychology.
They adopt, for their own intellectual comfort, the old behavioural theory, recently revived by US "neuroscience" and widely circulated, unbeknownst to them, by academic institutions and the media.
Thus, by suggesting that it is possible to use the "levers" (sic) of executive engagement, a recent Ipsos survey published in Le Figaro.fr is reinforcing leaders in a posture of mechanistic governance, which is not suited to today's world.
Identify and measure mobilizing factors
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the smooth running of modern enterprises requires a finalist view of human behaviour.
It consists in integrating a fundamental observation into all governance thinking and practice: for employees, commitment to the company is only possible if it is clearly seen as a means of achieving part of their dreams, ambitions and projects.
Currently, only studies from Functional Motive Analysis adopt this view of employee motivation.
These studies have shown that they judge their company on the basis of a predetermined doxa which allows them, through their perceived image of the company, to evaluate what it offers them to realise their life plans.
By identifying and measuring these motivators, business leaders can monitor, forecast and anticipate their 'social performance' and put their human resource management back in place.
They thus create a favourable environment for the concerted development of robust and efficient economic intelligence.
Oslo speech: "Just war" deserves praise from the right to Obama
The American right on Friday welcomed Barack Obama's speech in Oslo the day before, satisfied that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize had defended the concept of "just war" against America's enemies.
Conservatives, who had been eager to give the award to Obama on October 9, applauded the presidential address this time, as did Sarah Palin, a former vice presidential candidate in the 2008 election.
I liked what he said, said Palin, a right-wing Republican, to USA Today, adding that she herself had addressed the "sometimes necessary" theme of war in her recently published memoirs.
War is of course the last thing in my opinion the Americans want to have to do, but it is necessary.
She felt that these terrorists should be stopped right there.
Mr Obama, who inherited his predecessor George W Bush's two wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, was busy in Oslo on Thursday justifying the use of force, a way of explaining his decision to send 30,000 additional troops to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another opponent of Mr. Obama, Newt Gingrich, said the president had done "a very good job" in Oslo.
I thought the speech was really very good, said the former speaker of the House of Representatives, who particularly appreciated the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential address.
"I found this speech to be historic in some ways", Gingrich said in an interview on the radio program "The Takeaway".
The former elected official, considered by some as a possible candidate for the Republican nomination for the 2012 presidential election, said he was pleased to see "a leftist president" remind the Nobel Committee members "that they would not be free and could not give a peace prize if there was no use of force".
Michael Gerson, former George W. Bush correspondent turned columnist for the Washington Post, said Obama delivered "a very American speech".
In addition to presenting himself as a 'citizen of the world' as he 'always does', 'he spoke like an American president', reminding Europeans 'that they are living in a security bubble that they did not create and that they are not doing much to preserve it', Gerson said.
One of the few on the right who was not convinced, a Bush-era hawk, former UN ambassador John Bolton, called the speech "shallow, blunt and uninspired" on the National Review Online website.
To the left of the president, Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich was alarmed to see Barack Obama justify the use of force.
When war is wrapped up in the notion of justice, it is easy to justify the slaughter of innocents, he warned.
The centre-left press, however, remained highly critical of the president.
The Los Angeles Times, while continuing to believe that the Nobel Prize was awarded prematurely to Mr. Obama, called his speech "overproduced" even for a speaker known for his talent.
The Oslo speech "should serve as a road map for international decisions against conflict, poverty and oppression", the California newspaper reported.
Obama "made the right speech", said The New York Times, calling it "both dark and uplifting".
Road workers: three marathons for a deal to save Christmas supplies
After three marathon negotiations, the road trade unions and TLF, the only employers' organisation to stay on, reached an agreement on Friday evening that ends the strike and threat to Christmas supplies.
At the signing ceremony on Friday evening, the Secretary of State for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, "rejoiced" at the agreement, after several sessions of negotiations, which began on Wednesday morning.
After a second night of talks, the negotiators left early Friday morning, hoping to sign the text of the agreement soon by the end of the morning.
This was despite the fact that three employers' organisations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) had shut the door.
But it took more than six hours of a meeting that started at 11 a.m. for everyone to agree and at 6 p.m. the text was signed.
The conflict "would have been very damaging to business" and "there was a fear that it would disrupt the holiday season", Bussereau said.
The text provides for a 4% wage increase for the lowest wages (in local and regional road transport) and a 2.9% increase for the highest (in international transport).
In hourly rates, for low-wage workers, "the rate goes from 8.72 euros to 9.06 euros.
It is not much, but we are going a long way", said Patrice Clos (FO).
Either we give the order to our activists that there will be no blockades, no blockades of the supply centres.
But there can always be some recalcitrant people who are not happy, he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of TLF, welcomed "a good agreement", although it was "difficult to concede the increases on high wages given the international competition".
He said the increases would be in the region of 170 euros per month for the lowest salaries and 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
The agreement is a common sense and respect for employees, said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) hailed "a historic agreement".
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to ionising radiation.
The agreement also provides for a 3% increase in travel costs and a general road transport survey in the first half of 2010, which will allow in particular to address the issue of a 13th month and a modernisation of the collective agreement.
Mr Bussereau recalled that "a reduction of €100 million in employer costs" was the subject of a government amendment to the amending Finance Bill for 2009, which was voted on Thursday night by the National Assembly.
The government will ask the Senate to vote on it "in identical terms".
The signing of the TLF makes it possible for the agreement to apply first to the enterprises which are members of this organisation and then to the whole profession, if extended by the Minister for Labour.
It will be done "as soon as possible", Mr Bussereau said.
The opposition of employers' organizations can only delay the process.
The FNTR denounced a "deceived market" because the €100 million "had already been promised to the sector to offset part of the carbon tax".
The Secretary of State for Transport has forced us to negotiate in a hurry, not as a result of a shared analysis, but to avoid upsetting the turkey eaters of the coming New Year, UNOSTRAS deplored.
The agreement risks "digging the grave of a very large number of SMEs in the sector in the next 12 months".
RER A: disruptions this weekend, unions unhappy with RATP proposals
The disruptions on the RER A, France's largest urban public transport line, will continue over the weekend, as a meeting on Friday on the second day of the strike between unions and RATP management left them starving for their bonus demand.
On Saturday and Sunday, during this important shopping weekend before Christmas, there will be trains only between 10am and 8pm, with one in two trains on the central section (between La Défense and Nation) and one in four trains outside the central section.
The interconnection with the SNCF will be suspended in Nanterre Prefecture, which will force travellers to change trains.
The Galeries Lafayette, which receive 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "RATP is making an effort to serve department stores".
The RER A runs through it from the west, the Paris metropolitan area.
The RATP section runs from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one in two trains ran during rush hour, and almost no trains during off-peak hours, as planned.
As on Thursday, there was no crowds on the docks, as the Franciscans organized.
In the early morning, the station in Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less crowded than usual, especially because of the absence of middle and high school students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger, Val-de-Marne, Jack Nbakina, a 29-year-old engineer, said he got up "an hour and a half earlier to be sure of arriving on time".
The train station in Saint-Lazare was not crowded, said the SNCF, which had planned to have police officers and security forces on duty.
The RER A operated by the SNCF from or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or departed from Saint-Lazare station to join the metros.
New general meetings of strikers will be held on Saturday and Sunday, which will consider the results, deemed "lean" by the unions, of a meeting with management on Friday afternoon.
The RER Director proposes to negotiate a specific protocol for RER A on all aspects, working time, career development etc.
This is not what drivers want, they want a premium, according to Thierry Garon (South).
The RATP even puts its bonus proposals in parentheses, the CGT was indignant, pointing out that the management "was not flawed to solve a problem while in the trucks and the SNCF it is done".
A new meeting is scheduled for Monday for "a wider review of the conditions for the exercise of the profession", RATP said.
This also led the unions to say that the company was "mocking weekend users".
By the morning, some 150 drivers had invaded a drafting committee at the headquarters in Paris.
The management, who had previously refused to discuss the strike, suggested the meeting "as a way of appeasing the situation".
The conflict threatens to spread to RER B on Tuesday, after the filing of a notice by Unsa and Indépendants.
The unions are demanding a bonus of 120 euros (Unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud, Independents) and complain about the deterioration of working conditions on this line to the million daily passengers.
RER drivers, all in the second half of their career, receive between EUR 2,200 and EUR 2,700 gross plus EUR 600 and EUR 650 in bonuses for shiftwork, Sundays and public holidays.
Turkish court dissolves pro-Kurdish party, decision with heavy consequences
Turkey's constitutional court on Friday declared the dissolution of the country's main pro-Kurdish party, a decision that was immediately followed by angry protests in the Kurdish community in the southeast of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision risks greatly complicating the task of the government, which has just reached out to the Kurdish community in an attempt to end 25 years of conflict.
The Democratic Society Party (DTP) was dissolved because it had become a "focus of activities detrimental to the independence of the state and its indivisible unity", the court president Hasim Kiliç told reporters after four days of deliberations.
The decision was unanimously taken by the 11 judges, while a qualified majority of seven votes was required to pronounce the dissolution, Kiliç said, adding that 37 party cadres, including its chairman Ahmet Türk and MP Aysel Tugluk, are banned from political life for five years.
The judge also announced the lifting of the parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Mr Türk and Mrs Tugluk and the confiscation by the Treasury of the party's assets.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (out of 550).
Its leaders had warned before the verdict that the deputies would leave Parliament rather than sit as unclassified MPs.
The decision follows a 2007 case by the Prosecutor of the Court of Cassation Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, who accused the DTP of following the "directives" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which is considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political showcase of the PKK rebels.
The party, however, claims to have "no organic links" with the PKK but refuses to label it a terrorist organisation and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The Court's ruling comes as the government has just reached out to the Kurdish community with a series of measures to strengthen their rights, in an attempt to curb Kurdish support for the PKK and end the conflict.
DTP leaders had said that a dissolution could lead to a resurgence of tensions in southeastern Anatolia, where numerous protests against the detention conditions of PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan have escalated into clashes with police in recent weeks.
As soon as the justice was announced, a thousand protesters gathered outside the DTP offices in Diyarbakir, the large city in the southeast populated mostly by Kurds.
Police fired tear gas and water cannons, while protesters threw molotov cocktails and rocks with slingshots.
Around 100 people also demonstrated in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Mr Türk said the court's decision would "deepen the despair".
Turkey cannot solve this issue by banning a party, he told reporters.
The government, formed by a party that grew out of the Islamist movement, also deplored the decision.
We are opposed to the closure of parties.
This does not solve anything, said Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
This decision is a total torpedo of the democratic opening launched by the government, commented political analyst Ahmet Insel.
He said that a reaction from the PKK was to be expected.
On Thursday, the PKK claimed responsibility for an attack that killed seven soldiers three days earlier in northern Turkey, one of the deadliest in recent months.
The first snow may fall
What Wolfgang Brauburger wants is a very harsh winter.
But the head of the road clearance and sanding service (FES) says it is not to bother the citizens.
It's simply so the officers can test the vehicles' technique and learn how to control them properly.
And according to the weatherman, it could be this weekend.
Over 300 officers and 120 vehicles are standing by to deal with the snow and ice.
The ESF has a very elaborate plan.
Mr Brauburger explains that as soon as it starts to snow in Frankfurt and temperatures drop below freezing, large sandblasting vehicles run along 20 main routes (called routes A).
This includes busy streets, major arteries, such as the Neue Weg and Hanauer Landstraße.
Also included are fire accesses, public transport routes, pedestrian areas and sloping streets such as Atzelbergstraße.
ESF officers start their shift at three in the morning.
If necessary, the 1,040 kilometres of road must be salted with a road sealant that adheres well, in a maximum of three hours.
This is why the ESF service starts at 3am "so that the roads are clear when the daily migration traffic starts".
That's when it gets harder, when the snow starts to fall at 7:30 in the morning.
This poses problems, says the head of the road-cleaning and sand-picking department, "because no motorist is willing to let the salt-picking vehicles pass".
Then, if the snow is gone, we take care of the access roads and the service roads - like the Rat-Beil-Straße.
The back lanes and side streets come last.
Mr Brauburger knows that this always raises some complaints.
At five o'clock in the morning, the FES's foot team sets out to clear the areas and crossings deemed dangerous as a priority.
The ESF services are generally unable to deal with cycle paths.
Mr Brauburger said that there is a special service in Frankfurt which monitors the condition of the bridges between 10pm and 4.30am.
Since ice forms very quickly on these surfaces, salting vehicles are used as soon as the temperature drops below 2 degrees.
The police also sometimes use this special service when needed.
The birthplace of the dinosaurs
Tawa hallae was similar to other carnivorous dinosaurs: this biped was about 6 feet (2.0 m) long and 5 feet (1.5 m) high, had powerful hind limbs, an elongated skull with sharp, curved teeth, short arms terminated by sickle-like claws, and a long tail.
If this species had lived a few million years later, it would have had nothing out of the ordinary.
But as Sertling Nesbitt of the University of Texas at Austin and his colleagues report in Thursday's Science magazine, the Tawa hallae is one of the first dinosaurs to exhibit these morphological features.
This animal lived 215 million years ago in New Mexico, which was then part of the landmass of the supercontinent Pangea and was located near the equator.
Sertling Nesbitt says the Tawa discovery sheds new light on the evolution of the first dinosaurs.
It tells us about the relationships, distribution, and characteristics of the relatives.
It was in 2006 that Sertling Nesbitt and other paleontologists undertook excavations at the Gohst Ranch site in northern New Mexico.
Randall Irmis of the Utah Museum of Natural History and a member of the excavation team says that they sometimes found a dozen bones in a day, which is absolutely unique for a sedimentary layer from the Triassic.
Scientists quickly realized that some of these bones belonged to a new species.
The excavations have brought up the remains of five specimens.
A discovery that confirms theories about the beginning of dinosaur evolution.
The researchers named it Tawa after the Hopi Indian word for the sun god.
Sterling Nesbitt said it was a remarkable discovery. Dinosaur fossils from the Triassic are extremely rare and contain only a few incomplete bone fragments.
Not all paleontologists share this enthusiasm.
For example, Martin Sander of the University of Bonn does not consider this discovery to be particularly spectacular, but he does say that it confirms certain theories about the early evolution of dinosaurs.
According to current knowledge, dinosaurs appeared on Earth about 230 million years ago.
Most of the oldest fossils, however, are fragmented and incomplete, making it very difficult to classify the very first dinosaurs.
The experts are wondering, for example, when the saurians split into three major evolutionary groups: the theropods (carnivores), which include the tyrannosaur and the later velociraptor, from which the birds descended; the sauropods, long-necked quadrupeds, and their relatives; and the ornithischian herbivores, which include species such as the triceratops and the stegosaur.
According to the studies of S. Nesbitt and his colleagues, the Tawa is one of the earliest theropods.
This species has an interesting mix of primitive and developed features, says S. Nesbitt.
Researchers have found evidence suggesting that the Tawa hallae had small air sacs in its skull bones, just as birds descended from theropods do.
These small air pockets make it easier for birds to breathe than mammals.
It seems that in the Tawa hallae, the vertebrae were also partially filled with air.
According to Randall Irmis, the Tawa is one of the oldest theropods with tiny air sacs in its bones.
Since the related lineage of the giant sauropods also had air sacs and a light bone, it may be thought that their common ancestor already possessed this beneficial innovation.
Three successive waves of migration to North America.
Since the earliest known dinosaurs lived in South America, researchers have concluded that the dinosaurs originated there.
So the three major evolutionary lines split and spread from South America to the rest of the world, which is all the land that formed the supercontinent Pangea.
This seems to be confirmed by the fact that the team of paleontologists also discovered the remains of two other theropods that are not particularly related to it.
The three species cannot descend from a common ancestor who migrated, say the researchers.
Alan Turner of the Natural History Museum in New York and co-author of the journal Science Studies says there were at least three waves of migration to North America.
There are of course some contradictions.
Martin Sander, a paleontologist in Bonn, says that there is an even older species, the silsaurus, that lived in what is now Poland and that it belongs to a group related to the dinosaurs.
He said this could give the wrong impression because there are a large number of dinosaur fossils in South America that have been preserved, while there are almost none on other continents.
However, how dinosaurs managed to become the dominant tetrapods of the Second Age from a relatively rare collateral line of the reptile branch remains a mystery to this day.
In the Triassic, dinosaurs shared habitat with many other reptiles, such as the ancestors of today's crocodiles and many other saurians.
Towards the end of the Triassic, dinosaurs spread across the planet, fostering the development of many new species while others, related to them, disappeared between the Triassic and Jurassic.
Such success, however, is not permanent.
To explain this transformation, Martin Sander sees two hypotheses.
There may have been a mass extinction in which dinosaurs survived randomly while other reptiles would have gone extinct.
Or maybe dinosaurs were better adapted and so they could eliminate competition on the field.
In any case, such success is not permanent.
150 million years later, a meteorite crash helped to bring about the flourishing of a group of animals that had also developed during the Triassic and had since been largely forgotten: mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and there are signatures from all over the world.
There are those of professors at the University of Toronto, the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna or Berkeley, California.
There are those of lecturers from the Universities of Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin and Bremen.
The police evacuation of the casino at Frankfurt's J.W. Goethe University is making waves around the world.
278 professors and lecturers from the J.W. Goethe University and other higher education institutions in Germany, Europe and North and South America express their solidarity with the protesting students on the Westend Campus.
In a statement written in German and English, they condemned the police intervention called for by the university's management committee.
Last week, the president of the Werner Müller-Estler University ordered the evacuation of the buildings occupied by the striking students and teachers after graffiti was strewn on walls and artworks.
Five students were injured during the evacuation.
The signatories say that the deterioration did not justify "such violent intervention by the police commandos against students and teachers who had organized their own classes".
The evacuation represents an "unacceptable encroachment" on freedom of research and teaching.
Focusing attention exclusively on vandalism only serves to "delegitimize and criminalize protest" and tries to make people forget the reasons for the mobilization.
The University's Governing Committee thus avoided the necessary debates.
The class leaders demand that the criminal proceedings be immediately suspended.
Most of the occupants did not participate in the damage.
Legitimization of the protests
The Verdi youth union in the service sector and the German Trade Union Confederation (DGB) are in solidarity with the students.
The protests are only a legitimate expression of growing concern for our own future, says Alexander Klein, regional youth secretary of the Verdi union.
The Minister for Science of the State of Hesse, Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU), took a strong stance on the action taken by the President of the University and the police.
We thank the president of the university.
Any occupation and degradation of the premises is totally unacceptable, she told the Wiesbaden regional parliament last Thursday on the TV show Aktuelle Stunde.
We understand the meaning of the protests but we do not accept vandalism, said CDU member of the regional parliament Peter Beuth.
The opposition SPD, Greens and Left (die Linke) parliamentary groups did not share this view.
The CSU is using a few painted walls as a pretext to criminalize protests, says Janine Wissler of the Left Party
Instead of considering the students' arguments and demands, they are being evicted.
The Left Party has tabled a motion demanding that the Minister of the Interior submit a report on the conditions of the police intervention.
The new  Silicon Valley 
For a long time it was known as a secret city, forbidden to Western visitors.
Zelenograd, one of the ten districts of Moscow, was a secret research centre for weapons under strict surveillance during the Soviet regime.
Today, with 216,000 inhabitants, the town is 37 km from the centre of Moscow and has the reputation of being the Soviet Silicon Valley.
It is home to important micro- and nanoelectronics production and research facilities.
As early as September 2008, representatives from Zelenograd established links with Riedberg, the Frankfurt Science Centre  with the university institutes and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were reciprocal meetings and last Wednesday representatives from Zelenograd and Riedberg ratified a  Protocol of close cooperation .
The signatories were the Deputy Mayor of Moscow Yuri Rosljak and the Prefect Anatoly Smimov of Zelenograd for the Russian delegation, Edwin Schwarz project section head for Frankfurt.
In 2010 representatives of the IFI and SMEs, whose main focus is scientific research, will travel to Zelenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
It is a sustainable scientific exchange.
But also economic relations.
It will allow FIZ companies to enter the rapidly expanding Russian market.
On the other hand, Russian scientific companies are interested in obtaining contracts in Germany.
Zelenograd is the seat of famous Soviet research institutes and societies.
The Moscow Institute of Electrical Engineering, the large firms Sitronics and Rosssijskaja-Elektronika are located here.
The municipality was founded in 1958 as a "planned socialist city" for arms research.
Zelenograd (literal translation  Green City ) takes its name from the wooded hills in the heart of which the research centres are located.
The S21 project: a brake on Stuttgart
The scale of the Stuttgart 21 project cannot be overstated.
For its supporters it is nothing less than  the new heart of Europe .
S21 is much more than the burial of a railway station, more than a colossal construction project that will plunge the heart of the capital of Baden-Württemberg into a hopeless chaos of construction for a decade.
Stuttgart 21 was born out of the spirit of the 1980s.
The mainline stations, with tracks ending in the city, were reputed at the time to be relics of 19th century transportation technology that served as a brake clog for modern rail traffic because it once took a long time to move the locomotives from the rear to the front.
Arrival, short stop, departure  that's what you do.
That is why the mainline stations must disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart too: a railway station, which is located about halfway along the Trans-European Railway Main Line between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava, hence the slogan "heart of Europe".
The implementation of the S21 project is really about to begin, although the visions of the 1980s have long since become out of step with reality.
Even the most ambitious planners recognized that the cost of burying the station in the respective capitals of Hesse and Bavaria was exorbitant.
In fact, the headline stations no longer really pose any problems of entry and exit since there are modern, reversible trains with car rails and driver-driven cars at both ends.
However, construction of Stuttgart 21 is now under way alongside the new inter-city line to Ulm.
Regional and local policies have prevailed.
The railway company is a party because it is the taxpayer who bears the costs of the risks of the largest infrastructure project in the Federal Republic and not the public undertaking.
From an urbanist's point of view, this project is relatively well justified.
You get an urban space that, if you believe the computer-generated planners' graphs, will be very green.
For the rail transport system, S21 is bad.
The passenger station and the extension of the section are designed for passenger traffic, which was - as was typical in the 1980s - a huge growth factor.
At that time, there was no competition for cheap flights.
Modern transport policy should focus first on increasing freight traffic because rail transport is much more environmentally friendly than road transport.
But the new track, with its slopes, is not suitable for freight trains.
S21, and this is much more serious, indirectly affects many other railway projects.
For example, six billion euros will be spent on the Swabian project.
That's the official number.
Experts think 10 to 15 billion is more realistic.
One thing is certain, in the next decade, there will be a shortage of money for other junctions and congestion points in the network.
The list of the Ministry of Transport mentions a total of sixty major projects.
One of the most important is the extension of the section through the Rhine valley by 180 kilometres.
Since 1987 this line has been built at a standstill.
It would be very urgent to press the fungus here.
But the S21 project is a bit of a brake.
The Rhine valley route is becoming a bottleneck for international goods traffic, right in the heart of Europe.
The Government reviews the airport judgment
The Land government raised the possibility of appealing the judgment of the Hessian Administrative Court on the ban on night flights at the Wiesbaden Regional Parliament.
The Minister for Economic Affairs Dieter Posch (FDP) announced that the CDU/FDP coalition had commissioned experts to examine the Administrative Court's judgment from a legal point of view, a document which comprises more than 400 pages.
The Kassel court had justified in a written document that the Land should adapt the regulations on the night flight ban if the proposed construction of the north-west runway at Frankfurt Airport were to take place.
The Land government's proposal to allow 17 aircraft to land between 11 and 5 a.m. is not compatible with the legal protection of citizens against nighttime air pollution.
The coalition must decide by January 4 whether to appeal the verdict.
The opposition criticises this time limit and tries to pressure the government representative to appeal to the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
The SPD parliamentary group leader Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel is calling on the CDU and FDP to return to their pre-election pledge to ban night flights, otherwise it will be considered a total breach of promise.
It is very difficult to be allowed to keep your word, said Green leader Tarek Al-Wazir, referring to the FDP's election slogan "We keep our promises".
Minister Dieter Posch refutes Schäfer-Gümbel's claims that the Land government is still trying to allow night flights by using "avocado and rubbish".
It takes time to conduct a thorough legal review.
The coalition does not want to make a decision based on a "quick first impression".
The Commission is also proposing to increase the number of EU-funded projects.
The opposition's interpretation of the statement by its group on the ban on night flights is completely wrong.
US banks pay back the aid
The big American banks, badly affected by the crisis, are breaking off their ties with the state.
Bank of America announced on Wednesday that it had repaid the Treasury in full $45 billion (over 30 billion euros), corresponding to the aid provided under the Tarp rescue plan.
The US television channel CNBC reported in a report that Citigroup was also considering repaying the aid received.
The banking institutions are thus seeking to get rid of the restrictions that were imposed on the acceptance of funds, such as limiting the bonuses awarded to executives and the payment of higher fees.
Bank of America launched a capital increase by selling securities to investors which brought in $19 billion in fresh cash.
The remainder comes from the bank's coffers, which are well stocked by the sale of several branches in other sectors.
Last Wednesday evening, Kenneth Lewis, the CEO of Bank of America, expressed his gratitude to the American taxpayers for the significant capital injection that helped them through a difficult period.
The banking institution had presumed its capabilities by buying the investment bank Merrill Lynch at the height of the financial turmoil.
Citigroup is also planning to raise money on the financial markets to free itself from state supervision.
The US bank could launch a $20 billion capital increase as early as Thursday, CNBC reported, citing banking circles.
A Citigroup spokesman declined to comment on the information.
In June the banks Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had repaid the public funds they had received.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals.
In the end, it all happened faster than I expected.
Barely two weeks after the current editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender was sacked by the ZDF board of directors, a successor has already been appointed.
The committee wanted to vote last night to make the appointment.
Peter Frey, who runs the Berlin edition of ZDF, was the big favourite.
The channel, however, did not want to confirm - officially - the vote so as not to prejudge the procedure.
However, it seems that there was also a desire not to further harm ZDF steward Markus Schächter if the proposal was not accepted by the Board of Directors.
Frey, who is Schächter's candidate, needed the vote of 9 of the 14 Commissioners.
The results of the vote were not yet known at the end of this edition.
Two weeks ago, Schächter proposed to the board of directors a five-year extension of Nikolaus Brender's contract but it was rejected.
Only seven members of the Council voted in favour of Brender's re-election and seven voted against it.
The CDU, which has a majority in the board, had already indicated several weeks before the vote that it did not want Brender back in office.
It was Roland Koch, the Minister-President of the Land of Hesse who had organized a league against the editor.
He had refused to have the highly esteemed editor-in-chief's contract extended, citing the fact that the audience for ZDF news programs had fallen under Brender.
This is why protests were still taking place, almost up to the vote, against the ZDF's growing political influence.
In the end, there were even 35 public law experts who got involved in the debate and who felt that Koch's approach was unconstitutional.
But it didn't help.
Peter Frey: who is he?
Peter Frey was born on 4 August 1957 in Bingen.
He studied political science, pedagogy and Romance languages (Spanish).
He then worked at the Südwestfunk (Rhineland-Palatinate radio organ) and the Frankfurter Rundschau (a German national daily).
In 1983 he became editor at the ZDF, first at the news magazine "heute-journal" (today's newspaper).
He then continued his career: from 1988 to 1990 he was the deputy editor-in-chief of the then; then correspondent in Washington in 1991/1992, then and until 1998 he was head and presenter of the "Morgenmagazins" (bi-monthly news program presented in the morning); until 2001 he was head of the foreign policy department of the ZDF and then head of the Berlin editorial office.
After Brender's disgrace, when he had just been named journalist of the year by the trade magazine Medium Magazine, the Greens announced that they would file a constitutional complaint
Koch's opponent in the Administrative Council, the Minister-President of Rhineland-Palatinate Kurt Beck, said last week that the Länder should transform the ZDF Intergovernmental Treaty so that the steward's staff proposals cannot be blocked by a partisan political majority.
However, Beck does not intend to ask for the removal of political figures from the ZDF supervisory committees.
Peter Frey, Brender's likely successor, had cleverly maneuvered the board by criticizing the board vehemently in its decision to fire Brender.
This proof of journalistic independence enabled Schächter to nominate him for the position of editor without losing face, just as the Board of Directors could elect him without any suspicion that he was appointing a political supporter.
In the arithmetic representations of the parties, Frey is classified as a left-liberal.
A major cleanup in university education
Partial success for students: after a year of educational strike, the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs of the Länder decided to be more conciliatory: at a meeting between the Ministers and the delegates of the Conference of Rectors, an agreement was reached stipulating that the working conditions of Bachelor's and Master's students should be improved.
In the future, students should be able to complete their studies.
In particular, they agreed to reduce the burden of examinations: a single examination should be used to close the chosen study module.
In addition, the workload will have to be reconsidered to ensure "realistic and acceptable proportions".
Political authorities and higher education institutions want to facilitate the recognition of examinations between universities and abroad.
The Länder have also committed to more flexible common structural requirements for Bachelor's and Master's programmes.
At regional level, there must be no different legislation from one Land to another.
Less exams
Since the beginning of the student protests last June, the ministers of education of the Länder and the rectors of universities have been using the buzzword "studiability".
But for the first time, this expression seems to have a concrete meaning.
The Accreditation Council has decided to reduce the number of certain examinations considerably: "Each module should normally be able to be concluded by a single examination", says a thirty-page document on future university admission requirements.
Reinhold Grimm, chairman of the Accreditation Board, says that by significantly reducing the burden of examinations, it should be possible to stop the slippage, which has seriously impaired the readability.
In addition, 'studyable' should be the decisive criterion for the organisation of studies in the future.
Modules and the content must be carefully examined to see if one can avoid the feeling of suffocation that one sometimes feels in choosing courses.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to the latest information on the RAID on Kunduz, the opposition believes that the Minister of Defense Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) is guilty of deliberate deception.
Students should "have the opportunity and the leeway to enable and encourage personal initiative".
The new regulations will cover access to new university degrees but will also be adapted to existing degrees.
These cycles must be 're-accredited' every 5 years, which means, however, that all cycles will not be reviewed until 2015.
There are 10 accreditation agencies in the whole of the Federal Republic of Germany, which are dependent on the accreditation boards set up by the Länder.
In October, the Ministers of Education put some pressure on the Länder to pressure the agencies to ensure that the curricula were not overloaded and the examination system not too strict.
In some Länder, universities and specialist higher education institutions have already agreed with their regional ministries to take appropriate measures.
The Rhineland-Palatinate is the only Land which has so far agreed to provide more resources for the development of the Bologna process.
With these funds, universities must organise tutoring programmes and strengthen the guidance offices, examination offices and international relations department.
The Länder and universities have a budget of 10 million euro for this.
In early 2010, the government intends to table an amendment to the Higher Education Institutions Act in Parliament.
After that, you will only need to pass one exam to complete your studies.
The organisation of studies will have to be more flexible, the recognition of transcripts from other higher education institutions must be guaranteed and access to the Master's degree must be simplified.
By the end of next year, the 'studability' of all university courses will have to be examined.
Last Thursday, the government and the opposition again debated the issue of school conditions in the country.
The decisions were welcomed but criticised.
The Federal President of the Socialist Students' Union said he hoped that in future the organisation of education policy would no longer take place "behind closed doors" of ministers and university rectors.
Students as concerned should be able to express themselves a little later than after the school strike.
The future graduates of higher education were supported by the President of the Rectors' Conference (HRK) delegates Margret Wintermantel: "The experience of students is very useful to us", she said on Thursday at a meeting with the Ministers of Education of the Länder with whom the HRK is working on a joint reform project.
The decision to establish a new system of education and training in the field of education and science is not a good one, but it is a good one.
Andreas Keller, member of the GEW Steering Committee, also calls on the Länder to ensure that today's Bachelor students will have enough places for Master studies tomorrow and that the conditions for study will be as good as possible.
The Länder must therefore hire more teachers.
However, the Ministers of Education did not mention the possibility of easing access to the Master's degree.
More than a footnote on Herta Müller
It is with these words  Arrived in Germany and it is beautiful, almost more control...  that a work by the poet Werner Söllner begins, in which he thematizes in fragments of disturbing sentences the experiences of a dissident who arrived in Germany and gained freedom but at the same time lost his linguistic territory.
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, was first a teacher of German and English in Bucharest and then a collection manager in a youth publishing house before moving to Frankfurt am Main.
Söllner has received various literary prizes; in 1993 he held the coveted Chair of Poetry at Goethe University Frankfurt and since 2002 he has been Director of the Hessian Literature Forum at the Mousonturm artist house in Frankfurt.
He was the subject of much discussion in non-literary circles last Tuesday at a conference in Munich on the theme "German literature in Romania in the mirror and the distorting mirror of your Securitate files".
Visibly unstable and embarrassed, Söllner made a statement in which he admitted to fellow German-Romanian writers such as Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer that he had collaborated as an informant for the Securitate political police.
In 1989 Söllner received the German Language Prize jointly with some of the participants.
The recruitment trials had started in an insidious way in 1971.
I am, concludes Söllner , someone who has not sufficiently resisted the Securitate's attempts to intimidate .
The poet Werner Söllner is the informant Walter (IM Walter).
Almost simultaneously with the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller and her exemplary literary encounters with the mechanisms of dictatorship, the literary scene, and in particular the community of German authors from Romania, was shaken by a case that clearly shows the depths and baseness of a political system based on police surveillance and espionage.
Werner Söllner is, as far as we can tell from current knowledge, not only guilty but also a victim.
In his own Securitate file, IM Walter played a role, assures literature specialist Michael Markel after Söllner's confession and he refers to the positive influence of IM Walter who had interceded on his behalf.
 He was able to get him out of all the difficult situations at the time, according to Markel.
Markel felt the moral urge to make this comment.
The form in which Söllner made his statement to this audience was unexpected, however the admission by a former dissident of his collaboration with the Romanian secret services is actually not so surprising.
Germany is a pleasant reserve for the Securitate spies, wrote Herta Müller in July in the newspaper Die Zeit after reading the 914 pages of her own dossier.
We can assume that the victims have been speculating and sometimes guessed which real names were hiding behind the borrowed names Sorin, Voicu and also Walter.
Unlike in Germany, where in the meantime the consultation of Stasi files is a reliable process, the attitude towards the legacy of Securitate files is still very confused.
Systematic clarification has been continually thwarted and curbed in the past years.
It was not until 1999 that a national council corresponding to the Birthler institution was set up to work on the assimilation of the Securitate archives (CNSAS), but the return of the files has rather dragged on since then.
Since 2005 there has been a law defining the management of archives.
The fact that the influence of former members of the Securitate in Romania is still very strong is confirmed by the interview of a former Securitate official from Temesvar who, after the announcement of the Nobel Prize to Herta Müller, spoke very disdainfully of the laureate.
She was psychotic, and in the end, she was only questioned once.
The infamy of power thought it could express itself here, without any glue, under the guise of freedom of expression.
Certainly, many unavoidable questions are associated with the Söllner case as this so often happens in a context of hidden guilt.
The moderate response of the audience, Söllner admits, gives hope that the rest of this chapter will be defined more by a thirst for knowledge than by accusations and a sense of shame.
The genesis of the work of Herta Müller, who was awarded the Nobel Prize yesterday, is more than a footnote.
Riots at the Champions League
It was as if a representative were arriving, pulled straight from a nice Christmas party, on which the sports goods manufacturer had spread his goods when the new VFB coach Christian Gross came up at quarter to midnight in a Mercedes C-Class, which he had just called, an orange plastic bag from the supplier in hand.
The man whose bald head was noticed, was led to a city that was still foreign to him.
Otherwise our 50-year-old man could have driven himself  he had not drunk alcohol and he was not drunk with happiness.
He had a nice evening, but he had to go back to work tomorrow.
Because now it was about to begin.
The words of the Swiss who had just been called up three days earlier were clear:  We have reached the quarter-finals , that is, the Champions League with a 3:1 win against Unirea Urziceni from Romania  but we must not be blinded by success.
The "big job" is coming up on Sunday.
The aim is to repeat the results of the Champions League in Mainz every day.
And we will have to overcome the weaknesses that have reappeared after the three quick goals of Marica (5), Träsch (8) and Pogrebnyak (11).
Drawing of lots
The eighth round of the Champions League (match 16/17. + 23/24 February/match 9/10. + 16/17 March) will be drawn on 18 December in Nyon.
The joy of Babbel's successor's entrance into office was therefore moderate.
And the joy was not limited to the lucky man who had given the unstable Stuttgart professionals unfailing motivation and pleasure in playing.
I went to the players and told them to focus on their strengths, I advised them to be more courageous, explained the 'plumber of souls'  Gross - the recipe for success that sounded so good but no longer worked with Mr Babbel.
It has set off a magic spell, said Babbel supporter Jens Lehmann, "and in football, when there is a new impulse, sometimes things happen that you never thought possible".
And Sami Khedira, who after weeks of injury, rose to the top of the rankings thanks to his dynamism, tried to describe the phenomenon seen in the proverbial "fresh wind" and the new manager's method of work: "He is someone who takes action and demands discipline".
That's what we need in the current situation.
But apparently Babbel missed it.
VfB Stuttgart have not yet crossed the line, warns manager Horst Heldt
For now, VfB Stuttgart needs more than anything else, tenacity.
Like Gross, the players and the manager are careful not to overestimate the victory against a totally outdated and weakened Romanian guest defense.
They had also won in Glasgow before having a bad wake-up call four days later in Leverkusen with 0-4 , Khedira objected.
Horst Heldt, the manager, said that they had achieved one of the goals for the season but that there were others that were still far away.
We haven't crossed the difficult road yet.
Heldt's 40th birthday, when he was not in the mood to celebrate, even after his first home win in three months, was due to the events of the weekend, which were triggered by a television interview with goalkeeper Jens Lehmann just before the start of the match.
There are decisions that others make and not Jens, Heldt would counter, in response to Lehmann's sharp criticism.
He had accused the management of poor style and said that she had decided to change coach under pressure from pubescent fans.
Lehmann also considered it a sign of lack of sovereignty and jealousy that his day off after the games was taken away from him.
Lehmann's statements were  marked by sheer selfishness  and he punched Heldt and announced consequences for the goalkeeper.
They were in danger of becoming lifelong friends.
In any case, they agreed on everything else, that is, without the group's prior work by the coach they replaced, the strong sporting and combating representation would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants were  largely successful  Heldt and Lehmann retorted in chorus  and even the man in the plastic bag acquiesced.
World heavyweight championship
Hot fight in Bern: Kevin Johnson the challenger was constantly verbally and gesturally provoking world champion Vitali Klitschko.
But after twelve tough rounds the Ukrainian defended his title as the WBC heavyweight champion of the world.
The judges unanimously agreed that he won the points.
Hamburg  Vitali Klitschko retains his heavyweight title.
The WBC announced that on Saturday night the 38-year-old champion had won a unanimous points victory over American Kevin Johnson (120:10).
For the third time Klitschko defended his title since his comeback on stage in October 2008.
Earlier, the Ukrainian had already won the WBO and WBC World Championships twice.
Unfortunately, he didn't get the long-awaited knockout.
Klitschko, who won 39 times in 41 professional fights, was twice defeated by injuries.
Challenger Johnson had to accept his first loss in the 24th fight.
In the Arena in Bern, in front of 17,000 spectators, the great Klitschko mostly wanted to dictate the fight, from his height of 2.02 meters, with his left counter.
Johnson, who was 11 centimetres shorter than Klitschko and had announced the end of Klitschko's career before the duel, managed to avoid the champion's blows, preventing Klitschko from bringing his dangerous right-back into play.
Johnson, too passive in action for a challenger, tried mostly to pass the rounds.
Although he continued to provoke Klitschko with words and gestures his blows rarely reached the champion.
He is still the second boxer after Timo Hoffman in the year 2000, having crossed the distance of twelve rounds with Klitschko.
The challenger had made a lot of noise in the Swiss capital before the fight.
He insulted Klitschko calling him a "bad zombie" who "isn't really capable".
During the weigh-in on Friday, the champion couldn't help but provoke Johnson by dropping his sunglasses from his nose  so he could see his eyes .
Fourth win since Klitschko came back.
Klitschko won again in his fourth fight since his comeback on October 11, 2008
After a break of almost four years, he had defeated then-Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and regained his WBC belt, which he had previously had to give up without a fight.
In that year, defending his championship title, he won the fight against Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba and in September against Chris Arreola of the USA.
"I just took a hit in this fight and I'm in perfect shape", Klitschko said of his quick return to the ring.
His dream is to try to bring the four most important titles together in the family.
His brother Wladimir is a WBO and IBF champion.
But it is the Britishman David Haye who, having dethroned the great Nikolai Walujew - 2.13 meters - in November, wears the WBA belt.
This summer, The Hague cancelled a game against Vitali Klitschko that was scheduled for September.
It seems his promotion company is now planning to play the match at Wembley Stadium in London.
The Kunduz case
Opposition frontal attack: Green Party parliamentary group leader Jürgen Trittin accused Defence Minister Guttenberg of lying in the Kunduz affair.
The SPD and the Left Party are asking the Chancellor for explanations.
Hamburg/Berlin - After reviewing the latest information on the Kunduz airstrike, the opposition accused Defence Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) of deliberately concealing certain facts.
The minister intentionally "formulated a falsehood" about the deadly attack on two tankers last September, said the head of the Green parliamentary group, Jürgen Trittin, on Saturday during the ARD news programme "Tagesschau" (the 8pm newspaper).
In short, that means he lied.
The order to kill was given in total disregard of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is essentially the content of the report available to NATO and which was read by Mr Guttenberg, Trittin said.
Last Friday, new media reports revealed that the attack was not actually aimed at destroying the stolen trucks, but at eliminating two prominent Taliban leaders.
According to the NATO investigation report, 142 people were killed or wounded in the US airstrike, which was launched at the request of German Colonel Goerg Klein, Military Commander of Kunduz.
The Greens, SPD and Left asked Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) on Saturday to speak to the Federal Parliament as soon as possible and reveal what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Jürgen Trittin and his colleague from the Green Party Renate Künast are of the opinion that Mrs Angela Merkel must clearly state whether the targeted massacre strategy is part of the Federal Government's Afghan policy if the Chancellery, the army and the intelligence services have approved this new strategy.
The Government spokesman categorically rejects these criticisms.
The Chancellery has in no way influenced the military's interventions in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, voices were growing stronger to express doubts about the real reasons for the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and State Secretary Peter Wichert, as presented by the ministry.
According to the information in the SPIEGEL newspaper, the information they had given Guttenberg about the attack on the tankers was both correct and complete.
Officially, they would have concealed the existence of the NATO report and hid some embarrassing details from the Minister.
However, it is suggested that the two senior officials informed the Ministry of Defence of the existence of several reports, including a two-page document by Colonel Klein and a report by the military police.
The Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung reports that Wichert had meanwhile written to ask for clarification.
So far, he has not gotten an answer.
On Saturday, the Ministry refused to comment on the allegations and referred the matter to the Federal Parliament's committee of inquiry, which was set up the following Wednesday to shed light on the facts in question.
The dream worlds
Some people are awake seeing images and hearing voices that no one else sees or hears.
It is not only in the mentally ill or under the influence of drugs that the boundaries between imagination and reality blur.
As long as these things happen during sleep, everything's fine.
When we lie in our dark rooms, we can indulge in the wildest dreams and fantasies unhindered.
However, the person who, when awake, experiences a dream state, hears and sees things that others do not perceive, soon has the reputation in our Western world of being crazy or drugged, or at least being original.
Such images and voices are not only seen in people with mental illness or under the influence of drugs.
It's our imagination that's at fault -- it's the same neuronal activity that allows us to design houses, paint paintings, or write novels, but sometimes causes the boundaries between dream, madness, and reality to blur.
A state of conscious waking, taking the form of a dream, can take many forms, from visions at best to madness at worst.
But even though the trigger and the effect are distinct, the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of the New Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, the second states of shamans, psychosis and hallucinations are all attributed to very similar processes.
Hallucinations or delusions occur when the balance of neurotransmitters in the brain - primarily dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin and acetylcholine - is broken and the interaction between different parts of the brain is disturbed.
Complex hallucinations and delusional thoughts are very common during schizophrenic psychosis.
The force of gravity no longer has power over the person.
Since ancient times, philosophers and doctors have always looked into the relationship between madness and dreaming.
For Aristotle, hallucinations were a form of daydreaming; Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, noted in 1861 that "madness is very similar to dreaming", and for Sigmund Freud, dreaming was even "a psychosis with all its irregularities, imaginations, delusions and sensory illusions".
It's the fall of 2001 and Henning T is transformed into a comic book character.
His body is two-dimensional in bright colors.
The earth's gravity no longer has any power over him, he's hovering above the ceiling.
He's feeling a little bit of a punch.
Behind him, winged devil creatures, grimacing, bloodstained mouths, showing their teeth.
They chased him, kicked him with burning boots, and threw him against the wall.
Thunderous, mean voices, screaming, coming out of the walls and the radio.
He can't take the insults and the humiliation anymore.
Henning T. pulls two wires from his stereo chain, makes a loop of it, and attaches it to a hook attached to the ceiling.
He gets on a buffalo and puts the ring around his neck.
He jumps.
The loop is coming off.
Let this be a lesson to you, the voices in a choir are screaming to rip out his eardrum. "Go to a clinic and get treated!"
Henning T. is now 40 years old, he's had six acute psychosis episodes, the last one in two years, the first in almost 20 years.
It was triggered by the LSD.
Diagnosis: psycho-affective schizophrenia, paranoid, also manic-depressive, he is on medication for depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He's learned to live with his illness, he's been married for three years.
During my psychosis, I experienced terrible fears and deep despair.
Illusions are a cruel reality.
About one percent of the population suffers from schizophrenia at least once in their lifetime, and in psychiatric clinics it is the second most common disorder after depression.
In a schizophrenia crisis, the affected person can no longer distinguish between the inner world and the outer world, and they find themselves in a state of hyperexcitation, which can lead to hallucinations, megalomania, relationship madness or persecution.
It is very common to hear voices  commanding voices, commenting voices or conversing voices.
Optical hallucinations are also not uncommon.
The person concerned can no longer distinguish between the important and the insignificant, the brain can no longer filter out disturbing signals, the conscious is drowned in sensations.
Like dreaming, psychosis opens the floodgates to a flood of ideas and fantasies from the deeper layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is centered on the subject, according to Professor Thomas Fuchs, head of the psychiatry department at the Heidelberg CHU (Allgemeine Psychiatrie im Universitätsklinikum).
The schizophrenic is at the very center of the situation, with a meaning centered on him.
At the same time he finds himself in a passive role, he is like in a dream, overcome by events and cannot act on them actively.
This is why schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled, manipulated.
They usually have no possibility of adjusting to reality, illusions are a cruel reality, waking up is ruled out.
To experience once in your life a hallucination.
Unlike dreams, Fuchs says, "the sensory and spatial structure of reality that is perceived during psychosis is basically preserved".
Delusional thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the alienation of the experience takes place in a real setting.
Why our brains do these kinds of freaks is still a mystery to researchers.
According to Fuchs, exceptional situations can cause everyone to lose momentary perception of reality.
But only a small number of people will develop psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but studies of twins have shown that genes are not the only determining factors.
The researchers assume that the people involved have minor brain damage.
It is thought that neuronal maturation in the brain is disrupted at an early stage of development, for example by a viral infection of the mother during pregnancy, Fuchs explains.
But what remains unexplained is how the neurological system malfunctions and how it goes undetected for many years.
Environmental factors also play a role  stress or a traumatic experience can be a trigger for psychosis, if there is a predisposition.
Similarly, hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychosis because they act on neurotransmitters.
When our brains get hot.
The crazy thing, says psychology professor Erich Kasten from Lübeck, is that psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and take expensive drugs to get rid of them, while others buy very expensive drugs to get them.
The perception of pleasant or unpleasant illusions is often just a matter of perspective.
Kasten has been collecting reports on hallucinations and delusional phenomena for ten years. Last year he published his findings in a book entitled The Unreal World in Our Minds.
Hallucinations are not only one of the concomitant phenomena typical of psychosis but also of an impressive number of other pathologies.
These include mental disorders such as borderline or depression, but also migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease and head trauma.
Surprisingly, under certain conditions even the brains of healthy people are prone to hallucinations.
Hallucinations, Kasten says, are made up of fragments of memories that are normally inhibited.
They form when the areas of the brain that process sensory perception are overactive or not sufficiently controlled; when our brains get too hot, but also when there is no stimulation.
Drugs can trigger this condition just like brain damage or psychosis.
But also lack of stimulation, stress, heartbreak or other exceptional mental states.
In recent studies, one third of participants admit to having experienced a hallucination at least once in their lives.
In the summer of 2005 Sarah K. is 16 years old, she lives in a small town in the former Mecklenburg-Pomeranian and she goes to high school.
A young girl who's trying to be normal, really.
If it weren't for the images and the voices.
During recess, a young boy, thin and with long brown hair, comes to speak to her.
When she answers, her classmates look at her, amazed that no one else can see or hear the boy.
They think this shy girl is a lunatic dreamer but Sarah K doesn't dream, she's sure.
She's awake, and she hears and sees this boy just as she sees and hears the girl sitting next to her on the bench.
She may even feel his presence momentarily.
It's a nice feeling, she finds this young man nice.
Am I crazy? she wonders sometimes.
But she knows that this young man and the other visions are not real and that they will disappear again.
Apparitions are usually scary at night.
Sometimes visions are hard.
When she's in class, she can't follow the class because the teacher is just introducing a new student to her eyes and ears when he's invisible to the others and the teacher is clearly explaining equations on the board.
Apparitions are usually scary at night.
When, in the darkness of her room, she waits for sleep, which comes too seldom and too late, she often cannot tell whether she is awake or already dreaming, whether the images she sees, the grimacing faces or the young girl with bloody cuts on her arms and legs are before her eyes open or closed.
Leave me alone, she shouts at those creatures.
She won't tell her parents or friends, they'll think she's crazy.
Autumn of 2009, Sarah K. is now 20 years old.
She graduated last year and she lives with her boyfriend.
A year ago, the hallucinations stopped.
Ever since she got in touch with psychologist Kasten online, she knows she's not crazy.
Madness is also a work of art of despair.
When someone is socially isolated or not stimulated enough, they are more likely to hallucinate after a while.
I guess the brain isn't busy enough, so it makes it animated.
Sarah K., an only child, was afraid of other children when she was young and often played alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at age 13 that the man she had called Dad since she was of thinking age was not her real father.
These are the same brain areas that are active for visual and auditory hallucinations, and for real impressions and sounds, so it is very difficult for people like Sarah K to tell the difference between illusion and reality.
Hallucinations are also images that form in the brain, which is why they seem so real".
For Kasten, night dreams are also a form of hallucination.
Hallucinations in healthy people are not fundamentally different from those in acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, a sane person is able to recognize that fantasies are not real images.
That's why Kasten advises his patients to cherish hallucinations as a special talent.
There's only one step between a dream and a hallucination.
In our overly conscious world, we are unfortunately quick to mistake imaginary experiences for pathologies, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor at Heidelberg and chief physician at the psychiatric and psychotherapeutic clinic at the Florence Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
Psychosis is a serious, painful illness but one that also contains something positive, creative - madness is a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard studied the so-called oniroid form of experience, a particular form of alteration of consciousness awakened by dreaming.
Oniroid vices are very complex half-dreams that are perceived as real by the person experiencing them and that he cannot differentiate from the dream even when he is awake.
Oniroid awareness occurs during trauma or in extreme conditions, such as in patients with polyradiculopathy who are fully conscious but experience motor paralysis.
According to Schmidt-Degenhard, when a human being is threatened with a loss of self and the world, due to a total and lasting inability to move, he replaces this real situation that is affecting his life, with his own imaginary world that is dissociated from reality.
It's a mental state of boundary between dreaming and hallucinating.
Since it is not possible to overcome the situation in reality, a change of world takes place but the real situation is represented in the imagination.
It is, in fact, an intense form of means and interpretation, in a situation which is intolerable in itself, a capacity for organization which is given to us men, so that we do not sink into the nothingness of the loss of consciousness.
Everything is real even later in memory.
The Zurich art historian Peter Cornelius Classen also describes his oniroid experiences in his book "Change of Heart" as a soul-saving action.
He was 49 when he went on a multi-day journey after a heart valve operation followed by a heart transplant, during which time his body was condemned to remain motionless in resuscitation.
Claussen plunges into a world he created from scratch, visits foreign places, travels back in time, and finds himself an old man lying in a railway sanatorium, a robot at his bedside watching over his health.
He lives in the Middle Ages among the nobles who make blood drugs.
He is kidnapped by a Greek man on a motorcycle who takes him back to his country, surfing with his hospital bed in the snow of the Alps and meeting a Korean mobster.
He's completely absorbed in this imaginary world, everything is real even later in his memories.
According to Claussen, these inner journeys are fundamentally different from any dream.
Dreaming is a completely different state, he writes, describing what he experienced.
Unlike dreams, memories from mental travel are extremely clear and highly detailed even years later.
In fact, they can be said to be much more distinct and intense than the actual experience.
The intensity of this experience is what makes our other daily experiences blurred, according to psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Ultimately, oneroid delusions, psychosis, hallucinations and psychedelic experiences show us how fragile our inner representations of the external reality are even when awake.
Any change in consciousness, says psychologist Kasten, "can cause a distortion of what we call reality".
An experience that can also be quite rewarding.

At 27, the children will take over the publishing house.
Kallen's appointment as Burda's publishing CEO is an intermediate solution: in the longer term, Hubert Burda wants his two children to take over the media group, he told the Spiegel newspaper.
The holding company must remain a 100% family business.
Hamburg - Publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children
The two children will inherit at 27 and are determined to integrate into society, said Hubert Burda, 69, to Spiegel.
All the details have been arranged in advance.
The question of whether they will be active in the company will arise later.
It will also be necessary to see if they are capable of doing so.
You can't put your kids in 7,500 jobs without knowing if they're capable of doing it.
It would destroy the kids as well as the company.
Mr Burda announced last Thursday that he was stepping down as chairman and chief executive in January and that his successor was Paul-Bernhard Kallen.
Kallen, 52, has been a member of the Board of Directors since 1999.
He was first in charge of the technology sector.
He was later in charge of the Treasury department, i.e. he was responsible for the company's capital and after Jürgen Todenhöfer left he also took over marketing, foreign trade, printing and finance.
For the first time, a member of the Burda family is not in charge of the Burda publishing house.
Burda's children are 19 and 17 years old respectively. Her son Felix, who would now be 42, died a few years ago.
The appointment of Kallen also serves to tie in the next 10 or 15 years"
Burda says the holding company must remain 100% family-owned.
The ruins have always been in families that have been driven by a capitalist glut, who have made huge unfortunate speculations thinking they could climb higher and higher.
That was never my strategy.
I never had any dreamy universal power, said Burda.
I do not see myself in the role of a country's tutor as Springer could be and I do not intend to be part of these international leagues like Time, these companies have become far too important.
Full of beauty
Everything you could possibly want in terms of beauty and well-being, at your fingertips.
This seems to be the goal set by El Corte Inglés, which has just opened in the shopping centre of Callao (Madrid), a multidisciplinary space of over 1000 m2 dedicated to body care and attention.
The spa, located on the eighth floor, houses prestigious brands such as Hedonai, a specialist in laser hair removal, Spaxion, with its relaxation and aesthetic treatment rooms, Luis & Tachi, hairdressers, Marina d'Or, which has a gym, or L'Occitane and its natural cosmetics, among others.
There is also a food court, with a tea room in particular, which offers over 130 different kinds of tea.
Spaxion offers you, for example, a relaxing massage with your partner, while enjoying the exceptional views of the capital, or a relaxation area for two hours to organise your own  Beauty Party  with eight of your friends and relax with a Jacuzzi, massage and a glass of champagne.
The total area is 250 m2 in 12 rooms, where the most innovative facial, body and hydrotherapy treatments can be used.
Like, for example, cavitation to fight cellulite or vibrating platforms.
The gym also has these devices, as well as virtual trainers who guide the steps of the customers, offering them a fully personalised treatment.
It all starts with entering your personal code on a touchscreen in front of the device.
Several videos then show us how to do our exercise program correctly.
His supervisor says that 15 minutes (including warm-ups and stretches) is enough to get all the muscles working.
And if, after working our bodies, we want to go to the hair salon, Luis & Tachi has a room where we offer customized hair restoration, lighting or nutrition rituals.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to have been the watchwords of this urban spa, which will be open every day of the year from 10am to 10pm.

The shape of the neckline, which is very important for highlighting the figure, is one of the variables we have to take into account.
Here are some suggestions.

Endesa and Barcelona, getting the electric car
The electricity company Endesa, in collaboration with the Barcelona City Council, has created the Oficina LIVE.
It is a project to develop and promote the electric vehicle in the Catalan capital.
The Oficina LIVE (Logistics for the Electric Vehicle Implementation) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the introduction of the electric car in the city and will set up mobility agreements, by making arrangements, coordinating, presenting grants, etc.
It will also develop the MOVELE project, promote the electric car, and gather the views and work of the sectors involved.
The ultimate idea is to launch what will become the transport of the future.
3  electric cities 
But Barcelona is not the only city to be involved in the introduction of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville joined the project.
These are the three cities chosen by the government, under the MOBELE Plan, to launch the deployment of the electric car.
The electricity company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Generalitat de Catalunya.
It aims to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
The latter include activities related to energy, and in particular energy efficiency.
This is not the only initiative in which Endesa is involved in promoting the electric car.
The company is involved in European standardisation groups and has a number of complementary projects under way, such as G4V, ELVIRE and CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees  a future of tranquility  for the motor industry
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, saw  a future of tranquility  for the Spanish automobile industry, which he said was the country's main export sector.
In his presentation of the President's Economic Report for 2009, Mr Zapatero recalled the measures taken by the government during the year to support the automotive sector.
 Without a Competitiveness Plan for the automotive sector, we would today be in a situation of abandonment, of the closure of some of our main production sites,  said the Prime Minister.
 With this plan and the brands' decision to stay in Spain, in a highly competitive sector, we can look to a peaceful future for the future of this industry, which is our main export sector, he added.
He recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, part of the Comprehensive Plan for the Automotive Sector (CAP), allocated EUR 800 million to projects by 19 manufacturers and 137 auxiliary companies, which mobilised investment of more than EUR 3 000 million.
The Chief Executive explained that this investment was intended both for the development of new models and for the modernisation of existing products and processes.
Zapatero also emphasised the government's demand support measures, referring to Plan 2000E, which was implemented in collaboration with the autonomous communities and the car companies.
According to the President, this plan has reduced the average emissions of new vehicles on the Spanish market by 6% and contributed to a  strong increase  in registrations, which increased by  40%  in November.
20 000 m2 of old cars
Madrid hosts the first edition of the International Exhibition of Vintage Cars, a meeting place for professionals and enthusiasts of the motoring world.
The event will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 at the Pabellón de Cristal in the Casa de Campo in Madrid.
The exhibition area is 20 000 m2 and will be attended by more than 200 national and international exhibitors.
Not only will you find motorcycles and collector cars, but you will also find all kinds of motorcycle related items at ClassicAuto Madrid.
The exhibitors in the pavilion will be able to find accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, accessories, magazines, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of items related to the world of the collector's engine that will delight collectors and curious.
Among the companies participating are Clásicos de Mos and Good Old Times, specialists in car sales, Juan Lumbreras, catering, Coupe-Francisco Pueche, car sales and restoration, and Cochera Clásicos, specialists in Mercedes Benz.
Outdoor aptitude test
But the trade fair will also include side activities: meetings, sports exhibitions, aptitude tests, presentations and competitions.
Fitness tests with collector cars and motorcycles will also take place on a circuit set up outside the exhibition grounds.
Mazda3 i-Stop: a sporting spirit that is sustainable
Mazda wants to prove that the sporting spirit is not angry with respect for the environment.
To this end, it has recently integrated the engine stop and start system, called i-Stop, into the Mazda3, a device which, at least for the moment, is only available on the 150-horsepower petrol 2.0 engine.
This second generation Mazda3 is characterised by its overall good rating.
The details, the finish of the vehicle, the habitability, the behavior, the mechanics, the i-Stop system...
All these aspects are remarkable about the new Mazda3.
Starting from the driver's seat, the front seats are ergonomically and securely fitted.
The touch of the steering wheel is also particularly pleasant.
Continuing with the control panel and console, we see how Mazda has continued the Japanese trend of creating a futuristic interior design, with many buttons and controls, as well as bright red and blue colours.
This style is reminiscent of the Honda Civic.
This is why we can say that both the Mazda3 and the Civic, both Japanese, stand in contrast to the sobriety of German products, and more particularly to the Golf from Volkswagen, which they all want to surpass.
Continuing with the passenger compartment, this compact Japanese car has more than enough seating capacity to allow four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
Add to all this a large box of regular shapes.
The automatic shut-off and start system of the engine, at least for the time being, is only available on the two-litre petrol engine with 150 hp and with six-speed manual shift.
This engine is a real delight, distinguished by its fineness, low noise, performance and control of consumption.
Although the most popular Mazda3s are diesel models, those who do not cover a large number of kilometres a year should not exclude this petrol-powered i-Stop, both for its high speed comfort and its controlled consumption.
As regards the level of equipment, the model chosen for the test is the Sportive, i.e. the model with the highest number of standard components.
Among the standard equipment, the lane change assistant (LCA) which eliminates blind spots, traction and stability controls, the speed control, the light-sensitive interior mirror, the on-board computer on a large screen, parking sensors, independent air conditioning, rain and light sensor, bluetooth and bluetooth audio, and the 17-inch alignment wheels, are particularly notable.
As if this equipment were not enough, this version also had the Premium Pack which, for an additional EUR 1 500, included, among other items, adaptive bi-xenon headlamps and a BOSE audio system with disc charger.
The Commission
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars in its class.
It is particularly characterised by the quality of the materials used, its behaviour and its high level of equipment.
In addition, those who do not drive many kilometres a year will be able to opt for the i-Stop version combined only with the 150hp petrol 2.0 engine.
The only drawback of this model is its high price, which is between 21 770 euros for the Luxury finish and 23 270 euros for the model tested, the Sportive.
In return for this considerable sum, the Mazda3 will provide us with a great deal of satisfaction every day.
 first  luxury
L.A. is a red carpet of sensuality, epitomized by Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars have dazzled us more than ever, dressed in models as stylish as they are sexy for the release of Nine.
Our Pe, as sophisticated as she was, had opted for a dark Lady.
The Promise of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, it is a device that only allows you to look at your e-mail, without offering the possibility even of seeing certain types of attachments or browsing the Internet.
It enjoyed its five minutes of fame in the United States when Time magazine named it one of the products of the year.
It is actually harder to see on the street, but the idea seems interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek offers a very low price and monthly subscription, less than half of what, for example, the iPhone data subscription costs.
Following its success, the company launched two new devices: one designed exclusively for Twitter, the other with a free lifetime data service, at six times the price of the Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the Web event, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
It's as limited as its American cousin, but it comes with a surprise.
The monthly subscription price, around EUR 12, includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those who travel with a Smartphone already know what it's like to give up data when crossing a border or desperately search for a cafeteria on Wi-Fi (or a Fon connection) to check your mail.
The idea of fixed-price roaming is incredibly attractive and should have worked for a long time.
Some operators have special arrangements and travel options, but for me, I would need a PhD in physics to understand them and good glasses to read the fine print.
The European Commission's repeated calls for affordable roaming charges across Europe have had little noticeable effect.
Outside their home country, people are hesitant to use data, and rightly so.
The fact that a small device like the FonPeek (it is always curious that it is called Fon even though it does not have Wi-Fi) offers these types of rates means that operators are starting to think differently and are looking at different proposals to make their data network more profitable.
Kindle is another good example, it includes downloading books and other Internet searches.
No subscription and no hassle.
It is a connected device and you pay when you buy it and not every month.
And that's what I hope to see one day for FonPeek: a lifetime access purchase option like Peek already offers in the US.
Not that I want to buy it.
I'm checking my mail on my phone, thank you.
I simply wish it because I believe it is a fairer formula for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with this same system.
Michelle's favorite color is
Yellow is, without a doubt, the favorite color of the first lady of the United States.
If she went to Barack Obama's inauguration as President of the United States in a dress and coat of this color, she did indeed choose the same to accompany him to the second moment, undoubtedly the most important of her life: the presentation in Oslo of the Nobel Peace Prize.
Michelle Obama wore a very similar pattern on both occasions: in addition to their similar color, a yellow pulling towards green with bright reflections, both times the outfit consisted of three pieces: the dress, the jacket and the coat, in the same fabric, and was adorned with a large embroidery or necklace.
So at first glance, it would seem that the First Lady of the United States is following in the footsteps of the Princess of Asturias and has chosen to wear the same outfits.
But the fabric from which the two sets are cut makes them very different.
If she was wearing thick lace when she took office, she wore printed velvet in Oslo.
The accessories are also different: green shoes with medium heels for the first occasion, and a similar model, but this time gold.
The hairstyle has also changed: the hair is now raised up whereas it was loose the last time.
75% of working mothers have had work problems because of their maternity
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for younger generation women who want to become mothers.
This is the finding of the study  Fertility and career of women in Spain , carried out by the CSIC in collaboration with the Instituto de la Mujer.
The survey of 9 737 women aged 15 to 75 leaves no doubt: 75% of working mothers have had their working careers limited by maternity.
The study shows that there are many differences in the start of married life and the number of children, whether the woman works or not and the type of job she has.
Women who are not working outside the home, who work parttime or have unstable jobs, marry earlier, have their first pregnancy earlier and have more children.
In contrast, women with stable jobs, mainly in the public sector, delay marriage and first pregnancy and have fewer children.
Women aged 35-49 with a fixed job have their first child on average 3.7 years after they have settled down as a couple.  This figure rises to 4.1 for those working in the public sector.  These data show that women with a fixed job have taken longer in their lives to get it, which has led them to delay marriage and the arrival of children.
Moreover, the type of job exercised has a major influence on maternity, but less on the date of beginning cohabitation, explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
Education is another factor that widen the gap between the age of marriage and the age of first child.
The survey found that the higher the level of education, the later they marry and have their first child.
The difference also persists among women of the same generation.
For example, in the 35-49 age group, those with primary and higher education respectively became mothers for the first time at an average age of 25.1 and 32.1 years.
 Another distinction also appears between women, according to their level of education.
While those with primary education marry and have their first child before finding a stable job, those with secondary or higher education reverse this programme and give priority to obtaining a stable job as a prerequisite for marriage and the arrival of a child, says Delgado.
Diane Kruger is worth it too.
L'Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its list of coveted female ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will be the face of several of the brand's products, singing the universal motto "Because I'm worth it".
The protagonist of Joyeux Noël, one of the most elegant actresses on the international scene, joins other celebrities registered at L'Oréal Paris, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before her, the last to enter this club were actresses Evangeline Lilly (Lost) and Freida Pinto (Slumdog Millionaire).
Among men, the cosmetics brand also has luxury ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey (Dre Grey, Anatomy Lessons) and Matthew Fox (Evangeline's companion in Lost).
British fashion awards
The British have a lot to say in the fashion world.
Its leading representatives, designers and models, past and present, gathered for the annual award ceremony, which took place in London at the Royal Court of Justice.
No one missed the appointment.
Former model Jerry Hall and his daughter, Georgia May Jagger, named Model of the Year.
The ace of Manuel Vincent
Manuel Vincent offers us in Poquer de ases (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) about thirty "radiographies" of writers who have passed through his literary life (and sometimes, his other life).
He does not do this according to the predictable and apprehended genres (biographical summary, life and work), but by looking for something similar to the nucleus of the character created.
The journey is exciting and Vincent is not without its scares and illuminations.
This book is a delightful treat, but it is also a moving invitation to read and reread.
I'll leave you with a few snapshots.
On Albert Camus:  In its pages, I discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual, almost physical, impulse, the very one I felt without naming it: pleasure against fate, morality without guilt and innocence without any god. 
On Samuel Beckett:  Nihilist, Christian allegorical, he wrote what was in his blood, not in his head, between powerlessness and ignorance, with a dazzling poetic humor, meaningless, like the blade of the knife that almost killed him. 
On Graham Greene:  Our man was inspired by this woman of passion that lasted thirteen years, in whose flesh he combined the emotion of adultery with the pleasure of remorse, a spiritual privilege that was to reach heaven by the path of perdition. 
On James Joyce:  Ulysses was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach.  It is one of the eight thousand-meter peaks of world literature, which must be climbed by the north face, on which the best climbers still and always let go. 
About William Faulkner: He was a strange man.
Of himself he sometimes said he was the heir of a county landowner and other times he was the son of a black woman and a crocodile.
Both of these dreams were great.
On Louis-Ferdinand Céline:  This writer collected the insane scream pushed from a bridge by this character of Munch to carry its echo to the depths of the night of the 20th century, in its literary form, and he did so in flight from himself and invoking posterity with a violent speech to maggots. 
About Dorothy Parker:  One day she got down on her knees and prayed:  Dear God, I beg you to make me stop writing like a woman. 
On Joseph Conrad:  On his grave were engraved the verses of Spenser:  Sleep after toil,/ after the storm the port,/ rest after war,/ after life, tired death delights. 
About Virginia Wolf:  In her luggage she carried her depression too.
Her husband would very normally accept her telling him that Edward VII was peeping among the azaleas or that the birds were singing in Greek.
Never was a man so patient and so in love with a neurosis whose literary talent exceeded madness.
On Pío Baroja:  What did Martín-Santos do but try to hide Joyce at Baroja's?
What was Benet trying to do but have Faulkner shoot Baroja?
What did it do but seek the glory of this man to serve as his pedestal?
A cowardly attack
Last week, my mother, who is in her 70s, was walking in our neighborhood in Fuenlabrada when a group of young people between 15 and 18 years old passed her and our dog, a blood-red dog, rescued from the spa and weighing no more than six kilos, and without saying a word, they kicked her twice, leaving the dog seriously injured.
We are outraged because we do not see the fun in attacking a defenseless little animal that was on a leash.
In addition, there was the indignation of a lady who was walking around quietly and who, when she insulted these individuals, became afraid for her physical integrity, since an energetic who attacks an animal is capable of doing the same to a woman, a child, an old man or, in short, anyone weaker than himself.
The incident occurred at about 5 p.m. on a Tuesday in a normally quiet neighborhood.
The dog has been moaning all day.
We have of course lodged a complaint with the local police station, although we doubt it will do much good and to avoid offending the sensitivities, we just want to make it clear that the cowardly murderers were Spanish.
We have been outraged by this and have denounced it.
We don't understand what's going on in young people that they find it amusing to mistreat a defenseless animal for nothing that gives us affection, friendship and companionship.
We do not know what happened to good manners and respect for animals and people.
Michelin and Fesvial, together for wearing helmets
The tyre manufacturer Michelin, in collaboration with the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to encourage the wearing of helmets, mainly among younger motorcyclists, as reported today by both organisations.
The aim of this initiative is to raise awareness of the importance of wearing a helmet, as it is the only form of protection that can prevent head injuries or even death in a two-wheeler accident.
Michelin said that the campaign was in line with its commitment to road safety, which goes beyond the design and manufacture of ever safer products, and that it contributed to this objective through other educational and information activities.
The new campaign to encourage the wearing of helmets on two wheels, under the slogan  To be or not to be , will include a first phase in which posters will be distributed in more than 500 motorcycle garages to ensure the widest possible distribution.
Finally, Michelin stressed that road safety is a constant concern for the company, as as a tyre manufacturer for two-wheelers, one of its main objectives is to develop ever safer products.
Sales of light commercial vehicles are increasing
After almost two years, the light commercial vehicle market is beginning to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9 425 vehicles registered in November in Spain represent an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, more importantly, they represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of decline, according to figures from the employers' union of the manufacturers Anfac and Ganvam, the dealer union.
However, there is some good news, as the benchmark for comparison in November 2008 was particularly poor, with a 60% decrease compared to the previous year.
As a result, despite the reversal last month, the number of registrations accumulated during these 11 months is 40% below the previous year.
Since January, if all vehicles falling within the category of light commercial vehicles (derivatives of passenger cars, pickups, vans, light vans and light chassis trucks) are added together, 95,853 have been sold.
The big clouds that are most affecting demand have not disappeared, because although they are also bought by individuals, most of the purchases are made by small and mediumsized enterprises, which pay for almost 100% of their purchases with external financing.
Thus, in addition to the restrictions implied by the limitation of bank credit, other factors such as the increase in unemployment or the persistence of the bad economic situation must be added.
In view of this situation and the difference in passenger cars, the aid for the purchase of the 2000E was of little use.
In addition to individuals, self-employed people and SMEs who wish to purchase a light commercial vehicle of less than 3.5 tonnes with a CO2 emissions level of not more than 160 grams per kilometre can also benefit, but the number of operations speaks for itself.
Yesterday, at Ganvam, we were again reminded of the need for the administration to pay special attention to these vehicles and also to industrial vehicles (trucks and buses).
The dealers' association forecasts a similar year to the one ending in 2010, for which it calculates a fall in sales (for passenger cars and 4x4s) of 19%.
Emergency braking assistance is now compulsory
As was the case with the ABS anti-lock braking system and as will be the case with ESP stability control, emergency braking assistance systems will be a mandatory feature on European cars.
They are already mandatory on newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while a grace period has been set for the rest of the vehicles until the end of February 2011.
The EU-imposed measure aims to improve pedestrian protection, although its mode of action may also help to avoid many rear-end collisions.
The emergency brake assist acts by increasing the pressure on the brakes in the event of an emergency detected by the system by the driver's kick.
But the latter does not always maintain the pressure until the end.
According to a study by the car component manufacturer Bosch, one third of the drivers involved in an accident had failed to apply the brake before the collision, and half of them had not used the brake to its full strength.
Up to 1 100 accidents
The assistance intervention, on the other hand, requires the maximum of the braking system, reducing the distance the car needs to stop.
According to an EU study, if all cars were equipped with these types of components, up to 1 100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be avoided each year.
This reduction would be even greater with the popularisation of so-called intelligent emergency braking systems: it is estimated that one in four accidents with injuries would be prevented.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that, by means of a radar or camera, detects obstacles and warns the driver, and acts slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, he helps by increasing the pressure on the pedal if necessary.
If it does not react, and although the collision is inevitable, the device will apply maximum force to the brakes to minimise damage.
General Motors is delaying Opel's plan until January.
While workers at the Opel plant in Figueruelas, Zaragoza, were warned by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that production of the new Meriva would start in the first week of April - probably on the 8th - according to Javier Ortega, the North American manufacturer warned that it would need more time to finalize Opel's rescue plan.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, understands that every point of the plan has been approved in advance by the relevant party.
And this may mean that the final document, which will first be submitted to workers and then to the governments of the countries where the factories are located, will be postponed until early 2010.
GM, on the other hand, says a decision on the sale of Saab should be made in the next few days.
It is therefore not surprising that the Swedish government has increased pressure on the US manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to being in contact with potential new buyers.
One of them could be Geely, which is also keen to acquire Volvo, but the bid by Dutch sports car manufacturer Skyper, backed by the Russian group Converg, is gaining momentum.
If he doesn't agree with either of them, GM could sell a piece of Saab to the Chinese company Baic.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year if it is not sold is maintained.
I was driving the Porsche Boxster Spyder.
To design their latest and most precious jewel, Porsche engineers took the Boxster S and managed to slim it down to just under 80 kilograms, leaving the balance at only 1,275 kilograms.
This meant that they did not have the automatic roof, which was replaced by a manual roof, which reduced by 21 kg, using aluminium doors like those of the GT3, another 15 kg less, removing the air conditioner, 13 kg, reducing the petrol tank from 64 to 54 litres, 7 kg of gained, mounting sport sticks, another 12 kg, and with light 19 inch tyres, five kg.
Finally, they gave up the CDR-30 audio system, gaining an additional six kilograms, and replaced the door handles with cloth handles, saving the remaining kilo.
Although the model also exists with the dual-clutch PDK gearbox, the test was carried out on a six-speed manual gearbox model, mainly on California's secondary network roads, in the mountains, with particularly winding corners.
His behaviour can only be described as irreproachable.
The reduction in weight does not prevent the car from rolling on the ground with confidence.
On the contrary: it had been a long time since we had tested a model so small and lightweight that at the same time guarantees such safety in corners, even at high speed.
He's a small athlete, able to warm up his muscles at low speed for as long as it takes, until we ask him to sprint, brake, recover and push his engine again...
With its communication-like, precise steering, the car will do what our hands on the wheel tell it to do.
And she'll do it with surgical precision.
Sound of engine at will
The sound of the 320 hp V6 boxer (10 more than the Boxster S) is particularly successful and can be enhanced with the  sport  option or through a system that modifies the roar of the engine, already used on the Panamera.
The ability to accelerate is brutal, whether at rest or during recovery.
The suspension is firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The pavement of the roads we drove on the Boyxster Spyder was quite damaged, but the car was able to handle the chicken nests.
The electronic assistants barely showed up on the whole trip, while at some turns we found ice early in the morning and gravel later in the morning.
In short, an ultralight car, one of the most entertaining to drive and far more than a modification of the Boxster S.
The car will go on sale in February 2010 at a price of €70,831.

Baskonia offers itself a victory in Israel
Caja Laboral won 91-82 in a spectacular victory on their visit to the difficult pitch of Maccabi Electra, despite the many absences suffered by Dusko Ivanovic's team.
The Vitoria team was able to fill the important absences of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with a great deal of commitment and teamwork, even if it had to wait until the end to win.
Moreover, the great skill from the perimeter, with 16 three-point baskets, largely determined the final victory.
The game started quickly for the blue and red, who took the lead from the start.
The fact that the first four baskets of the Vitoria team were marked from the perimeter, presaged that they had jumped onto the Israeli field with hot wrists.
English and Teletovic were the main architects of the 18-20 final in the first quarter.
The second half was on the same tone, but Alava's team chose Barak's inside play and Eliyahu's work, which was met with cheers and applause back at his old home, to increase their advantage at halftime (34-43).
Teletovic was already starting to show his strength as the best player on his team, with 13 points scored, although Splitter's  minus six  rating already suggested that the night was not going to be the best for the Brazilian.
But in this match, despite the fact that they were on the right track at half-time, nothing was played, far from it, and the Avala team wanted to remind the Vitoria team that you don't win that easily on their pitch, and thanks to  Elias' hand, they managed to get into the match.
Eidson and Pnini played a decisive role in the yellow team's advantage over the bright team (50-49).
Other difficulties
Ivanovic's injured but far from dead players needed to make some clever moves to catch up, and that's when Mirza Teletovic's machine gun came through, which with three consecutive three-point baskets and the help of English and Ribas returned the score to a reassuring 54-67, which the hosts managed to accentuate at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
Avala's team went out to play all for all in the final period and English and San Emeterio (60-75) said they would not let anyone take what they deserved for the first 30 minutes.
However, Pnini y Eidson, the best of their team, did not give up and tried to support her from the three-point line (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter out for fouls, Ivanovic's players did not rush, defended well, and although the Israelis came close in the final minute (80-85), the game was already played and the victory escaped Tel Aviv for the first time this season.
The wounds prevent the Unicaja from fighting
Unicaja lost to Olympiacos in Greece and were relegated to Euroleague Group B, in a match marked by the absence of Unicaja players, especially in the home game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The Malaga team was not intimidated by the atmosphere of the Peace and Friendship Pavilion or the size of its rival, arguably one of the most powerful in Europe and with a large budget.
The first quarter's play was a dream come true for the Andalusians, with an aggressive defense and three consecutive three-point baskets, two from leader Omar Cook and one from Guillem Rubio who dazzled the home team 12-18 in the ninth minute.
Olympiacos were surprised by the intensity of Unicaja, although the local team's arsenal with the indoor play of Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, turned the score 22-20 in the thirteenth minute, when an action, a start of a fight, between the North American leaders Beverley and Williams resulted in the disqualification of both players.
The Greek team started to function by showing its superiority in both camps, as the injury exit of English centre Joel Freeland and the three personal fouls of Carlos Jiménez weighed on Unicaja.
The home players and Lithuanian winger Linas Kleizas, with their three-point baskets, extended the lead 44-32 in the nineteenth minute.
I can't get back up
The third period was particularly offensive for Olympiacos, who, despite the 19 losses, proved superior and even managed to equalize the difference of the match played in Malaga 66-48, in the twenty-seventh minute, causing the leader of the group to stumble.
LUnicaja was trying to overcome the absences and the last outing of Scottish centre-back Robert Archibald, who was injured during the match.
Despite all these problems, Unicaja, thanks to his organization, Cook's three-point baskets, and Lewis's support, left a bit of hope with 66-57 in the 31st minute.
But the victory was virtually impossible because Olympiacos was ruthless when the players were pressing and showing their superiority in inches in the zone.
Croatian centre Nikola Vujcic, managed to bring the score to 81-62 in the 37th minute, and Unicaja submitted, accepting the victory for Olympiacos.
How much should you be paid based on your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can find out what salary they would earn based on their profile, thanks to a new application from Trovit, the search engine with the highest number of small ads for real estate, jobs and vehicles in Spain.
The tool  How much should you be paid?  calculates users' salaries from over 140 000 job vacancies available to Trovit in Spain, using a form available on Facebook, where you must enter your profession, years of experience, age and the city where you want to work.
The search engine has been running for a week and has detected that, as a general rule, Spanish workers feel underpaid, said Trovit's product manager Albert Ribera in a statement.
According to data available to Trovità from its search engines in the UK and France, the Spanish are the least well paid.
A British computer programmer earns €45,226 gross per year, a Frenchman €31,059, while a Spanishman receives €24,000.
Similarly, a driver receives a gross annual salary of €34,247 in England, €25,751 in France and €16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the lowest paid job in Spain is that of waiter, with €11,592 net per year, followed by salesman, with €14,725, and laborer, with €15,667.
The most searched jobs on the Internet in the last three months are driver, part-time and social worker.
Brazil sets date for Zelaya to leave
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya to stay in its embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The ousted president will have to leave the diplomatic mission no later than 27 January 2010, the official end of his mandate.
Francisco Catunda, the charge d'affaires at the Brazilian Embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that Mel knows he must leave the embassy, where he has been a refugee since September 21, before that date.
 He is aware that he must leave on 27 January, and at the end of his term of office he must look for another destination .
The channel also quoted the former envoy, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the deadline:  My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the support of the Brazilian government, Zelaya said by phone.
After the November 29 elections (in which Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya promised to stay in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, that same week, he tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation ultimately failed, as Zelaya refused the condition of political exile imposed on him by the de facto government headed by Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you very much.
After rosy days since last spring, when asset inflation was the dominant note in the markets, uncertainty is again emerging, which is not surprising as it is their natural state, in an environment where agents make decisions about a future of uncertain nature.
The remedy used by central banks to stabilise markets has been to monetize debt by buying assets directly and indirectly by providing ample liquidity at near-zero rates, so that financial institutions buy assets to mobilise.
Central banks have already confirmed that direct asset purchases have been virtually completed and, without questioning their non-conformist liquidity policy, are starting to put some sand in the chips, as the ECB has done, with their one-year tender next week.
As a result, investors are questioning the ability of the global economy to sustain economic recovery without heterodox measures and we are seeing a reversal in the reduction in risk premia.
Stock market volatility and corporate bond spreads are rising again, although they remain far from the paranormal levels they reached at the beginning of the year.
The States have been forced to socialize private risk and the public debt is again affected.
There is a return to quality and the US, Japan and Germany have been the safe havens of choice for investors, increasing the differences between the euro area countries and Germany.
Spain was barely affected by this episode of instability, but then Standard & Poor's threatened to downgrade the rating of the Kingdom of Spain again.
On the other hand, a little uncertainty is not bad for silencing the moral hazard advocates, who were once again trying to stir up a sense of conscience among the world economic policy makers who had curbed the destructive effects of the credit limitation on job destruction, when what should be done is to declare a new Thanksgiving.
However, the situation in Dubai is similar to a tribal struggle between the emirates to regain their place in the emirate and we have already seen the case of Greece.
A government that hides a public deficit, elections, and a new government that uncovers the pot of roses.
Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It would be completely irrational for the ECOFIN to bail out Hungary from non-compliance with its external payments at the beginning of the year and allow a euro area country to default on its commitments.
What is logical, however, is that ECOFIN has encouraged the Greek government to be transparent and has made its citizens jointly responsible for the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we hope, we are faced with a period of normalisation of transitional risk premia after some excesses in high positions, this would be foreseeable.
In the case of Spain, as long as our public debt spreads grow in line with European corporate bonds, we have nothing to worry about.
If European disparities were to narrow and our own to continue to widen, then this would be an idiosyncratic Spanish risk.
The Standard & Poor's case is an anecdote: when our forecasting indicators force most research services to anticipate their stimulus models and to revise upward their forecasts for 2011, with the OECD and the European Commission also back to the task with a Japanese model for the Spanish economy, it does not bode well for their warning.
Once again, this seems to be a great opportunity to buy Spanish assets, even if for now  prudence is a mother of certainty.
Connected sectors
The President of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to speak yesterday before the Congress of Deputies' subcommittee, where the energy strategy of Spain for the next two decades is being discussed.
After his speech, which was followed by that of the President of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Mr Galán outlined for the press what he had said before the subcommittee at eight o'clock.
According to the Iberdrola president, Spain needs to invest €50 billion by 2020 and €60 billion more between then and 2030 if the nuclear power stations currently in operation remain open.
If this were not the case, the investment needed would not be 60 000 million but 95 000 million.
However, Iberdola considers that for the next decade, investment should not be directed at increasing production capacity, but at distribution networks and international interconnections.
From 2020 onwards, the question changes, and we will need to increase power.
It focuses on both gas and coal plants, with carbon dioxide recovery mechanisms and, above all, on renewable energy.
In this area, it considers that an additional 18 000 MW are needed, with additional supporting energy sources.
Galán, who believes that the Sustainable Economy Bill that the government has just approved is in line with his company's demands, did not want to attack the royal decree to encourage national coal consumption, which contradicts policies to combat global warming.
He believes that there is a clear long-term stake in this regard, despite the one-off measures, as described by the Iberdrola president.
In any case, Galán believes that investment decisions, although long-term, must be started because they take time to mature and a stable remuneration framework is needed to address them.
Ferrovial wins the Aer Lingus handling market in ten airports
The Swiss company Swissport, Ferrovial's subsidiary for ground airport services, will be the preferred partner of the Irish airline Aer Lingus for freight services at ten European airports where it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt and Brussels are among the most important.
The agreement, the economic terms of which have not been disclosed, is for a period of five years.
Ferrovial, the Junta de Castilla-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed a cooperation protocol yesterday to establish the Smart Infrastructure Innovation Centre.
The Alliance plans to invest 20 million by 2012, 50% of which will come from Ferrovial.
One of the centre's tasks will be to carry out research on energy efficiency on motorways and at airports.
Acciona disputes its first motorway in Australia at Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona is fighting for its first concession motorway in Australia, a market it already operates in as an energy and water company.
The project is a tunnel estimated at A$1.7 billion (about EUR1.047 billion).
The French company Bouygues and the German company Hochtief are its rivals.
A 5 km tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane on the east coast is an option to enable Acciona to establish itself in the country as a public works and motorway concessionaire.
The city council hopes to have it ready by the end of 2014.
After choosing the public/private partnership (PPP) to carry out the project, as part of a business plan under the auspices of Ernst & Young, the local authority already has a list of finalists who will be responsible for the construction and operation of the toll.
Pending the submission of their bids in May, the planned investment is A$1.7 billion (about EUR 1.047 million) and the final phase is being contested by three consortia, with a significant presence of European manufacturers.
The group called Transcity is led by Acciona, the only Spanish company listed, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest Australian builders, while the second, based in Italy, is one of the largest European specialists in underground work.
Against Acciona's backdrop, the Northern Direct consortium was formed, with the participation of the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and the French construction group Bouygues.
The third and final consortium to pass the test is LBRJV, whose capital is shared between the Australian Leighton (a subsidiary of the German builder Hochtief, which in turn owns the stake of ACS), another local company, Baulderstone (owned by the German Bilfinger Berger group) and the Welsh public works company Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises major construction and privatisation, but entry is very difficult, except by acquiring a local construction company.
This strategy was followed by the companies Hochtief and Bilfinger, already mentioned, in addition to their Asian references, and remains an unverified step for the Spanish giants in the sector.
ACS has just gained a foothold in this market with its 30% stake in Hochtief, which owns Leighton.
Millionaire assets
ACCIONA is situated in a geographical area of major importance for the sector, where it already has a large presence through its energy supplier and desalination activities.
Among other assets, it has the largest wind farm, Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and heads the group of companies responsible for operating and managing the Adelaide desalination plant, with a budget of 700 million.
It now intends to consolidate these two areas and to take advantage of synergies to enter the construction and infrastructure management markets.
The underground tollway, promoted by the Brisbane City Infrastructure Office and known as the Northern Link, is designed to link the Western Toowong Highway to the Kelvin Grove bypass (see map), via a 4 km tunnel.
The timetable set by the administration indicates that the tender will take place during the summer of 2010 and that work will start in December next year.
Despite the fact that the toll road will be opened to traffic at the end of 2014, it is not expected that the construction will be completed before 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will have two double tracks, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Queensland Government will provide A$500 million (€308 million) for its funding.
Brisbane already has jobs for Hochtief .
Australia continues to produce a lot of high-quality products, and Hochtief mentioned yesterday that it had secured a $154 million contract with the government.
The company owned by ACS will equip the infrastructure of the national fibre broadband network through its local Leighton subsidiary.
The project will provide 400 000 people with fast internet access and provide employment for the German company for 18 months.
The company has also sold the 27-storey King George Tower in Brisbane, but work has not yet started and Hochtief has completed the sale for 129 million.
In the United Kingdom, specifically in Manchester, she will share with Laing O'Rourke the construction and management of two school groups for 25 years.
The initial investment will be EUR 75 million.
FCC is awarded a 64 million tunnel in Slovenia
FCC, through its subsidiary Alpine, has been awarded a €64.5 million contract to build a 2.1 km long motorway tunnel in Slovenia.
The company was awarded the contract a few days after being awarded the contract for the extension of the Bosruck tunnel in Austria, for a total of 130 million.
Alpine thus consolidates its experience in tunnel construction.
The construction is scheduled to start in early 2010 and will take 32 months to complete.
Mrs. Rushmore is being awarded the Renfe ad.
Renfe has entrusted advertising and marketing services for the next two years to the Mrs Rushmore agency, with a budget of around EUR 3 million per year, the rail operator said.
The contract provides for two 12-month extensions each.Ms. Rushmore was selected from 16 agencies that applied for the tender organised by Renfe, four of which were finalists, including TBWA, which has been responsible for creativity for the past three years.
From now on, Mrs. Rushmore will be in charge of the campaign design and production.
France Telecom fined 63 million for restricting competition
The French competition regulator has fined France Télécom EUR 63 million for its anti-competitive behaviour in the country's Caribbean region.
According to the Commission, the operator limited competition in fixed and mobile telephony by signing exclusive agreements, tariffs and consumer loyalty schemes outside the scope of regulation.
With this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state-owned company has accumulated more than €450 million in fines since 1994 because of the obstacles it places on its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday was increased because the competition authority considers that France Télécom has committed similar infringements in the past and is therefore a repeat offender.
A shop for apps
The French company's mobile phone subsidiary followed suit and opened an Internet application shop with the aim of increasing non-voice revenues.
Initially, the Orange app store will be active in France and the UK.
It will not be until 2010 that it will be available in other countries such as Spain.
Their participation in the Champions League has brought in 476.4 million to Real Madrid and Barça since its inception.
The Champions League has become a source of income for clubs since its inception in 1992.
Real Madrid and FC Barcelona have earned 467.4 million, which places them in third and fifth place of the clubs that have earned the most money in this competition.
Manchester United is at the top of the list.
Manchester United is at the top of the list.
Winning the UEFA Champions League is not only a glory, it is also one of the main sources of income for the big clubs.
The competition has distributed EUR 5 362.5 million to the 105 teams (including 12 Spanish) that have participated since the tournament's inception in the 1992-93 season, according to UEFA information.
Real Madrid and FC Barcelona were well served in this division.
The white club was the third club on the continent to receive the most money for its participation, and the only one, with A.C. Milan, to have won the trophy three times.
The Catalan club, current title holders and last winners of the former European Cup in 1992, is fifth on the list.
At the top of the list are Manchester United and Bayern Munich, the two teams that also charged the most for their participation in the last Champions League.
And that's despite losing to Barça.
Spain, on the other hand, is only the third country in terms of Champions League money earned, although it has won more titles than any other (five, while Italy has won four, England three and Germany two).
Distribution
This apparent paradox is explained by the complex money-sharing procedure applied by UEFA.
This year, the organisation headed by Michel Platini expects to earn €1.090 million from the Champions League.
Of this amount, UEFA will spend 413.1 million on fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that took part in the qualifying matches (including Atlético Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who managed to participate received $3.8 million just for being there, plus more than $550,000 for each game played.
There is also a bonus for winning (800 000 euros) and a tie (400 000 for each team).The eighth-place finishers each receive three million, the eight teams in the quarter-finals 3.3 million.
The last four teams will each get $4 million.
And the winner will win $9 million, compared to the $5.2 million the other finalist received.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet established the existence of a selective advantage in favour of the airports concerned.
On the other hand, Barça pocketed 2.5 million for winning the European Super Cup in August.
But in addition, there are the variable payments, for which 337.8 million are spent.
This money is distributed according to the proportionate value of each television market.
The Spanish market is one of the largest, with four designated markets.
The previous year's champion gets 40% of the money, 30% for second, 20% for third and 10% for fourth.
The other part will be paid according to the number of matches played during the current year.
Nueva Rumasa is offering 61 million euros for 29.9% of Sos.
The Nueva Rumasa Group listed yesterday the details of its share purchase offer, which will take up between 25 and 29.9% of Sos' capital.
A percentage that does not require an offer to the public (OPA) for all the securities.
In particular, Nueva Rumasa offers EUR 1.5025 per share, which will be paid over 10 years and will be remunerated at a rate of 1% per annum for this carryover.
Yesterday, Sos shares closed at 1.85 euros; the offer from Nueva Rumasa therefore valued the company 18% below the market.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the actual valuation of Sos.
The offer is conditional on the appointment of eight of the 15 advisers.
The Jerez Group has given shareholders 15 days to express their interest in the sale of the shares.
The CNMV said it had not been informed of the offer, although the Ruiz Mateos company claimed it had contacted the regulator.
If it were to take place, the disbursement would amount to 611.7 million, while Sos' capital is 254.27 million.
In the meantime, Sos is continuing to restructure its management.
In an attempt to stay out of any possible takeover bids and legal back and forth between its former directors, the brothers Jesús and Jaime Salazar, it announced the election of María Luis Jordá as Director of Internal Audit.
A decision that made her the first woman to hold a senior management position in a food company.
This is a newly created post which will report directly to the group chairman.
And it's not without controversy, as the company remains mired in a legal battle over the alleged diversion of more than 230 million S$ to Salazar companies.
The possibility that Sos will reveal new embezzlement of funds in the coming months cannot be ruled out.
On the Salazar loan, former councillors Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representatives of the CCM and Unicaja) told the National Court yesterday that they had been informed of the misappropriation of 212 million without knowing where it was going.
The CNMV authorises the OP of exclusion of Paternina submitted by Inversora Mer
The National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) authorised yesterday the exclusion offer submitted by Inversora Mer to Federico Paternina on 9 October.
The Authority explained that it authorised this operation because it understood that its terms were in line with the standards in force and that it considered the content of the explanatory note submitted to it to be sufficient following the amendments applied on 2 December last.
The CNMV stated that the offer concerned the acquisition of 550 008 shares of Federico Paternina at a price of EUR 7.65 per share, representing 8.95% of the share capital, consisting of 6 142 786 shares admitted to trading on the Madrid and Bilbao stock exchanges.
He also explained that 5 592 778 million shares were frozen and could not be transferred in any way before the tender was finalised, the price of which he said had been fixed by Federico Paternina in accordance with the rules in force.
New tools for car expertise
In these days of bad weather and accidents, the garage is not the only one that benefits.
Every day, thousands of cars that have been involved in an accident are brought back to a garage, where an expert must assess the damage and the cost of repair.
Each claim is different, and calculating the cost of parts and labour time can be a long and complex job.
Calculating the cost of a repair between EUR 20 000 and EUR 30 000, including parts and labour, can take two to three hours.
However, with the help of the latest computer tools, this would be a matter of minutes.
This is why almost 100% of experts use this type of system.
The service providers and solutions for claims assessment and maintenance are dedicated to gathering the information provided by manufacturers, then processing it and offering it to their customers as a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, part of the North American Solera group, is the leading company; 80% of estimates are made with its products.
The other competitors in the field of tools for assessing and producing information on the sector are GTMotive and Eurotax.
Working with manufacturers' data is far from simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, commercial director of Audatex, the company in Spain has 63 manufacturers and importers, and each of them provides them with information in a different format.
In addition, the volume of data to be processed is constantly increasing, so that more versions, variants and engines have been launched in the last five years than in the previous fifteen years.
When a new car comes on the market, these companies get to work.
This is a very difficult job, because you have to catalogue every one of the thousand parts of the vehicle and put a price tag on it.
In addition, a graphic  intelligent  of each model is made on which the various parts of a passenger car can be clicked.
If it is a mass-selling model, the work can be done in a week if the process proceeds very quickly.
If it is a low-selling car, it can take three or four months.Currently, Audatex has complete information on 99.2% of cars sold in Spain.
For example, they have information on the most exclusive models, such as Porsches, but not on Ferraris or Lamborghinis.
For vehicles on the road, the figure is over 99%.
To carry out the documentation and database development work, Audatex has eight centres around the world (in Spain, France, Germany, the USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), each of which specialises in certain brands.
The national headquarters is located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than 100 technicians (usually mechanical experts) work simultaneously on three computer screens.
Audatex invests 90 million a year in developing these databases.
Every month, 2.5 million data are recorded, and customers receive updates every other day.
The development of this huge flow of information enables these companies to use it for different purposes and to offer a variety of products.
The most common application is for repair and maintenance, but depending on the country, there are also tools for managing scrap parts or calculating the sale or residual value of a car.
The only company that has a guide that gives information on the value of used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex doesn't offer it in our country, but they do in the United States.
Audatex's products make it easy to see what kind of support it can provide to industry professionals.
The company offers ten different tools, the flagship product being AudaPlus, the standard claims assessment solution for experts.
These include cars, motorcycles, light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of parts, it takes into account the manufacturer's estimated repair times or painting scales.
This tool is purchased according to its use, for each estimate.
The highest cost is EUR 5.75 for customers who use it only a few times, up to ten times a month.
Then each insurance company, which performs thousands of tests, negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the full identification of a vehicle and the equipment with which it left the assembly line, only by its chassis number.
AudaGlass focuses on vehicle glass, and AudaSubastas is an open server for the professional sector on the Internet that allows you to bid on vehicles declared wrecked.
Its statistics service is very useful for identifying trends, conducting geodemographic analyses or knowing common problems by brand or model.
It is possible to study, for example, how many models of a particular brand have gone to the garage for a breakdown or how many have suffered serious accidents for a given period.
GT Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tool.
It markets, amongst others, GT Estimate, which is also aimed at experts and provides digital images, as well as access to official parts, prices and times of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa group, founded in 1971 as a provider of claims, breakdowns and maintenance services and solutions.
The GT devaluation guide is a historical reference product on the market.
The company works with 24 000 users in garages, 3 100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Its turnover has been growing at a rate of 20% a year over the past three years, and it generated a turnover of EUR 10.8 million in 2008.
At the beginning of last year, it began its internationalisation process, with the opening of an office in Paris.
Audatex was founded in Germany in 1966 and established in Spain in 1979.
According to the company's sources, 62% of its turnover is generated in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38% in North and South America.
The Solera group (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will have a worldwide turnover of USD 557 million, up by 3.3% on 2008.
In our country, the company will receive EUR 19.1 million, 7.2% more than last year.
In 2005, the Solera Group was listed on the stock exchange at $1 billion, today its shares are valued at a total of $2.4 billion.
Since 2007, it has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange and is a component of the Standard & Poor's benchmark index.
Internet auctions of crashed cars
In October last year, the Solera group acquired Autoonline, an Internet platform for the sale of cars, motorcycles and special vehicles in disaster.
The transaction involved a cost of €59.5 million for 85% of the company's capital, which could be increased to the remaining 15% next year.
The aim of the acquisition was to offer more valueadded services to its customers, with the possibility of gaining access to a huge international market.
This estimation and sales service is intended exclusively for professionals in the sector, such as insurance companies, experts, rental companies, garages, salesmen and professional sellers who must be registered before starting operations.
The platform was set up in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650 000 transactions throughout Europe, including 500 000 in Germany.
Its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
There are currently over 1500 vendors and 4000 registered experts on the site.
It handles 3 000 ads a day and in the Spanish market 100 new ads are published every day.
According to Spanish law, a car with a chassis number removed can no longer be driven, but on the other hand, some parts that are not damaged can be used as spare parts.
Old cars can be re-registered, even if they have been withdrawn, after a complex procedure.
Four-stage garage door
With the Auda-Taller tool, Audatex ensures that the user gets a quote in just four steps: identify the vehicle, find the spare part, create a quote and generate it.
The ease of use is a key element of these systems, especially in convincing older professionals who are more or less reluctant to use new management techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, including 666 passenger cars, 109 off-road vehicles, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Of course, to use it, you need a computer and an Internet connection.
Once the model to be repaired has been identified by its chassis number, a real graphic image of the model in question appears and the part needed is selected.
The user can include variables such as labour price, increases or reductions, and then print the quote and give it to the customer.
AudaTaller is not an estimation tool like AudaPlus, but a reference catalogue.
The main difference between the two systems is that the one for garages does not include estimated man-hours.
The cost of using this tool for the garage is 350 euros per year, which can be credited.
The Audatex company is currently working on making these images three dimensional.
This is an innovation that mechanics are very keen on, as it will allow, for example, to select a door and rotate it to see the inside.
