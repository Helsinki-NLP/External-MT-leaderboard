This was mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of cases reported from Italy, but all other EU/EEA Member States and the UK also showed similar rising trends in cumulative COVID-19 outbreaks (request attached).
Figure 2 shows a comparison of the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK with infected cases in Italy in the period 31 January to 15 March 2020.
It explains that by 8:00 am on 15 March, 15 other EU/EEA member countries and the UK reported total cases that were comparable to Italy's figures in 3 weeks or less.
Our results show that the number of definite COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and UK is increasing rapidly.

A 2010-11 survey revealed a wide variation in access to ICU beds and Medium Care beds in Europe, varying from 29.2 beds in Germany to 4.2 beds in Portugal per 100,000 population.
This means that these countries have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 intensive care beds per 100,000 inhabitants in 2010).
Scenarios modeling related to saturation of health and treatment capacity with estimates for each EU/EEA Member State and UK in relation to the prevalence of COVID-19 hospitalized patients with a risk of > 90% exceeding the capacity of ICU beds were presented in the sixth ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment in relation to COVID-19.

The experience of the disease in Italy and the current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is spreading rapidly in the EU/EEA Member States and the UK.

As stated in the recent ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment, delaying the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is essential to a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach with a shift from restrictions to epidemic mitigation, as if the necessary measures are not taken in advance, the expected rapid increase in infection may not give decision-makers and hospitals sufficient opportunity to identify, accept and implement appropriate responses.

The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak caused by SARS-CoV-2 has caused over 3,000 deaths and over 80,000 illnesses in China and other parts of the world to date, leading to a humanitarian catastrophe.
SARS-CoV-2
COVID-19 is less severe and deadly than SARS, but is more contagious and infects older people and men more than younger people and women.

The virus has a high homology to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, on February 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) chose the name SARS-CoV-2 for it and the name of the related disease, CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19) (coronavirus disease-19 or COVID-19).
The epidemic started in Wuhan, China and quickly spread throughout the country and about 5 other countries around the world.

The World Health Organization has warned that COVID-19 is "public enemy number one" and its power is likely to be greater than terrorism.
According to the PubMed database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, over 200 scientific papers have been published on COVID-19, covering topics including virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment since the first article was reported on January 7, 2020 on determining the genomic sequence of the virus sampled from several patients.
This review aims to summarize research advances in new and relevant areas.
In the possible sections, we will try to compare COVID-19 to SARS and another coronavirus disease called Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS which became prevalent in 2012).
We will discuss what we have learned so far about disease prevention and diagnosis, as well as a number of critical questions that remain.

CoVs are a subfamily of large, coated viruses that contain a single strand of RNA.
They are classified into four genera, alpha, beta, gamma and delta, where alpha and beta coronavirus infect humans.
S
The viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after viral genome replication, the genomic RNA together with a coating of glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins form virion-containing vesicles which then fuse with the plasma membrane leading to the release of the new virus.
The first genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on 10 January 2020.
The findings showed that SARS-CoV-2 is a new variant of the beta coronavirus with a 99.98% similarity in 10 random samples from the original outbreak site at the Hunan seafood market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is more genetically similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 particles were detected in the superfine sections of the epithelium of the human airways by means of examination with a translucent electron microscope.
ACE2 in humans is known as the SARS-CoV-2 receptor and also as SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2s protein S, however, has a weaker binding to the human ACE2 receptor than SARS-CoV, which is consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV-2s cause a weaker disease than SARS-CoVs.
SARS-CoV-2 also produces a new short protein encoded by orf3b and a secretory protein encoded by orf8.
SARS-CoV-2 protein orf3b plays a role in the pathogenic properties of the virus and inhibits IFNβ (interferon beta) expression; however, orf8 does not contain any known dopamine or functional motif.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou and colleagues reported the cryomicroscopic structure of the human ACE2 receptor with a resolution of 2.9 ingstroms in complex with an amino acid carrier called B0AT1.
They found that the above complex, which has both open and closed configurations, is assembled as a dimer and the ACE2-B0AT1 complex can be attached to two S proteins which can be used as a benchmark for coronavirus detection and contamination.
B0AT1 may become a therapeutic target for drug screening for SARS-CoV-2 infection. B0AT1 may become a therapeutic target for drug screening for SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Source and intermediate host
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have been identified as both originating from bats and transmitted to humans through cats, zebras and camels respectively.

However, the 1% difference between the two genomes is still a large difference; therefore, it is expected that definite results will be provided for consistent evidence (Figure 3).

SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in-vitro for 48 hours in a dry environment, ranging from 5 days at a temperature below 20 degrees Celsius and a humidity of 50%-40%.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar characteristics.
SARS-CoV-2 is reported to be sensitive to the following agents that can effectively inactivate the virus: UV rays and exposure to 56°C for 30 minutes; ether, 75% ethanol, chlorine-containing disinfectant solution, plasticizing acid, chloroform and other fatty solvents, but chlorhexidine does not have this ability.

The general pattern of the virus is first detected by the host's innate immune system via pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) including the -C-type quasi-lectin receptors, the quasi-transitory receptor (TLR), the quasi-NOD receptor (NLR), and the quasi-RIG-I receptor (RLR).
The virus induces various pathways of function such as expression of inflammatory factors, dendritic cell maturation, and synthesis of type I interferons (IFNs) which limit the spread of the virus and accelerate phagocytosis of viral antigens by macrophages.

T-lymphocytes, which include CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to activate specific virus antibodies, and CD8+ T cells directly kill the virus infected cells.
T-cell helpers produce inflammatory cytokines to help cells defend themselves.

Immunity includes complementes including C3a and C5a, and antibodies also play a role in fighting viral infection.
For example, antibodies isolated from a recovered patient neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an overreaction of the immune system produces a large volume of localized free radicals which can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs and in the worst case, lead to multi-organ failure and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 is a cluster disease, and is more likely to occur in people with concomitant illnesses and pregnant women.
It is normal that people who are exposed to a large number of viruses or people whose immune functions are impaired have a higher chance of infection than others.
SARS-CoV-2 has an approximate average duration of 1 to 14 days, with a study of 425 initial patients in Wuhan showing that this duration is mostly 3 to 7 days.

A more recent study mentioned above, based on a demographic review of 8,866 patients, cited a common duration of 4.8 (7.2-3.0) days.
It is very important for health authorities to apply effective quarantine time based on the most accurate period of time to prevent transmission of virus to others by infected but asymptomatic individuals.
As a general procedure, people who are found to be infected or infected should be quarantined for 14 days.
Should the quarantine period be increased to 24 days?
Tiberasometimes is the primary symptom of COVID-19, which may occur alone or be accompanied by other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, diarrhea, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.
Some patients developed shortness of breath and/or tissue oxygen deprivation within a week of onset of disease.
In severe cases, symptoms of acute respiratory syndrome, infectious shock, metabolic acidosis, and blood clotting disorder were observed in patients.

Similar findings have been reported in two recent studies on a family cluster and a cluster formed by transmission through asymptomatic individuals.

80% needed respiratory support, which was much higher than COVID-19 patients and corresponded to a higher mortality rate for MERS compared to COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and gout (21%) were also observed in patients with MERS.

In the early stages, the number of ambient white blood cells (especially lymphocytes) in patients is normal or reduced.
For example, lymphopenia with less than 10<sup>9</sup> × 4 cells per liter including less than 10<sup>9</sup> × 1 cells per liter and increased concentrations of aminotransferase aspartate and viremia (virus observation in blood) were observed in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
The levels of hepato-musculoskeletal enzymes and myoglobin in the blood rose in some patients and the C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation in the blood rose in most patients.
In severely ill vertebrates, the levels of D-dimer, a product of the breakdown of fibrin in the blood, were elevated and the number of lymphocytes was gradually decreasing.

Patientes se caracterizan por la pneumonía no crónica, lesión respiratoria aguda y síndrome de trastorno respiratorio agudo (SRAAD).

It has been proven that cytokine storm in SARS and MERS patients is caused by an overreaction of the immune system.
Cytocin storm is a type of systemic inflammatory reaction characterized by the release of a series of cytokines including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune system cells to release free radicals in abundance, which is the main cause of ARDS and various organ failure.
Immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of cytokine storm, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and tosilezomab, a monoclonal anti-IL6 antibody, have been used for the treatment of cytokine storm.
Other immunosuppressive therapeutic approaches for cytokine storm include: T cell-mediated immune response modulation; IFN-γ, IL-1 and TNF inhibition; JAK inhibition; Blenatomib; cytokine signaling inhibitor 4; and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids as immune system suppressant medications have been widely used in the treatment of SARS with the aim of reducing the severity of inflammatory damage.

Remdesivir is a novel antiviral drug developed by Gilead and primarily for the treatment of diseases caused by the Ebola and Marburg viruses.
Sometime later, it was discovered that Remdesivir might also have an inhibitory effect on other single stranded RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS viruses.
Gilead then made the compound available to China for testing in two clinical trials on SARS-CoV-2 infected vertebrates and the results were perfectly expected.

Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse reactions may occur following combination therapy with lupinavir/ritonavir.
The interactions between this medication and other medications used by the patient should be carefully studied.
Plasma from recovered patients and antibody production

In fact, recovered patients often have relatively high levels of antibodies to fight the pathogen in their blood.
Antibodies are immunoglobulins (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to fight against pathogens and other foreign particles that identify and directly neutralize unique molecules in pathogens.

Based on clinical studies done so far, the following factors may affect or be related to the diagnosis of COVID-19 patients (Table 3):
Age: Age is the most important factor for the prediction of SARS, as is COVID-19.
Covid-19 is predominantly occurring in the 65-30 age bracket, with 47.7% being infected amongst individuals taller than 50 years in a study involving 8866 patients described above.
Patients requiring intensive care were more likely to suffer from seizures and context-related complications and were older than non-intensive patients (with a median age of 66 versus 51 years), suggesting that age could be considered as a predictor for the outcome of COVID-19 patients.
Gender: As mentioned above, SARS-CoV-2 infected men more than women (0.31 per 100,000 compared to 0.27 per 100,000).
Tumor and complications: COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care are at increased risk of acute cardiac injury or arrhythmia.Tumor and complications: COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care are at increased risk of acute cardiac injury or arrhythmia.
Heart problems were also the leading cause of death in patients with SARS.
SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to also bind to ACE2-positive clenbuterols, which may lead to hepatic impairment in COVID-19 patients.
It should be noted that age and disease have a strong correlation and may interfere with each other.
Anormal lab findings: The level of reactive protein C in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue damage and has been suggested as a potential diagnostic factor for disease, response to treatment and ultimate improvement.
It has been suggested that there is a correlation between CRP levels and severity and COVID-19 prognosis.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
These enzymes are highly expressed in several tissues, particularly in the heart and liver, and are released during tissue damage.
,
Clinical symptoms: Chest X-ray and timing of clinical symptoms should be considered along with other relevant issues to predict the consequences and complications of COVID-19.
Use of steroids: As described above, steroids are immune system suppressants that are commonly used as complementary therapy to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage in the fight against infectious diseases.

The most optimistic estimate is that the outbreak will end by March and the phase of analysis will last for 3 to 4 months.
However, some experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter et al. estimate that the COVID-19 epidemic, which is significantly more contagious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Langini and colleagues designed a model to predict the outcome of an epidemic, suggesting that the SARS-CoV-2 virus could infect two-thirds of the world's population.

The COVID-19 epidemic comparison with SARS and MERS is shown below (Figure 5).
SARS-CoV-2 has a high transmission rate via cough or sneezing and is likely to be transmitted through direct contact with virus-infected material.
The virus was also found in the feces, raising the possibility of new transmission from the gastrointestinal tract.
A recent study on 138 patients reported that 41% of people were likely to have contracted the disease through hospital infections, including 17 patients with other diseases and 40 from healthcare.

The first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is by wearing face masks; the use of both surgical masks and respiratory masks N95 (series number 1860s) helps to control the spread of viruses.
Surgical masks prevent airborne transmission of respiratory fluid droplets from potentially infected vertebrae to others or from sticking these droplets to surfaces of materials and then after being transmitted to others.

This message made the public warning not taken too seriously, especially as the whole country was preparing for the Spring New Year Festival and thus a crucial opportunity to prevent the spread of the disease on its minimal scale in Wuhan was missed.
China's disease control agencies may have learned this hard lesson and made key improvements for future actions.

COVID-19 affects older men and women more than younger men and women, and also has a higher severity and mortality rate in older men than younger men.
SARS has a higher mortality rate than COVID-19 (10.91 vs. 1.44%).
Covid-19 patients transmit the disease even when they are asymptomatic, whereas SARS patients usually transmit when the disease is very severe, making it much harder to prevent the spread of COVID-19 compared to SARS.
This partially explains why SARS-CoV-2 spreads much faster and on a wider scale than SARS-CoV.
In some COVID-19 patients, the usual RNA test for the SARS-CoV-2 virus may be associated with a negative result.
On the other hand, recovered patients can be re-infected with the virus.

The outbreaks of acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) are shown on the other coin and indicate the extent of the devastation and potential risk of a human coronavirus infection.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China in late 2019 has put the coronavirus back in the spotlight and surprised us with its long transmission, but its pathogenicity is less than its sister SARS-CoV.
HCoVs are zoonotic and understanding the zoonotic origin of HCoVs can help us well.
Most human coronaviruses originate from bats, which are nonpathogenic.
Some HCoVs are also known as source reservoir hosts.
Identification of host animals directly contributes to the prevention of human disease.

CoVs belong to the family Coronaviridae, which includes a group of single-stranded sub-positive RNA coated viruses.
These viruses, which have the largest genome of 26 to 32 kB among RNA viruses, were named "CoVs (coronavirus) " or coronaviruses under the electron microscope, due to their crown-like morphology.
️Structurally, coronavirus have single-piece genomes that have a similar organization.
About two-thirds of the genome including the two open reading frames are overlapping (ORF1a and ORF1b) which are translated into pp1a and pp1ab polyprotein replicas.
Polyproteins are further processed to produce 16 non-structural proteins, designated nsp1 through 16.
The remaining protein of the genome, including ORFs, is for structural proteins, including spike (S), viral envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleoprotein (N).

The other five beta-CoVs are HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, SARS-CoV (severe acute respiratory syndrome causative coronavirus), MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms such as regular vomiting and/or diarrhea.
SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic and cause severe infection of the lower respiratory tract in almost as many patients and greatly increase the risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and extrapulmonary manifestations.
The first strain of HCoV-229E, B814, was isolated from the nasal mucosa of patients infected with sputum in the mid-1960s.

The 2003 SARS outbreak is one of the most devastating of the modern era, with more than 8,000 people infected and a mortality rate of about 10%.
Ten years later, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak led to a sustained outbreak in the Arabian Peninsula, and rare cases spread to the rest of the world.
The novel human coronavirus 2019 ( 2019-nCoV), later renamed SARS-CoV-2, is the causative agent of the ongoing epidemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has claimed the lives of 3,120 people and infected over 91,000 people as of 3 March 2020.
The alarm has been sounded and the world must prepare for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven human coronaviruses have animal origins from bats, mice, and domestic animals.

The COVID-19 epidemic has brought enormous medical, scientific, social and moral challenges to China and the world.

HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old baby in the Netherlands in late 2004.
It was first observed to be common in young children, elderly and patients with weakened immune system or respiratory disease.
Shock, inflammation, fever and bronchiolitis are common in the disease caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study described isolating a similar virus from a sample of nasal mucus from an 8-month-old infant who had a chest infection in the Netherlands.
Although the case was identified in the Netherlands, it has actually spread worldwide.
HCoV-NL63 is estimated to be the cause of about 4.7% of respiratory tract diseases, with its prevalence peaking in early summer, spring, and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is also associated with laryngitis insidida, also known as laryngitis.

HCoV-HKU1 was identified as causing mild respiratory disease worldwide, as were HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43.
All four cases of mass-transmitted HCoVs adapted well to humans and are generally less likely to mutate to cause long-acting pathogens, although for unknown reasons there have been rare cases of a long-acting subtype of HCoV-NL63, recently reported in China due to severe infection of the lower respiratory tract.
Summonly, when these HCoVs gain the ability to transmit effectively and maintain their continuity in humans, their infectivity or pathogenicity decreases.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 in Saudi Arabia, from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient who had acute chest and pelvic dysfunction and a pulmonary insufficiency.

A second-degree outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of MERS are similar to SARS, which is characterized by a progressive acute chest and neck.
Unlike SARS, many MERS patients develop severe pollen insufficiency, which is unique to MERS among HCoV outbreaks.
Over 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting.


The World Health Organization (WHO) has designated the SARS-CoV-2 respiratory tract infection outbreak as an international public health emergency and has named the disease COVID-19.

It is worth noting that the mortality rate in Hubei, China is 4.2% compared to 1.2% abroad.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infections, which manifest in the form of fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Diarrhoea has also been observed in some patients.
Symptoms include chest pain and cough, which can quickly become acute respiratory syndrome.

SARS-CoV-2 is clearly less pathogenic than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV but is more likely to be transmissible.

First, the incubation period and duration of HCoV are very similar.
SARS-CoV-2 represents a general trend of the other human coronaviruses.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is between SARS-CoV and four mass-pandemic human coronaviruses (including HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
SARS-CoV-2 infection, on the one hand, exhibits characteristics that are usually seen more frequently during mass HCoV infection, including the presence of non-specific, mild or even absence of symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subset of severe COVID-19 cases may also be considered as SARS-CoV infection, although the proportion is slightly lower.
Thirdly, transmission of SARS-CoV-2 continues to show interesting patterns that are indicative of both mass-spreading HCoVs and SARS-CoVs.
SARS-CoV-2, on the other hand, has a transmissibility at least as high as other HCoVs with mass prevalence.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Finally, SARS-CoV-2 can be identified in the gut samples, like other human coronaviruses.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
It is also interesting to see if SARS-CoV-2 will show seasonality, like the mass-spread human coronaviruses.
SARS-CoV-2 characteristics including transmissibility, pathogenicity and sustained spread after human transmission will influence the ultimate fate of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak.
All four HCoVs have adapted well to humans with mass outbreaks that cause mild symptoms.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
In other words, both could be survivors of the old HCoV pandemic.
HCoVs that cause severe disease in humans and humans that have been infected with severe HCoVs were excluded from the study.
To this end, HCoVs must replicate sufficiently in humans to allow for the accumulation of adaptive mutations that neutralize host limiting factors.
In this case, the more stable the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak becomes and the more people become infected, the greater the chance the virus has to complement humans.

These viruses do not require an animal reservoir.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, on the other hand, are not well adapted to humans and their transmission cannot be stable in humans.
They must keep themselves in animal reservoirs and reproduce, usually through one or more intermediate hosts and reproducers, seeking an opportunity to transmit to sensitive human destinations.
SARS-CoV-2 shares similar characteristics with SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and the four mass-transmitted human coronaviruses.

An animal is considered an evolutionary host of a human coronavirus if it is the host of a close ancestor with high homology at the nucleotide sequence level.
Ancestral virus is usually well adapted to the host and is nonpathogenic.
Similarly, the reservoir host will keep the HCoV continuously for a long time.
In both cases, hosts are naturally infected and act as the natural host of the HCoV or its parent virus.
On the other hand, if the HCoV is recently, before or approximately simultaneously with introduction to humans, transmitted to an intermediate host, it does not adapt well to the new host and is often pathogenic.
The intermediate host can act as an animal source for human infection and act as a replicator host allowing the virus to temporarily replicate and then transmit to humans to increase the scale of infection in humans.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
HCoVs, on the other hand, can adapt to intermediate hosts and even cause long-term native disease.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes a natural reservoir host.

Paguma larvata and a raccoon dog in live animal markets were first identified as carriers of SARS-CoV-like viruses that are nearly identical to SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly proven by the fact that no further SARS cases were reported after all the zebras in the market were killed.

It turns out that all of these are the ultimate hosts of SARS-CoV.
The search for a natural animal host for SARS-CoV led to the discovery of a very close relative bat coronavirus called HKU3-associated bat coronavirus Rhinolophus (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which is found in Chinese horseshoe bats.

Human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known as the SARS-CoV receptor.
WIV1 was found to use bat ACE2, bat scavenger, and human as receptors for cell entry.

Bat-HKU4 and MERS-CoV both use a similar host receptor, called dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), for virus entry.
RNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequences for MERS-CoV are phylogenetically closer to bat-type coronaviruses identified in Europe and Africa.
To date, no live MERS-CoV has been found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and its closest bat relative CoV-HKU25 share only 87% homology of nucleotide sequence.
,

Live MERS-CoVs similar to those found in humans were taken from a mountain camel's nose sample, suggesting camels serve as the true reservoir hosts for MERS-CoVs.
It should be noted that in general, mild but at the same time severe viral replication was observed in the strains that were experimentally infected with MERS-CoV.

SARS-CoV-2 exhibits nucleotide homology of 96.2% with the bat coronavirus RaTG13 isolated from Rhinolophus affinis bats.
Like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence discrepancy between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too large to consider a parental relationship.
In other words, bats may not be the first hosts of the SARS-CoV-2 reservoir unless similar bat coronaviruses are found in the future.

A previous study on patient pangolins also reported the detection of viral contents from lung samples which were found to be similar to SARS-CoV-2.
The study used different collection methods and manual selection to create a partial genome sequence that took up about 86.3% of the viral genome's complement length.
The possibility that pangolin is an intermediate animal host for SARS-CoV-2 cannot be ruled out.

The high degree of similarity between SARS-CoV-2 related beta-CoV RBDs in the pangolin and SARS-CoV-2 is thought to be due to evolutionary homology with selection mediation.

Nootropy is being promoted as an evolutionary force winner among beta coronaviruses.

The history of interspecies transmission of HCoV-229E is not well understood.
Bat alpha coronaviruses were found to be closely related to SARS-CoV-2.

First, humans may have come into contact with bats, not alpacas, due to the presence of a common ecological niche.

Secondly, bat alpha coronaviruses related to HCoV-229E are diverse and non-infectious in bats, whereas alpha alpaca coronaviruses caused outbreaks of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, no cases of alpaca coronavirus have been observed in wild animals.

actually, bats are the direct source of human pathogenic viruses, including the herpes virus, Ebola virus, Nepa virus, and the Hendra virus.
It is therefore not surprising that bats may have transmitted HCoV-229E directly to humans.
Alpha bat coronavirus, on the other hand, acts as a gene reservoir for HCoV-229E, but alpacas and unicamels can act as mediator hosts that transmit viruses to humans, as happened with MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is an excellent example of interspecies transmission from bats to mountain camels and later from mountain camels to humans.

It is clear that bats are a rich source of viral species for interspecies exchange of genetic fragments and interspecies transmission.
Long life, crowded colonies, close social interaction and strong ability to fly, all make bats ideal as ""virus transmitters"".
MERS-CoV, on the other hand, has been established in camels for decades.
The virus has adapted well to these camels, which have evolved from an intermediate host to a stable, natural reservoir host.
MERS-CoV is a mild pathogen and has a relatively low mutation rate in these animals.


Especially, beta coronaviruses are highly pathogenic in pangolins.
They may be hosts of the SARS-CoV-2 alpha coronaviruses, similar to the SARS-CoV algae.

SARS-CoV-2 may be contagious in many mammals, including domestic animals and pets.
A study on domestic and wild animals is needed to investigate antibodies.
Third, the above mentioned, SARS-CoV-2's neuropsychological and adaptation may have occurred in a third species that has been in contact with both bats and pangolins.

Coronavirus has an unreadable exoribonuclease, and removing it would lead to mutation and severe debilitation or even its extinction.
Significantly, the nucleotide analogue called Remdesivir is known to suppress the process of replication of the coronavirus by inhibiting exoribonuclease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the best medicines to combat SARS-CoV-2 that should be clinically tested.

Teoretically, it is unlikely that genetic mutation can quickly neutralize vaccines and SARS-CoV-2 antivirals.
Secondly, the large RNA genome in coronaviruses makes it more flexible in genome editing for mutations or neuropsychology, thus increasing the likelihood of co-evolution between species, which helps the emergence of new coronaviruses when conditions are right.
This is supported by the abundance of unique open reading frameworks and protein functions encoded towards the 3′ end of the genome.
Third, through a "copy-selection" mechanism, the coronaviruses randomly and repeatedly convert patterns during RNA replication.
On the host, which acts as a marker for mixing, string transformation occurs frequently during transcription of the coronavirus RNA.
RNAs of long homology and complement length and subgenome can combine to produce new coronaviruses.
Evidence of natural neurocompositional phylogenetics was observed, both in HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43 and also in animal coronaviruses such as bat SL-CoV and bat CoV-HKU9.

RBD interacts with the cellular receptor in the S protein of a coronavirus and is highly selective in response to the host antibody.
SARS-CoV possesses RBD at 318 to 510 amino acids on S1 segment, which causes binding of human ACE2 and also common receptors for virus entry.
SARS-CoV receptor binding domain is able to detect ACE2 receptors in various animals including bats, zebras, mice and dog raccoons, which makes it possible for the virus to be transmitted between species.

SARS-CoV possesses two mutations, K479N and S487T, in its RBD, which may increase the dependence of the spike protein interaction with human ACE2 receptors.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutes could play a vital role in viral adaptation to humans.
It is important to note that the cell receptor of SARS-CoV-2 is identical to SARS-CoV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of protein S suggests that the tendency to bind its S protein to human ACE2 has likely changed.

It will also be interesting to determine whether other auxiliary receptors are necessary for transmission compared to the high mutation rate in SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-NL63 also binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), but with a different part of the S.
There are many other HCoV receptors including aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E and 9-O-acetylsialic acid for HCoV-OC43.
This could be the reason why these coronaviruses have been successful in adapting to humans after interspecies transmission from the host animal.

It should also be warned that artificial selection can play a role in causing unwanted changes in viral genomes, which are most likely the result of releasing viruses from selective stresses, for example by the host immune system.
An example of these effects is the complete length loss of ORF4 in the HCoV-229E prototype strand, which occurs due to the removal of two nucleotides.
Although healthy ORF4 can be seen in bat and camel viruses related to HCoV-229E, the alpha alpaca coronavirus has a nucleotide layer that causes a mutation in the reading frame.
Recently, the evolution of emergent human coronaviruses is also undergoing selection pressure on their reservoir hosts.

Coronavirus are not pathogenic or cause very mild symptoms in their reservoir hosts such as bats and camels.
They reproduce violently without creating a strong defensive response from the host.
There are puzzles as to why asymptomatic vectors are seen and what causes severe cases in human infection.
Symptoms are usually due to overactivation of the immune system response and cytokine storm, where the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung damage.
In contrast, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response is isolated from the replication of the coronavirus.
The same strategy for isolating the immune response may have positive effects on the anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
The interferon response in bats is particularly strong.

Especially, bat coronaviruses are very diverse with the possibility of transmission from animals to humans.
There are many opportunities for these animal coronaviruses to evolve or become neuropsychological, leading to the emergence of new coronaviruses that are more transmissible and/or lethal to humans in the future.
The eating culture of wild animals in some parts of China should be abandoned to reduce the amount of unnecessary contact between humans and animals.


They stay in their natural reservoirs to spread.
Though bats have many characteristics that contribute to the spread of viruses, if people are trained to stay away from these animals, the likelihood of human contact with bats and other wildlife species can be minimized.

According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to confirm a suspected case, each of the features of the epidemic history must be combined with two of the clinical signs to allow a comprehensive analysis, or in the absence of an epidemic history, three of the clinical signs must be present.
History of epidemiology: (1) A history of travel or stay in Wuhan and its surrounding areas or other communities where COVID-19 cases have been reported in the last 14 days before symptoms began there; (2) A history of contact with individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 (with positive nucleic acid testing); (3) A history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms from Wuhan and its surrounding areas or other communities where COVID-19 was reported in the last 14 days before symptoms began there; (4) A history of contact with a cluster of confirmed cases (2 cases of fever and/or respiratory symptoms within 2 weeks in small areas such as home, workplace, school, etc.).
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The confirmed diagnosis must be based on a suspected case with one of the following pathogenic or serological events: (1) a positive real-time PCR test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) a viral genome sequence showing high homogeneity to the novel coronavirus; (3) a positive result for specific IgM antibody and IgG antibody to SARS-CoV-2 in a serum test; or a conversion of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibody from negative to positive or a tetracycline increase of 4 times or more at a higher than this value in the acute phase.
We can see that instant PCR testing, for nucleic acid in the respiratory system or blood sample has been added to the second edition (18 January 2020) and third edition (22 January 2020).
Pathogenic diagnosis of blood samples was added to the fourth edition (27 January 2020) and fifth edition (8 February 2020); and then serological evidence was added to the seventh edition.
The improvements are based on the researchers' continuous efforts to search for an optimized nucleic acid diagnostic kit for rapid detection, as well as respiratory system samples including blood sampling, which led to the emergence of confirmed criteria with increased availability of different samples and greater support in relying on a positive antibody result.

The flow chart of Zhou and colleagues should therefore be updated, as they classified a person without clinical symptoms as low risk.
The scoring system also needs to be validated in further clinical actions and studies.

Woolworths also restricted the purchase of bath towels for door delivery to one package per order on Wednesday.
The conversions followed the previous four packages for each transaction restriction introduced on March 4 and 5 respectively by Woolworths and Coles.
Coles Supermarkets in a media interview on 8 March reported that despite the four-pack restriction, "many stores reach supplement sales within an hour of goods delivery", calling the demand ""unprecedented"", while ALDI chain stores, in their Facebook post on Tuesday, called the sale ""unprecedented"".
According to a spokesperson for Woolworth, sales rose with a "steep incline".
The Costco store in Canberra also limited the allowable quantity to two packages last week.
To reduce this shortage, Coles ordered larger packages from suppliers and increased frequency of delivery, Woolworth ordered additional warehouses and Aldi pre-stocked for Wednesday special offer.
Rachel Zimmerman, CEO of the Australian Retailers Association, said retailers are trying to increase inventory, but local authorities' restrictions regarding truck traffic times have made it difficult.
He expects production costs to rise, as suppliers try to meet demand and have fewer special cases.


He noted that bathroom towels are a bulky commodity that takes up a small amount of space in a large space. If sold, the large space will empty shelves and cause a feeling of scarcity.
Rachel Zimmerman told ABC News, "Coles and Woolworth believe that if there were enough goods on the shelves, if there were and are enough supplies of products like toilet towels and disinfectants, you could probably minimize this buying panic".
The manufacturer of recycled toilet towels Who Gives a Crap stated on Wednesday that their stock was exhausted.
According to News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, the maker of Clinix bath towels and Solaris Piper, the maker of Sorbent, emphasized that they work 24 hours a day, seven days a week to meet the market demand.

Thursday's edition of NT News, a Darwin newspaper, included an eight-page appendix intended for use as a toilet towel.
According to ABC Australia on 3 March, stores were initially reluctant to impose restrictions and stated that they had no plans to impose any purchase restrictions.
Russell Zimmerman:Other products such as masks, disinfectants, dryers, powders and hand washing liquid are in high demand.
Similarly, outside Australia, it was observed that on Sunday evening the British online supermarket Okado limited the purchase of bath towels to two packs of 12.
The World Health Organization declares a COVID-19 pandemic


"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Tedros Adhanom, Director General of the World Health Organization believes that "if countries act towards identifying, testing, treating, isolating, tracking and mobilizing individuals for the purpose of responding".
"We are deeply concerned about the alarming levels of outbreak and severity, as well as the alarming levels of inaction".
According to Dr. Tom Friedman, former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, this pandemic was ""unprecedented"".
He said, in a statement released by CNN in February, "Besides influenza, no other respiratory virus has been identified from the onset of symptoms to the ongoing global outbreak".
Ghebreyesus made a similar comment, saying: "We've never seen a coronavirus pandemic before".
He continued, "We have never seen a pandemic that could be controlled simultaneously".
The new status as a pandemic follows the decision of the World Health Organization to declare the outbreak a public health emergency on an international scale in January.
Dr. Anthony Fosse, Director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, commented on the outbreak,"It's getting worse".
As of Thursday, the Associated Press reported that there were at least 126,000 COVID-19 cases worldwide, resulting in over 4,600 deaths.

The virus outbreak was detected in Wuhan, China in December 2019, declared a national public health emergency of concern on January 30, 2020, and declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020.


China had a mortality rate of 4%, however, globally it varies from 13.4% in Algeria to 0.08% in New Zealand.
Symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Combined diseases include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.

Primary care is actually a form of symptom management and a supportive treatment.The recommended preventive measures include washing hands, covering the mouth when coughing, keeping distance from others, and screening and quarantining people who are suspected to be infected.

The pandemic has led to severe global socioeconomic disruption, postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, and widespread shortages in resources caused by panic shopping.
Schools and universities have closed in 193 countries either nationally or locally, affecting approximately 99.4% of the global student population.Schools and universities have closed in 193 countries either nationally or locally, affecting approximately 99.4% of the global student population.



The patients were mainly associated with the Hunan seafood wholesale market, so it is thought that the virus originated from zoonosis (a common human-animal disease).
The virus that caused the epidemic is known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus with characteristics very similar to bat coronavirus, pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV. It was later found that the first person who showed symptoms was infected on December 1, 2019, and that person had no apparent contact with the seafood cluster.
From the initial group of cases reported in December 2019, it was found that two-thirds of infections were market-related.

Important reports may not be reported as a supplement, especially in cases with milder symptoms.

Cases are those in the population who have been tested for COVID-19 and whose testing has been confirmed and declared positive in accordance with official protocols.

A study published on 16 March showed that in China, as of 23 January, about 86% of COVID-19 infections had gone undetected and these undocumented infections were the source of infection for 79% of the documented cases.

Data awal dari Italia menunjukkan angka kematian akibat pandemi 5-4 kali lipat dari angka kematian akibat COVID yang telah diumumkan secara resmi.
A spokesperson for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledged that ""we know that [the prevalence] is lower than the actual figure"". The reported reports of false numbers in the US confirm these statements. This lower than the actual estimate, often occurs in pandemics such as the H1N1 swine flu epidemic. The first confirmed death was reported on 9 January 2020 in Wuhan.

The Centre for Applied Medicine at Oxford University estimates the fatality rate for a global pandemic as a whole to be between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The higher estimates of this range are consistent with the results of randomized COVID-19 testing in Germany and a statistical study analysing the effect of this test on the estimates of CFR.
The World Health Organization acknowledged that the global pandemic is manageable.
The peak and end times of the outbreak are unknown and may vary by location.
Maciej Boni, Penn State University, admitted: "If not monitored, outbreaks of infectious diseases typically remain unchanged after a period of time and decline after the end of existing hosts".

"Generally, physical distancing and other measures will be necessary until a vaccine is available (about 18 months or longer) ", according to a study conducted by Imperial College led by Neil Ferguson".
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University commented, "I believe it is unlikely that the virus will disappear completely - because it is so contagious" and "it is possible that it will become a seasonal disease that reappears every year".
The severity of the re-infection depends on the herd's immunity and the degree of mutation.
COVID-19 symptoms can be relatively nonspecific and infected individuals may be asymptomatic.
The two common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Symptoms with less prevalence include fatigue, respiratory distress (confusion), loss of sense of smell, shortness of breath, joint pain, sore throat, headache, tremor, vomiting, bloody vomiting, diarrhea or cyanosis.The World Health Organization states that almost one in six people will become seriously ill and experience respiratory distress.
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) classifies emergency symptoms as breathing difficulties, persistent chest pain or feeling pressured, sudden confusion, difficulty waking from sleep, and bruising of the face or lips; in the presence of these symptoms, urgent medical attention is recommended. Further progression of the disease can lead to severe chest pains, acute respiratory syndrome, spasm, septic shock, and death.

The proportion of asymptomatic patients in China was estimated to be as low as 44%.
The incubation period (time between infection and onset of symptoms) usually varies from one to fourteen days; in the majority of cases it is five days. An example of uncertainty is the estimated fraction of COVID-19 people who have lost their sense of smell, which has been reduced to 30% initially and later to 15%.

It is believed that in the early stages, the spread of the virus is through close contact with droplets produced when coughing, sneezing or talking, but only if close contact is considered to be between 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have shown that when coughing without covering, droplets can move from 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some have suggested that the virus may also be transmitted via tiny fluid droplets that are spread, for example, during speech and remain suspended in the air for longer periods.The respiratory droplets may be spread during breathing and speaking, although the virus is not normally spread via the air.
These droplets may enter the mouth or nose of people close to us and be absorbed into the lungs.
Some medical procedures such as tubal and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may cause airway respiratory secretions and consequently lead to airway discharge.

The disease is thought to have originated from zoonosis, or a disease shared by humans and livestock.
Genetic analysis has shown that the coronavirus genetically forms a cluster with the genus Betacoronavirus and the subgenus Sarbecovirus (subgenus B) together with two strains of bat origin.
The virus has 96% genome-wide similarity to other bat coronavirus (BatCov RaTG13).

Virus infection can be diagnosed temporarily based on symptoms, although definitive diagnosis is confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (Rrt-PCR) infectious secretions or CT imaging.
A study comparing polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with CT scan (CT) in Wuhan showed that CT is more sensitive than PCR, although less specialized, and has many of its visual features overlap with other types of breast and disease processes.
"March 2020 the American College of Radiology recommended that ""CT should not be used for screening or front-line testing for COVID-19"".
The World Health Organization has published several protocols for RNA testing for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was on January 17.
The test uses reverse transcription RNA (rRT-PCR) chain reaction.
The test can be done on respiratory or blood samples.
Results are usually provided within a few hours to a few days.

Synthetic neural networks based on AI were developed to detect visual characteristics of the virus in radiology and CT images.
Strategies to prevent transmission include general personal hygiene, hand washing, not touching your eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands, and coughing or sneezing on towels and quickly throwing towels in the garbage.
To those who may have already been infected, it is advised to use surgical masks in public.

The use of mobile phone location data by governments for this purpose has raised concerns about privacy, with Amnesty International and over 100 other organisations issuing a statement calling for restrictions on such surveillance measures.

Users will then receive a message asking if they have recently had direct contact with a person who tested positive for COVID-19. There are common misconceptions about how to prevent infection, for example, washing the nose and throat with mouthwash is not effective.

CDC also recommends using alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available.
The World Health Organization recommends people avoid touching their eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The surfaces can be disinfected with a number of solutions (one minute exposure to disinfectant for stainless steel surfaces), including 62-71% ethanol, 50-100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide and 0.2%-7.5% povidone iodine.
Other solutions such as benzalkonium chloride and chloroxydine gluconate are less effective.
CDC recommends that if a person is suspected of COVID or has been confirmed in a place such as an office or a treatment center, all areas such as offices, health services, outreach areas, shared electronic equipment such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls and ATM machines used by patients should also be sanitized.
Health organizations have advised people to cover their mouth and nose with a towel or a handkerchief when coughing or sneezing and to immediately throw away their paper towels.
Chirurgical masks are recommended for people who may have been infected as masks can reduce the volume and distance of respiratory droplets when speaking, sneezing and coughing.
The World Health Organization has issued guidelines regarding when and how to use masks.

Many governments have already mandated or recommended social distancing in quarantine areas that are affected by the outbreak.

"The use of the term ""social distancing"" has given rise to the notion that individuals should participate in complementary social isolation rather than being encouraged to communicate with others through alternative means."Some authorities have issued sexual hygiene guidelines during the pandemic."

It may be possible to apply a combination of restrictive and mitigating measures simultaneously.
Pandemic suppression requires more stringent measures to get the pandemic baseline replication rate below 1.Part of pandemic management is to reduce the pandemic peak, also called the epidemic curve smoothing.
This reduces the risk of healthcare overload and gives more time to develop vaccines and treatments.
Interventions non-pharmacological that may control the spread of the virus include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks and quarantine; public measures aimed at physical distancing such as school closures and cancellation of mass events; public participation to encourage admission and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such as cleaning of surfaces.The major part of the serious measures aimed at containment of the outbreak in China was implemented when the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as the quarantine of entire cities and travel bans.

South Korea has turned to public screening and local quarantines and warned against the frequent and displacement of infected people.
Singapore has provided financial support for cases that self-quarantined and imposed heavy fines for individuals who ignored quarantining.
Taiwan increased the production of masks and imposed heavy fines for the confiscation of medical equipment.Simulations carried out in relation to the UK and the US showed that reducing the epidemic (reducing rather than stopping the epidemic) and curbing (reversing the epidemic) pose major challenges.

It can be suppressed, but it should continue as long as the virus is circulating between humans (or until a vaccine is developed, whichever comes first), otherwise when some of the strict measures are eased, the virus will re-peak and spread.
Long-term intervention to combat pandemics has social and economic costs.
No specific antiviral drug has been approved for COVID-19, but efforts are underway, including testing of the available drug.
Pulmonary anticoagulants, fluids and rest can be effective in relieving symptoms.Pulmonary anticoagulants without prescription, fluid drinking and rest can be effective in relieving symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids, and assisted breathing may be necessary.
The use of steroids may exacerbate the complications.

#ChineseDontComeToJapan (Boyfriend: Don't Come To Japan) was a Twitter trending topic in Japan.


Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses containing Ukrainian and foreign citizens evacuated from Wuhan and transferred to Novi Senjari.

Dilip Ghosh, the head of the Bharatiya Janata Party's state branch in South Bengal, stated that the Chinese destroyed nature and ""that is why God took revenge on them""".
"The remarks were later condemned by the Chinese Consulate in Calcutta and called ""a mistake""."""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The results are usually announced after a few hours or up to 2 days.
RT-PCR testing performed with throat-only sampling in the first week of disease is reliable.
The virus may then disappear in the throat, although it continues to replicate in the lungs.
For infected cases tested in the second week, sample material can be obtained from the lower respiratory tract by inhalation catheter or exhalation.
One of the first PCR tests was prepared in January 2020 by Charité in Berlin, which used reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) and provided the basis for the manufacture of 250,000 kits which were distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
UK has also developed a test as of 23 January 2020. Kogenebiotech in South Korea has also developed a clinical-grade SARS-CoV-2 detection kit, based on PCR called PowerChek Coronavirus, on 28 January 2020.
"E"gene, which is present in all beta coronavirus variants, and the RdRp gene, which is only present in SARS-CoV-2.In China, BGI Group was the first company to receive emergency use approval from the China National Medicinal Products Organization for a SARS-CoV-2 basic PCR detection kit.In the United States, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is authorizing its own Real-Time RT-PCR detection panel for novel coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) through the International Reagent Resource in public health laboratories.
One of the three genetic tests in the older versions of the test kits was left incomplete due to a defect in the identifier, causing the trials at the Atlanta CDC to have problems; this caused the number of samples that were successfully evaluated to drop by an average of 100 per day for the whole of February 2020.
The reliability of the two-component tests was not determined until February 28, 2020, and state and local laboratories were allowed to begin testing from this date.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under emergency use authorization. US Commercial Laboratories began testing it in early March 2020.

In Russia, the COVID-19 test was designed and developed by the State Research Center for Virology and Biotechnology.
On February 11, 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Agency for Healthcare Supervision and Treatment. On March 12, 2020, it was reported that Mayo Clinic had developed a test to detect COVID-19. On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for a test that could be done in 3.5 hours and in large volumes, resulting in a machine capable of performing approximately 4,128 tests every 24 hours.

Subpleural dominance occurs with disease evolution, penetration and crazy paving.
A study in Wuhan, the starting point of the pandemic, compared PCR and CT to each other and stated that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less specialized, and has many imaging features that overlap with other diseases of the chest and throat (pneumonia) and respiratory problems.

High-power automated systems will be able to perform these assessments in many laboratories, but their availability will depend on the production ratio for each system.
CLT is usually performed using a single blood sample, however, series of samples can be used to track the immune system response.
PoCT is usually performed by perforating the skin.
Unlike PCR methods, there is no need to perform pre-sampling elimination procedures. On 26 March 2020, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) identified 29 companies that had notified the FDA in accordance with the requirements and were therefore able to distribute their own antibody tests.

The testing capacity is several hundred samples per hour and is therefore much faster than the usual PCR evaluation for viral RNA.
Antibodies are usually detectable within 14 days of infection beginning.In early April, the UK announced that none of the antibody testing kits purchased were good enough.
"Hong Kong has set up a program whereby those suspected of being sick can stay at home, ""the emergency department gives a patient a sample tube"", the patient puts a tofu inside the tube, sends it back and receives the test results after a while.""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Drive-through centers helped South Korea implement one of the fastest and most comprehensive testing in the world. In Germany, the National Association of Forensic Health Insurers announced on 2 March that it had the capacity to perform around 12,000 tests per day inside ambulances, up from 10,700 tests the week before.
When the doctor prescribes the test, the health insurance will cover the costs.
According to the President of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has the capacity to perform a total of 160,000 tests per week.


"The first laboratory study showed that by the calendar week of 12/2020 a total of at least 48,3295 samples had been tested, with the week of 12/2020 itself taking into account the SARS-CoV-2 test result being positive for 33,491 people (6.9%). In Israel, researchers from the Technion and Rambam Hospital developed a method for testing samples taken from 64 patients simultaneously where all samples were combined and tested, and if the result was positive, samples were tested individually. A 2,000 square meter Emergency Diagnostic Laboratory in Wuhan called ""Ho-yan"" (Chinese: 火眼, meaning "eye of fire") was opened by BGI on 5 February 2020 which could test 100 000 samples per day."

On March 16, the World Health Organization announced testing programs as the best way to slow the progress of the COVID-19 pandemic. The high demand for testing due to the widespread spread of the virus had caused hundreds of thousands of tests to be piled up in private US labs and the supply of sampling equipment and chemicals to be difficult.

A study showed countries that performed more diagnostic tests relative to deaths had much lower death rates, probably because these countries are better at identifying infectious cases that have only mild symptoms or which have no symptoms.
The World Health Organization recommends that countries that do not have testing capacity and have laboratories with limited experience in relation to COVID-19 send their first five positive and first ten negative COVID-19 samples for confirmation to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories.

"Washing hands with soap consistently at ""critical moments"" throughout the day prevents the spread of many diseases, for example diarrhea and plague, which are transmitted via the gastro-ocular route".

There are five important times a day to wash your hands with soap to reduce oral-transmission of disease: after going to the bathroom (sweating and spitting), after wiping the baby's underwear (diaper change), before feeding the baby, before eating, and before and after preparing food or when touching raw meat, fish or chicken.

Lave hands before using medicines or treatment measures can prevent or minimize the spread of the virus.Lave hands before using medicines or treatment measures can prevent or minimize the spread of the virus.
The primary medical purpose of handwashing is to clean hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause injury or disease.
This is of particular importance for people who work with food or in the medical field, but is also an important practice for the general public.
Lavarse las manos tiene muchos beneficios, incluyendo reducir la propagación de la gripe, el coronavirus y otras enfermedades infecciosas; prevenir enfermedades que provocan diarrea; y reducir las infecciones respiratorias.

This simple action could reduce the mortality rate in these diseases by 50%.
Interventions that promote handwashing are able to reduce diarrhea by about one-third, which is equivalent to clean water supply in low income areas.
48% of reductions in diarrhea cases can be attributed to hand washing with soap. Washing hands with soap is the most effective and inexpensive method for preventing diarrhea and respiratory infections (ARI), which is done as a routine in homes, schools and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, a major ARI, is the number one cause of death among children under five years old, claiming 1.8 million lives annually.
Diarrhoea and thrush are also the cause of death for approximately 3.5 million children per year.
UNICEFs findings say that replacing hand washing before eating and after going to the bathroom with a sustainable habit could save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, cutting diarrhea deaths by nearly half and reducing deaths from acute respiratory infections by a quarter.
Lavarse le manie è complemento di altri interventi di disinfezione con acqua, disinfezione e programmi di igiene personale (WASH).
Lavarse las manos también evita el impétigo, que se transmite por contacto físico directo.
The small harmful effect of washing hands is that frequent washing of hands can lead to skin damage due to dry skin.
A 2012 study in Denmark showed that excessive hand washing can lead to itching and scarring of the skin, known as eczema or dermatitis, a condition that is particularly prevalent among health care workers.
Two other symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) are:

Other times where handwashing techniques should be followed to prevent transmission include before and after treating a wound or wound, after coughing, coughing, or flushing; after touching animal waste or handling animals; and after touching garbage.
In many countries, the rate of hand washing with soap is low.

"The Critical Health Care Program" launched by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of measures to improve the health and education of children.
Two times a year, along with daily hand washing, daily fluoride spraying, is the most important thing in this national program.
Indonesia has also implemented it successfully.
The removal of microorganisms from the skin is increased by adding soap or detergents to the water.
The main function of soaps and detergents is to reduce the barrier to dissolving in water, to increase solubility.

Antibacterial soaps have been heavily promoted to promote mass health.
To date, there is no evidence that the use of prescribed antiseptics or disinfectants can produce antibiotic resistant organisms in nature.
Antibacterial soaps, however, include common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, which have a wide list of resistant strains of organisms.

They are often based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol with a constituent such as a carburetor (polymer acrylic acid) that converts to gels, or a moisturizer such as glycerin in a liquid, or foam for convenient use with alcohol and to reduce the drying effect of alcohol.
The addition of dilute hydrogen peroxide increases its antimicrobial activity. Hand sanitizers containing at least 60 to 95% alcohol are highly effective at killing microbes.
Alcohol-based disinfectants kill bacteria, multi-drug resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), the causative agent of tuberculosis, and a number of viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccines, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.
70% alcohol disinfectants can kill up to 99.97% (logarithmic reduction of 3.5, equivalent to a reduction of 35 decibels) of hand bacteria in less than 30 seconds and 99.99% to 99.999% (logarithmic reduction of 4 to 5) of hand bacteria in 1 minute. Hand disinfectants are more effective against bacteria and less effective against some viruses.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are almost ineffective as a complement to neuroviruses (or Norwalks), the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis.A sufficient hand sanitizer or alcohol-based lubricant should be applied to the skin by thoroughly moisturizing and covering both hands.
The front and back of both hands and the middle and ends of all fingers are rubbed for about 30 seconds to dry the liquid, the floor or the skin.

The increased use of these detergents is based on ease of use and quick activity in killing microorganisms; however, they should not be used as a substitute for proper hand washing, unless soap and water are available.
Repeated use of alcohol disinfectants causes dry hands, unless a moisturizer and/or softener is added to their formula.
The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced by adding glycerin and/or other moisturizers to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing moisturizer caused less burning and dryness compared to antibacterial soaps.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact itch syndrome, or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives in hand-made alcohol garments are rare.

The effectiveness of non-alcoholic hand sanitizers is highly dependent on the ingredients and formulation and has historically been much less effective than alcohol and alcohol-containing garments.
Recently, formulations using benzalkonium chloride have shown sustained and increased antimicrobial activity after use, unlike alcohol, which after repeated use, probably causes decreased effectiveness due to progressive reverse reactions.

Ash or soil may be more effective than water, but probably less effective than soap.
Another concern is contamination of soil or ash with microorganisms, which may contribute more to the spread of disease rather than to its reduction.
Ash, like soap, is an antiseptic, because it forms an alkaline solution when in contact with water.
The World Health Organization recommends ash or sand as a substitute for soap in the absence of soap.
The correct handwashing technique recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control to prevent transmission includes the following steps:
Rinsing your hands with hot or cold water.
It is recommended that running water be used because the stagnant pools may be contaminated, although the water temperature may not appear to be different.
Wipes your hands and the back of your hands, between your fingers and under your nails with plenty of soap.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that people wash their hands more thoroughly when using soap compared to when using just plain water.
Rush your hands for at least 20 seconds.

"The importance of handwashing for human health, especially for people with vulnerable conditions such as newborns or wounded soldiers in hospitals was first introduced in the mid-19th century by two hand hygiene pioneers: Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis, who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, who was the ""founder of modern nursing"" in England".

In the 1980s, the spread of foodborne and healthcare-associated infections caused the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to promote active hand hygiene as an important practice for preventing the onset of infection.
The 2009 swine flu outbreak and the 2020 global COVID-19 pandemic raised awareness in many countries regarding the importance of hand washing for preventing such infectious diseases.
"For example, posters with the content ""Dream Hand Washing Techniques"" were installed alongside the sinks in public toilets and in the toilets of office buildings and German airports".
"The phrase ""to withdraw one's hand from"" something, means to declare one's unwillingness to accept responsibility or to share in it".

The COVID-19 outbreak can have multiple effects on the workplace.

Trade patterns can change, both in terms of the goods being demanded and in terms of the way these goods are received (such as shopping outside of peak hours or through on-site delivery or ride-hailing services).
Finally, shipping goods from geographic areas that are severely affected by COVID-19 can be problematic. A preparedness and response plan for infectious disease can be used to guide preventive measures.
The plans take into account the level of risk associated with different workplaces and work tasks, including sources of exposure to disease, risk factors in the social and home environment and risk factors for each worker individually, including exposure to a chronic disease.
The plan also identifies appropriate control practices necessary to prevent these risks and alternative plans for situations that may occur following an outbreak.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees with symptoms of acute respiratory illness should stay home until the fever, fever symptoms and any other symptoms are resolved, at least 24 hours after stopping the use of anti-fever medication or symptom reversal, and a more flexible policy for the use of medication leave to allow employees to stay home to care for sick family members, and that all employees be informed of the new policies.

This includes workers who are in contact with the general public, such as those in schools, busy workplaces and some large retail spaces. Engineering controls for this group and the groups most at risk include the installation of high-efficiency air filters, increased ventilation rates, installation of physical barriers such as plastic fragrance drop protectors and installation of ride-hailing service clinics for customers. Procedural controls for these groups and groups most affected include the use of equipment such as: encouraging sick workers to stay at home, encouraging the replacement of routine meetings with virtual contact, creating variable working hours, cancelling unnecessary travel to places where COVID-19 is most prevalent, setting up workplace contact planning, providing a minimum of training on the importance of protective hands and other protective equipment, providing training and training to workers who are at risk of COVID-19, and providing appropriate and timely access to COVID-19 vaccines and other workplace safety measures.

CDC recommends schools and child care centers be closed for a short period of time for cleaning and disinfection, regardless of the extent of the disease in the community, because an infected person may have been in the school building.
When the rate of social transmission is low or moderate, social distancing strategies can be used such as cancelling camps, gatherings and other gatherings such as face-to-face training or singing classes or dining in cafeterias, increasing table distance, changing start and end times, limiting the presence of unnecessary clients and using a separate health office for children with influenza-like symptoms.

In some sanitary and cold room environments, special negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate.
Samples must be transported with Biological Defense Level 3 precaution.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that new patients be placed in isolation waiting rooms, depending on whether they are suspected of having COVID-19. OSHA recommends that those who work within 6 feet of patients or people suspected of having SARS-CoV-2 and those who are performing aerosol generating procedures, use medical masks in addition to other personal protective equipment.

Other types of respirators can provide greater protection and improve staff comfort.The WHO does not recommend supplemental coverings, as COVID-19 is a respiratory disease and is not transmitted primarily through body excretions.
The World Health Organization recommends surgical masks for screening starting point personnel.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that those who collect, store, or transfer respiratory samples collected from COVID-19 patients without any aerosol-generating procedure use surgical masks, protective glasses, face shield, masks, and gloves.

SRE, HR Ops, Trust & Safety and fundraising teams (among others) are doing critical work that may need further support.
We will begin a process across all units to evaluate current objectives and focus on supporting whatever is necessary to accomplish this mission.
There is much work to be done, we will focus only on the most important projects.

We don't intend to ""double the time"" to make up for the delay once the pandemic is over.
You won't be expected to work harder to meet deadlines, which are now unreasonable.
We recognize that circumstances have changed and will take action if necessary to set new targets and timelines.
What happens to APP?
To adapt to the reality and expectations of the new working day, we are going to change the timeframe for the delivery of our 2020-2021 Agenda.
We plan to expand our 2019-2020 schedule to allow more time to budget and allow employees to prioritize basic tasks, taking care of themselves and taking care of their loved ones, while those who need or want to work, have a lighter work schedule in the coming weeks.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2B (ACE2) is an enzyme that binds to the outer surface (cell membrane) of lung cells, blood vessels, heart, lungs, and intestines.
ACE2 inhibits the activity of angiotensin-converting enzyme by reducing angiotensin-2 and increasing angiotensin-1-7, making it an effective drug target for the treatment of cardiovascular disease. ACE2 also acts as an entry point into cells for some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often called hACE2.
Angiotensin 2 converting enzyme is a metalloenzyme with a nucleus element that is localized to the surface of intracellular and other cells.
ACE2 protein contains the M2 domain of the n-terminal peptidase and the C-terminal amino acid transporter domain of the cluster.
ACE2 is a single-pass membrane protein with an enzyme-active domain that is localized to the cell surface in the lungs and other tissues.
ACE2 extracellular domain is cleaved from the membrane domain by another enzyme called shadase, and the resulting protein solution is released into the bloodstream and eventually eliminated in the form of urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 binds to the cell membrane of primarily porous lung cells, small intestinal enterocytes, vascular endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells of arteries in most organs.
ACE2 mRNA is also found in the cerebral cortex, corpus callosum, hypothalamus, and brainstem.
ACE2's primary function is to act as an ACE antagonist.
ACE breaks down angiotensin I into angiotensin II, which is a vasodilator.
ACE2 inhibits the release of carboxyl-terminal amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin-II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyzes it to angiotensin-II (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can cause the cleavage of a number of other peptides including / ((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((
ACE2 also regulates the passage of the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 from the membrane and is involved in Hartnap disease.
ACE2 is a membrane-permeable protein, which serves as the main entry point into the cell for some coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63 (the virus that causes SARS) and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
S1 protein spike in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 binds to the ACE2 enzyme domain on the cell surface, leading to endosytosis and transmission of both virus and enzyme to endosomes in cells.
This entry process also requires preparation of protein S by the host TMPRSS2 serine protease, whose inhibition is being investigated as a potential treatment. This led to the hypothesis that decreasing ACE2 levels in cells may help fight infection.

"A review and meta-analysis published on July 11, 2012 found that ""use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a significant 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to controls""."
"Also,"It also reduced the risk of chest pain in patients treated with angiotensin-metabolism enzyme inhibitors, patients who had a higher risk of chest pain, especially patients with stroke and heart failure".
"Use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with reduced deaths from chest and hip, although the results were less potent relative to overall risk of chest and hip".
It turns out that human ACE2 nootropic (rhACE2), a novel treatment for acute lung injury, has improved pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in pigs with acute respiratory distress syndrome caused by lipopolysaccharide.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is approximately 10 hours and the onset of action is 30 minutes plus a 24-hour period of action.
Various findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising drug for those who are resistant to classic renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or in patients with long-acting angiotensin II. The injection of rhACE2 has been studied in clinical studies for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
"COVID-19 B applications are mobile phone software applications designed to help track calls in response to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. the process of identifying individuals ("contacts") who may have been in contact with an infected person".

Israel confirmed network-based tracking. Israel confirmed network-based tracking.
Network-based solutions that access raw location data have potential privacy issues.
However, not all systems with central servers need access to personal location data. A number of privacy systems have been created that use central servers only for two-way communication (see below).
In South Korea, a non-app-based system was used to perform call tracking.
Thanks to the fact that the system is not a dedicated app, it collects tracking information from various sources including mobile tracking data and card transaction data, and combines these to generate text message alerts to people suspected of infection.



Privacy call tracking is a popular idea that has inspired countless research since at least 2013. As of April 7, 2020, over a dozen expert groups are working on appropriate privacy solutions, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to record user proximity to other mobile phones.
PEPP-PT is a coordinated effort that includes both centralized and decentralized approaches and is not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include privacy-friendly tracking (DP-PPT/DP-3T), TCN temporary call count, FKA call event count, CEN), privacy-sensitive protocols and mobile phone call tracking (PACT) mechanisms, and others.

Reuse of a drug (also known as drug recycling, re-profiling, re-use, or therapeutic recycling) is the reuse of an approved drug to treat a disease or medical condition different from what the drug was originally designed for.
This is an area of scientific research that is currently being pursued to develop safe and effective COVID-19 treatments.
SARS-CoV-2 possesses 66 proteins for drug development, each of which has multiple ligand binding sites.

According to scientists of the Epidemic Preparedness Innovation Alliance (CEPI) in April, there are 115 vaccines in early stage development, of which 78 have been confirmed as active projects (79, according to Milken Institute) and 37 vaccines have been announced but little information is available to the public (presumably in the planning or design phase).
Phase I-II trials test early immunity and immunity development and are generally randomized, placebo controlled and performed in multiple locations, while determining a more effective and accurate dose.
Phase 3 trials typically involve more participants, including a control group and vaccine efficacy testing for disease prevention as well as monitoring for side effects at optimal doses.
Of 79 proposed vaccines that are in active development (approved in early April 2020), 74 vaccines have not yet reached the human evaluation stage (still in ""preclinical"" research).

568,000 were cured.The virus was initially spread between people by direct contact, usually by the following droplets from coughing, sneezing or sneezing.
When these droplets are produced during the fermentation, they usually stick to the ground or to surfaces rather than moving over long distances.

The virus can survive for up to 72 hours on surfaces.
The disease is most contagious within the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although there may be a spread before the onset of symptoms and in later stages of the disease. The standard method of diagnosis is rRT-PCR from a biofilm substrate.
The use of masks is recommended for people who are suspected of being infected with the virus and their caregivers.

Hong Kong Hospital officials detected a 20% to 30% reduction in lung capacity in the number of people who had recovered from the disease, and lung scans were indicative of organ damage.
It can also lead to post-care syndrome.

Immunity seems likely given the behaviour of other coronavirus, but there have been reports of people who have been reinfected after contracting COVID-19.
It is believed that these cases worsen long-term infection rather than reinfection.
It is thought to be natural and transmitted via an infectious vector of animal origin.
The exact origin is unknown, but the spread of infection was complementary to human-to-human transmission as of December 2019.
The Lancet, a study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020, announced the first date of onset of symptoms on December 1, 2019.
The official WHO documentation reported that the first symptoms of the disease were on December 8, 2019.

The figures vary by region and over time and vary by frequency of testing, quality of health care system, treatment options, time elapsed since the start of the outbreak and demographic characteristics such as age, gender and overall health.

Research shows that viral diseases like Ebola, AIDS, influenza and SARS have different effects on women and men.
A higher percentage of health workers, especially nurses are women, who are more likely to contract the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on February 11, 2020 that the official name of the disease is "COVID-19".
WHO President Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO is the initials of the word corona, VI is the initials of the word virus and D is the initials of the word disease in English, and the number 19 indicates the year of the first observation of the virus infection: 31 December 2019.
The name of the virus was chosen based on the global naming guidelines to prevent defamation, with the consideration of not referring to a specific geographical area (e.g. China), or a specific species of animal or group of people. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called SARS-CoV-2.
"World Health Organization"s public statements also use the term ""COVID-19 virus"" or ""COVID-19 virus".
"Coronavirus"sometimes refers to both a virus and a disease.
"While the initial outbreak of the virus in Wuhan, China, the virus and the disease were known collectively as ""coronavirus"" and ""Wuhan coronavirus"".
In January 2020, the World Health Organization designated the disease 2019-nCoV and acute respiratory disease 2019-nCoV, according to the 2015 guidelines for the temporary toxicity of diseases and viruses by location.
The official names of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were released on 11 February 2020.

The first clinical study of a vaccine with four volunteers started in Seattle on 16 March 2020.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic gene copied from the virus that causes the disease. Antibody-dependent enhancement has been suggested as a potential challenge to the development of a vaccine for SARS-COV-2, but this is controversial.

As of March 2020, there is experimental evidence of the effectiveness of Remdesivir.
Clinical improvement was seen in patients treated with compassionate use of remdesivir.
Phase III clinical studies are underway in the United States, China and Italy. Chloroquine, which was previously used to treat malaria, was studied in China with preliminary results in February 2020.
There are, however, calls for review of the research by other researchers.
Korea and China recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, while recommending a daily dose of one gram, points out that doubling this dose is extremely dangerous and can be fatal.

Blood tests in combination with serum ferritin testing are used to detect cytokine storm cases, to combat such progressive symptoms that are said to be the cause of death in many infected individuals.
The interleukin-6 receptor antagonist was approved by the FDA in 2017 based on a retrospective case study for the treatment of steroid-resistant cytokine release syndrome caused by a different cause, CAR T cell therapy.
To date, there is no random or controlled evidence that tosilezomab is an effective treatment for CRS.
Transfer of filtered antibodies and antibodies collected from the immune system of individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 to infected cases is currently being studied as a non-vaccination method.
This strategy was tried for SARS without definite results.
Viral neutralization is the predicted mechanism by which passive antibody therapy can create a defensive agent against SARS-CoV-2.
Also possible are other mechanisms such as cytotoxicity and/or antibody-dependent cell phagocytosis.
Other types of passive antibody therapy are being developed, for example, the use of artificial monoclonal antibodies.
The production of serum from healthy individuals, which includes the fluid portion of recovered patients and contains specific antibodies to the virus, can be increased for faster uptake.
