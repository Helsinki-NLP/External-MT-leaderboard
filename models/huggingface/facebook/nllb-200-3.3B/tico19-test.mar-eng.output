The combined incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom is increasing rapidly between 1 January and 15 March 2020.
The combined incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases is showing a similar pattern across the European Union/European Economic Area (EEA) countries and the United Kingdom, confirming that the COVID-19 pandemic is accelerating across all countries, although the stages vary by country.
Based on Italy's experience, countries, hospitals and intensive care facilities should increase their preparedness for the rapidly increasing number of COVID-19 patients who will require health care and especially high-intensity care.
On 31 December 2019, a series of pneumonia cases of unknown cell lineage were detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention of China suggested the novel coronavirus as the pathogenic medium, which is now called Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since the disease was caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, it was named coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Evidence so far has shown that 80% of people with COVID-19 have mild illness, i.e. respiratory infection with or without pneumonia, and most of them have recovered.
In 14% of cases, COVID-19 takes the form of more severe illness requiring hospitalization, while in the remaining 6% of cases, the illness is severe requiring intensive treatment.
The mortality rate for COVID-19 hospitalized patients is 4%.
In this study, we assessed the patterns of combined COVID-19 incidence in each country in the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK) and compared them with those in Hubei Province, China.
We also compared the number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK between 31 January - 15 March 2020 with cases in Italy.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK
After China, COVID-19 has had a further geographical spread and the rest of the world's COVID-19 epidemic figures are now following the country's trajectory.
COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020.
The first case of COVID-19 in Europe was reported in the March 5 publication of EuroSurveillance 2020, Spiteri et al. by WHO.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases reported from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, were reported by France on 24 January 2020.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases were reported in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (UK), with 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths reported between 31 December 2019 and that date, including 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths in Italy alone.
Gathering the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases and cumulative incidence
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) keeps track of COVID-19 cases from every country in the world, for which information is updated daily at 8:00 am using official sources such as the country's health ministries, national and regional health authorities and WHO.
This data is used to assess the nature of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK and compare them with cases in Italy.
As a sample of the scope of active COVID-19 cases, we calculated the cumulative 14-day incidence of COVID-19 cases, taking into account the natural spread of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA country and the UK during the period 1 January - 15 March 2020.
We also presented the aggregated number of reported cases from each country as of 8:00 am on 15 March 2020 and compared them with the Italian cases from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
The nature of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the UK
The overall pattern of 14-day split-combined cases of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the UK is similar to that in Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
In the EU/EEA as a whole and in the UK, the combined incidence of COVID-19 began to rise around 21 February and then accelerated by 28 February 2020 (Supplementary material).
This included the rapidly increasing reported cases in Italy, but also the increasing pattern of cumulative COVID-19 cases in all other EU/EEA countries and the UK (Supplementary material).
Figure 2 shows the combined number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and UK compared to cases in Italy from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
It highlights that as of 8am on 15 March, 3 weeks earlier or less, an equal number of cases in Italy had already been reported in 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK.
Our results show that COVID-19 cases are increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The observed pattern of cumulative cases of COVID-19 suggests that the pandemic is growing at a comparatively rapid pace in all countries.
Further, while different countries are at different stages, the gaps in national public health responses and the different interpretations of possible cases and patient selection protocols across countries need to be examined for confirmation of COVID-19, including catch-up testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in affected areas of Italy described a situation where 10% of patients with COVID-19 required intensive care, and media sources indicated that hospitals and intensive care centers in these areas had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on admission of COVID-19 patients to hospital and/or intensive care units are currently available at EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% of cases respectively (data not shown).
However, they should compile current surveillance data in a systematic manner that is consistent with the reported number of cases and deaths.
A study in 2010-11 found that there is a large disparity in the number of acute and intensive care beds in Europe, which is 29.2 beds per 100,000 population in Germany and 4.2 in Portugal.
This means that other countries have fewer or more resources than Italy (12.5 intensive care and moderate care beds per 100,000 population in 2010-11).
The prevalence of COVID-19 cases admitted to hospital in each EU/EEA country and the UK is associated with a > 90% risk of exceeding intensive care bed capacity, which is the sample scenario associated with healthcare capacity saturation, as provided in the sixth update of the ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment for COVID-19.
Since cases are still limited to certain regions of EU/EEA countries and the UK, and hospitals and intensive care units are providing treatment to certain regional populations, case data and data on intensive care units should be made available as far as possible within the definition of regional centres for statistics level 2 (NUTS-2).
The experience of Italy and the current pattern in other countries suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic is spreading rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care units must therefore prepare for the continued community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and the increasing number of COVID-19 patients requiring health care and, in particular, intensive care, as is the case in the affected regions of Italy.
As demonstrated in the recent ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment, a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach is required to contain rather than delay the spread of SARS-CoV-2, as if not implemented in time, the rapid expected increase in such cases will not allow decision makers and hospitals to assess, accept and absorb their response.
Public health measures have also been listed in the Rapid Risk Assessment to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a brief window of opportunity during which countries can further intensify their efforts to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce pressure on health services.
If this fails, it is likely that healthcare systems in other EU/EEA countries will face a surge of patients who will require high-quality care in the coming days or weeks.
The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has so far killed over 3,000 people and infected over 80,000 others in China and elsewhere in the world, and has become a disaster for humanity.
Like its homologous virus SARS-CoV, which caused thousands of people to develop SARS in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may have been transmitted from bats and exhibited similar symptoms through similar mechanisms.
While COVID-19 has a lower severity and mortality than SARS, it has a higher infectivity and is more common in older people than in young people and in men than in women.
This article attempts to provide a timely and comprehensive review of the emerging research topic in response to the growing number of publications on emerging diseases.
We have covered the basics of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and prevention of disease.
Although many questions remain unanswered, we hope that this review will help us understand and diagnose this dangerous disease.
The Spring Festival on 25 January 2020 was unprecedented and unforgettable for all Chinese people who were asked to stay at home for the entire holiday and the many weeks that followed due to the outbreak of a new infectious disease.
The virus is highly homologous to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), so on 11 February 2020 the World Health Organization designated it SARS-CoV-2 and the associated disease COV disease 19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic started in Wuhan, China and quickly spread across the country and to 50 other countries around the world.
As of 2 March 2020, the virus had resulted in 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients discharged and 3,000 patients dying.
The WHO has warned that COVID-19 is "the public's number one enemy" and possibly more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), within two months, more than 200 research papers on COVID-19 have been published covering its virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment since the first case was reported on 7 January 2020, with the virus being sequenced in addition to various patients.
This review seeks to summarize the research progress in a new and slowly evolving subject area.
When possible, we will attempt to compare COVID-19 with SARS and other CoV-related illnesses, such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS, 2012 outbreak).
We will also discuss what we have learned about prevention and prognosis of the disease, and some of the remaining pressing issues.
CoVs are traditionally considered non-lethal pathogens to humans, primarily responsible for about 15% of common colds.
However, this century we have encountered two highly virulent human CoVs, namely SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which initially erupted in China in 2003 and in Saudi Arabia in 2012, and quickly spread to other countries with extreme morbidity and mortality.
Thus, the current COVID-19 is the third CoV outbreak in recent human history.
As shown in Figure 1.1, the first clusters of pneumonia of unknown origin were reported by the National Health Commission of China in Wuhan on 31 December 2019.
The COVID sequence was released after seven days.
The first fatal case was reported in Wuhan on 15th January, 2020.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly to neighboring cities, provinces and countries.
On 20 January, healthcare providers were notified of an infection that indicated human-to-human transmission.
On 23 January, a total lockdown was imposed in the city of Wuhan, and all public transportation was shut down.
The first clinical study of the disease on 24 January indicated that of the 41 confirmed cases, only 21 cases had come from direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market, which was understood to be the initial centre of infection from an unknown animal source.
On 30 January, WHO declared the outbreak as a global health emergency.
By the time of the report's publication, the disease had already spread throughout China and to 50 countries worldwide (Figure 2.2).
The final status and severity of the outbreak is still uncertain as the situation is changing rapidly.
The multi-centre study of 8,866 patients, including 4,021 confirmed cases of COVID-19 as on 11th February 2020, presents the following updated picture of the pandemic (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people of all ages, but primarily targeted people aged 30-65 years.
Half of the infected people (47.7%) were aged 50 years, very few were below the age of 20 years and only 14 infected were under the age of 10 years.
SARS-CoV-2 infected more men (0.27/1,00,000) than women (0.31/1,00,000) than it did in the previous year.
COVID-19 spread mainly in Hubei and surrounding urban areas.
The average duration of COVID-19 from infection to diagnosis is 5 (2-9) days.
The average holding period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from infection to death was 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The default reproduction number (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected people increased dramatically before 23 January 2020, coinciding with the large pre-Spring Festival outbreak in China.
The mortality rate for patients with confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and the adjusted mortality rate for patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three major risk factors for COVID-19 were gender (male), age (>60) and acute pneumonia.
CoVs are a subfamily of large and overlapping viruses that include a single strand of sense RNA.
They can be divided into four genes, namely alpha, beta, gamma and delta, of which alpha- and beta-CoVs are known to affect humans.
This envelope spike (S) glycoprotein binds to its cellular receptors angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV respectively and then skin fusion occurs.
The infectious RNA genome is released into the plasma; after replication of the viral genome, the genomic RNA is coated with glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins to form virion-containing vesicles, which then fuse with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was recorded on 10 January 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 has been identified as a new type of beta-CoV with 99.98% genetic identity in 10 sequential samples taken from the origin of the outbreak at the Hunan Seafood Market in Hunan.
SARS-CoV-2 is more genetically similar to MERS-CoV than SARS-CoV.
Through transmission electron microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles have been detected in the very thin regions of the human aortic valve.
Human ACE2 has been found to be a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
However, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to human ACE2 more weakly than the S protein of SARS-CoV, which coincidentally causes less severe infections due to SARS-CoV-2 than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also produce new small proteins, which are encoded by orf3b and the secreted protein is encoded by orf8.
SARS-CoV-2's orf3b may play a role in infectious pathogenesis and inhibit the expression of IFNß; however, orf8 does not contain any known functional domain or target.
On 18 February 2020, Zhou, et al. reported that the cryo-EM structure of the full-length human ACE2 at 2.9 Å resolution was intermixed with the amino acid carrier B0AT1.
They found that the structures of the vesicles that were open and closed were fused together as dimers, and the ACE2-B0AT1 vesicle can bind to two S proteins, providing identification of CoV and evidence of infection.
B0AT1 may be a potential therapeutic target for drug testing to overcome SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Primary and Medium Host
It is known that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated from bats and were transmitted to humans from cats and camels respectively.
Bat-CoV-2 was identified as a local host of SARS-CoV-2 after a genealogical comparison with other CoVs, as the new virus is 96% identical to bat-CoV-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21 SARS CoVs.
However, it is unknown which mediators helped the virus cross the species barrier to infect humans, and the route of transmission is yet to be clarified.
Ji, et al., suggested that snakes must be carriers to reach humans from bats, in which homosexual recombination must have occurred during S protein.
A study by researchers from Guangzhou, China, suggested that the long-nosed, ant-eating cat mosquito, which is widely used in traditional medicine in China, could be a potential intermediate host for SARS-CoV-2, finding 99% genetic similarity between the CoV found in the mosquito and SARS-CoV-2 found in the cat mosquito.
However, the 1% split between the two genomes is still a large gap, so a conclusive conclusion is awaited (Figure 33).
The physics of SARS-CoV-2 is still largely unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in dry environments for up to 48 hours and can survive in 20°C and 40%-50% humidity for up to 5 days.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar properties.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 cannot survive in ultraviolet light and at temperatures of 56°C after 30 minutes, while other solid solvents besides ether, 75% ethanol, chlorinated disinfectant, paracetic acid, chloroform and chlorhexidisin can effectively neutralize it.
The human race as a whole is not immune to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore vulnerable to this new virus.
Currently, no extensive studies on the immunological response to SARS-CoV-2 have been conducted.
Thus, we can only refer to studies on other CoVs, specifically: SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Figure 4).
Normally, when a virus attacks a host, it is first identified by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which include C-type lectin-like receptors, Toll-like receptors (TLRs), NOD-like receptors (NLRs) and RIG-i-like receptors (RLRs).
The virus through the pathway induces the expression of inflammatory factors, maturation of dendritic cells, and induces type I interference (INN), which limits the spread of various viruses and accelerates the macrophage phagocytosis of viral antigens.
However, the N proteins of SARS-CoV can help the virus to escape the immune response.
Soon, the favorable immune responses join the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in the defense.
CD4+ T cells induce B cells to produce virus-specific antibodies and CD8+ T cells directly destroy virus-infected cells.
T helper cells produce cytokines, which are proliferative agents that help the rescue cells.
However, COV can inhibit T cell function by interfering with T cell apoptosis.
Humoral immunity, including antibodies and components such as C3A and C5A, is also essential to fight viral infections.
For example, antibodies extracted from patients with severe disease have been found to be the nucleotide of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, the overreaction of the immune system results in large local free cell populations that can cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs, and in the worst case can cause various organ damage and even death.
The group-onset SARS-CoV-2 infection is most likely to affect older people with comorbidities and pregnant women.
People who have other diseases or whose immune system is weakened are more likely to be infected than others.
The estimated mean incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, with 3-7 days in most cases as seen in the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases found that the average incubation period was 3 days and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
As described above, the most recent study shows that the incubation period in a population of 8,866 cases was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
Organizing effective isolation periods based on the most accurate incubation period is critical for healthcare officials to prevent infected but asymptomatic people from transmitting the virus to others.
As a general measure, people who have been in contact with or infected with the virus should be isolated for at least 14 days.
Is it necessary to quarantine for 24 days?
Fever is the major and early symptom of COVID-19, which may be accompanied by no symptoms or other symptoms such as dry cough, wheezing, muscle spasms, dizziness, headache, sore throat, rhinorrhea, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.
Some patients may develop dyspnea and/or hypoxemia one week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, patients may develop acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy.
Virology testing is required for early diagnosis of patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms and severe fever, even if pulmonary imaging is abnormal.
A demographic study conducted in late December 2019 showed that the percentage of symptoms were as follows: fever 98%, dry cough 76%, dyspnea 55% and diarrhea 3%; 8% of patients required ventilation support.
Two recent studies on a family group and a group of infected people without symptoms have found similar findings.
By comparison, demographic studies in 2012 showed that MERS-CoV patients also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and dyspnoea (55%) as the main symptom.
However, 80% of them required ventilation support, which was much higher than in COVID-19 patients and MERS was more severe than COVID-19.
Diarrhea (26%) and laryngitis (21%) were also reported in MERS patients.
In SARS patients, it was observed that fever (99-100%), dry cough (29-75%), dyspnea (40-42%), diarrhoea (20-25%) and sore throat (13-25%) were the main symptoms, and approximately 14-20% of patients required ventilation support.
By February 14, when the number of confirmed cases reached 66,576 globally, the COVID-19 death rate was 2%.
By comparison, the SARS death rate by November 2002 was 10% of the 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, the mortality rate was 37% of the 2494 confirmed cases based on the demographic study of June 2012.
Previous studies had indicated that the RO of SARS-CoV-2 was as high as 6.47 and had a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23, while the RO of SARS-CoV was between 2 and 4.
A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV in terms of symptoms, mortality and RO is given in Table 1.1.
The above data suggests that SARS-CoV-2 is more transmissive than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but less virulent than both.
Therefore, the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is more challenging to control than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
The collective beginning often starts with a single family or a single ceremony or a single vehicle, such as a cruise ship.
Patients have a history of travel or residence in Wuhan or other affected areas or contact with infected individuals or in the last two weeks prior to onset.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks and recovered patients who have been discharged from hospital can carry the virus again which has prompted the extension of the quarantine period.
In the initial stage, patients have normal or decreasing numbers of peripheral white blood cells (specifically lymphocytes).
For example, 1,099 COVID-19 patients had lymphopenia with a white blood cell count < 4×109/L including a lymphocyte count < 1×109/L and had elevated aminotransferase levels and viraemia.
Liver and muscle enzymes and myoglobin were elevated in some patients, and C-reactive protein and erythrocyte levels were elevated in most patients.
In patients with severe cases, the blood fibrin degradation product D-dimer was elevated and the lymphocyte count decreased rapidly.
The majority of COVID-19 patients had abnormalities in chest radiography and were characterized by bilateral patchy shadows or ground glass opacity in the lungs.
Patients often develop atypical pneumonia, severe lung injury and severe respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled swelling, fluid retention, and progressive thickening greatly affect air exchange.
Damage to type-1 and type-2 pneumocytes leads to a decrease in surface area and an increase in surface tension, which reduces lung conductivity and increases the risk of lung damage.
So, the worst radiographic findings are often the same as the most serious illnesses.
The first diagnostic evaluation of COVID-19 on 18 February 2020 showed that desquamation of pneumocytes, formation of a germicidal membrane and infiltration of central lymphocytes and diagnosis of multi-nucleated syncytial cell viral infection in the lungs of patients who died from the disease was consistent with ARDS and similar to SARS and MERS patients.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used as the main criteria for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, the high false-negative rate accelerating the pandemic led to the use of clinical manifestations for diagnosis in China on 13 February 2020 (which no longer relies solely on RT-PCR).
The same thing started to happen with SARS.
Therefore, the combination of medical history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiological findings is important and essential for effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, the Feng Zhang Group described a protocol using the CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technique for detecting SARS-CoV-2, which detects synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA fibers at 20 × 10-18 mol/L to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microliter of input) without the need for extensive tools within one hour using a dipstick.
The hope is that the new technique, if validated in clinical samples, could dramatically increase sensitivity and facility.
Due to the lack of experience with novel CoVs, clinicians may only provide supportive care to COVID-19 patients and may attempt various treatments previously used or proposed for other CoVs, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and other viral diseases (Table 2).
These treatments include current and potential treatments including antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, elderly patients' plasma, Chinese medicine and mental health support.
Not only that, but it was also proposed to use the cells of many patients for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are working hard to develop antibodies and vaccines for the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 initially attacks the lungs and possibly other organs expressing ACE2 such as the gastrointestinal system and to a lesser extent the kidneys.
Thus, respiratory failure and dysfunction pose a major risk to patients and is a leading cause of death.
Therefore, respiratory support is essential to relieve symptoms and save lives, including general oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen, non-invasive ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients suffering from severe respiratory symptoms should be supported with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), an improved cardiopulmonary bypass technique used for fatal cardiac or respiratory failure.
In addition, maintaining electrolyte balance, preventing and treating secondary infection and septic shock, protecting the function of major organs is also important for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
It has been known that in SARS and MERS patients, the extra immune system response results in a cytokine storm.
A cytokine storm is a form of systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a chain of cytokines that includes TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune system cells to release large numbers of free radicals, which is a major cause of ARDS and various organ malfunctions.
Immunosuppression is important in the treatment of cytokine storms, especially in severe patients.
Anti-IL-6 monoclonal antibody corticosteroids and tocilizumab are used to treat cytokine storms.
Other immunosuppression treatments for cytokine storm include T cell-directed immune response, inhibition of IFN-Y, IL-1 and TNF, inhibition of JAK, blinetumomab, suppressor of cytokine signaling 4, and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids are widely used as immunosuppressants in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, high doses of steroids were not beneficial for chronic lung injury in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Instead, they can cause serious side effects, especially vascular osteonecrosis, which can significantly affect the prognosis.
However, the use of short-term corticosteroids in low to moderate doses is recommended for the prudent use of corticosteroids in critically ill COVID-19 patients.
At the time of writing, no effective antiviral treatment had been confirmed.
However, remdesivir has been found to be effective when given intravenously to an American patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a unique antiviral drug initially developed by Gilead to treat diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg virus.
Later, remdesivir showed potential inhibitors for other single-stranded RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on this, Gelid supplied the components to China for testing on patients with SARS-CoV-2 and the results were very promising.
In addition, baricitnb, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin have been suggested as potential treatments for patients with severe respiratory symptoms.
Combination therapy with lopinavir may cause diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse reactions.
The effect of these treatments on other medicines used in patients needs to be carefully monitored.
Plasma and antibodies are produced from infected patients.
There is a long history of collecting blood from patients who have recovered from infectious diseases to treat patients with the same disease or to prevent healthy people from becoming ill.
It is true that the blood of the elderly patients has a higher number of antibodies than the pathogens.
Antibodies to fight pathogens and other foreign substances are immunoglobulins (IG) produced by B lymphocytes and they identify specific molecules in the pathogens and destroy them directly.
Based on this, cells were collected from the blood of the COVID-19 survivor group and 10 patients with severe disease were vaccinated.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, along with inflammation and viral pressure, and improved oxygen circulation.
However, until specific therapeutic regimens are developed, testing and clarification are required for large-scale use.
In addition, some of the cellular impairments must be carefully considered for therapeutic effects.
For example, antibodies can greatly stimulate the immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, which is potentially lethal.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low and the demand for cells is high to treat critically ill patients.
It is difficult to rapidly develop and produce specific antibodies to fight a global pandemic.
It is therefore important and practical to isolate B cells from many infected patients and identify the genetic codes that encode the effective antibodies or to test for effective antibodies against the necessary proteins of the virus.
In this way, we can increase the production of antibodies at a rapid rate.
TCM has been used in China for thousands of years to treat various ailments.
However, the effect is highly dependent on the combination of various components in the formula according to the TCM theory of disease diagnosis.
Most of the effective components are unknown or uncertain because such components or their highest combinations are difficult to extract and verify.
In the absence of an effective and specific treatment for COVID-19, TCM is an alternative treatment option for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or those who have undergone severe stages.
For example, Shu Feng Ji Do capsules and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules have been found to be effective for COVID-19 patients.
The highest recovery rate was seen in various provinces of China that used TCM for the treatment of COVID-19 at 87% of patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while Hubei Province, where TCM was used in only 30% of COVID-19 patients, had the lowest recovery rate (13%)
However, this is a somewhat rough comparison because other influencing factors such as the number of patients and severity should be included in the assessment.
On February 18, 2020, Bo Li Zhang and colleagues published a study comparing Western medicine (WM) alone with the combination of WM and TCM.
They found that the time it took for the body temperature to return, for the symptoms to disappear, and for the patients to be admitted to the hospital was much shorter in the WM + TCM group than in the WM group alone.
Importantly, the rate of symptomatic progression (mild to severe) was much lower in the WM+TCM group than in the WM alone group (7.4% vs 46.2%) and the mortality rate was also lower in the WM+TCM group than in the WM alone group (8.8% vs 39%).
However, large scale, well-controlled trials are needed at more centres for the efficacy and safety of TCM.
It would be somewhat bizarre to characterize the mechanism of action and explain the components of TCM treatments or, if possible, their combinations.
Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 experience the majority of severe infectious or life-threatening illnesses, and people in isolation experience boredom, loneliness and anger.
Also, symptoms of infection such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as adverse effects of treatment such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids, can lead to anxiety and depression.
In the early stages of the SARS outbreak, emotional disturbances such as persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, mood stimuli, adverse symptoms, delusions and suicidal thoughts were reported.
Mandatory contact tracing and quarantine as part of the public health response to the COVID-19 outbreak may lead to people becoming more anxious about infection, isolation, and blame among family and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, suspected persons and their contacts as well as to the general public in need.
Mental support includes the establishment of multidimensional mental health groups, regular and open communication about accurate news and treatment plans for the SARS-COV-2 outbreak, the use of professional electronic tools and the use of apps to avoid close contact with others.
Effective vaccines are required to break the chain of transmission from animal to virus storage and from infected to susceptible hosts, and can often be used effectively as antiviral therapy to control emerging viral pandemics.
Efforts are being made to develop a S-protein-based vaccine to generate long-lasting and potent antibodies and/or protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
The live-attenuated vaccines for SARS were evaluated on animal samples.
However, the physical function and lethal challenge patterns in adult individuals and the protective factors against animal-transmitted viral infection have not yet been identified in vaccine candidates given before the start of clinical trials.
This may be because the impact of SARS had already ended 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since then.
Conversely, the emergence of sudden cases and some mass cases of MERS in eastern countries and its continuing spread to other regions suggests that an animal-transmitted source exists in the region.
Vaccination strategies for MERS were developed using inactivated viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, microorganisms, virus-like particles, and recombinant protein subunits, and some were evaluated on animal samples.
Developing a safe and effective vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 for immunocompromised individuals is an urgent and critical task for the current pandemic.
However, overcoming the hurdles is challenging as it takes a long time (on average 18 months) to develop a vaccine and dynamic variation of CoV.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has now started to show its full clinical course in about thousands of patients.
In most cases, the patient can recover gradually without any recurrence.
However, like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 has also been associated with high morbidity and mortality in severe cases.
Hence, healthcare organizations need to build diagnostic models to prioritize their services, especially in under-resourced areas.
Based on clinical studies reported so far, the following factors may be associated with or affect the diagnosis of COVID-19 patients (Table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor in the diagnosis of SARS, as it was for COVID-19.
As described above, in a study of 8,866 cases, 47.7% of patients aged 50 years or older who developed COVID-19 were aged 30-65.
Patients requiring intensive care were more likely to have inherent abnormalities and complications and were much older than those who did not (51 versus 66 on average), suggesting that age is a diagnostic factor for COVID-19 patients.
Gender: As described above, SARS-CoV-2 infects men more often than women (0.31/1,00,000 vs. 0.27/1,00,000).
Symptoms and complications: COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care may be more likely to suffer from severe cardiac arrhythmia and arrhythmia.
Heart disease was also one of the leading causes of death in SARS patients.
SARS-CoV-2 has also been reported to bind ACE-2 positive colangiocytes, which may cause liver failure in COVID-19 patients.
It is important to note that the relationship between age and current disease is important and that they can influence each other.
Unusual laboratory findings: The level of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood indicates the severity of inflammation or tissue injury and is a potential long-term diagnostic factor for disease, response to treatment and eventual recovery.
The correlation of CRP levels with the severity and diagnosis of COVID-19 has also been suggested.
In addition, increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine kinase (CK) may also help predict outcomes.
These hormones are widely expressed in various organs, especially in the heart and liver, and are released in tissue damage.
So, they're the traditional indicators of heart or liver failure.
Major clinical symptoms: Chest radiography and transient exacerbation of clinical symptoms should be considered in conjunction with other issues to predict the outcome and severity of COVID-19.
Use of steroids: As described above, steroids are immunosuppressants that are used as adjuvant therapy for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
The widespread use of high-dose corticosteroids in severe SARS patients has resulted in many survivors suffering from chronic osteoporosis with lifelong disability and reduced life expectancy.
Steroids should be used in low doses and for short periods of time in COVID-19 patients if needed.
Stress: As described above, many patients suffered from additional stress during the COVID-19 outbreak as they had to stay in isolation for long periods and in very precarious conditions and witnessed the death of family members and close relatives.
It is essential to provide counseling and long-term support so that they can recover from stress and return to normal life.
According to demographic studies so far, the characteristics of the COVID-19 pandemic are different from those of SARS.
SARS-CoV-2 can effectively replicate in the upper respiratory tract rather than the lower respiratory tract and may cause mild or no symptoms in the early stages of infection, similar to other CoVs that can cause colds.
Thus, infected patients in the initial stage or retention period may produce large amounts of virus during daily activities, which can make the epidemic very difficult to control.
However, while SARS-CoV infection is thought to spread when patients are critically ill, most infections do not occur in the early stages.
Thus, the current COVID-19 outbreak is more severe than the SARS outbreak and is difficult to control.
Large-scale efforts are currently underway in China, including the lockdown of Wuhan and surrounding cities and the continuous quarantine of almost the entire population, to stop the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these actions are significantly damaging the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new cases is decreasing and the pandemic appears to be slowing down.
The most optimistic forecast is that the outbreak will end by March and the downward phase will last for 3-4 months.
However, other experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter, predicts that COVID-19, which is more infectious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini has established a model to predict the outcome of the pandemic and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian group has reported that SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in the mid-turbinate and throat swabs of a patient who had been discharged 2 weeks prior to recovery from the disease, indicating that this newly identified virus may be circulating in an influenza-like pattern.
However, there are some promising signs from China based on the declining number of new cases, which shows the positive impact of the current policies.
Initially, Ebola was projected to cause one million cases and five million deaths.
However, due to strict quarantine, the disease was eventually brought under control.
It is possible that, like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 will weaken until it becomes ineffective and eventually become extinct or a less pathogenic virus that coexists with humans.
The comparison of COVID-19 pandemic with SARS and MERS pandemic is given below (Figure 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious through coughing or sneezing and can also be caused by direct contact with material contaminated by the virus.
The virus has also been detected in faeces, which has strengthened the new possibility of faeces-to-mouth transmission.
A recent study of 138 cases indicated that 41% of the cases may have been hospital-acquired infections, with 17 patients having other pre-existing illnesses and 40 healthcare providers.
So, we need to take great care to protect people, especially: healthcare providers, social workers, family members, colleagues, and not just that, but also third parties who come in contact with sick or infected people.
The first safety step to reduce the risk of infection is to use a face mask; both surgical masks and N95 respirator masks (series #1860s) help prevent the spread of the virus.
Surgical face masks prevent the airborne fluid droplets from potentially infected individuals from reaching the surface of the material, so that they do not infect others.
However, only N95 (series #1860) masks can stop the respiration of micro-viruses up to 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% of the viruses being able to completely penetrate; SARS-CoV-2 is similar in size to SARS-CoV and both are approximately 85 nm in size.
Since particles can penetrate five surgical masks one on one, healthcare providers who have direct contact with patients are required to wear N95 (series #1860) without using surgical masks.
Along with masks, healthcare providers are also required to wear fitted isolation gowns to avoid contact with the virus.
Viruses can also infect people through the eyes.
On 20 January 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2 despite wearing an N95 mask; the virus may have entered his body through his inflamed eyes.
Therefore, healthcare providers should wear transparent face coverings or goggles when working with patients.
The general public in affected or potentially affected areas are advised to wash their hands with disinfectant soap more often than usual, stay indoors for self-isolation and limit contact with potentially infected persons.
Three feet is considered the correct distance for people to stay away from the patient.
These actions have been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of infection and preventing the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 was introduced to the human world as a new virus, as reported on 7 January 2020, the memory of the 2003 SARS outbreak should have sounded the alarm bells in China as it is a homolog of SARS-CoV.
However, even on January 19, 2020, the director of the Wuhan Disease Control Center was telling the public that the new virus is less contagious and less able to replicate from human to human and that it is not difficult to contain and control the disease.
This message has greatly reduced public vigilance, especially as the country was preparing for the Spring Festival and the critical time to keep the disease at a minimum in Wuhan was missed.
Disease control agencies in China can learn from this hard lesson and make significant improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies should take the following precautions (1) to be more careful when making public announcements because every word spoken to citizens is important and can change their perception and decision; (2) to be more sensitive and reactive to unusual information in clinics without waiting for formal reports from doctors or nurses; (3) to be more restrictive to prevent potential infection at an early stage rather than reassure the public; and (4) to test and test targeted and effective drills from time to time to improve public awareness of the disease and increase the community's response system.
The COVID-19 outbreak was caused by a novel virus, SARS-CoV-2, that emerged in late December 2019.
By the time this article was written, within two months, it had spread throughout China and to 50 countries around the world.
Since the virus is similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms are similar between COVID-19 and SARS, the COVID-19 outbreak created a sense of SARS returning.
However, there are some notable differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are important for controlling the disease and treating patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than younger people, and men more than women, and older people have a higher severity and death rate than younger people.
The death rate of SARS is higher than that of COVID-19 (10.91% vs. 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients can transmit the virus even when they are asymptomatic, while SARS patients only do so after they become critically ill, making COVID-19 much harder to contain than SARS.
This explains in part why SARS-CoV-2 is spreading more rapidly and widely than SARS-CoV.
Some COVID-19 patients may have a negative result in the routine RNA assay for SARS-CoV-2.
On the other hand, patients who have recovered from the virus can become positive again.
These findings significantly increased the risk of spreading the virus.
The rapid progress in COVID-19 research has not addressed many key issues, such as:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96% genetic homology was found between SARS-CoV-2 and two bat SARS-like COVs, we cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 is descended from bats.
Which animal was the original media species for transmitting the virus from the original host, bats or humans?
Without knowing the answers to #1 and #2, we cannot effectively stop the infection and the outbreak could return at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical evaluation demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, how does the virus enter airway cells and subsequently change the diagnosis?
Does the virus also bind to ACE-2 expression cells in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot achieve rapid and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the plague last?
How does the virus genetically evolve during human infection?
Will it become a global pandemic, or will it go extinct like SARS, or will it keep coming back like the flu?
These and many other questions require research, but it may take some time.
However, we have no choice but to catch the disease as soon as possible and to return to normalcy.
The origin of the zoonotic disease of human coronaviruses
For thousands of years, the co-evolution of coronaviruses (CoVs) and their relatives with humans has been driven by mutation and adaptation.
Prior to 2003, two human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are known to cause mild illnesses such as the common cold.
The devastating and deadly nature of HCoV infection has been demonstrated by the outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).
The coronavirus resurfaced in central China in late 2019 with the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and we were surprised by its high infectivity, but its pathogenicity was lower than that of its cousin SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is a zoonotic disease and therefore it is beneficial for us to understand the zoonotic origin of HCoV.
Most HCoVs originate from bats where they are non-pathogenic.
Some HCoVs are also known to have mediated parasitic hosts.
Animal-based identification can have direct implications for the prevention of human disease.
Investigation of the COVID-mollusque interaction in animals may shed light on important information on the COVID pathogen in humans.
In this review, we present a review of the existing knowledge of seven HCoVs, with a primary focus on their discovery history as well as their zoonotic disease origin and intracellular transmission.
Importantly, we compare different HCoVs from the point of view of viral evolution and genome recombination.
The current COVID-19 pandemic is discussed in this context.
Besides, the need for successful replacement of the nutrient and the impact of viral evolution on the severity of the disease has also been highlighted.
Coronavirus (COV) belongs to the family of coronaviridae, which includes a group of intrinsic, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses.
The largest genome of these RNA viruses, 26-32 kilobases, is called "Cov" because of their crown-like appearance under the electron microscope.
Structurally, COVs have undivided genomes that share the same structure.
About two-thirds of the genome consists of two large overlapping open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into pp1a and pp1ab replicas of polyproteins.
The polyproteins are further processed to form 16 non-structural proteins, which are classified as NSP1~16.
The rest of the genome contains the ORF for structural proteins, including spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
Numerous gene-specific auxiliary proteins are also encoded by different lineages of COV.
COVs are classified into four generations according to different protein sequences (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV), of which the beta-CoV generation contains the highest number of HCoVs and is further divided into four generations (A, B, C and D).
Phylogenetic evidence suggests that bats and mice serve as the genetic source for most alpha-CoV and beta-CoVs, while birds are the main prey for gamma-CoV and delta-CoV.
For thousands of years, COVs have been continuously crossing the species barrier and emerging as some of the most important human pathogens.
As of today, there are seven known human COVs (ACOVs).
HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are the alpha-CoVs.
The other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, which is the acute severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms such as cold and/or diarrhea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the newly identified SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, causing severe lower respiratory tract infections in a relatively large number of patients who are at higher risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and extrapulmonary manifestations.
In 1960, the first HCoV-229E variant, B814, was isolated from nasal secretions of patients with the common cold.
Since then, more knowledge had been accumulated through extensive studies on HCOV-229E and HCOV-OC43, which cause self-limiting symptoms.
In fact, until the SARS outbreak, it was widely believed that infections caused by HCoVs were usually harmless.
The 2003 SARS outbreak was one of the most devastating in recent history, with an estimated 10% of the crude cases and more than 8,000 deaths.
Ten years later, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreak resulted in a sustained epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula that quickly spread to the rest of the world.
The 2019 novel HCoV (2019-NCoV), later named SARS-CoV-2, was the causative agent of the ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which had caused more than 3,120 deaths and infected more than 91,000 people by 3 March 2020.
The alarm is ringing and the world needs to prepare for the coming pandemic of SARS-CoV-2.
All seven ACOVs have their origin in bats, mice or pets.
Various evidence supports the theory of evolution from bats, in which viruses have taken over and are showing extraordinary genetic diversity, though not pathogenic.
The COVID-19 pandemic has presented enormous medical, scientific, social and ethical challenges to China and the world.
Tracing the origins of the zoonotic disease of ACOV reveals the natural history, driving forces and constraining factors behind the species' shift.
It will also guide or facilitate the detection of SARS-CoV-2 host, intermediate and propagating parasite (V) hosts, which may play a significant role in preventing its spread in the future.
In this review, we provide an overview of the origins of zoonotic disease, interspecies transmission and pathogenesis of HCoVs.
In particular, we emphasize and discuss the following common themes: The parent virus of HCoV is normally non-pathogenic in its natural parasitic host, but becomes pathogenic when interspecies infection occurs in a new host.
We also looked at the art of HCoV evolution, where if infectivity increases, pathogenicity decreases.
The impact of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak was also discussed in this context.
Animal COVID has been known since the late 1930s.
Before the first isolation of HCoV-229E variant B814 from the nasal secretion of a cold patient, different CoVs were isolated from various infected animals including turkey, mouse, cow, pig, cat and dog.
Seven HCOVs have been identified in the past decades.
A brief summary of the findings of HCOV in chronological order (Table 1) will be informative and instructive.
The first HCoV-229E variant was isolated in 1966 from patients with upper respiratory tract infections, and WI-38 lung cell lines have since been grown.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E experienced symptoms of a cold, including headache, sneezing, hoarseness and sore throat, as well as fever and cough in 10-20% of cases.
Later, in 1967, HCOV-OC43 was isolated from organ cultures of small rats and then from a serial passage in the brain.
The clinical features of HCoV-OC43 infection were similar to those of HCoV-229E, which are not distinguishable in terms of symptoms from infections with other respiratory pathogens such as influenza A viruses and rhinoviruses.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are globally distributed and are primarily infected during the winter season in low temperature environments.
Typically, the incubation period for infection with these two viruses is less than a week followed by about two weeks of illness.
Studies in human volunteers have shown that healthy individuals infected with HCoV-229E have developed mild colds.
Only a few patients with weakened immune systems develop severe lower respiratory tract infections.
SARS, also called "atypical pneumonia", was the first properly documented universally transmitted HCoV in human history, and the etiological agent SARS-CoV is the third HCoV discovered.
The first SARS case was detected in late 2002 in Guangdong province, China.
The SARS epidemic resulted in 8,096 reported cases with 774 deaths, which spread across several countries and continents.
It is estimated that each case without hypertransmitters can cause approximately two secondary cases, with an incubation period of 4 to 7 days, and the peak of viral effect can be seen on the tenth day of illness.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV may initially experience muscle aches, headaches, fever, chills and chills, followed by shortness of breath, coughing and respiratory distress.
Lymphoma, impaired liver function tests and increased creatinine kinase are common abnormalities found in SARS laboratories.
Diffuse alveolar damage, epithelial cell proliferation and an increase in macrophages have also been reported in SARS patients.
Approximately 20 to 30 percent of patients require intensive care and mechanical ventilation afterward.
Besides the lower respiratory tract, the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidneys can also be infected with this serious disease, often as a cytokine storm, which can be fatal, especially for patients with compromised immune systems.
The virus was first isolated from an open lung biopsy of a relative of a patient who had travelled to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, there has been a tremendous effort in HCOV research.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old baby in the Netherlands in late 2004.
It was initially found in children, the elderly and patients with immunodeficiency syndrome.
Colds, dry eyes, fever and pneumonia are common symptoms of HCoV-NL63 infection.
Another independent study in the Netherlands described isolating the same virus from the nasal secretions of an eight-month-old child with pneumonia.
Although it was discovered in the Netherlands, it has spread worldwide.
It is estimated that HCOV-NL63 is responsible for 4.7% of common respiratory diseases and its highest incidence occurs in summer, spring and early winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also known as Crohn's disease.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man hospitalized for pneumonia and respiratory infections in Hong Kong.
HCoV-HKU1 is associated with severe asthma development, including community-acquired pneumonia and pneumonia.
HCoV-HK1 is also found worldwide as HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 which cause mild respiratory illness.
All four of these community-acquired HCoVs have been well-adjusted in humans and are unlikely to turn into serious diseases, although unknown factors may also cause accidents as has been the case with more virulent subtypes of HCoV-NL63, which have been reported to cause severe lower respiratory tract infections in China more recently.
Generally, when these HCOVs gain the ability to efficiently transmit and persist in humans, they also become less toxic or pathogenic.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 in Saudi Arabia from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient who had severe pneumonia and renal impairment.
Although the majority of confirmed cases originated in the Middle East, imported cases of secondary transmission were reported in various European countries and Tunisia due to close contacts.
The second outbreak was in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical signs of MERS are similar to those of SARS, which is manifested by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS suffered severe kidney failure, which is very unusual for MERS in HCoV-related diseases.
The number of patients with symptoms of gastroenteritis such as diarrhea and vomiting was over 30%.
As of 14 February 2020, more than 2,500 confirmed cases had been reported with a fatality rate of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most devastating viruses known to mankind.
In mid-to-late December 2019, clusters of pneumonia cases associated with previously known SARS-CoV-2 infection began to appear in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization declared the outbreak of a lower respiratory infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 as a public health emergency of international concern and designated the disease as COVID-19.
As of 3 March 2020, there were 90,053 confirmed cases worldwide, with a crude case fatality rate of 3.4%.
Notably, the case fatality rate in China's Hubei was 4.2% compared to 1.2% outside of the city.
SARS-CoV-2 causes acute respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which are manifested by fever, cough and respiratory infections.
Some patients also experienced diarrhoea.
Pneumonia was one of the most severe symptoms and it can rapidly increase severe respiratory distress.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to high nucleotide sequence homogeneity, they are in different branches in phylogenetic structure.
SARS-CoV-2 is apparently less pathogenic but more transmissible than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Asymptomatic cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection have been reported and may have contributed to its rapid spread worldwide.
Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with six other HCoVs reveals a large number of similarities and heterogeneities.
First of all, the incubation period and the duration of the HCV infection are very similar.
In this respect, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trends of the other six HCoVs.
Second, the severity of symptoms of COVID-19 is between SARS-CoV and the four community-derived HCoVs (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibits features that are seen during normal HCoV infections, including nonspecific, mild, or no symptoms.
On the other hand, even though the incidence is low, there is a small subset of severe cases of COVID-19 also in SARS-CoV infections.
Third, SARS-CoV-2 infection is characterized by the curious patterns of both community-acquired HCoV and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 is as highly transmissible as community-acquired HCoV.
On the other hand, it remains to be verified whether the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is reduced after transmission to humans, as in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in the saliva samples.
Future studies will need to clarify whether SARS-CoV-2's oral-to-oral transmission plays a role as important as SARS-CoV in at least some of the circumstances.
It will be interesting to see if SARS-CoV-2 also shows seasonality, as do community-acquired HCoV cases.
However, the features of SARS-CoV-2 including its post-human transmission, infectivity, pathogenicity and sustained human transmission will be influential in the ultimate fate of the current COVID-19 outbreak.
HCoVs from all four communities, which produce mild symptoms, have been well matched in humans.
On the other hand, it may also be true that humans have adapted well to these four HCOVs.
In other words, both could be survivors of ancient HCoV infections.
HCoVs that cause severe human disease and HCoVs that cause severe human disease should be eradicated.
For this to happen, HCoVV must be replicated in humans to a sufficient extent to accumulate favorable mutations that will defeat the inhibitory factors of the virus.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak lasts and the more people it infects, the more likely it is to become fully adaptive to humans.
If it adapts well, it will be difficult to stop its spread to humans through quarantine or other infection control measures.
For several years, four community-acquired CoVs have been transmitted to humans, causing colds in immunocompromised individuals.
Viruses do not need the shelter of these animals.
In contrast, highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not adapted well to humans and their transmission in humans is not likely to be permanent.
They need to be maintained and propagated in their animal-like habitat and possibly spread to susceptible human targets through one or more intermediate and amplifying hosts.
The characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 are similar to those of SARS-CoV/Mars-CoV and the four community-derived HCoVs.
At least for now, it is highly contagious, like community-acquired HCV.
However, it is more pathogenic than community-acquired HCV and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether these shelters or intermediate animals will be able to fully adapt to humans without a host and spread to humans.
Before discussing the animal origins of HCoVs, it would be appropriate for us to discuss the definitions and characteristics of the evolutionary, natural, host, intermediate and amplifier hosts of HCoVs.
An animal can become a host for HCoV evolution if it harbours a closely related ancestor that shares high homogeneity at the nucleotide sequence level.
In this case, the ancestor virus is often adapted and not pathogenic.
Similarly, the parasitic host provides continuous and long-term shelter for HCV.
In both cases, the host is naturally infected and the natural host of the HCV or its parent virus.
Conversely, if HCoV is introduced into an intermediate host shortly before or during its introduction to humans, it does not adapt to the new host and is likely to become pathogenic.
These intermediate hosts can then act as zoonotic hosts of human infection and can act as a prophylactic host by allowing the virus to replicate momentarily and then transmit to humans to increase the spread of human infection.
An HCoV infection may be terminated if it is unable to sustain its transmission in the intermediate host.
In contrast, HCOVs can accept intermediate host and not only that, but can establish long-term pathogenicity.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes the natural parasite host.
Epidemiological data has revealed retrospectively that the first case of SARS has a history of contact with predators.
Subsequent seroprevalence studies showed that the prevalence of anti-SARS-COV-IGG was higher in animal traders than in the general population.
Masked palm civets (Paguema larvata) and raccoon dogs in live animal markets were first identified as carriers of SARS-CoV-like viruses that were similar to SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly reinforced by the fact that no further SARS cases were reported after killing all the civets in the market.
However, it was also reported that the majority of masked palm civets in forests or farms that were not in contact with live animal markets were negative for SARS-CoV, suggesting that perhaps masked palm civets are intermediate propagating hosts but not natural hosts of SARS-CoV.
Significantly, 80% of the different animals in the Guangzhou market had anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, so it is also possible that different species of small mammals could also act as intermediate amplifier hosts for SARS-CoV.
These are all seen as the final straw of SARS-CoV.
Subsequent searches for the natural animal host of SARS-CoV led to the discovery of a closely related bat-CoV, called SARS-related Rhinoceros bat-CoV HKU3 (SARS R-RH-bat-CoV-HKU3), which exists in the Chinese horseshoe bat.
These receptors are positive for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and for the genome sequence of SARS-RH-BATCOV-HKQ3.
It and other bat species share 88-92% nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV.
These studies laid the foundation for the new idea that bats feed on the human pathogens that develop.
Several SARS-like COVs (SL-CoVs) have been identified from bats, but none other than WIV1 has been isolated as a live virus.
Human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is thought to be the receptor for SARS-CoV.
WIV1 was obtained from a sample of the gut of bats which was then exposed to be used as a receptor for entry into bats, civets and human ACE2 cells.
Interestingly, the blood plasma of a SARS patient who recovered from the disease was able to inhibit WIV1.
Thus, WIV1 represents the closest related ancestor of SARS-CoV in bats that shares 95% nucleotide sequence homology.
Although there is high homogeneity between the two viruses, it is generally understood that WIV1 is not an intermediate parent virus of SARS-CoV and that bats are not immediate parasitic hosts of SARS-CoV.
The genealogical analysis groups MERS-CoV into the same cluster as COV-HKY4 and bat COV-HKY5.
Both bat COVID-HKU4 and MERS-CoV are transmitted by the parasite, which uses dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) for viral entry.
The sequence of RNA-dependent RNA polymers of MERS-CoVs is genetically close to the counterparts found in Bat Beta-CoVs in Europe and Africa.
So far, no live MERS-CoV has been found in wild bats.
Only 87% nucleotide sequence homology is found between MERS-CoV and its closely related bat-CoV-HKY25.
Thus, bats may not be the immediate parasitic host of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that dromedary camels are seropositive to the MERS-CoV specific neutral antibodies, as are camels of Middle Eastern descent found in many African countries.
Living MERS-CoV is similar to the virus found in humans that was isolated from nasal swabs of dromedary camels, further indicating that camels serve as host parasitic hosts of MERS-CoV.
It is noteworthy that a large number of viruses, usually mild in symptoms, were found in experimental samples in camels infected with MERS-CoV.
Notably, infected camels not only inhale the virus through the respiratory tract but also through the faecal tract, which is also the main route of escape of the virus from the urinary tract.
The question remains, however, that in many confirmed cases of MERS there is no history of contact with camels before the onset of symptoms, a human-to-human transmission route or an unknown transmission route in which unidentified animal species that harbor MERS-CoV are likely to be the cause.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% nucleotide homology with bat COVID RATG13, isolated from a bat-like organism related to Rhinolephus.
As in the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence variation between SARS-CoV-2 and RATG-13 is very good for determining the paternity relationship.
This means that bats are unlikely to be the immediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2, unless a bat-CoV similar to it is found in the future.
Therefore, the host animal of SARS-CoV-2 intermediary must be a wildlife species that was sold and killed at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, with many of the early cases associated with COVID-19 being associated with the animal-to-human transmission event.
Numerous recent studies based on metagenomic sequencing have suggested that a group of endangered small mammals known as pangolins (Manis javanica - the cat-eating cat) may also be the shelter for the ancestor beta-CVO associated with SARS-CoV-2.
These new pangolins share 85-92% of the nucleotide sequence homology of the COV genomes with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are closely related to RATG13 at the level of nucleotide sequence by approximately 90% homology.
They group SARS-CoV-2-like viruses into two sub-branches in the gene tree, one of which shares the more similar RBD with SARS-CoV-2, a 97.4% amino acid sequence identifier.
In the paradox of inevitability, the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 are more diverse, yet higher in the proportion of genome-wide homologation sequences.
Recent research on infected pangolins has also reported detection of viral envelopes on lung samples, which were found to be similar in extent to SARS-CoV-2.
The research adopted a distinct assembly method and physical curation to produce partial genome sequences of approximately 86.3% of the full length viral genome.
We cannot rule out the possibility that pangolins are one of the animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
However, due to the sequence variation between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolins SARS-CoV-2 related beta-CoVs, there is currently no evidence to support that SARS-CoV-2 is a direct pangolin origin.
Besides, the gap between SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 is also much smaller than the gap between SARS-CoV-2 and the Pangolin SARS-CoV-2 related beta-CoVs.
The path of evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals has yet to be established.
While the highest sequence homogeneity was found in RBD between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolins, SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs, SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 share the highest genome-wide sequence homogeneity.
There is widespread speculation that there are high levels of similarity between the RBD of Pangolin's SARS-CoV-2 related beta-CoV and that of SARS-CoV-2 carried by selective-path-pharmacotherapy coevolution.
Pangolins is an alternative proposal in the benefit of recombination between SARS-CoV-2 related beta-CoV and RTG13 in a third wild animal species.
As a driving force in evolution, recombination is widespread in beta-CoVs.
The jury is still searching for the immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
Even with high levels of pathogenic HCoVs, the animal origin of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKY1 has also been studied.
Genetic evidence has shown that HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E both originated from bat COVs, while HCoV-OC43 parent viruses of HCoV-HKU1 were found in rodents.
It has been reported that bat COV ARCOV.2 (Appalachian Ridge COV) found in the North American Triangulum bat, has shown close association with HCOV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E is chromosomally related to another bat COV, named Hipposideros/Ghanaquam/19/2008, which was detected in Ghana, while camels were suspected to be their intermediate hosts.
For clarity, the current knowledge on animal origin of known HCoVs is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Historically, evidence of interspecies transmission of HCOV has been presented through genealogical analysis.
When HCoV-OC43 from domestic animals crossed the species to infect humans around 1890, an outbreak of respiratory infection was recorded.
The interspecies transmission history of HCoV-229E is poorly understood.
Bat alpha-CoV, which is closely related to HCoV-229E, has been detected.
One of them is alpaca alpha-CoV.
There are multiple layers of evidence supporting direct transmission of the virus from bats to humans.
First, it's possible that humans, not alpacas, came into contact with bats in a shared environment.
Instead, humans have a closer relationship with alpacas.
Secondly, bat-related HCOV-229E alpha-COV is distinct and non-pathogenic in bats, whereas alpacas alpha-COV has been implicated in outbreaks of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, Alpacas alpha-CoV has not been detected in wildlife.
Thus, the possibility that alpaca may have acquired HCoV-229E-related alpha-CoV from humans cannot be ruled out.
In fact, bats are a direct source of human pathogenic viruses including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
It is therefore not surprising that bats can directly transmit HCoV-2229E to humans.
Alternatively, bat alpha-CoV is the genetic stockpile of HCoV-229E, the alpaca and dromedary camel may serve as intermediate hosts that can transmit the virus to humans, as happened in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV has served as the best example of inter-species transmission from bats to dromedary camels and from dromedary camels to humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV from bats is known for its early identification and has been reinforced by subsequent discoveries.
It is clear that bats provide a rich reservoir of viral species for the interspecies exchange of genetic fragments and interspecies transmission.
Longevity, dense colonies, close social interaction and the ability to fly all provide ideal conditions for bats to be 'viral vectors'.
MERS-CoV, on the other hand, has been penetrating dromedary camels for decades.
These camels have adapted well to them, which has made them stable and natural parasitic hosts from intermediate hosts.
MERS-CoV causes a very mild disease and maintains a relatively low mutation rate in these animals.
Their small number of human infections is an accident, and humans are the most vulnerable to MERS-CoV because their infection is not persistent.
This role of camels in the transmission of MERS-CoV is in contradiction to, if anything, the role of pangolins in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
In particular, pangolin beta-CoV is highly pathogenic in pangolins.
They may be step-wise prophylactic for SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs, as is the case with SARS-CoV cases.
Future research should consider or rule out the numerous possibilities for an interspecies transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans.
First, bats may be parasitic hosts of SARS-CoV-2 related viruses, which is almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans can share their environment with bats by killing them or by mining coal.
Second, pangolins may be one of the intermediate amplifying hosts for the recently identified SARS-CoV-2 related virus.
Human exposure to the virus is through slaughter and eating of fish that have been caught.
It is possible that many mammals, including pets, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
For antibodies, a pet and wildlife survey is required.
Third, as mentioned above, recombination and uptake of SARS-CoV-2 can be found in a third species that is in contact with bats and pangolins.
The animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still being investigated.
Apart from the different types of animal carriers, there are also three main aspects in favour of the COVID virus in facilitating crossing the species barrier.
First, they have a relatively high mutation rate in RNA replication.
Compared to other single-stranded RNA viruses, the estimated mutation rate of COVID is dependent on the stage of acceptance of COVID by the new host, with an average replacement rate of "mild" to "high" at -10-4 replacements per 2 sites per year.
COVs have an evidence-reading exoribonuclease, the deletion of which results in high mutation crossing and degeneration or even viability.
Remarkably, the nucleotide analogue remdesivir is known to inhibit the replication of COV by these exoribonucleases and RNA-dependent RNA polymers.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising agents against SARS-CoV-2 being tested in clinical trials.
However, the mutation rate of COVs is about a million times higher than the rate of their hosts.
Furthermore, when COVs are not well tolerated by the host, the mutation rate is always high.
Compared to SARS-CoV with a high mutation rate, SARS-CoV-2 has a clearly low mutation rate, indicating a high level of susceptibility to humans.
It may have already been taken up by other near-human hosts.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which has been well accepted by drones.
In theory, it is unlikely that genetic drift will cause ineffective rapid vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 and anti-viral.
Second, the large RNA genome in COVs provides additional flexibility for genome editing, mutation and recombination, which increases the possibility of interspecies co-evolution, which, when conditions are favorable, is beneficial for the emergence of novel COVs.
This is supported by multiple open readable frames and by the action of proteins encoded at the 3' end of the genome.
Third, COVs switch the template between RNA replications randomly and frequently through a "copy-selection" mechanism.
In the cell, they act as a mixing vessel, with strand switching occurring frequently during the transcription of the COV RNA.
A high proportion of homologous full-length and subgenomic RNAs can reassort to produce new COVID-19.
Genetic evidence of natural recombination has been found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43 as well as in animal COVs such as bat-SL-CoV and bat-CoV-HKU9.
Interaction between virus and host in relation to transmission
In addition to the three viral aspects mentioned above, viral interaction with the host recipient is another important factor that is influential in interspecies transmission.
Here, recombination of SARS-CoV is taken as a paradigmatic example, which has also shown evidence of positive selection between incidences of interspecies transmission.
Based on comparative analysis between isolates of Sars-CoV and Civet, it appears that SARS-CoV has been rapidly accepted in different animals, especially with mutations in the RBD of the S protein.
Typically, in RBD in S proteins, COV interacts with the cell receptor and is actively selected by the cell's antibody response.
In SARS-CoV, RBDs are located at the 318th to 510th amino acid in the S1 segment, which binds to human ACE2 as well as their recipients for viral entry.
SARS-CoV's RBD allows interspecies transmission of viruses that are able to recognize ACE2 receptors of various animals, including bats, rats, mice, and raccoon dogs.
In fact, only six amino acid residues were found to be different in the RBD between the human and civet viral isolates, and four of them were located in the receptor-binding pattern for interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
In SIV SARS-CoV, K489N and S487T mutants are present in their RBDs, which may enhance the desire for interacting of spike proteins with human ACE2 receptors.
In other words, the replacement of these two amino acids may be important for viral acceptance in humans.
It is important to note that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cellular receptor with SARS-CoV.
The 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of the S protein indicates that the binding affinity of their S proteins with human ACE2 may have been altered.
In fact, one cryo-EM study has shown that the desire for these bonds is 10 to 20 times greater than the desire for a binding between human ACE2 and SARS-CoV-S proteins.
It would also be of interest to determine whether any other co-recipients are required for transmission of SARS-COV-2.
HCOV-NL63 is also likely to bind to ACE2, but with a different part of the S.
There are numerous other HCOV receptors, such as amino peptides N for HCoV-229E, and 9-O-acetylated sialic acid for HCoV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these COVs to humans after interspecies transmission from their animal hosts.
As an addition to cellular metabolism, the effect of interspecies transmission of HCOV is also controlled by other nutrient dependence and inhibitory factors.
The uptake of this nutrient protein between the natural storage hosts of HCoVs such as humans and bats, dromedary camels and rodents can inhibit interspecies transmission.
Successful interspecies transmission of HCoVs requires strengthening nutrient dependency factors and reversing nutrient restriction factors.
In this regard, molecular determinants in this important viral-pesticide interaction region are yet to be identified and characterized.
For SARS-CoV-2, the unbiased genome-wide and prevention factor screening of nutrient dependence using CRISPR's state-of-the-art technology can be useful.
The emergence of new HCVs: going back to zero
The variation of bat COVs provides ample opportunity for emergence of new HCoVs.
Thus, the swollen COV acts as a genetic reservoir for the HCoV.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination also cause HCoVs to evolve and serve as two important milestones in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein-coding genes has the potential to radically alter viral patterns.
Of the SARS-CoV helper proteins, ORF8 is considered critical for acceptance in humans, as SARS-CoV-related mitosis viruses are found to encode the unspoken ORF8 proteins when isolated.
The 29-nucleotide deletion of SARS-CoV has been found in a strain isolated early in the human outbreak.
This deletion causes ORF8 to split into ORF8a and ORAP8b, and is considered a receptor mutation, which promotes cell migration.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a history of potential recombination with the alpha- and gamma-CoV lineages, which are characterized by a large number of small recombinant regions in the RNA.
Reconnection sites were also identified in NSP 9, most of NSP 10, and parts of NSP 14.
Similarly, it has been shown that MERS-CoV has experienced recombination events in different lineages, which have been found in dromedary camels in Saudi Arabia.
Apart from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events have been reported in other HCoVs, including HCoVs recombining with other animal COVs in their non-structural genes.
Artificial selection may also contribute to unwanted alteration of the viral genome, often by releasing the virus from the selective pressure exerted by the host's immune system.
An example of this effect is the loss of full-length ORF4 in the HCoV-229E prototype lineage, leading to two-nucleotide deletion.
One ORF4 can be found in HCOC-229E-related strain and camel virus, the alpha-CoV indicates single nucleotide inclusion, which results in frame shifts.
Last but not least, the evolution of new HCoVs is also made possible by selection pressure in their parasitic hosts.
Isolated or only mild symptoms were found when bats were infected with COVID, which suggests a mutual acceptance between COVID and bats.
It appears that bats have adapted well to COVID through physical appearance and physiological activity.
For example, a defect in the activation of the pre-inflammatory response in the lymph nodes reduces the efficiency of the pathology that is triggered by COV.
Furthermore, the natural killer cell receptor NKG2/CD94 is suppressed due to upregulation of the natural killer cell activity in the lymph nodes and the low expression of the major tissue adhesion complex class I molecule.
Furthermore, the high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated from the high-metabolic activity of bats both suppress COV replication activity and result in proferinging through the exoribonuclease, thus, when introduced into the new host, the genesis of the viral lineage provides pressure for large-scale pathogenicity.
More pathogenic COV strains also evolve in recombination, which leads to the acquisition of new proteins or protein features to absorb nutrients.
Thus, these three new HCOVs have not been accidental in the past two decades.
COVs have been shown to cause non-pathogenic or benign symptoms in their parasitic hosts such as bats or camels.
These powerful nutrients replicate the immune response without overwhelming it.
The mystery of why the carriers appeared here in the first place and what is causing the serious problem in human infection is hidden.
Symptoms are mainly due to the high activation of the acute immune response and cytokine storms, while where the immune response is stronger, more severe forms of lung damage appear.
In contrast, in the immediate carrier, the immune response is deployed to replicate the COVID.
This same immune response disruption strategy may be a useful strategy in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2.
The interferon response is particularly strong in bats.
Thus, the administration of at least type-I interferon should be beneficial in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans.
Furthermore, the inflammatory activation of NLRP3 in bats is defective.
Due to this, MCC950 co-sandman of NLRP3 agonist may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general pattern by which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV emerge.
Conversely, in bat-CoV, beta-CoVs were found to share 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV, whereas bat-CoVs also shared 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
However, even after the emergence of marketed mammals and other animals as hosts for SARS-CoV-like viruses, intermediary hosts for SARS-CoV-2 were not immediately identified.
SARS-CoV-2 homology has been surprisingly found in Pangolins beta-CoV, suggesting that Pangolins may have acted as one of the intermediate hosts or that Pangolins beta-CoV may have contributed genetic traits to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
The question remains, however, that there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is either deliberately or accidentally man-made.
The recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 has brought the COVID-19 to the limelight once again.
Studies in bats and other animals have fundamentally changed our understanding of the importance of the parasitic host of HCoVs in their zoonotic origin and human infection.
The evidence from the outbreak showed that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 had a bat origin and its transmission to humans was through intermediate hosts.
The SARS-CoV outbreak was caused by human-wild cat contact at a market, and the closure of the seafood market and the killing of the wild cats there effectively ended the SARS-CoV outbreak.
For the same reason, pangolins should also be removed from the seafood market to prevent animal-borne infection, in view of the discovery that the multiple lineage of pangolins beta-CoV is closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, whether and how the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from pangolins and other mammals to humans has yet to be explained in future research.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been present in dromedary camels for a long time.
The camel is an important means of transportation and has been a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool products for the local people.
They are widely spread in the Middle East and Africa.
It is impossible to sacrifice all camels for the control of MERS, as was done in the wildlife markets of China to contain the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop recurrent outbreaks of MERS, the overall vision of developing an effective vaccine against MERS-COVID for camels should be taken up along with the integration of other infection control measures.
Because we can't eliminate these viruses, new strains can emerge to cause outbreaks.
In the wild, there are also many different types of zoonotic seabream.
Especially, bat COVs are highly variable in animal-derived potential.
There are numerous opportunities for evolution and recombination in these zoonotic COVs, resulting in the emergence of new forms of COV that are more infectious and/or lethal in humans in the future.
The culture of eating wild animals in some parts of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
In the case of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, a better preparedness and response plan should be in place.
In fact, viruses have been around for a long time on this planet.
They stay in their own natural habitat until they have a chance to spread.
Although bats have many viruses-spreading characteristics, training people to avoid bats and other wildlife species can reduce their exposure to humans.
Continuous monitoring of mammals is needed to better understand the life cycle of COVs and their natural hosts, which could be useful in preventing animal-to-human transmission and future outbreaks.
To conclude, the most effective way to contain the zoonotic virus is to keep the animal away from the ecological location of the natural reservoir of the zoonotic virus.
Many pieces of the puzzle of the animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 are still missing.
First, if bats infected pangolins with the ancestor virus of SARS-CoV-2, it would be interesting to see under what conditions bats and pangolins share the same ecological niche.
If, however, other bats played a more direct role in human infection, then we need to determine how humans came into contact with bats.
Third, if tertiary mammals really did act as intermediate hosts, it should be clear how they interacted with different species, including humans, bats and pangolins.
Finally, the possibility that many mammals, including pets, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 should be investigated and experimentally infected.
If it is a bat, pangolin or other mammal, it may be possible to identify a similar SARS-CoV-2 or its ancestor virus in its natural host in the future.
Continued exploration in this field will shed light on the evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, which is a key finding in the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
It is necessary to update the diagnostic criteria of "suspected case" and "confirmed case" of COVID-19.
On February 6, 2020, our team has published the Rapid Advisory Guidelines for Diagnosis and Treatment of 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection, and these guidelines have become a good reference for our nation and the global fight against the pandemic.
However, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease. Our awareness and knowledge is gradually increasing based on the experience of ongoing research findings and clinical practice, therefore, the strategies of diagnosis and treatment are also constantly updated.
In the letter, a commentary on our guidelines and the latest diagnosis of COVID-19 (seventh edition) "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases" according to the latest diagnosis and treatment guidelines provided by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China is highlighted.
In December 2019, the outbreak was caused by the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which has been officially named Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), and the virus was named Severe Acute Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic.
To combat the infection of SARS-CoV-2, our team has developed quick consultation guidelines and they have been published online in Military Medical Reservoir on 06 Feb 2020.
Since its publication, it has garnered a lot of attention.
Note that even though COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge is gradually increasing based on ongoing research findings and clinical practice, so the diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly being updated.
For example, a total of seven editions of the Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020 were published with some context-revised abstracts.
Now that our guidelines have received comment from Zhou et al., they have submitted a simple score proposal based on their clinical experience.
His work has added new evidence to our guidelines and also provided a valuable context for the pandemic across the world.
We acknowledge and thank him for his remarkable work.
However, his work also needs to be updated in line with the latest diagnosis and treatment guidelines of COVID-19 (trial version 7) and recent studies.
As per the Seventh Edition (3 March 2020), confirmation of suspected case requires any one item of characteristic of the clinical history to be combined with two items of clinical discovery, or if there is no clear clinical history, three items of clinical discovery to be completed.
Communicable history: (1) history of traveling to or residing in Wuhan City and its surroundings, or in an area where COVID-19 cases have been reported for 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (2) history of contact with cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection (including positive nucleic acid test); (3) history of contact with a patient with fever, or with respiratory symptoms, from Wuhan City and its surroundings, or from another community where COVID-19 has been reported in the previous 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (4) history of contact with areas of confirmed cases, (such as home, office, school, etc.) in a small group, with ≥ 2 cases of fever and/or respiratory symptoms within 2 weeks.
Clinical findings: (1) Fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) Symptomatic features of COVID-19 infection; (3) Total white cell count reduced to normal, or lymphocyte count decreased in the early stages of onset.
Diagnosis of confirmed cases should be based on suspected cases with any one of the following components of pathogenic or serological evidence as provided: (1) a positive real-time PCR test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) a complete viral genome sequence showing high affinity for known novel coronavirus; (3) a positive serum test for SARS-CoV-2 specific IgM antibodies and IgG antibodies; or a negative change from a positive to a positive SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibodies, or an increase in the titer ≥4 times in the acute or recovery phase.
We can see that the real-time PCR test for nucleic acid in respiratory tract or blood samples was added in the second (January 18, 2020) and third (January 22, 2020) versions.
Pathogenic identification of blood samples was added in the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) editions; and later in the seventh edition, serological evidence was added.
These improvements are based on the researchers' regular work of identifying optimal nucleic acid for rapid diagnosis, as well as the inclusion of respiratory tract blood samples, which has increased the availability of different samples, and supported the positive results of specific antibodies in the confirmed criteria.
In addition, there was a growing body of evidence that reminded us to be cautious with both the typical symptoms and the asymptomatic ones.
Therefore, Zhou et al. should update the flow chart, as they are classifying the person without clinical symptoms as "low risk".
The scoring system also needs to be verified in future clinical practice and studies.
In conclusion, we hope that more direct evidence will come to readers for their comments.
For diagnosis of suspected case and confirmed case, we should track and follow the latest guidelines of its country of origin.
Our team will also update our guidelines from time to time to help you.
Bangladesh reports five new COVID-19 deaths, highest in a single day
Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths from COVID-19 in one day yesterday.
This is the highest number of deaths from the virus in a day.
As of yesterday, 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases are staying at home as reported by the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) of Bangladesh.
A total of 17 deaths have been reported.
In an online briefing, IEDCR director, Dr. Mirzade Sabrina Flora, said that the dead included four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Mirzaade, two cases were in the 60s, two were in the 51-60s, and one was in the 41-50s.
She also said that two of the victims were from Dhaka.
On 11 March, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a pandemic.
Hospital officials told a local news outlet, Adolu Agency, that one of the dead was Jalal Saifoor Rahman, director of the Bengal Anti-Corruption Commission, who was being treated at the Amity Hospital in Kuwait.
In an online video announcement on Saturday, Bangladesh Road Transport and Bridges Minister Obaidul Kwadar said that public transport will remain closed for longer than originally planned until Saturday.
The public transportation shutdown was initially scheduled to begin on March 26 and was planned to end on Saturday, April 4.
The movement of essential goods - medical, fuel and food - is still allowed.
The first reported case of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh on 8 March, involving two people who had returned from Italy and the wife of one of them.
On March 19, all three of them were already cured.
SARS-CoV-2 has surpassed one million infections worldwide.
On Thursday, the total number of cases worldwide of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection crossed the one million mark, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
At least 52,000 deaths were linked to COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.
This milestone came on the same day as Malawi confirmed its first coronavirus infection and Zambia confirmed their coronavirus-related death.
North Korea, on Thursday, claimed that it is one of the few countries that has remained free from the coronavirus infection.
As of now, WHO has confirmed 1,051,635 cases yesterday, including 79,332 cases in the previous 24 hours as of 10.00 am Central European Time (0800 UTC) on 4 April.
In the United States, more than 244,000 coronavirus cases have been reported, of which 5,900 have been linked to deaths.
CBS News, citing data from Johns Hopkins University, reported that more than 1,000 deaths from coronavirus infection were reported in the U.S. on Wednesday.
Worldwide, strict measures have been announced to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, the mayor of Moscow, extended the lockdown until May 1.
At the national level, President Vladimir Putin announced that Russians will continue to receive their salaries even if they do not go to work until April 30.
The Portuguese Parliament extended the state of national emergency for another 15 days, with the resolution passed by 215 votes to 10, with one vote against.
Saudi Arabia has imposed a full-day curfew in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina: Previously, the curfew was only from 3 pm to 6 am.
Thailand plans to implement a curfew from 10pm to 4am.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine has extended his stay-at-home order until May 1.
Stores in Australia have reduced the limit of toilet paper per transaction.
On Sunday and Saturday evening, Australian store chain Woolworths and Coles reduced its restrictions on purchases of toilet paper to two and one package per transaction respectively, nationally.
ALDI, too, started the one-pack limit on Monday.
These restrictions were posted as messages at the checkout and on the chain's Facebook page.
If people need to self-isolate, shoppers are stocking up for fear of COVID-19.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited the purchase to one pack per order for home delivery.
These changes come after the previous four-pack ban per transaction introduced by Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5 respectively.
Coles, in their March 8th release, reported a four-pack ban, "many stores selling out within an hour of delivery", and said that demand was "unbelievable", while ALDI, in their Facebook post on Tuesday, called it "unexpected".
According to a Woolworths spokesman, sales have "significantly increased" in the past week.
Costco's store in Canberra also limited the quantity to two packs last week.
To further reduce the shortage, Coles ordered larger packages from suppliers and increased the delivery frequency. Woolworths ordered additional stock, while ALDI made availability early for the planned Wednesday.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said retailers have tried to increase stocks, but have been hampered by local council truck-delivery time restrictions.
They expect to see an increase in production costs, as suppliers have to meet demand, and to meet the low specialty.
On Tuesday, ADLI announced that due to early shipment of stock, some stores could not run Wednesday specials.
In a report for News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail expert at the Queensland University of Technology, said that stores are filling up their stock every night.
They complained that toilet paper is a big item, leading to a decline in numbers, and, when sold, a large amount of shelf space.
Coles and Woolworths have shown that if you have a lot of things on the shelf, like toilet rolls and sanitizer, and they're there in large numbers, you're less likely to panic, Russell Zimmerman told ABC News.
The recycled toilet paper manufacturer Who Gives a Crap said that it was out of stock.
Kimberly-Clark, which makes Kleenex Toilet Tissue, and Solaris Paper, which makes Sorbent, emphasised that they are working 24/7 to keep supplies running, according to a report from News.com.au.
Domain.com, a real estate site, reported that some property sellers in Melbourne are offering free toilet paper to the first bidder at its auction, when the big Labor Day weekend buyers were bidding for nothing because they had no time.
The Thursday edition of NT News, which is printed daily in Darwin, included eight pen inserts for cutting and use as toilet paper.
According to a March 3 report from ABC Australia, the store was originally opposed to the imposition of the restrictions, stating that it had no plans to impose any restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman said that there is also a high demand for other products including masks, sanitizers, dry goods, handwashes and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, on Sunday evening the British online supermarket Ocado limited the purchase of Andres toilet paper to two packs of 12-roll.
The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 as a global pandemic.
The ongoing COVID-19 outbreak was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on Wednesday, with the disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
Although the term "global contagion" refers to how much a disease has spread rather than how dangerous a particular event is, WHO has noted the need for concrete action by governments.
All countries can still cash out this global pandemic.
In response, nations must identify, test, treat, isolate, track and unite their people in the fight against TB, said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.
We are extremely concerned about both the alarming level of spread and severity and the appalling level of inaction.
According to Dr. Tom Freedan, former head of the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the global epidemic is "unprecedented".
In comments published in February on CNN, he says, "No other respiratory virus other than influenza has been traced from its origin to its global spread".
GEBRAIESUS shares the same view, saying, "We have never seen a global pandemic like the one caused by the coronavirus before".
He added, "And we have not seen a global pandemic that can be controlled in the same time".
The current state of the global pandemic follows the decision of WHO in January to declare this outbreak a public health emergency of global concern.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the United States National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said of the outbreak, "It is certain that the situation will get worse".
As of Thursday, the Associated Press reported that there are at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic is the global pandemic of the Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) which is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak, which was detected in Wuhan, China in December 2019, was declared a public health emergency of global concern on 30 January 2020 and has been recognised as a global pandemic since 11 March 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, nearly 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in nearly 97,000 deaths.
Nearly 364,000 people have recovered.
The estimated mortality rate in China is 4%, while in the world it ranges from 13.04% in Algeria to 0.08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and dizziness.
Symptoms of complicated cases may include pneumonia and severe respiratory distress.
The time from infection to symptom onset is usually about five days, but it can range from two to fourteen days.
No vaccine or specific antiviral treatment is known.
Primary treatment is symptomatic and supportive.Recommended preventive measures include hand washing, covering the mouth when coughing, distancing from other people, observation, and self-isolation by those who are suspected to be infected.
Authorities around the world have responded by restricting travel, quarantining, imposing curfews, controlling workplace hazards and closing services.
The pandemic has caused severe socio-economic isolation globally, with sporting, religious, political and cultural events being postponed or cancelled, and widespread shortages of supplies being triggered by panic buying.
Schools and universities are closed in 193 countries either nationally or locally, affecting nearly 99.4% of the global student population.
Misinformation about the virus has spread online, and there have been instances of fear or hatred and discrimination against Chinese people, other Eastern and Southeastern ethnic groups, and people from areas that look like them and have significant cases of the virus.
The reduction in travel and the closure of heavy industries has resulted in reduced air pollution and carbon emissions.
Health officials in Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei province) reported cases of pneumonia of unknown cause on 31 December 2019 and an investigation was initiated in early January 2020.
Most of the cases were related to the wholesale market of seafood in Hunan and therefore the virus is believed to be of animal origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak, known as SARS-CoV-2, is a newly discovered virus that is closely related to the bat coronaviruses, the cat coronaviruses and SARS-CoV.The earliest known person with symptoms was later diagnosed on 1 December 2019 and was not directly related to the subsequent Wet Market group.
Two-thirds of the initial batch of cases reported in 2019 were found to be market-related.
On 13 March 2020, an unconfirmed report in the South China Morning Post suggested that a 55-year-old man in Hubei Province, tracked to 17 November 2019, may be the first case.On 26 February 2020, the WHO reported that as new cases in China declined but suddenly increased in Italy and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China exceeded the number in China for the first time.
Cases may have been reported in a much smaller number, especially cases with mild symptoms.
As of 26 February, relatively few cases were reported among young people, with cases aged 19 or under accounting for 2.4% of cases worldwide.Patrick Vallance, Chief Medical Adviser of the United Kingdom, estimated that 60% of the British population would need to be infected before achieving mass immunisation.
Cases refer to the number of people tested for COVID-19 and confirmed positive as per official guidelines.
As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland had official policies not to test those with mild symptoms.
A study published on 16 March found that approximately 86% of COVID-19 cases in China had not been detected by 23 January, and that undocumented individuals with these infections were the source of infection in 79% of these documented cases.
A statistical analysis released on 30 March estimated that the number of infections in Italy was significantly higher than the number of cases reported.
The baseline reproduction number (R0) for COVID-19 was estimated to be 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that it could be 5.7.
The majority of people who get COVID-19 recover.
And in those who don't, the time from onset of symptoms to death is 6 to 41 days, with most of them 14 days.
As on 10th April 2020, nearly 97,000 deaths have been attributed to COVID-19.
In China, as of February 5, 80% of deaths were people over 60 years of age, and 75% had a pre-existing medical condition including heart disease and diabetes.The official death toll from the COVID-19 pandemic usually includes those who tested positive for COVID as per the official schedule.
The actual deaths from COVID-19 may be much higher, as it may not include people who have not been tested, for example, dying at home, in nursing homes, etc.
A small amount of data from Italy shows that the number of deaths during the global pandemic was 4-5 times higher than the official COVID death toll.
A spokeswoman for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledged that "we know that [the number of deaths reported] is an underestimate", a statement that is confirmed by incomplete reports of a decline in the US count.
The first death outside mainland China was reported in the Philippines on 1 February, and the first death outside Asia was reported in France on 14 February.
As of February 28, outside mainland China, more than a dozen deaths had been reported in Iran, South Korea, and Italy each.
Deaths were reported in more than forty countries and territories as of 13 March in all continents except Antarctica. Several methods are commonly used to record the number of deaths.
These figures vary by region and time, and are influenced by the number of tests performed, the quality of the health care system, treatment options, the time since the outbreak, and demographic characteristics; for example, age, gender, and overall health. The case-to-death ratio is the total number of deaths divided by the number of diagnosed cases in a given period.
The ratio of deaths to cases worldwide is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) as of April 10, 2020, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
The number varies by region.
The case-to-case ratio in China decreased from 17.3% (for those with symptoms from 1 to 10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for those with symptoms after 1 February 2020). Other methods include the case fatality rate (CFR), which represents the percentage of infected individuals (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who died from the disease.
These statistics are not time-bound and they track a specific population from infection to case resolution.
Many academic institutions have tried to calculate these figures for specific populations.
The University of Oxford's Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine estimates that the overall infection-death rate of the global pandemic is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The upper end of this range is consistent with the first randomized COVID-19 tests in Germany and a statistical study that analyzes the effect of the tests on CFR.
WHO is confident that the global pandemic can be brought under control.
The peak level and maximum duration of this outbreak is uncertain and it may vary by location.
According to Maciej Bony of Penn State University, "If unchecked, the outbreak of infection may stop at a certain level and grow, and it may decline as the host for the disease becomes less available.
But it is simply impossible to predict accurately when this will happen".
Zhong Nanshan, a senior medical adviser to the Chinese government, argued that if all countries start to follow the WHO's advice on measures to contain the spread of the virus, "this will be over by June".
On 17 March, Adam Kucharsky of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine noted that SARS-CoV2 is likely to remain in circulation for one to two years".
The study, led by Neil Ferguson of Imperial College, suggests that social distancing and other measures "will be necessary until a vaccine is available (which could take 18 months or longer)".
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University noted that "the virus is so easily transmitted that complete eradication is impossible", and that "it will be a seasonal disease and probably recur annually".
The toxicity or severity of the relapse depends on the collective immunity and the extent of the mutation.
Symptoms of COVID-19 are comparatively non-specific and are not likely to be observed in infected people.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, respiratory tract discharge (cough), loss of sense of smell, diarrhea, muscle and joint pain, wheezing, headache, chills, vomiting, bleeding, diarrhea or blue skin due to lack of oxygen. The WHO states that approximately one in six people develop severe illness and respiratory problems.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists emergency symptoms such as difficulty breathing, prolonged chest pain or pressure, sudden confusion, difficulty getting up, and facial or lip bruising, and recommends immediate medical treatment. Acute pneumonia, acute respiratory distress, tail injury, septic shock, and death may result if the disease progresses.
Some of those infected may be asymptomatic, showing no clinical signs, but test results may indicate infection, so researchers advise that those who have been in close contact with people who are confirmed to be infected should be closely monitored and screened to rule out the possibility of infection.
The Chinese estimate that the proportion of asymptomatic people may be as low as 44%.
The time to onset of actual disease after entering the body is usually from 1 to 14 days, with a peak of 5 days.For example, it is estimated that the number of people with COVID-19 who lost their sense of smell initially was 30%, and then it dropped to 15%.
Some details of how the disease might have spread are still being worked out.
The disease is thought to be spread primarily by close contact and small droplets formed by coughing, sneezing or talking, close contact within 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
During the study, it was found that cough drops without a mask can travel from 4.5 metres (15 ft) to 8.2 metres (27 ft) due to a cough without a mask.
Some have suggested that the virus can also be transmitted by small droplets that are released from the mouth during speech and can remain in the air for long periods of time. Although the virus does not form in the air, respiratory droplets can form during breathing and speech.
These droplets can enter the mouth or nose of people nearby, or be absorbed into the lungs with breath.
Medical procedures such as intubation or cardiopulmonary resuscitation can thinly disperse respiratory secretions and thus allow airborne transmission.
If someone touches a contaminated surface, including skin, and then touches their eyes, nose, or mouth, it can spread.
Although there are concerns that it could be spread through feces, it is considered to be of low risk.
The Chinese government has ruled out the possibility of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by feeding or oral route.Although transmission is possible before symptoms appear and in the later stages of the disease, the first three days after symptoms appear are the most likely to be infected with the virus.
People tested positive three days before symptoms appeared, suggesting that infection is possible even before large-scale symptoms appear.
There are only a few reports of asymptomatic but laboratory-confirmed cases, but some countries have detected asymptomatic infections when investigating contacts.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control says that while it is not fully understood how easily the disease spreads, one person can infect two to three others, and the virus can survive on surfaces for hours to days.
In particular, the virus has been found to be present on plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel for three days, on cardboard for one day and on the floor for four hours.
However, this can vary with humidity and temperature.Pets and other animals have tested positive for COVID-19.
Although British authorities recommend washing hands after contact with other surfaces that infected people may have touched, as well as washing hands after contact with animals, there is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an unprecedented virus, first isolated in Wuhan from three individuals with pneumonia associated with a cluster of cases of acute respiratory illness.
All features of the novel SARS-CoV-2 are found in all related coronaviruses that occur in nature. Outside the human body, the virus dies as household soap dissolves its protective coating. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to SARS CoV in origin.
It is believed to be of primitive origin.
Genetic analysis has revealed that coronaviruses form genetic clusters with two strains derived from vertebrates, including the genus Betacoronaviruses and the subgenus Serbikoviruses (Lineage B).
Its entire genome is 96% compatible with the samples of coronaviruses (BatCov RaTG13) related to other bats.
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there is only a single amino acid difference in some parts of the genome sequence between mosquito viruses and human viruses.
To date, a full genome comparison has detected 92% of the genome content shared between the virus in the mouse and SARS-CoV-2, which is insufficient to prove that the mouse is the intermediate host.
The diagnosis of viral infection can be made on the basis of symptoms but confirmation is by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) or CT imaging of the infected area.
A comparative study of PCR and CT performed in Wuhan suggested that CT, although less accurate, is significantly more sensitive than PCR and that many of its imaging characteristics are similar to those of other pneumonia and disease processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that CT be used as a diagnostic test for COVID-19 or not be used as a first-line test.
For SARS-CoV-2, WHO has issued several guidelines for RNA testing, the first of which was issued on 17 January.
This test uses real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test can be performed on a sample of the respiratory tract or blood.
Results are usually available within a few hours to a few days.
The test is usually performed using a sample of the upper nasal cavity from the back of the nose, but a sample of the throat can also be used. Many laboratories and companies are developing tests to detect blood-related resistance.
As of 6th April 2020, none of these tests had been proven to be accurate enough to be approved for widespread use.
In the US, a blood test developed by Sellax has only been approved for clinical use by certified laboratories.
Specific imaging features on radiographs and computed tomography (CT) of people who do not show symptoms have unconfirmed peripheral ground glass opacities and lack of pleural effusion.
The international online database of imaging findings of confirmed cases is being compiled by the Italian Radiological Society.
Imaging is less accurate in detecting COVID-19 without PCR confirmation due to its association with infections such as adenovirus.
A large study in China compared chest CT results to PCR and showed that while less accurate, imaging is faster and more sensitive to detect infection, and suggested that it should be considered as a screening tool in areas where the pandemic is spreading.
Convolutional neural networks with AI-based radiograph and CT have been developed to identify the viral image characteristics.
Prevention plans include maintaining good personal hygiene, hand washing, avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth, using tissue when coughing or sneezing, and throwing tissue directly in the trash.
Those who have already been infected are advised to wear surgical masks in public.
Physical distancing measures have also been recommended to prevent infection.Many governments have restricted or advised against travel from areas where outbreaks have occurred.
But the virus has reached the point of social transmission in large parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading in the community and some members of the community are unaware of when and where they became infected. Healthcare providers who are caring for an infected person are advised to take standard care, contact care and eye care.
The use of location information from mobile phones by governments for this purpose has raised privacy concerns and Amnesty International and 100 other organisations have issued a statement to limit such surveillance.
Several mobile apps have been implemented or suggested for voluntary use, and as of 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on options such as using Bluetooth to log in with other cell phones to maintain user privacy.
Users are then given a message if they have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19 that spreads misconceptions about preventing infection, such as that rinsing the nose and flushing the mouth are not effective.
There is no vaccine available for COVID-19, several organizations are working to develop vaccines.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after going to the toilet or if their hands appear dirty to the eye, before eating, and after blowing their nose, coughing, or sneezing.
This is because outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap because the household soap breaks its protective coating.
If a soap and water sanitizer is not available, the CDC still recommends the use of an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with a minimum of 60% alcohol by volume.
The WHO recommends not to touch eyes, nose, or mouth without washing hands.
Several solvents such as 62-71% ethanol, 50-100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hydrochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide and 0.2-7.5% povidone-iodine can be used to eliminate contamination on the surface (a stainless steel surface can be disinfected using a disinfectant in just one minute.)
Other solvents such as benzalkonium and crohexidine are less effective.
The CDC has recommended that if there is a suspected or confirmed case of COVID-19 in a place such as a latrine or nursing home, all tablets, touch screens, remote controls and equipment such as ATM machines used by ill persons in such an area should be disinfected.
Health authorities recommend that people who cough or sneeze cover their mouth and nose with a folded elbow or tissue and immediately dispose of the tissue.
Surgical masks are recommended for those who are likely to be infected, as wearing a mask can limit the amount and distance of travel of droplets that are spread by breathing when speaking, sneezing or coughing.
WHO has issued guidelines on when and how to use masks.
Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, said that wearing a mask may reduce the tendency for people to touch their faces, which is a major source of infection if hand hygiene is not good.
WHO recommends the use of masks only if healthy people are at risk, for example those caring for people who are infected with COVID-19, and also acknowledges that wearing a mask may help people avoid touching their faces.
Many countries have started encouraging the general public to wear masks.
The CDC recommends the use of non-medical masks made of cloth in the U.S. China specifically recommends the use of disposable medical masks for public healthcare providers, especially when in close contact with other people (1 meter (3 feet) or less).
Hong Kong recommends the use of surgical masks when using public transport or in crowded places.
Thai health officials are encouraging people to make cloth face masks at home and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned people from going out in public without wearing a mask or from going out without covering their nose and mouth.
On 16 March, Vietnam requested everyone to wear face masks in public places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has made it mandatory to wear a face mask when entering a grocery store.
Israel has asked all residents to wear face masks in public.
Taiwan is producing 10 million masks per day since mid-March and from 1st April, passengers will be required to wear face masks on trains and inter-city buses.
Panama has made it mandatory to wear a face mask when going out and recommended that those who cannot afford to buy face masks make them at home.
Face masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) involves infection control actions that are aimed at minimizing the spread of disease by minimizing close contact between individuals.
These practices include quarantining, travel restrictions, and closing schools, workplaces, playgrounds, theatres, or shopping centers.
People can implement social distancing by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded places, avoiding touching when greeting, and maintaining physical distance from others.
Several governments have mandated or recommended social distancing in the outbreak areas.
U.S. government agencies and health departments have reduced the maximum number of people that can be together from a maximum of 250 people (if the spread of COVID-19 in the region is not known) to 50 people and then to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned gatherings of more than two people in public. The CDC advises adults and those with medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, disorders of the circulation, hypertension, and compromised immune systems to stay home as they face an increased risk of serious illness and disorder. In late March 2020, WHO and other health agencies reduced the term "social distancing" to "physical distancing" in order to maintain physical or virtual distance while maintaining social contact.
The use of the term "social distancing" has resulted in people being isolated from each other in alternative ways rather than encouraging social contact. Some authorities have issued sexual health guidelines during this global pandemic.
This includes recommendations to have sex with someone you live with who is not infected with the virus or has symptoms of the virus.
It is recommended that those who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and who suspect they may have been infected should self-isolate at home.
Health agencies have provided proper guidance on how to self-quarantine. Many governments have ordered or recommended the quarantine of entire populations living in areas where the infection has been confirmed.
The highest level of self-isolation is recommended for those in high-risk groups.
Those who may have been in contact with a person infected with COVID-19 and who have recently traveled to a country or region where there is widespread infection are advised to self-isolate for 14 days from the last time they were in contact.
Prevention or containment and containment are the key measures to control the outbreak.
Prevention of transmission is done in the early stages of an outbreak and aims to track down those who are infected, isolate them, as well as plan measures to control the infection and vaccinate against the spread of the disease to other populations.
When it is not possible to prevent the spread of a disease, steps are taken towards mitigation: measures are taken to slow down the spread and to reduce its impact on health systems and society.
Both prevention and containment can be combined.
More extreme measures are needed to reduce the global epidemic by reversing the global epidemic by reducing the number of basic reproductions to less than 1 as part of a strategy to reduce the severity of the outbreak, called the Flattening of the Outbreak Graph.
This reduces the risk of strain on healthcare and saves time to develop vaccines and treatments.
Non-medical preventive measures that can manage an outbreak may include personal preventive measures such as hand hygiene, face masks and self-isolation, school closures, encouraging and involving the community in the approval of interventions such as banning large gatherings, and similar social measures aimed at physical distancing, such as cleaning surfaces related to the surrounding environment.
Other countries have also taken various measures to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea has started mass testing and localised quarantine and has warned to be vigilant about the movements of infected people.
Singapore provided financial assistance to those who self-isolated and punitive measures to those who were unable to do so.
Taiwan increased production of face masks and sanctions against stockpiling medical supplies.The challenges are to emulate Great Britain and the United Nations in mitigating (not slowing, but halting) and containing (reversing the spread of the pandemic) the spread of the disease.
The proactive plans to reduce the spread of disease can reduce the high demand for healthcare by two thirds and halve deaths, but still cause thousands of deaths and enormous strain on health systems.
Containment may be a priority but it needs to be sustained as long as the virus is spreading in the community (or until a vaccine is available, if it happens earlier), otherwise the infection can spread again after the measures are relaxed.
Prolonged intervention to contain or contain the spread of the pandemic results in economic and social damage.
There are no proven specific antiviral drugs for COVID-19 but efforts are underway to develop those that incorporate trials of existing drugs.
Taking over-the-counter cold medications, drinking fluids, and taking rest may help to alleviate symptoms.
The need for oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids and respiratory support may feel like a crisis.
The effects can be made worse by the use of steroids.
Several compounds that have been previously approved for treatment of other viral diseases are being investigated for treatment of COVID-19.
WHO also stated that "traditional and home remedies" can alleviate the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-2.
WHO has stated that capacity building and optimizing healthcare for patients with COVID-19 are fundamental measures to respond to the outbreak.
The European Regional Office of the ECDC and WHO have issued guidelines to move the available resources for hospitals and primary healthcare to various levels including focusing on laboratory services for testing for COVID-19, eliminating alternative methods where possible, isolating and isolating patients who test positive for COVID-19 and increasing the capacity of the emergency department by training staff and increasing the number of available ventilators and beds.
There are several theories as to where the first case (the so-called patient number zero) was found.
The first case of this novel coronavirus can be traced back to Wuhan, Hubei, China on 1 December 2019.
The number of coronavirus cases in Hubei gradually increased in a month.
They were mostly related to the Hunan wholesale seafood market, which also sold live animals, and one theory is that the virus came from similar animals or in other words, the virus is primitive. A group of patients with pneumonia of unknown cause was detected on 26 December and treated by Dr. Zhang Jishian at Hubei Provincial Hospital, who informed the Wuhan CDC on 27 December.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues about a "SARS-like coronavirus".
Eight of them, including Lee Wenling, were warned by the police for spreading false rumours, and one, Ma Fan, was reprimanded by her superiors for giving such a warning.
The Wuhan Municipal Commission later released a public notice and informed WHO.
Several cases of unknown pneumonia were reported to health officials in Wuhan, which led to an investigation in early January.In the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases was doubling roughly every seven and a half days.
Due to migration due to the Chinese New Year and the fact that Wuhan is a transportation hub and a major railway interchange, the virus spread to other provinces in China in early and mid-January 2020.
On 20 January, nearly 140 cases were reported in one day in China, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Later official data show that as of 20 January 2020, 6174 people had already started showing symptoms.As of 26 March, the United States had overtaken China and Italy as the world's top countries with the most confirmed cases.As of 9 April 2020, 1.61 million cases have been reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people have died and more than 364,000 have recovered.
Nearly 200 countries and territories have reported at least one case.
As Europe is becoming more globalized, many countries in the Schengen area have imposed restrictions on free movement and border controls.
National-level responses include measures to contain the spread (stay-at-home orders, stay-at-home orders, and lockdowns) and curfews. As of 2 April, nearly 300 million people in the United States, or 90% of the population, are in some form of lockdown, more than 50 million people are in lockdown in the Philippines, nearly 59 million people are in lockdown in South Africa, and 1.3 billion people are in lockdown in India.
On 26 March, 1.7 billion people worldwide were in some form of lockdown, a number that rose to 2.6 billion in two days - a third of the world's population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was traced to Wuhan before 1 December 2019, with an unconfirmed case detected on 17 November.
Dr. Zhang Jishian had detected a cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause on December 26, after which his hospital reported to the Wuhan Jiangnan CDC on December 27.
Early genetic tests of samples from patients on 27 December showed the existence of a SARS-like coronavirus.
On December 31, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public notice.
The WHO was informed on the same day.
As the incident of the alert occurred, doctors in Wuhan were alerted by the police for spreading false rumors about the outbreak.
The Chinese National Health Commission initially claimed that there was no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission.
In the days after January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign that Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping later described as a "people's war" to contain the spread of the virus.
The sanitation chain, described as "the largest isolation in human history", was announced on 23 January, halting travel in and out of Wuhan, which was later extended to a total of 15 cities in Hubei, affecting 57 million people.

WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom said that PHEICs are caused by the threat of global spread, especially in low and middle income countries where health systems are not as capable.
Responding to the restrictions on travel, Tedros said that "there is no need to take unnecessary measures that interfere with international travel and trade" and that "WHO does not recommend imposing restrictions on trade and movement".
On 5 February, the WHO appealed to the global community for $675 million in planned preparedness funding in low-income countries, and in doing so, they saw the urgency to assist countries that, even if they were to start spreading the virus, did not have systems to detect people infected with the virus.
Tedrosny went on to announce that "we are as strong as our weakest link" and urged the international community to "invest today or pay more tomorrow". On 11 February, the WHO named the disease COVID-19 at a press conference.

On 11 March, the WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak as a global pandemic.
The Managing Director said that WHO is "deeply concerned about the increasing rates of disease and the alarming levels of severity and inactivity".The WHO has been heavily criticized for its apparent mishandling of the global pandemic, including delaying the declaration of a public health emergency and classifying the virus as a global pandemic.

Several Communist Party of China (CPC) administrators at the provincial level were removed for their handling of isolationist efforts in central China, a sign of discontent against the response to the outbreak of the established political party in that area.
Some critics believe that the move was aimed at protecting Chinese Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping from public outrage over the coronavirus outbreak.
Some Chinese officials, such as Zhao Lijian, have rejected the theory that COVID-19 originated in the US or Italy, and that the initial outbreak of the coronavirus originated in Wuhan.
Donald Trump's US administration has referred to the coronavirus as the "Chinese virus" or the "Wuhan virus" and said that China's "secretness has made a virus so dominant that it has transformed into a global pandemic" which some critics have criticized as racist and "a failure to contain the disease of self-administration".
The Daily Beast received a cable from the US government that contained a message outlining a ruse to deceive the enemy that originated from the top of the National Security Council and that the plan was "all about China".
We are being told to try and get this message out in any way we can, by press conferences and television appearances, etc. Media outlets like Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg have claimed that China's efforts to send aid to the virus-stricken areas are a propaganda effort for global domination.
The EU's foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, warned that a turnaround and "liberal politics" is a geopolitical element that includes a threat of domination.
Borrell also said that China is aggressively sending the message that it is a more responsible and trustworthy partner than the US.

Italy's La Stampa newspaper, citing an unnamed "high-level political source", said that 80% of the aid materials sent by Russia were useless or of little use to Italy.
The source accused Russia of having conducted an offensive campaign of "geopolitical and diplomatic" persuasion.
Lombardy President Attilio Fontana and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio denied the media reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia also sent cargo planes carrying medical aid to the United States.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Pishkov said that "in offering assistance to US partners, [Putin] assumes that when US manufacturers of medical supplies and goods take off, they will also pay back in the same way if necessary".
The planned Defender 2020 NATO military exercise in Germany, Poland, and the Baltic states will be scaled down from the largest NATO exercise since the end of the Cold War.

The Iranian government has been heavily affected by the virus, and nearly two dozen members of parliament have been infected, as well as fifteen current or former political figures.
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani wrote a public letter to world leaders on March 14, 2020, asking for help, and said that his country was struggling to cope with the outbreak due to the United States' restrictions on its access to international markets.The outbreak prompted the United States to adopt social programs that are common in other rich countries, including Universal Health Care, Universal Child Care, family holidays, and increased funding for public health.
Political analysts predicted that this would negatively impact Donald Trump's reelection bid in the 2020 presidential election.The global pandemic has strained diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea.
South Korea criticized Japan's "dubious and passive isolation efforts" when Japan announced that anyone arriving from South Korea would be quarantined for two weeks at a government-designated location.
South Korean society was initially polarized or one-sided about President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans have signed petitions either to impeach Moon for what they see as the government's handling of the outbreak in a hostile manner or to praise Moon for the way in which countries have responded to the global pandemic by enacting emergency laws.
Some critics have expressed concern that this could give governments an opportunity to tighten their grip on power.
In Hungary, their parliament voted to allow their Prime Minister Viktor Orban to rule by executive order indefinitely, to dissolve parliament and elections, and to crack down on those deemed to be spreading misinformation about the virus and to cripple the government.
The coronavirus outbreak has been blamed for a number of incidents including supply shortages, caused by increased use of global outbreak response equipment, panic buying and disruption in factories and logistics.
The United States Food and Drug Administration warned of shortages of medicines and medical supplies due to increased consumer demand and disruption to suppliers.
Shopping panic was seen in many areas, and as a result, grocery stores lost essential items such as food, toilet paper, and bottled water, leading to a shortage of supplies.
The mainly technology industries have been alerted about the delay in shipment of electronic goods.

It has also led to a worldwide shortage of personal protective equipment, and the WHO has warned that this will put health workers at risk.
In Australia, the global pandemic has given DaiGyu stores a new opportunity to sell Australian goods to China.
This action led to a shortage of baby formula in some supermarkets and subsequent bans by the Australian government.Despite high COVID-19 cases in northern Italy and the Wuhan area and high demand for upcoming products, both areas have survived severe food shortages.
Measures against the illicit trade in stocks and essential goods by China and Italy have been successful, and the severe food shortages that were expected in Europe and North America have been avoided.
The high agricultural production in Northern Italy has not seen much decline, but industry representatives warn that prices may rise.
The shortage of food plates in stores was only temporary in Wuhan, too, as Chinese authorities opened pork stores to provide adequate nutrition for the population.
Similar laws in Italy require food producers to keep food stocks for such emergencies.

As a result, the number of people who went shopping in the malls on foot decreased by 33-43% in February as compared to March.
Shopping mall operators around the world have mandated more measures, such as increased hygiene, thermal scanners to monitor the temperature of customers, and cancellation of events. According to the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the global recession caused by the pandemic will push 14 to 22 million more people in Latin America into extreme poverty than they would have been in the world without the pandemic.
At its peak in Wuhan, nearly 5 million people lost their jobs in China in January and February.
Nearly 300 million rural migrant workers in China are either stuck at home in the provinces or stuck in Hubei province.In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for government assistance.
The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis estimates that the coronavirus outbreak could lead to the loss of 47 million jobs in the United States and a 32% unemployment rate. In India, the lockdown has led to the loss of tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (who are paid for their jobs). A survey by Angus Reed found that 44% of Canadian households have experienced some form of unemployment. In Spain, nearly 900,000 workers have lost their jobs since the lockdown began in mid-March.
In the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for the Universal Credit Scheme. In Germany, nearly five million companies have sent their workers to work on government-subsidized short-term work schemes called KurzRebate.
Germany's short-time work compensation scheme has been adopted by France and Britain.
The fine arts and cultural traditions of the performing arts have been profoundly affected by this global pandemic and have affected institutions and individuals - both employed and unemployed - globally.
And the arts and cultural institutions tried to maintain their campaigns (mostly publicly funded) which included giving the community the opportunity to experience cultural traditions, keeping their staff safe in public places and helping artists whenever possible.
As of March 2020, a large number of museums, libraries, performance venues, and other cultural institutions around the world have been closed indefinitely, and their exhibitions, events, and performances have been cancelled or postponed.
In response, there has been a strong push to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another rapidly declining form of the pandemic is the cancellation of religious services, major sporting events and other social events such as concerts, technical conferences and fashion shows.
The film industry has also experienced disruption, with the Vatican announcing that it will cancel observance of the Holy Week in Rome, which falls in the last week of the Christian season of Lent, the season of penance.
Many dioceses have asked Methodist Christians to stay home instead of coming to Sunday worship, some churches offer church services via radio, online live broadcast or television, while others offer the option of drive-in worship.
While the Roman Catholic bishops of Rome are closing their churches and chapels and St. Peter's Square is being emptied without worshipers, other religious institutions have also closed services and limited the gathering of people in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gurdwaras.
Iran's health ministry cancelled Friday prayers in the affected areas and closed them after the sunset, while Saudi Arabia banned foreign pilgrims as well as residents from visiting the holy sites of Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused a major disruption in the global sporting schedule since World War II.
Several important sporting events have been cancelled or postponed, including the 2019-20 UEFA Champions League, the 2019-20 Premier League, UEFA Euro 2020, the 2019-20 NBA season and the 2019-20 NHL season.
The outbreak has disrupted plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were originally scheduled to begin in late July; the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that "the schedule of events will be rescheduled after 2020, but will be before summer 2021".
This has led to many gamblers playing online, which has led to a significant increase in new sign-ups on many online gambling sites. Many music groups have postponed or cancelled concert tours, which has also affected the entertainment industry.
Many of the major theatres, including Broadway, have postponed their experiments.
Some artists have found ways to continue creating and sharing art on the Internet as an alternative to traditional live presentations, such as live performances of concerts or the creation of web-based "festivals" for artists to present, distribute and publicize their work.
Many online memes have been circulated on the coronavirus, many of which are intended to create humour and distraction in this climate of uncertainty.
Since the COVID-19 outbreak, xenophobia, deep prejudice and racism has been demonstrated against the Chinese people and people from the East Asian region as well as from hotspots in Europe, the US and other countries.
In particular, there have been reports of incidents of fear, suspicion and hostility in several countries in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
In the February report (when most cases were still confined to China), Chinese people were reported to be either deserving of the outbreak or receiving a just retaliation for this type of racial sentiment, which has been recorded in various groups around the world.
Some African countries have also seen an increase in anti-China sentiment.
Many citizens of Wuhan and Hubei have reported discrimination based on place of regional origin.
There is support for the Chinese people and people in the affected areas, both online and offline.
People in Italy, the first country in Europe to experience a severe outbreak of COVID-19, may have also been subject to suspicion and xenophobia after the outbreak spread to new hotspot countries. People from other countries, including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea, initially joined together and signed petitions to ban Chinese people from entering their country in an effort to stop the spread of the disease.
In Japan, #ChinaisnotTutKmToJapan has also become a very popular topic on Twitter.
Chinese and other Asians in the UK and US have reported increasing incidents of racism and attacks.
US President Donald Trump has faced criticism for referring to the coronavirus as the "Chinese virus", a term that critics consider racist and anti-Chinese.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked a bus carrying Ukrainian citizens and foreign refugees from Wuhan to Novy Sandar.
Students from North East India, who come from the Chinese border areas and study in key Indian cities, have reportedly experienced harassment in connection with the coronavirus outbreak.
The state president of the Bharatiya Janata Party in West Bengal, Dilip Ghosh, stated that the Chinese had destroyed nature and "so God took revenge".
The Chinese embassy in Kolkata later condemned the attacks, calling them "defamatory". Xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese residents in China has been fueled by the pandemic, where foreigners are described as "foreign trash" and targeted for "disposal".
Current newspapers with paywalls have removed some or all of their paywalls for their coronavirus coverage.
Many scientific publishers have made scientific research on eruptions freely available.
Some scientists have chosen to share their results quickly on a preprint server like bioRxiv.

Laboratory tests for the Coronavirus Respiratory Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and associated SARS-CoV-2 virus include methods to detect the presence of the virus and detect the antibodies generated in response to infection.
The presence of the virus in the test is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects the RNA of the coronavirus.
This test is specific and is designed to detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA only.
It is used to confirm recent or active infection.
Antibiotic testing (serology) can be used for both diagnosis and close monitoring of the population.
Antibiotic tests show how many people had the disease, including people with very mild symptoms or those with no symptoms to tell.
The results of these tests can be used to determine the exact mortality rate of the disease and the level of immunity of a population group.
Due to limited testing, no country had reliable data on the spread of the virus in its population until March 2020.
As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and there is wide variation in how much testing was done between countries.
This variability is also likely to significantly affect reported case mortality, which is likely to be largely unrealistic in some countries.
Respiratory samples obtained by various methods can be tested using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), including nasopharyngeal swab or saliva samples.
Usually, the results are available within a few hours to two days.
RT-PCR test of throat swab is only valid in the first week of the disease.
The virus can then disappear from the throat and the number of infections in the lungs can continue to increase at a rapid rate.
During the second week of testing of infected persons, the alternative is to take a sample from deep airway via suction catheter or use a post-cough device (thunky).
One of the initial PCR tests was developed at the Charity in Berlin in January 2020 using Real-Time Reverse Transcription Polymer Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) and was the foundational component of the 250,000 test kits made available for distribution by the World Health Organization (WHO).
England also developed the test by 23 January 2020.On 28 January 2020, South Korean company Cogenbiotech developed a clinical grade, PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit (PowerCheck Coronavirus).
The test detects the "E" gene shared by all beta coronaviruses and the RdRp gene specific to SARS-CoV-2.In China, BGI Group was one of the first few companies to receive approval for emergency use from the National Medical Products Administration of China for a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit.In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is distributing the 2019-nCoV real-time RT-PCR diagnostic panel through International Reagent Resources.
One of three genetic test faulty reagents in older versions of the test sets led to inconclusive results and disrupted testing at the CDC in Atlanta; this resulted in an average of less than 100 samples per day being successfully processed throughout February 2020.
As on 28th February 2020, the tests conducted using two components were not considered as valid, and till then state-level and local labs were not allowed to start the tests.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under emergency use authorization.
On 5th March 2020, LabCorp announced the availability of COVID-19 tests based on RT-PCR across the country.
Similarly, on 9th March 2020, Quest Diagnostics made COVID-19 testing available across the country.
No limits were declared on quantity; sample collection and processing should be done in accordance with the CDC requirements.
The COVID-19 test was developed and manufactured by Vector Russia, the State Research Centre for Virology and Biotechnology in Russia.
The test was registered by the Federal Service for Health Care Monitoring on 11 February 2020.On 12 March 2020, it was reported that the test was developed by Mayo Clinic to detect COVID-19 infection.On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received approval from the FDA for a large-scale test that can be performed in 3.5 hours, thus allowing one machine to perform an estimated 4,128 tests in a 24-hour period.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA granted emergency use authorization (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories to test the Abbott M2000 system; the FDA had previously granted similar authorization to Holograph, LabCorp, and ThermoFisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Safed similarly received an EUA from FDA for a test that was completed in approximately 45 minutes.
The FDA approved a test that uses isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology instead of PCR.
Since it does not require a series of alternating temperature cycles, the method can give a definite result in as little as five minutes and a negative result in 13 minutes.
There are currently around 18,000 such machines in the US and Abbott expects to increase production to 50,000 tests per day.The test, which uses a monoclonal antibiotic that binds specifically to the nucleocapsid protein (N protein) of the novel coronavirus, is being developed in Taiwan and is expected to give results similar to rapid influenza tests in 15 to 20 minutes.
In March 2020, a review of the information concluded that "thorax X-rays are less useful for early diagnosis, while CT [computed tomography] findings may be present before symptoms begin".
Typical features of CT include bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacification with an asymmetric lateral distribution.
As the disease progresses, subplural dominance, crazy peving and aggregation develop.
A comparative study of PCR and CT in Wuhan, the origin of the current pandemic, has suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, despite being less specific, as it incorporates many of its imaging features with other pneumonia and disease processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that "CT should not be used as the primary screening test to detect or diagnose COVID-19". The CDC recommends PCR for initial screening by March 2020.
Antibodies, including IgM and IgG, are produced as part of the immune response to infection.
The tests can be used to detect infection, determine immunity and monitor the population, either in a central laboratory (CLT) or by Point of Care Testing (POCT) at approximately 7 days or so after the onset of symptoms.
Many clinical laboratories will be able to test these with large-scale automated systems that are built up over a period of time, but their availability will depend on the rate of production for each system.
Although multiple samples can be used to track the immune response, a single peripheral blood sample is commonly used for CLT.
A single blood sample is usually obtained through a skin puncture for POCT.
Unlike PCR methods, extraction is not required before screening.On 26 March 2020, the FDA named 29 agents that it had advised the agency as needed and therefore were able to deliver their antibody tests.
As of April 7, 2020, only one test has been approved by the FDA under emergency use authorization. At the end of March 2020, EuroEmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitome Diagnostics received European Community approval for their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies against the background of a virus in a blood sample.
The capacity of the test is such that hundreds of samples can be tested in a matter of hours and therefore it is several times faster than the traditional PCR test of viral RNA.
Antibiotics are usually detectable within 14 days of infection.In early April, England purchased a test kit that was found to be unsuitable for use.
Hong Kong has a plan in which suspected patients can stay at home, "the emergency department will give the patient a sample tube", they spit in it, send it back and in a few days they will get a test result.The British NHS has announced that it is studying a preliminary plan to test suspected individuals at home, so that they do not risk infecting others if they come to the hospital or need to be disinfected if an ambulance is used.
Drive through centres have helped South Korea to perform the fastest, most comprehensive testing of any country.In Germany, on 2 March, the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians reported that they had the capacity to perform approximately 12,000 tests per day in a mobile system, and that 10,700 had been tested in the previous week.
When a doctor asks for a test, the cost is covered by the health insurance.
According to the chairman of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has the capacity to conduct a total of 1,60,000 tests per week.
As of March 19, Drive-in tests were offered in several major cities.
As of 26 March 2020, the total number of tests performed in Germany was unknown, as only positive results were reported.
The first survey of the laboratory found that a total of at least 4,83,295 samples were tested up to and including the week of 12/2020 of the calendar and 33,491 samples (6.9%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.In Israel, researchers at Technion and Rambam Hospital developed and used a method to test samples from 64 patients at once, in which all samples were combined and only tested if the sample was found positive together.On 5 February 2020, a 2,000 square metre emergency detection laboratory was opened in Wuhan by the BIG, which can process more than 10,000 samples in English over the last day.
The facility was built in 5 days under the supervision of BGI founder Wang Jian and the modeling shows that if the testing capacity had not been started on time, 47% more cases would have been seen in Hubei and the associated cost of handling quarantine would have doubled.
The Wuhan laboratory has been followed closely by Huo-Yan laboratories in a total of 12 cities in China, Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai.
As of 4 March 2020, the total throughput was 50,000 tests per day. The multiplex design, published by Origami Assays, is open source and can test as many as 1,122 patient samples for COVID-19 using only 93 tests. These balanced designs can be used in small laboratories without a robotic liquid handler.
As of March, the shortage and insufficient supply of the reagent has been a stumbling block for large-scale trials in the EU, UK and US.
This led some authors to start using a sample preparation protocol that involved heating samples to 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release the RNA genome for further testing.On 31 March it was announced that the UAE was now testing more people for coronavirus in its population than any other country and was on track to ramp up testing levels to reach a larger population.
This was in combination with the purchase of drive through capacity and wholesale throughput laboratory in proportion to population from Group 42 and BGI (based on their "Huo-Yan" emergency detection laboratories in China).
Built in 14 days, this laboratory is capable of performing thousands of RT-PCR tests a day and is the first in the world to be so large scale accelerated outside of China.
Various test procedures that target different parts of the coronavirus genetic profile have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization acknowledged Germany's action to send manufacturing kits to low-income countries that do not have the resources to manufacture their own kits.
Germany's work was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the US Centers for Disease Control was not available until 28 January, which delayed the available tests in the US. China and the US had problems with the reliability of test kits in the early days of the outbreak, and these countries and Australia could not supply enough sets to meet the demand and the testing recommendations from health experts.
On the contrary, the availability of large-scale testing in South Korea helped to reduce the spread of the novel coronavirus.
The large scale testing capacity of private sector laboratories was built up by the South Korean administration over many years.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization ordered the ramp-up of testing programs as the best way to mitigate the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.The large scale spread of the virus created a huge demand for testing, causing a backlog of hundreds of tests in private laboratories in the United States and a shortage of swabs and chemical reagents.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of its test kits.
In the United States, the test kits developed by the CDC were "flawed"; later, the government removed the bureaucratic barriers that prevented private testing; and Spain purchased test kits from a Chinese company, Shenzhen BioEasy Biotechnology Co., Ltd., but found that the results were incorrect.
The company explained that the failure to collect samples or to use the kits properly could have led to erroneous results.
The Ministry said that it would return the wrong test kits and replace them with different test kits supplied by Shenzhen Bioscience.The Czech Republic reported that 80% of the test kits purchased from China were wrong.Slovakia purchased 1.2 lakh test kits from China which were found to be defective.
Prime Minister Matvick suggested that the kits be dumped at the Danube. Turkey's Health Ministry's Ates Kara said that the kits Turkey bought from China had "large amounts of errors" and that they had "not been used". The UK bought 35 million test kits from China but announced in early April 2020 that they were not usable.
Testing, followed by isolation of those who tested positive and tracing of contacts of those who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 has yielded good results.
In the Italian city where the first COVID-19 death occurred, researchers conducted two rounds of testing on a total population of approximately 3,400 people, approximately ten days apart.
About half of the people who tested positive had no symptoms, and those who were found were isolated.
By limiting the travel of the living, new infections were completely avoided.
With aggressive contact tracing, internal travel restrictions, screening and quarantine, the spread of the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore has been much slower than in other developed countries, and extreme restrictions such as forcible closure of restaurants and retail establishments have not been imposed.
Many events have been cancelled and Singapore had begun advising citizens to stay home since 28 March, but schools reopened on 23 March at the scheduled time after a period of holiday.
Many other countries like Iceland and South Korea have managed the pandemic through aggressive contact tracing, ban on domestic travel, testing and quarantine, but less aggressive lockdowns.
Statistical studies have shown that countries that test more than they test for deaths have a much lower mortality rate, because they are more likely to detect only mild or no symptoms.
The WHO has recommended that countries that lack testing capacity and have limited experience with COVID-19 in their national laboratories should send their first five positive and ten negative samples of COVID-19 to one of the 16 laboratories referred by the WHO for confirmatory testing.
Of the 16 laboratories referenced, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
The table below shows the impact of a country's testing policy on the "% of positive tests" ratio.
Other things being equal, a country that tests all citizens, whether symptomatic or not, will have a higher percentage of positive tests than a country that tests only those who are admitted to the hospital.
Hand washing (or hand washing), also called hand hygiene, is the act of washing one's hands with the intention of removing dirt, grease, microorganisms or other unwanted elements.
Regular hand washing at certain "critical times" throughout the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and typhoid, which can be spread by touching hands and mouths.
Respiratory diseases such as influenza or colds can also infect people, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth (i.e., mucous membranes).
The five main times of the day when hand-washing with soap is important are: before and after going to the toilet, after cleaning the baby's bottom or changing diaper, before breastfeeding the baby, before and after eating and cooking food, or handling raw meat, fish, or poultry.
If water and soap are not available, hands can be washed with ash, the World Health Organization recommends washing hands at:
Before cooking, during cooking, and after cooking.
Before and after caring for a sick person.
After changing a diaper or washing the thigh of a child who has had a seizure.
After blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.
After touching an animal, animal food or animal waste.
Medical hand hygiene is the hygiene practices associated with medical procedures.
Hand washing before administering medication or receiving medical care prevents or minimizes the spread of disease.
The main medical purpose of hand washing is to clean the hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause harm or disease.
This is especially important for people who handle food or work in the medical field, but it's also an important habit for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing the infectious causes of diarrhoea; reducing respiratory infection;
And that includes reducing the rate of infant mortality among home births.
A 2013 study found that improved hand washing practices could lead to minor improvements in height in children under five years old.
In developing countries, the rate of child mortality associated with respiratory and diarrheal diseases can be reduced by starting with simple behavioral changes such as hand washing with soap.
These simple actions can reduce the mortality rate from these diseases by nearly 50%.
Interventions that promote hand washing can reduce diarrhea incidence by about one third and can be compared to providing clean water in low-income areas.
The 48% reduction in diarrhea incidence can be attributed to handwashing with soap. Handwashing with soap, which is an emergency practice in homes, schools and communities around the world, is the only highly effective and inexpensive way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (ARIs).
Pneumonia with ARI is the leading cause of death among children under five years, causing an estimated 18 million deaths per year.
An estimated 35 lakh children die every year from diarrhoea and pneumonia.
According to UNICEF, more lives can be saved by establishing the habit of washing hands with soap before eating and after using the toilet than by any vaccine or medical intervention, reducing deaths from diarrhea by almost half and from acute respiratory infections by a quarter.
Hand washing is usually combined with other hygiene interventions as part of water, sanitation and hygiene (wash) programmes.
Hand washing also helps protect against the infection of the infectious disease called impetigo, which is spread by direct physical contact.
A minor side effect of hand washing is that frequent hand washing can cause skin dryness and skin damage.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing can lead to skin conditions such as itching and scaling of the palms, called hand rashes, which are especially common among healthcare workers.
Excessive hand washing is also considered a symptom of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five important times throughout the day when it is important to wash hands with soap to reduce the risk of hand infection and spread of the disease: after going to the bathroom (towel, toilet), after cleaning the baby's thigh (diaper change), before breastfeeding, before eating, and before/after cooking or handling raw meat, fish, or poultry.
Other occasions when proper hand washing practices should be adopted to prevent the spread of disease include before and after treating a cut or other wound; after spitting, coughing or sneezing; after touching animal droppings or handling animals; and after handling litter.
In many countries, hand washing with soap is not common.
In 2015, a study of 54 countries found that an average of 38.7% of households washed their hands with soap. A 2014 study showed that Saudi Arabia had the highest handwashing rate at 95%, the United States at about 77%, and China at the lowest 23%. Some behavioral change practices are now emerging, including increasing handwashing with soap at critical times.
The "Compulsory Health Care Program" implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of a measure of action for the health and educational advancement of children.
Disinfection twice a year, as well as daily hand washing with soap and flushed teeth, is a core part of the national programme.
It has been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The removal of microorganisms from the skin is enhanced by the use of soap or detergent with water.
The main function of soap and detergent is to reduce the concentration of the solvent and increase solubility.
Water alone is insufficient to cleanse the skin because the fat and protein components of organic soil are not readily soluble in water.
However, purification is done by proper flow of water.
Our recycling nature means that solid soap is likely to have bacteria from previous use.
Some studies on migration of bacteria by contaminated solid soap have concluded that the migration is not possible due to the destruction of bacteria by the foam.
The CDC still says "liquid soap that is not touched by hands is preferable for use".
Antibiotic soaps have been heavily promoted among health conscious people.
To date, there is no evidence of the use of recommended antiseptic or disinfectant for naturally occurring antibiotic-resistant.
However, antibiotic soaps contain common antibiotic components such as triclosan, which has a broad list of resistant strains of organisms.
Therefore, antibiotic stress resistants are not selected for disinfectant soaps, but may not be as effective as suggested.
In addition to surfactants and skin-protective agents, refined formulations such as pH regulators can contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid), immunoactive benzoic acid, and other skin conditioners (corfds, vitamins, menthols, plant extracts). A comprehensive analysis by the University of Oregon School of Public Health indicated that even common soaps are as effective at removing germs from plants and animals as consumer-grade tricloxan disinfectants.
Warm water, which is comfortable for washing hands, is not enough to kill germs.
Bacteria grow rapidly at body temperature (37 degrees C).
However, warm water is more effective than cold soapy water in removing the natural oil containing dirt and germs from the hand.
However, contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that hot water is not effective in reducing the microbial load from the hands.
Hand sanitizer or hand antiseptic is a water-based hand sanitizing agent.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, water-based hand sanitizing agents (also known as alcohol-based hand rubs, antiseptic hand rubs or hand sanitizers) began to gain popularity.
Most of them are in the form of a gel with a thickening agent such as isopropyl alcohol or ethanol formulation with a carbomer (polymer of acrylic acid), or in the form of a wet liquid such as glycerine, or in the form of foam to make it easier to use and reduce the drying effect of alcohol.
Hydrogen peroxide enhances the antimicrobial activity. At least 60 to 90 percent alcohol in hand sanitizers is an effective disinfectant.
Alcohol rub sanitizer viruses, multi-drug resistant viruses (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis and some pathogens (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccinia, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi
Alcohol Rub Sanitizer contains 70% alcohol and kills 99.97% (3.5 log drop equivalent to 35 decibel drop) of hands within 30 seconds of application and 99.99% to 99.999% (4 to 5 log drop) of germs within 1 minute of application. Hand Sanitizer is very effective in some animals and less effective in some pathogens.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizer is completely ineffective against pathogens such as norovirus (or norovoc), which is the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis. Both hand antiseptic or alcohol rubber should be used to thoroughly clean the hands.
Rub the front and back of both hands and between all fingers for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel cools.
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that when dirt is visible on hands, washing hands with hand sanitizer afterwards.
The ease of use and rapid microbiological activity has led to an increase in the use of these agents; however, if soap and water are not available, they should not be used as a substitute for proper hand washing.
As frequent use of alcohol based sanitizer can cause dry skin, softeners and/or moisturizers should be added.
The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other skin softeners to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers with emollients caused less skin irritation and dryness than soaps or antibiotic detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact gallbladder syndrome or hypersensitivity to alcohol or to substances in hand rubs are rarely detected.
The incidence of skin disease was found to be lower with corrosive contact than with hand washing with soap and water.
Despite their effectiveness, non-aqueous agents do not sanitize the organic materials, but only disinfect them.
This is why hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of pathogens, as pathogens are confined to the hands.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand sanitizers is highly dependent on ingredients and formulation, and has historically significantly outperformed alcohol and alcohol-free detergents.
Recently, formulations using benzalkonium chloride have been shown to have persistent and cumulative antibiotic activity, in contrast to alcohol, where efficacy has been shown to decrease after frequent use, possibly due to progressive adverse skin reactions.
Many people in low income groups cannot afford soap and they use ash and clay.
Ash and mud may be more effective than just water, but less so than soap.
One concern is that if the soil or ash is contaminated with microorganisms, it will increase the spread of disease rather than slow it down.
Like soap, clay is a disinfectant because when it comes in contact with water, it produces an alkaline solution.
The WHO recommends the use of ash or sand as an alternative when soap is not available.
The precise hand washing technique recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control to prevent the spread of disease includes the following steps:
Wet hands with warm or lukewarm running water.
Running water is recommended because standing basins can be contaminated, and water temperature has been found to make little difference.
With a lot of soap, rub it on your hands, on the back of your hands, between your fingers, under your nails, and make it foam.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that people wash their hands more thoroughly when using soap than when using tap water.
Rub your hands together for at least 20 seconds.
Rubbing creates friction, which causes the germs on the skin to leave, and rubbing for longer allows more germs to leave.
Wash your hands under running water.
Hand washing in a basin can contaminate your hands.
Dry your hands with a clean cloth or air dry.
Wet and damp hands can quickly become contaminated again, and the thumb, wrist, the area between the fingers, and the underside of the nails are the areas that are usually soaked when washing hands.
Artificial nails and partially removed nail polishes can provide shelter for microorganisms.
Moisturizing lotion is often recommended to prevent dry hands; dry skin can cause skin damage that can increase the risk of infection.
Where tap water and/or soap are not available, various low-cost options can be made to facilitate hand washing e.g. in developing countries if required, by pouring water and/or ash through hanging jerican or pumps with appropriate holes. In situations of limited water supply (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are water-conservation options such as "tippy taps" and other low-cost options.
The tip tap is a simple technique that involves a can being held up by a rope to pour a little water on the hand and soap, and a lever that can be moved with the foot.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the hygiene process, but there is some debate about the most effective way of drying in public washrooms.
A growing body of research suggests that paper towels are much healthier than the electric hand dryers found in most bathrooms.
In 2008, the University of Westminster in London conducted a study to compare the levels of cleanliness offered by paper towels, hot-air hand dryers and modern jet-air hand dryers, and the European Tissue Symposium sponsored the study by the paper industry.
The researchers found that after washing and drying hands with a hot air dryer, the number of bacteria on fingers increased by an average of 194 percent, and on palms by 254 percent.
After drying with a jet air dryer, the total number of bacteria on the fingers increased by an average of 42% and on the bottom of the fingers by 15%.
After washing and drying hands with paper towels, the total number of bacteria on fingers decreased by an average of 76% and the number on the soles by 77%.The scientists tested each type of drying method to see if it would result in contamination of other washroom users and the washroom environment.
A jet air dryer that blows air out of the unit at 180 m/s (650.0 km/h; 400 mph) is capable of blowing microbes out of the hands and the unit and contaminating washroom users and the washroom environment up to 2 m away.
Using a hot air dryer, the microbe can spread from the dryer to 0.25 meters.
No significant spread was seen due to paper towels. A study conducted by TUV Produkt und Umwelt in 2005 evaluated different hand-turning methods.
The following changes in bacterial counts were observed after hand drying:
There are many hand dryer manufacturers in existence, and hand dryers have been compared to paper towels.
When traveling, when soap and water are unavailable, hand sanitizer wipes are an alternative to hand washing.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers must contain at least 60% alcohol.
Medical hand washing became mandatory after Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness in preventing disease in a hospital setting (in 1846).
There are electronic devices that remind hospital staff to wash their hands if they forget.
One study found that their use reduced the rate of infection.
Medical hand washing is a minimum of 15 seconds, involving applying a large amount of soap and water or gel to the face and scrubbing each part of the hand.
The hands should be rubbed together in a fold.
If dirt is stuck in the nail, a bristle brush can be used to remove it.
Hand washing and wiping with a clean towel is important as water can contain germs on the hands.
After drying, use a paper towel to turn off the water (and to open the exit door if necessary)
This helps to prevent the surfaces from contaminating the hands again.
In healthcare, hand washing aims to remove pathogenic microorganisms ("germs") and prevent their spread.
The New England Journal of Medicine reported that the lack of hand washing has reached unacceptable levels in many medical settings, where large numbers of doctors and nurses routinely forget to wash their hands before touching patients, leading to microbial infections.
One study found that proper hand washing and other simple measures can reduce catheter-related blood flow infections by 66%. The World Health Organization has published a handwashing and hand-washing best practice guide for healthcare.
The draft hand hygiene guidelines issued by the Institute can also be found on their website for public comment.
Whitby et al. had organized a relevant review.
If demonstration of regular compliance is required, professional tools can measure and validate hand hygiene.
The WHO has defined "five moments" for hand washing:
If you are exposed to blood/ bodily fluid
Before and after disinfection
After caring for the patient, if the soap contains antiseptic chemicals (medicated or "antibacterial" soap) it will cause a killing reaction in the hand washing fluid.
Such killing may be required prior to surgery or in areas with high concentrations of antibiotic-resistant organisms, surgical initiation requires a hand-free-touch on-and-off plumbing system to 'wash' the hands, chlorhexidine or iodine wash, a sterile towel to dry the hands after washing, and a sterile brush for rubbing and another sterile tool for cleaning the fingertips.
All jewellery should be removed.
The process usually requires washing the hands and the area from the wrist to the elbow for 2-6 minutes.
You don't have to scrub for a long time (10 minutes).
When washing, the water should not be drawn back over the hands from the wrist to the corner.
After hand-washing, the hands are dried with a sterile cloth and a surgical gown is put on the body.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash hands before and after caring for a sick person or to use hand sanitizer.
For the control of staphylococcal infection in hospitals, it was found that the greatest benefit of hand washing was achieved by washing the first 20% of the time, and a very slight increase was achieved when hand washing frequency was increased by more than 35%.
The rate of bacterial infection in food is more than three times higher when washing hands with plain soap compared to antibacterial soap. Comparing hand washing with alcohol-based solution and hand washing with antibacterial soap at 30 seconds each time, it was found that hand washing with alcohol-based solution was 26% less likely to cause bacterial infection than with antibacterial soap.
But soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based hand sanitizers in reducing H1N1 influenza A virus and clostridium from hard-shelled hands. Interventions to improve hand health in healthcare settings may include training staff on hand washing, increasing the availability of alcohol-based hand sanitizers, and providing written and oral reminders to staff.
Further research is needed to determine which of these interventions are most effective in different healthcare settings.
In developing countries, handwashing with soap is considered an inexpensive and necessary means of achieving good health and nutrition.
But the lack of reliable water supply, lack of soap or hand washing facilities in people's homes, schools and workplaces has made achieving a universal hand washing behaviour a challenge.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, there is a lack of hand washing faucets near every private or public toilet, despite the availability of affordable options for installing hand washing facilities.
However, poor hand washing may be a result of dead habits rather than lack of soap or water.
The promotion and reward of handwashing with soap can influence policy decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of handwashing and change long-term behaviour of the population.
To implement this effectively, monitoring and evaluation are required.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based approaches are effective in increasing hand-washing rates in LMICs, while social marketing initiatives are less effective.An example of promoting hand-washing in schools is the "three-star approach" by UNICEF, which, among other hygiene requirements, encourages schools to make simple, inexpensive solutions to ensure that students wash their hands with soap.
When the minimum standards are met, schools can go from one star to three stars.
The creation of hand washing facilities can be part of the efforts to promote hand washing to reduce morbidity and child mortality.
The World Handwashing Day is another example of an awareness raising initiative that seeks to change behaviour. UNICEF promoted the adoption of handwashing emojis as a result of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic.
Some studies have considered the overall cost-effectiveness of hand washing in developing countries in relation to avoided dialysis.
However, one review suggests that promoting handwashing with soap is significantly cheaper than other sanitation interventions such as tap water and sanitation.
For people in particularly vulnerable situations, such as new mothers or wounded soldiers in hospitals - the importance of hand washing to human health was first recognized in the mid-19th century by two pioneers in hand hygiene: Ignaz Semmelweis, a Hungarian physician working in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the "English founder of modern nursing".
At the time, most people believed that the Mi'mas, a foul-smelling organism, was the cause of infection.
In 1980, as a result of foodborne outbreaks and health-care-associated infections, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention more actively encouraged hand-washing as an important measure to prevent the spread of infection.
The outbreak of swine flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 has raised awareness in many countries about the importance of hand washing with soap to protect oneself from such infectious diseases.
For example, in Germany, public toilets and toilets in office buildings and airports have had wall murals displaying "proper hand washing techniques" next to hand washing sinks.
To wash one's hands is a reluctance to take responsibility for something or to share in its complexity.
It originates from the biblical passage in Matthew where Pontius Pilate washes his hands of Jesus Christ's decision to crucify him, but in some English communities the phrase came with wider use.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth is forced to wash herself in an attempt to wash away a fictional stain while demonstrating her guilty conscience about the crimes she and her husband committed.
It has also been found that people wash their hands more often than others after remembering or contemplating immoral acts, and they tend to give more importance to handwashing.
Also, those who are allowed to wash their hands after such meditations are less likely to engage in other "cleanliness" compensatory activities, such as volunteering.
Hand washing is required in religions for both hygiene and symbolic purposes. Using water to wash hands, but not soap, is part of the ritual of washing hands, which includes the Baha'i Faith, the Hinduism, the Jewish faith Te'vilah and Ne'tilah, the Lavabo in Christianity, and the Wudhu in Islam. Hand washing is required in religions after certain acts, especially for hygiene.
In Hinduism, Judaism and Islam, washing hands after using the toilet is mandatory.
And in Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam, it is mandatory to wash one's hands before and after every meal.
Managing the workplace risk due to COVID-19
Workplace hazard management due to COVID-19 is the application of occupational safety and health practices to manage hazards for prevention of Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19).
Proper risk management at the workplace depends on the nature of the workplace and the workplace, the source of infection, the severity of the disease in the community and the risk factors of each worker who may be vulnerable to COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk occupations have minimal occupational contact with people and other co-workers, for which basic infection prevention measures are recommended, including hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home when sick, respiratory etiquette, and regular workplace cleaning and disinfection.
Moderate infection risk jobs include those that require overlapping or close contact with individuals who are not known or suspected to have COVID-19 infection, but may have been infected due to ongoing community transmission or international travel.
This includes workers who are in contact with the general public, such as in schools, densely populated workplaces and some large retail outlets.
In addition to basic infection prevention measures, risk control for this group includes maintaining air quality by using high-efficiency air filters, wearing sneakers and having personal protective equipment available in case a person is exposed to COVID-19.
OSHO considers healthcare workers and mortuary workers who have been in contact with a known or suspected person with COVID-19 as having a high infection risk, in which case the worker is performing aerosol-generating procedures or collecting or handling samples from a known or suspected person with COVID-19, which increases the risk of exposure to a much higher level.
Risk controls appropriate for these workers include engineering controls such as negative pressure ventilation rooms and personal safety equipment appropriate for the specific job.
The COVID-19 outbreak can have many implications for the workplace.
Workers may be absent from work because of illness, the need to care for others, or fear of possible infection.
Commercial patterns can change in both the sense of what goods are in demand and how to get those goods (such as buying at low-crowd times or buying through delivery or drive-through services).
Finally, COVID-19 may disrupt the movement of goods from geographical areas that are heavily affected.
The plan addresses the risks associated with various workplaces and occupations, including sources of infection, risk factors arising from domestic and social areas, and risk factors of each worker, such as ageing or chronic medical conditions.
They also define the controls needed to address those risks and outline contingency plans for situations that may arise from outbreaks.
Preparedness and response planning for communicable diseases may be subject to national or sub-national recommendations.
Goals for an outbreak response include reducing transmission among staff, protecting those at risk of developing adverse health complications, maintaining business practices, and minimizing adverse impacts on other things in their supply chain.
The severity of the response to the disease is affected by the communities where the business is located.
The Risk Control Hierarchy Framework is widely used in occupational safety and health to group risk controls according to their effectiveness.
Where COVID-19 risks cannot be completely eliminated, the most effective controls are engineering controls, followed by administrative controls and finally personal protective equipment.
Engineering controls involve isolating employees from work-related hazards rather than relying on worker behavior, and may be the most cost-effective solution to implement.
Administrative control is the change in work policies or procedures that require action by the worker or employer.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but it can help prevent some infections.
All types of PPE should be selected based on the risks to the workplace, they should be suitable for use (e.g. respirators) and worn properly, regularly inspected, maintained and replaced as needed and they should be properly removed, cleaned and stored or properly disposed of to prevent infection.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHO), low-risk occupations have minimal occupational contact with the public and other coworkers.
Basic infection prevention measures are recommended for all types of workplaces, including thorough and complete hand washing, encouraging workers to stay at home if sick, observing respiratory etiquette including covering the mouth when coughing and sneezing, providing tissue paper and waste disposal baskets, being prepared to take telecommunications or multiple shifts if required, avoiding workers from using other tools and equipment, and regularly cleaning and disinfecting the workplace.
The early identification and isolation of a potential infectious individual is an important step in protecting workers, customers, visitors and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees who develop symptoms of a severe respiratory illness stay home unless they have had a fever, have symptoms of fever, and have other symptoms for at least 24 hours, unless they are taking medication to reduce fever or other symptom-modifying medication, and that sick leave policies are flexible, allowing employees to stay home to care for a sick family member, and that employees are aware of the policies.
According to OSHA, moderate infection risk jobs include those that require six feet (1.8 m) of close contact with people who are not known or suspected to be infected with COVID-19, but who may have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to ongoing community transmission around the work area or recent international travel to a location where COVID-19 is widespread.
This includes workers who have had contact with the general public, such as those in schools, densely populated workplaces and some large retail outlets, and places where there is a need for them to be on hand, such as schools, densely populated workplaces and some large retail outlets. The work includes installing high-efficiency air filters for engineer controls and for groups at higher risk, increasing air sports maintenance, installing physical barriers such as transparent plastic sneezed guards, and a drive-through window bus for services. For these risk groups and higher risk groups, administrative controls include encouraging sick workers to stay home, providing them with the necessary virtual communication tools, installing live shifts, providing a handshake, providing access to COVID-19-containing or life-threatening places of work, providing a platform to protect the public and work with a safety plan, providing training to customers who may need to follow COVID-19 prevention measures, personal protective equipment, face shields, and other measures, and promoting a safe work environment, face protection, and workplace, personal protective equipment, and other elements that can be used to protect against COVID-19 infection.
Workers in this high-risk group rarely need to use respirators.
If a person is sick on an aircraft, appropriate controls to protect workers and other passengers include keeping the person 6 feet away from other people, assigning a crew member to serve the sick person and giving the sick person a face mask or telling the sick person to cover his mouth and nose with tissue paper when coughing or sneezing.
When servicing a sick passenger or touching their bodily fluids or potentially infected surfaces, it is necessary to wear disposable medical gloves and if the sick passenger has a fever, persistent cough or difficulty breathing, cabin crew must wear additional personal protective equipment.
For commercial ships including cruise ships and other passenger vessels, risk controls include delaying travel while sick and self-isolation while on board in case of fever or other symptoms and immediate notification to the onboard medical centre.
Ideally, medical follow-up should be conducted in the quarantined person's room. If a school or child care center is found to be infected with an infected person, whether or not there is community transmission, the CDC recommends that it be temporarily closed for cleaning and disinfection.
Where there is minimal to moderate community transmission, social distancing policies can be adopted, such as postponing field trips, crowd and physical education or prayer classes or other large gatherings including dining in cafeterias, increasing distance between desks, changing arrival and departure times, restricting non-essential visitors, and setting up separate health centres for children with flu-like symptoms.
Schools may be considered for longer closures when there is significant infection in local communities, along with social distancing strategies. Law enforcement personnel who are doing routine daily activities are considered by the CDC to be at low immediate health risk.
Law enforcement officers who are required to have contact with other persons who are infected or suspected of being infected with COVID-19 are advised to follow the guidelines with appropriate personal protective equipment as emergency medical technicians.
During the period of care, if close contact occurs, the personnel should clean and disinfect their duty belts and gear using household cleaning spray or wipes before reuse and for a controlled period as well as follow standard operating procedures for disposal of used PPE, segregation of clothing and washing.
OSHA considers certain health care and mortuary workers to be at high or very high risk of infection.
Jobs with high risk of infection include healthcare delivery, rescue, laboratory and medical transportation personnel who come in contact with known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
Employees who are performing aerosol-producing procedures on known or suspected COVID-19 patients or collecting or handling samples from such patients are at high risk of infection.
Aerosol-producing techniques include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopy, some dental systems, and examination or invasive sample collection.
The high risk mortuary work involves personnel involved in the preparation of the bodies of persons with known or suspected COVID-19 infection at the time of death; if they perform autopsies, they are at high risk of infection.
Specialized negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in some healthcare and bathroom structures.
Handling of samples with biosafety level 3 procedures.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that incoming patients suspected of having COVID-19 should be isolated in separate waiting rooms accordingly.As with other PPE, OSHA recommends that workers working within 6 feet of known or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection and aerosol-created procedures should be provided with respirators.
In the United States, NIOSH-approved N95 respirators or better respirators must be used in conjunction with a comprehensive, written respiratory protection system, including fitness-testing, training, and medical examinations.
Other types of respirators may provide better protection and be more comfortable for staff. WHO does not recommend full body protection, as COVID-19 is a respiratory disease, it does not spread through the body's other secretions.
WHO recommends the use of surgical masks only by personnel performing screening at entry points.
WHO recommends the use of surgical masks, goggles or face coverings, gowns and gloves for personnel collecting, caring for or transporting respiratory samples from patients undergoing treatment for COVID-19 without any aerosol-producing procedures.
If an aerosol-producing procedure has been performed, N95 or FFP2 respirators should be used instead of surgical masks.
In light of the global shortage of PPE, WHO recommends the use of physical barriers such as telemedicine, clean windows, allowing direct access to healthcare providers in COVID-19 patients' rooms using only PPE required for specific work, reducing the need for PPE use for them, using a single respirator without separating multiple patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordinating the supply chain of PPE, and providing services without encouraging the use of masks by individuals who do not have symptoms.

Subject: Reducing the burden and preparing for the future
Date/time of submission: 14th March 2020, 00:24 UTC The following is a list of the current and upcoming events.

This month we find ourselves in a remarkable situation.
The COVID-19 pandemic is a case that illustrates the interconnectedness of humanity and our responsibilities to one another.
We have no prior experience of these challenges, but we know that our best response depends on global empathy, collaboration and building a community that is at the heart of our organization.
The remarkable proof of how lucky we are to have the opportunity to work with such wonderful people is the harmony and concern that we see among all our colleagues through emails, phone calls and chats.
I couldn't be more grateful and proud to call you my colleague.
Last week, someone came to me and praised your work.
He reminded me of how much it means to the world to be able to read Wikipedia at this time and how powerful a symbol it is that this important resource is online and available to everyone.
Whether you're keeping this site up to date or paying our colleagues or keeping our groups safe, it's because of your work that we're here.
The world needs the information that Wikipedia provides much more than Ervi does.
This is a moment in which it's not just what we do, but how we do it that's going to have a meaningful impact on the world.
The importance of this campaign and your role in it will lead us to make some significant changes in the way we work together, starting next week.
(Matthew 6:33) The Bible says that "the spirit of truth will guard [us] against every sort of covetousness".
As Robin mentioned earlier, the C-Team met last night to discuss our vision and timeline for the coming days and months.
In that conversation, we discussed what the appropriate response would be to what we were facing and the best way to sustain the organization during this time.
We are eager to relieve stress and help our campaign in the long run.
If you want to dial back, that's fine.
For all employees, contractors and contract staff:
Our daily work schedule is expected to be approximately 4 hours per day or 20 hours per week until further notice.
We are not announcing a holiday - if you can work more normal hours, you can be used in this campaign.
But the world is unpredictable these days, and whether you need to take care of your loved ones, do the grocery shopping, or go to the doctor, your health is our priority.
We're not tracking your time.
If you are sick, do not work.
It shouldn't be said, but we're saying it.
No sick leave or PTO needed - just tell your manager and help your team to make adjustments to the calendar and schedule so that the important parts of the job can be completed.
(If you have been diagnosed as COVID-19 positive, please inform Brian at T&C Ops, so that T&C can support you and ensure that your situation is being properly addressed by management).
The employees who work overtime will be paid full salary.
We have already said and reiterate our commitment to respect our contractors and colleagues who work overtime.
Each one shall be paid according to his hours of work in the ordinary course of life.
This will include if you are ill and unable to work.
If you want to work, we will help you.
Many people use work as a way to relieve stress about the world around them.
Especially in times like these, the benefits of what we do can be amazing.
Again, it's about taking care of yourself.
We ask that you speak to your manager so that we know what to expect and can make changes accordingly.
Some work is considered essential.
There are some things that we should keep doing.
SRE, HR Ops, Trust and Safety and Fundraising Teams (among others) do important work, which may require additional support.
We will begin the process with all departments to assess the current objectives and focus our efforts on supporting the essentials of your mission.
There is a lot of work for all of us to do, we will only focus on the most important projects.
If you work slowly now, you won't lose anything later.
Once the global shock is over, we are not planning to "work twice as long to get the job done".
You will no longer be expected to work overtime to meet unrealistic deadlines.
We accept that the situation has changed and we will work to set new goals and timetables when appropriate.
What happens to the APP?
While adjusting expectations for our new realistic and routine working hours, we aim to adjust the time frame for delivery of our 2020-2021 Annual Plan.
Our intention is to propose to extend our 2019-2020 plan to include those people who may have to work for the next few weeks or who may want to work for a shorter period of time, while allowing employees more time to prepare a budget to prioritize important tasks, care for themselves and care for their loved ones.
This extension of the deadline will greatly reduce the current planning workload and stress across the organization.
We will be presenting our proposal to the Board next week and as soon as we get confirmation, we will update our delegates and teams on the next steps.
Thank the APP team for their leadership in this.
Office conditions, contamination and hygiene
Last week, we learned that one of our SF staff members may have been infected with COVID-19.
However, with extreme caution, we have assigned a disinfectant cleanup team to disinfect all areas in our San Francisco offices.
They use high-quality antiseptic solutions used in hospitals to disinfect every surface, as well as the lobby and the edges of the elevators that come to our floor.
The building uses its own safety measures, using products that help to protect its tenants.
We are satisfied that these offices will be fully operational when we decide to return.
Our DC office is located in the WeWork area, where we and all other DC-area employees have been sharing their COVID-19 solutions.
Last week, our DC office was transformed into a fully remote set-up following guidelines shared with San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues in the NYC-area know, we're in talks to rent a space in Brooklyn.
These discussions are ongoing, but we can delay them.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Long-time remote workers know that this is just an adjustment, and they want to give you some advice:
Limit your meetings to one or two hours at most.
If you need longer sessions, think about how you can divide them into several days.
Make the agenda clear and send them the materials in advance.
Make this video the default with tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate face-to-face collaboration and connectivity.
To make each meeting easier, have someone lead it, who will monitor the chat for questions asked and check the list of speakers, and have someone else help take notes (or take notes in cooperation).
If you need a convenient headset, email the technician assistant.
Use your welfare allowance for breakfast.
Join the #Remotize channel on Slack to talk to your colleagues about the work assigned to you.
The HR Operations team is looking at webinar-based ergonomics to help increase the amount of work distributed across the organization.
Last week, we asked all community grantees to postpone Wikimedia-funded events like "Editathons" until the WHO declares the pandemic over.
We told them that we had learned that our request for suspension and other restrictions would make it impossible to complete their agreed grant-in-aid activities, and also told them that no one would be punished for delaying or changing those targets.
Next week we'll be tracking additional guidance for Wikimedia and other regional and thematic community forums.
A common sense of the entire global community seems to be both saddened by this disruption, and at the same time pleased by this clarity and ability to focus on our own community, Wikimedia, and others.
As we go forward, CRT is working to set up a page on Meta-Wiki to provide the community with a place to monitor this impact and track our communications with them.
Staying in touch with COVID-19 related issues.
We are sending invites to your calendar for a special staff meeting to be held next Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
We're going to use this time to share additional updates, answer your questions, and spend some time understanding each other.
We are all in this together and are here to help in any way we can.
In the meantime, keep up with this email and other important information about COVID-19 on the Office Wiki.
CRT will keep these pages updated and all the information in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular communication with staff who live in countries that are currently severely affected.
If you have any questions about travel, events, a key workflow, or a challenge you're considering, or need help with anything else, feel free to report it to CRT and work with them.
We are here to help and cooperate and to establish contacts if needed.
If you have any confidential or sensitive material, please email Brian Judan, Director of Global Human Resources.
None of these changes should be seen as a quitting of our work and a liability.
Instead, they have to formally acknowledge that at this moment, we will need to take on our work and responsibilities in a way that we have never done before.
These are the steps that we think are necessary to cooperate with each other so that we can keep working, meet their needs and provide the services they depend on.
When the time comes, these activities will help us.
For now, it is time to collaborate and create space for the important tasks that will be faced in the coming weeks and possibly months.
And to make that happen, we need all of you, so we need you to take care of yourself and your family, so that you can give your best when it matters.
Now please -- wash your hands and don't touch your face!
The following are some of the key points that were made by the members of the leadership team: Catherine, CRT (Amanda K., Amy V., Brian J., Doreen D., Gregory V., Joel L., Lynette L., Ryan M., and Tony S.) and the rest of the leadership team (Grant I., Heather W., Jamie V., Janine U., Liza S., Robin A. Ryan, M., and Toby N.).
B'angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme attached to the outer surface of cells (cell membranes) in the lungs, blood vessels, heart, kidney, and intestines.
ACE2 antagonises the action of the related angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the levels of angiotensin-II and increasing the levels of Ang1-7, and thus it is a promising drug for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. ACE2 acts as an entry point for some coronaviruses into cells.
The human version of the enzyme is often called hACE2.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a zinc-containing metalloprotein enzyme found on the surface of endothelial and other cells.
The ACE2 protein has an N-terminal peptidase M2 domain and a C-terminal collector renal amino acid transporter domain.
ACE2 is a single-pass type of mucosal membrane protein that is activated by its enzyme action on the surface of cells in the lungs and other tissues.
The extra cellular domain of ACE2 is cleaved from a second transmembrane called shades, and the resulting soluble protein is released into the blood and eventually dissolved in the urine.
ACE2 is found in almost all organs: the membrane of type II alveolar cells in the lungs, enterocytes in the small intestine, endothelial cells in arteries and veins, and arterial smooth muscle tissue in most organs.
ACE2 mRNA is also found in the cerebral cortex, stratum, hypothalamus, and brainstem.
The primary function of ACE2 is to act as a resistor to ACE.
ACE allows the vasoconstriting hormone angiotensin I to enter the angiotensin II.
ACE2 in turn breaks the carboxylic-terminal amino acid from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyses it to the vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), also known as H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH.
[des-Arg9]-Bradykinin, epelin, neurotensin, dinorphin A and ghrelin can be broken by several other peptides including ACE2.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane transport of the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and is involved in Hartnup's disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 serves as the main entry point into cells for some coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
Specifically, binding of the enzymatic domain of ACE2 to the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 spike S1 proteins on the cell surface results in endocytosis and transfer of both viruses and enzymes to endosomes located in the cells.
The host serine protease TMPRSS2 is also required for the entry process to priming the S protein, the inhibition of which is currently under investigation as a potential treatment. This has led some to conclude that lowering ACE2 levels in cells may help fight infection.
However, many professional and regulatory bodies have recommended the continuation of standard ACE inhibitors and ARB therapy.
A systematic review and meta-analysis published on 11 July 2012 found that "use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a 34% reduced risk of pneumonia compared to controls".
In addition, patients who were at high risk of developing pneumonia, particularly stroke and heart failure, had a reduced risk after treatment with an ACE inhibitor.
Although the effect of ACE inhibitors was less strong than the overall risk of pneumonia, the use of ACE was also associated with a reduction in pneumonia-related mortality.
Recombinant human ACE 2 (rhACE2) is considered to be a novel therapy for acute lung injury and has been shown to improve pulmonary haemodynamics and oxygen saturation in piglets with lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is about 10 hours, and its effects take 30 minutes to start, and its duration is 24 hours.
A number of findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising drug for patients with intolerance to classic renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or for patients with high placement of unbalanced angiotensin.Infused rhACE2 has been evaluated in clinical trials for treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
b-COVID-19 apps are software applications in mobile, designed to help identify contacts, i.e. the process of identifying people who have been in contact ("contacts") with an infected person, in response to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic.
In some provinces and jurisdictions, numerous applications were developed and proposed with official government support.
Several frameworks were developed to create contact tracing apps.
Privacy concerns have been raised, particularly in systems that track the geographic location of app users.
Less intrusive options include using the Blue Tooth signal to log the proximity of the user to other cell phones.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they will integrate the functionality to support such Bluetooth-based apps directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government has jointly developed an app with Alipay that will allow citizens to check whether they have been in contact with people infected with COVID-19.
This app is used in more than 200 Chinese cities, and in Singapore, it's called Trace Together.
The app was developed by a local IT community and will be made available as open source and submitted to the government. North Macedonia launched the BlueTooth-based app "Stop Corona" to contact potentially infected people and provide rapid response to healthcare officials.
The app was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app was awaiting approval from Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
The AMP is in advanced development and will be available in a few weeks, the government said on 12 April 2020. A similar AMP has been added in Ireland and France ("Stop COVID").
Australia and New Zealand are both considering apps based on Singapore's Trace Together and Blue Tooth protocols.Russia intends to introduce a geo-fencing app designed to ensure that for COVID-19 infected patients living in Moscow, they do not leave home.
Ross Anderson, professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge, lists a number of potential practical problems with app-based systems, including false positives and the possibility that the app is less likely to be effective if its use is limited to a very small proportion of the population.
While expressing concern about the spread of misleading or harmful "coronavirus" apps, Apple set limits on what types of organizations can add coronavirus-related apps to their app store, limiting it to only "authorized" or otherwise reputable organizations.
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy campaigners expressed deep concern about the impact of mass surveillance using coronavirus apps, especially whether the surveillance infrastructure built to deal with the coronavirus pandemic would be destroyed.
Amnesty International and 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for limits on such surveillance.
The agencies announced eight conditions for government projects:
Surveillance must be "legal, necessary and verified";
The extension of surveillance and surveillance should have sunset clauses;
The use of data should be limited to COVID-19 reasons;
Information security and anonymity must be secured and shown to be protected on a pro forma basis;
Avoid severe discrimination and neglect due to digital surveillance;
Sharing of information with third parties as defined by law;
The right of citizens to defend against malpractice and to respond to it;
Meaningful participation of all "relevant stakeholders" is required, including public health experts and marginalized groups.The checklists are also issued by the German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (RSF).
The proposed Google/Apple plan aims to address the issue of tracking devices permanently removed from their device operating system once the need for tracking systems is over.
Some countries use network-based location tracking instead, which eliminates the need to download the app and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network based tracking has been approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to raw location data have significant potential privacy concerns.
However, not all systems with central servers need to access personal location data; many privacy-protected systems have been created that use central servers only for intercommunication.
In South Korea, a system was used to introduce contact tracing that was not based on the AMP.
Instead of using a dedicated AMP, the system aggregated various tracking information including mobile device tracking data and card transaction data, and combined them to generate a text message to notify the potential-infected person.
In addition to using this information to alert potential contacts, the government has made location information publicly available, something that was allowed due to far-reaching changes in data privacy laws after the MERS outbreak in that country.
This information is available to the public through numerous apps and websites. Other countries, including Germany, have considered both centralized and confidential-protected systems.
Details are not available as of 6 April 2020.
Privacy-protected contact tracing is a well-established concept, with research literature dating back to at least 2013. As of 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to log users in with other cell phones in close proximity.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordinated effort with both centralized and decentralized methods and not a single protocol. The decentralized protocol includes decentralized privacy - proximity detection (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, fka Contact Event Numbers, CEN), privacy protocols and mechanisms for contact tracking (PACT) to mobile and others.
In these protocols, identifiable personal data never leaves the device and all matches are on the device.
The privacy group at MIT Media Lab is developing SafePath, a platform for using privacy-protected techniques when collecting or using location or path intersections to track the spread of COVID-19.
This is based on research published in the March 2020 white paper "Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic". Another similar effort is SafeTrace, a privacy technology development company created by Enigma MPC, which was originally founded in the MIT Media Lab.
Using secure data hardware technology, SafeTrace allows a user to share sensitive location and health data with other users and authorities without compromising the privacy of that data.
On 5 April 2020, the Global TCN Alliance was formed by groups that had come together around essentially the same vision and overlapping protocols, and their goal is to reduce fragmentation, take backs and enable the functionality of alerting apps, which is the key aspect of widespread adoption.
On 9 April 2020, the Singapore government announced that it had made the BlueTrace protocol used by its official government app open source.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple, the companies that control the Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced an initiative for contact tracing based on a combination of Bluetooth low energy technology and privacy cryptography, which they claim will preserve privacy.
He also highlighted the features of the core technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system can be brought in three stages:
Rollout of tools to enable governments to create government secrecy - protecting coronavirus tracing apps.
Integration of this functionality directly into iOS, Android, Google and Apple is planned to address the continuous monitoring issues by first distributing the system through operating system updates and then removing the threat after the same way.
B'Drug repositioning (also called drug re-purposing, re-profiling, retasking or therapeutic switching) is the use of a drug approved for one disease or condition to treat another disease.
This is the same type of scientific research that is currently being done to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Plasma infection for vaccination and revaccination. SARS-CoV-2 has 66 drageeable proteins, each with multiple binding sites.
Analysis of such binding sites provides a suitable platform for producing an antiviral drug that is effective against COVID-19 proteins.
The most important SARS-CoV-2 targets are proteins such as papen-like proteases, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, heliakase, S proteins, and ADP ribophosphatease.
Hussain AA and others studied various candidate compounds and then analyzed them for their similarity with similarly approved drugs to develop a SARS-CoV-2 anti-infective drug in their preclinical studies and recommend it in the clinical study design.
Chloroquine is an anti-seizure medication used against some autoimmune diseases.
On 18 March, the WHO announced that four medicines that will be studied as part of the Solidarity clinical trial will include chloroquine and related hydroxychloroquine.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that New York State trials on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine would begin on March 24. On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
The FDA has authorized the EUA to perform only experimental treatment for those patients who have not received approval for these therapies through the clinical trial process and who are admitted to the hospital but cannot receive treatment under the clinical trial.
The CDC has stated that "the use, dosage, or duration of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection" has not yet been standardized.
The medication is used when "no other option is left", doctors have said.
A small study conducted by a Turkish research team in Istanbul is using chloroquine along with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Large studies are underway at Duke University and Oxford University.
The safety and efficacy of hydroxychloroquine is being tested as a preventive measure by the NYU Langone Medical School.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed that favipirvir was "fully effective".
In Shenzhen, 35 patients tested negative in 4 days and 45 patients who did not tested negative had a sick period of 11 days.
In a study of 240 patients with pneumonia in Wuhan, half of the patients were given favipirvir and half of the patients were given umifenovir.
The Italian Pharmaceutical Institute reminded the public that the current available evidence to support the drug is insufficient and preliminary.
On 2 April, Germany announced that it would purchase the drug from Japan to stockpile, and with the help of the army, distribute it to university hospitals, where it would be used to treat COVID-19 patients.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has entered formal negotiations with the Trump administration to purchase a drug that could be less effective in critically ill patients, where the virus has already multiplied.
It may not be safe for pregnant women or women trying to conceive.
A study on lopinavir/ritonavir (caletra) that combined the antiviral lopinavir and ritonavir concluded "no benefit".
Drugs were developed to prevent HIV from replicating by binding to the proteins.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is working to modify these drugs to find compounds that bind to the proteins of SARS-CoV-2.
The WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the Solidarity trial.
Remdesivir was developed by Gilead Sciences to treat infections with Ebola virus and Marburg virus. Gilead Sciences subsequently discovered that Remdesivir exhibited intra-transit antiviral activity against phyllo-, pneumo-, paramyx-, and coronaviruses.
One of the problems with antiviral therapy is the mutation of resistance that results in more serious illness and infection.
Some previous pre-clinical studies have suggested that remdesivir may have a high antigenicity to immunity. Some clinical trials are underway, including two trials at the Cleveland University Hospital; one for people with mild disease and another for people with severe disease.
Three clinical trials of intravenous administration of vitamin C to patients with severe illness and hospitalized with COVID-19 are underway; two placebo controlled (China, Canada) and one uncontrolled (Italy).
New York State began testing the antibiotic azithromycin on March 24 and has been on the market since then.

Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding and who are not using effective contraception are not eligible.
Various anticoagulants are being tested in Italy.
Hyparin with a lower molecular weight is being used to treat patients, which encourages medical institutions in Italy to publish guidelines.
A multi-centre study involving 300 patients was announced by Italy on 14th April to investigate the prophylaxis and therapeutic efficacy of enoxaparin sodium.
Because SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, there is a growing scientific focus on the use of antiviral drugs approved in the past for new targets in the outbreaks of MERS, SARS, and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: Ribavirin was recommended for treatment of COVID-19 according to the 7th edition of the Chinese Guidelines.
Umifenovir: Umifenovir was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the 7th edition of China's guidelines.
Some antibiotics were found to be suitable for use in a new targeted treatment for COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (IL-6-anti receptor): approved by the Chinese
Also see Tests in China and Italy and Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
The b'A COVID 19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
While no vaccine has been completed in clinical trials, several efforts are underway to develop such vaccines.
The World Health Organization (WHO) said in late February 2020 that vaccines against the virus that causes SARS-CoV-2 are not expected to be available for at least 18 months.
In April, Phase I safety study was underway on five vaccine candidates.
COVID-19 was discovered in December 2019.
The global outbreak in 2020 has triggered a massive investment and research into vaccine development.
Several organizations are using published genomes to develop potential vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
As announced in April, the essentials of the CEPI initiative to develop a vaccine are speed, manufacturing capacity, scale planning and global delivery.
CEPI scientists were informed in April that 10 different technology platforms were undergoing research and development in early 2020 to develop an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The major platform objectives in the Phase I security study are:
Nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) in the Phase I developer and vaccine candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273
Viral vector (provided by the I developer and vaccine candidate:Cancino Biologics, adenovirus type 5 vector)
As per the information received by CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 vaccine candidates are in pre-development, with 78 confirmed projects in progress (79 according to the Milken Institute), and another 37 announced with very little information made public (assumed to be planned or in the planning stages).
Phase I-II trials provide preliminary testing of safety and antigenicity and are generally randomised, placebo controlled and conducted at multiple sites to determine the most accurate, effective dose.
Phase III trials typically have more participants, including a control group, and test the efficacy of the vaccine to prevent disease, as well as monitor for adverse reactions after adequate dosing.
Of the 79 vaccines in active development (as confirmed in early April 2020), 74 have not yet been evaluated in humans (still in "preclinical" research).
On 24 January 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that they are investigating a potential molecular clamp vaccine that would induce an immune response by genetically modifying the virus's proteins.

The partners announced the launch of pre-clinical trials and Phase I clinical trials by July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, India's Ministry of Health announced that they are working on 11 isolates and even at the fast pace, it will take about one and a half to two years to develop a vaccine.
MedicaGO, a biotechnology company based in Quebec City, Quebec, announced on March 12, 2020 that it has developed a coronavirus-like molecule, partially funded by the Canadian Institutes for Health Research.
The vaccine candidate is undergoing laboratory research and human trials are planned for July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, The Guardian reported that United Nations President Donald Trump had expressed willingness to pay Curevax "a large sum of money to obtain a single dose of the COVID-19 vaccine", for which the German government condemned.
On 17 March 2020, the US pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced that it has partnered with the German company BioNTech to jointly develop an mRNA-based vaccine.
Pre-clinical trials are currently underway for the mRNA-based vaccine candidate BNT162 with clinical trials expected in April 2020.

On 19 March 2020, Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) in France announced an investment of US$4.9 to the COVID-19 Vaccine Research Support Team, bringing the total investment of CEPI to US$29 to develop a vaccine for COVID-19 with the support of Institut Pasteur, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh.
CEPI's investment partners in the development of COVID-19 vaccine are Moderna, CureVac, Inovio, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, the University of Oxford and the University of Queensland.
Russian health officials announced on 20 March 2020 that scientists had begun testing six different vaccine candidates in animals.
Researchers at Imperial College of London announced on 20 March 2020 that they were developing a self-applying RNA vaccine for COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate was developed in 14 days after receiving the order from China.
The Government of Canada announced funding of C$275 million for 96 COVID-19 medical immunization projects in late March, including several vaccine candidates from Canadian companies and universities, such as the Medicago and Saskatchewan initiatives.
At around the same time, the Government of Canada announced C$192 million specifically for developing a vaccine for COVID-19, which included plans to establish a national "vaccine bank" that could be used in the event of a coronavirus outbreak.
On 2 April 2020, the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine announced that it was testing a potential COVID-19 vaccine, Pitcovak, in mice, stating that "the effective antigen-specific antibody response of the SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunit vaccine given by MNA was tested [in mice] and that the response started to be received 2 weeks after vaccination".
The University of Waterloo School of Medicine in Canada announced on 16 April 2020 that it plans to develop a DNA-based vaccine candidate in the form of a vaccine to be developed in the form of a vaccine to be developed.
Using bacteriophages, DNA will be produced that replicates in human bacteria to produce harmless virus-like particles, which stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the cloud computing resources of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google were joined by the United Nations, industry and three universities to access IBM's supercomputer.
Some vaccines have side effects, also known as unintended side effects.
This means that it can have other benefits besides preventing the disease.
Next, 4,170 healthcare workers will be recruited for a randomized trial in Australia.
The vaccines being developed may not be safe or effective.
Previous research conducted to evaluate the efficacy of the vaccine on COVID-19 specific animals such as ACE2-transgenic mice, other laboratory animals and non-human primates, indicates the need for international coordination to ensure biosecurity-level 3 containment measures and standard safety procedures for handling live viruses.
SARS and MERS vaccines have been tested in animals other than humans.
As of 2020, no SARS cure or vaccine that is both safe and effective for humans has been available.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the search for and development of novel vaccines and drugs to treat SARS was a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world.
As MERS became more prevalent, it was hoped that ongoing research on SARS would provide a useful model for finding vaccines and therapies for MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, a Phase I clinical trial of a DNA-based MERS vaccine in humans had been completed, and work was underway on three other vaccines, all of which were viral-vectored vaccines, two adenoviral-vectored (ChAdOx1-MERS, BFRS-Gammavac), and one MVA-vectored (MVA-MERS-S).
The cause of the outbreak was discussed due to social media posts that the virus responsible for COVID-19 was known and a vaccine against it was already available.
Patents that have emerged as evidence from various social media posts refer to existing patents for the gene sequences and vaccines of other coronavirus strains, such as the SARS coronavirus.
b'Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease that is caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Fever, cough and shortness of breath are common symptoms.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle soreness, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of smell, and stomach pain.
The period of onset of symptoms is usually five days, but it can range from two to 14 days.
While most patients experience mild symptoms, in some patients the disease progresses to viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.
As on 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases were reported from 210 countries and territories, of which 153,000 deaths.
More than 5,68,000 patients have recovered from the disease, and the virus is mainly spread through direct contact, often through coughing, sneezing or saliva.
When the dust is exhaled, it is expelled and falls on the ground or surface, and it does not carry infection over long distances.
People can also be infected by touching contaminated surfaces and touching their eyes, nose and mouth.
The virus can survive for 72 hours on any surface.
It is most infectious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, but can also be found in the pre-symptomatic and post-symptomatic stages.
Persons suspected of being infected with the virus and those providing care to them are advised to wear a mask.
There are different opinions on the use of masks by the general public, some officials are against wearing masks, some are advising against wearing masks and some are saying that it is necessary to wear masks.
There is currently no specific antiviral treatment or vaccine available for COVID-19.
A majority of countries in all six WHO regions have reported local transmission.
Patients who have been infected with the virus sometimes have no symptoms or experience flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath.
Sudden symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or tightness, feeling confused, difficulty walking, and blue discoloration of the face and lips; if these symptoms are detected, immediate medical attention is recommended.
Mild symptoms may include respiratory symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose, or sore throat.
Some patients experienced more or less frequent esophageal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.
Some patients in China initially showed chest tightness and a heartbeat.
Some patients have been reported to have advanced disease, pneumonia, multiple organ failure and death.
This is called the incubation period.
The incubation period of COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but in some cases it can be two to 14 days.
97.5% of patients who developed symptoms appeared within 11.5 days after infection.Reports indicate that not all infected patients develop symptoms.
The role of these asymptomatic carriers in infection is not yet clear; however, from early evidence, they are thought to be involved in the transmission of the disease.
The proportion of patients who are asymptomatic has not been identified and is being studied, while the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported that 20% of confirmed patients were asymptomatic until hospitalization.
China's National Health Commission began including asymptomatic patients in daily cases from 1 April; of the 166 infections reported that day, 130 (78%) patients had no symptoms at the time of diagnosis.
Both the saliva and the saliva have a high viral load.
Talking out loud often elicits more saliva than normal speech.
A study conducted in Singapore found that coughing without a face mask can cause a cough to travel up to 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus does not originate from the air, the National Academy of Sciences has speculated that it could be aerosol transmission and has found positive viral RNA in samples taken from air collectors outside people's homes.
During certain medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiac and vascular re-activation, the respiratory tract may leak secretions and thus cause airborne transmission.
When there is concern about transmission through contact, it is considered to be of low risk, with people with symptoms being the most likely to be infected with the virus; furthermore.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that while it is not yet fully understood how easily the disease spreads, it can be transmitted from one person to two to three others, and can survive on surfaces for hours to days.
In fact, the virus has been found to survive on paper packaging for up to a day, on plastic and steel surfaces (AISI 304) for up to three days, and on 99 percent copper surfaces for up to four hours.
However, this depends on the temperature and humidity of the environment and varies accordingly.
Soaps and detergents can be effective if used properly; soap products can strip the thick protective layer of the virus, neutralize it and separate it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other remedies, such as benzacounium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a type of surgical antiseptic) are less effective. In one study in Hong Kong, saliva samples were taken within two days of admission to hospital.
In five of the six patients, the first sample had the highest number of pathogens, and in the sixth patient, the highest number of pathogens were found in the next day's test.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel coronavirus with acute respiratory symptoms.It was first isolated from three patients with pneumonia associated with the acute respiratory disease center in Wuhan.
All the characteristics of this novel SARS-CoV-2 virus are seen in its related coronaviruses in nature.
Outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap that creates its own protective bubble.The virus that causes SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the virus that causes SARS-CoV.
The most significant impact from COVID-19 is on the lungs, as the virus reaches stem cells via the enzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is abundant in the second type of cells in the lung air cells.
The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called a spike to bind to ACE2 and enter the stem cells.
Acute heartburn has also been reported in 12 percent of patients admitted to hospitals in Wuhan, China, and is frequently reported in serious illness.
Symptoms of acute cardiac injury are largely due to the inflammatory response of the system and the weakening of immunity during the course of the disease, but acute heart muscle injury may also be associated with ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are abundant in the heart and are involved in cardiac function.
Cases of blood clots (31%) and blood clots in the veins (25%) were found to be more common in severe COVID-19 patients, possibly related to uncontrolled disease.Diffuse alveolar damage (DAL) was found in autopsies of patients who died from COVID-19, and inflamed white cells were found in the lungs.
Although SARS-COVID-2 has a tendency for ACE2 to cause cellular infection with respiratory tissue cells, symptoms of hyperinflammation are seen in severe COVID-19 patients.
Specifically, the pathogenic GM-CSF-receptor T-cell was found to be associated with the recruitment of inflammatory IL-6-receptor monocytes and acute pulmonary pathology in these COVID-19 patients.
The autopsy also showed a white blood cell infiltration.
The World Health Organization has published several guidelines for testing for the disease.
Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction is the accepted test method.
Respiratory tract samples from throat secretions are commonly tested, but respiratory secretions or saliva samples from the trachea may also be used.
Test results are usually available within a few hours or a couple of days.
Blood tests can be done, but this requires two blood samples taken two weeks apart and its results have little immediate value.
Scientists were able to isolate the Chinese coronavirus strain and publish its genetic sequence, allowing laboratories around the world to independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect infection with the virus.
As of April 4, 2020, antibiotic tests (which can diagnose current infection and also tell whether a person has previously been infected) were being developed, but not widely used.
The experience of the Chinese tests has shown that the accuracy is only 60 to 70 percent.
The first point of care test was approved by the FDA in the United States on 21 March 2020 for use later that month.Diagnostic guidelines issued by Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University suggest methods of detecting infection based on chemical characteristics and risk of disease.
Bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacity was common in the initial infection, with peripheral, asymmetric and background distribution.
As the disease progresses, subpleural dominance, peculiar peving (thickening of the lobular septum with variable alveolar filling) and congestion may occur.
There is some information available on the anatomy and micro-infections of COVID-19.
Some of the important findings of autopsies are:
The symptoms of the disease include: inflammation of the lungs, pain in the heart, hardening of the lungs, and swelling of the lungs.
Four types of severity of the spread pneumonia have been observed:
Mild pneumonia: inflammation of the lungs, overgrowth of lung cells, unrelated large cells in the lungs, interstitial inflammation with white cell infiltration and the formation of multiple large cells.
Acute pneumonia: Lungs failure and uncontrolled discharge from the lungs
Diffuse alveolar damage is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome and severe oxygen deprivation.
curative pneumonia: uncontrolled accumulation of secretions in the cavities of the lungs and interstitial fibrosis of the lungs
Blood clotting in the arteries (diseminated intravascular coagulation); leucorethroblastic reaction
Measures to reduce the risk of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, washing hands frequently and for at least 20 seconds with soap and water, maintaining respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends wearing a handkerchief in front of the nose and mouth when coughing or sneezing.
Hands should be washed after coughing or sneezing.
The CDC has recommended wearing face coverings in public to limit infection from asymptomatic individuals.Social distancing is intended to reduce the contact of infected individuals with large crowds, and has led to the closure of schools, offices, travel restrictions, and the banning of large-scale public gatherings.
In the case of social distancing, people are advised to keep at least 6 feet apart from each other.
There is no known vaccine for COVID-19 and no vaccine is expected until 2021, so the key part of managing COVID-19 at this time is to contain the spread of the disease, also known as the 'flattening curve'.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when their hands look dirty, before eating and after touching their nose and coughing or sneezing.
The CDC further recommends that hand sanitizers with an alcohol content of at least 60 percent be used, but only when soap and water are not available.In regions where commercial hand sanitizers are not available, the World Health Organization has recommended two formulas for local production.
The antibiotic activity in these formulations is generated by ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to inhibit the growth of microorganisms in alcohol; it is 'not an active hand disinfectant.'
Glycerol is added as a moisturizer.
Patients are managed through supportive care, which includes oxygenation, fluid therapy and other support for affected vital organs.
The CDC recommends that anyone who suspects they may be a carrier of the virus should wear a simple face mask.
External oxygenation has been used for respiratory failure, but its benefits are still being studied.
Personal hygiene and healthy lifestyle and diet are also suggested to boost immunity.
Supportive treatments may be useful in those with mild symptoms in the early stages of infection.The World Health Organization and the Chinese National Health Commission have published recommendations for the care of hospitalized COVID-19 patients.
Critical care and pulmonology specialists in the US have compiled treatment recommendations from various agencies under one open source, IBCC.
As of April 2020, no specific treatment for COVID-19 has been identified.
Based on symptoms, some medical professionals recommend the use of paracetamol instead of ibuprofen in the beginning.
To minimize the risk of transmission of the virus, precautions should be taken, especially during procedures that generate aerial spraying of bodily fluids, such as intubation or manual ventilation.
For healthcare workers caring for COVID-19 patients, the CDC recommends that they take general precautions, contact precautions, and airborne transmission precautions, as well as place the patient in an Airborne Infection Isolation Room (AIIR).The CDC has also outlined guidelines for the use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) during the pandemic.
Precautions recommended for preparedness: PPE gown, respirator or face mask, eye protection and medical gloves. If available, respirators should be preferred over face masks.
N95 respirators are approved for industrial use, but the FDA has also approved the use of masks under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
They are designed to protect against particles such as dust in the air, but, in other applications, their effectiveness against a specific biological medium cannot be guaranteed.
When masks are not available, face masks or homemade masks can be used as a last resort as recommended by the CDC.
Most COVID-19 patients are not so severe as to require medical ventilation or such, but a small percentage of patients do.
The type of medical respiratory support that patients receive due to COVID-19 respiratory obstruction is being studied continuously for people in hospital.The procedure of intubation can be avoided by a high-flow tube through the nose or by bivalve positive airway pressure.
It is not known whether either of these will have the same benefits for patients with serious illness.
Some doctors prefer mechanical ventilation treatments that are more aggressive if available, as they limit the spread of airborne pathogens compared to the use of a ventilation duct. The risk of severe disease is much higher in the elderly (those over 60 years of age, especially those over 80 years of age).
Many developed countries also lack adequate per capita hospital beds, which could limit the capacity of health systems to handle the sudden increase in the number of severe COVID-19 patients admitted to hospital.
A study in China showed that 5 percent of the total patients were admitted to the ICU, 2.3 percent required external ventilation support, and 1.4 percent died.
About 30% of COVID-19 patients admitted to hospital in China had to be admitted to the ICU department at the end.
Technical ventilation becomes complicated and oxygen delivery becomes more and more difficult as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) develops in patients with COVID-19.
Ventilators with pressure-control capabilities and high PEEPs are needed to reduce the risk of lung injury and pneumothorax caused by ventilators while delivering more oxygen.
High-efficiency PEEP may not be available on older ventilators.
Research on potential treatments began in January 2020 and several antiviral drugs have since been undergoing clinical trials.
Remdesivir is the most promising.
Although it will take until 2021 for new drugs to be developed, many of the trial drugs have been approved for other uses or are undergoing further trials.
Antiviral drugs can be tested on critically ill patients.
Volunteers, as recommended by the World Health Organization, participate in trials to study the effect and safety of these potential treatments.The FDA has provisionally approved convalescent plasma therapy as an experimental treatment in patients whose lives are at risk.
They have not been subjected to chemical studies to determine whether they are effective and safe treatments for this disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to deal with the outbreak.
Users are asked to enter their name and ID number.
The app can also show 'close contact' based on the information it monitors and thus understand the potential for infection.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If there is a potential risk, the app suggests self-isolation, and also provides information to local health authorities. Big data analytics from cell phone data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence are all being used in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore to track infected patients and people they have come in contact with.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed security services to search mobile phone data of people who may have been infected with the coronavirus.
Measures were taken to impose quarantine and protect those who may have been in contact with infected civilians.
In March 2020, Deutsche Telecom handed over the collected phone location data to the German federal government agency, the Robert Koch Institute, to be used for virus prevention and research.
Russia has installed facial recognition technology to track down people who break the lockdown.
Regional Health Commissioner of Italy, Giulio Gallari, said that he is receiving information via mobile phones.
The German government organized a 48-hour weekend hackathon with more than 42000 participants.
The President of Estonia, Kersty Karluolid, has also issued a global call for concrete measures to combat the spread of the coronavirus.
Isolation, travel restrictions, treatment adverse effects, or fear of infection can all make people feel anxious.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying that "increasing social isolation, loneliness, health concerns, stress and economic decline are the root causes of people's mental health and well-being".
It may have few or no symptoms, which is common with other respiratory diseases such as the common cold and colds.
Mild cases usually recover within two weeks, while severe cases may take three to six weeks to recover.
Based on information from other similar viruses such as SARS, MERS, it can be concluded that pregnant women who are severely infected with COVID-19 may be at higher risk, but this is not the case with COVID-19.In some people, COVID-19 can affect the lungs, causing pneumonia.
In severely affected people, COVID-19 can develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which can result in respiratory failure, septic shock or multiple organ failure, etc.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal blood clots, and damage to the heart, kidneys, and liver.
6% of people hospitalized with COVID-19 had blood clotting abnormalities, increased prothrombin time, and 4% of these groups had renal dysfunction.
Approximately 20-30% of people with COVID-19 have been found to have elevated liver enzymes.
The same report also stated that the time between onset of symptoms and death was 10 days, of which 5 days were spent in hospital.
However, the average time between hospitalization and death in the intensive care unit was seven days.
Early case studies found that the median time between onset of symptoms and death was 14 days.
A study by the National Health Commission (NHC) of China stated that the mortality rate for men was 2.8% while the mortality rate for women was 1.7%.
Histopathological examination of post-mortem lung samples shows diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyoxide in both lungs.
Viral cytophatic changes were observed in the pneumocytes.
The lung imaging was associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
High levels of troponin or cardiac arrest were found in 11.8% of the deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China.
The March report of the United States found that 89% of people admitted to hospital had some pre-existing complaints.The availability of medical resources and the socio-economic status of the area also affect the mortality.
Regional differences in mortality estimates in these situations are also due to systemic challenges.
Reducing the number of mild cases may result in an exaggerated mortality rate.
However, the fact that these deaths are the result of cases that have been exposed in the past may mean that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smokers are 1.4 times more likely to experience severe symptoms of COVID-19 than non-smokers, and approximately 2.4 times more likely to require intensive care or die.
Officials at a Hong Kong hospital found a 20 to 30 percent decrease in lung capacity in some people who had recovered from the disease, and lung scans showed organ damage.
This can lead to post-intensive care syndrome when recovered.
As of March 2020, it was unknown whether previous infections provided effective and long-term immunity in people who had recovered from the disease.
Based on the behaviour of other coronaviruses, it can be assumed that immunity is likely to be present, but cases have been reported where coronavirus tests were positive in the next few days after recovering from COVID-19.
It is believed that in such cases there may be a prolonged infection rather than a recurrence.
It is believed to be a natural virus that originated in an animal and is spread by infection.
Its exact origin is unknown, but by December 2019 the infection had spread entirely through human-to-human transmission.
A study of 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19 published in The Lancet in January showed that 1 December 2019 was the earliest date for symptom manifestation.
The official publication by WHO lists 8 December 2019 as the date of onset of symptoms.
Different methods are generally used to calculate deaths.
These numbers vary by region and time, and are influenced by the number of trials, the quality of the health care system, treatment options, the time since the initial outbreak, and demographic characteristics such as age, gender, and overall health.
In the last quarter of 2019, WHO assigned the emergency ICD-10 code U07.1 to laboratory-confirmed deaths from SARS-CoV-2 infection and the disease code U07.1 to deaths from COVID-19 that were not laboratory-confirmed clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The death-to-case ratio displays the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed in a given period.
The global death-to-case ratio is 6.9%, according to Johns Hopkins University.
Other measures include the case fatality rate (CFR), which displays the percentage of people diagnosed who die from a disease, and the infection mortality rate (IFR), which displays the percentage of infected people (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who die from a disease.
These statistics are not time-bound and are based on the specific population of cases that have been infected.
Not all infected people develop antibodies, and the presence of antibodies may be a clue as to how many people are infected.
In Italy, the center of the outbreak, a small village called Castiglione d'Adda, has so far claimed 4,600,80 (1.7%) deaths.
The disease was spread by the carnival festival in Genk and spread among younger people, resulting in a comparatively low mortality rate and perhaps not all COVID-19-infected deaths can be formally classified as such.
Also, the German healthcare system is not as overburdened.
In the Netherlands, perhaps about 3% of the population may have antibodies, as reported by blood donors.
69 (0.004% of the population) people have died from COVID-19.
The impact and mortality of this pandemic are different for women and men.
Studies in China and Italy found that men had higher mortality rates.
Men in their 50s are most at risk, and the closest gap between men and women is in their 90s.
In China, the mortality rate for men was 2.8% and for women 1.7% respectively.
The exact cause of these gender differences is unknown, but it may be due to genetic and behavioral factors.
Gender-based immunity gaps, low prevalence of smoking among women and the development of co-morbidities such as hypertension at a younger age than in women may all contribute to higher mortality among men.
In Europe, 57% of those infected were men, and 72% of those who died from COVID-19 were men.
As of April 2020, the US government was not collecting gender-disparity data among COVID-19 infected people.
The research found that viral diseases like Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.
A large number of health workers, especially nurses, are women, and they are at higher risk of contracting the virus.
The WHO announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease would be "COVID-19".
WHO Director-General, Tendros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said that CO stands for Corona, VI stands for Virus, D stands for Disease and 19 is the year when the first outbreak of this disease was observed: 31 December 2019.
The name was given to avoid referring to a specific geographical location (e.g., China), animal species, or group of people, which followed the international recommendation of the naming, and the purpose was to avoid stigmatizing anyone. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2).
In public communication, WHO uses the terms "COVID-19 virus" and "virus responsible for COVID-19" in addition to these.
Both the disease and the virus are commonly referred to as "coronavirus".
At the time of the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, both the virus and the disease were commonly referred to as "coronavirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus".
In January 2020, the WHO recommended 2019-nCoV and 2019-nCoV Acute Respiratory Diseases as interim names for this virus and disease, following 2015 guidance against the use of place names in the names of these diseases and viruses.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were released on 11 February 2020.
Due to capacity limitations in the standard imperfect chain, some digital manufacturers are printing healthcare materials as nasal swabs and ventilator parts.
For example, in one Italian hospital, when a ventilator valve was urgently needed and the supplier was unable to supply it in time, a local startup reverse-engineered and printed 100 valves overnight.
Since the initial outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracies, falsehoods and misinformation about the origin, extent, treatment and other aspects of the disease have emerged and spread rapidly online.
Humans have been found to be able to spread the virus to some other animals.
The study failed to find evidence of replication of the virus in pigs, ducks and chickens.
No drug or vaccine has been approved for the treatment of this disease.
The Government is conducting international research on vaccine and drug for COVID-19.
In March, WHO launched a "solidarity trial" to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of four existing antiviral compounds that are the most effective.
While no vaccine is currently available, various agencies are actively developing 'vaccine candidates'.
Previous studies on SARS-CoV-2 are being used, as both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use ACE2 neurotransmitters to enter human cells.
So far, three vaccination strategies have been identified.
First, the researchers' goal is to create a complete virus vaccine.
The purpose of using such a virus, whether it is an inactivated or dead virus, is to generate a new infection with COVID-19 in the human body's immediate immune response.
Another strategy is subunit vaccines, which aim to create vaccines that sensitize the immune system to a specific subunit of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus to penetrate the ACE2 enzyme in the neural tissue.
A third strategy is about nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, an innovative technology to produce vaccines).
The safety and efficacy of any of these three strategies must be tested for the experimental vaccine.In Seattle, on March 16, 2020, a clinical trial of a vaccine with four volunteers was initiated.
The vaccine contains a non-threatening genetic code, which is replicated from the virus that causes the disease.Antibody-dependent conservation has been suggested as a potential challenge to developing a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, but this is controversial.
As of April 2020, over 300 active clinical trials are reportedly underway.
Seven trials were being evaluated from already approved treatments for malaria, including four investigational studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Most Chinese research involves multi-purpose antiviral drugs, with nine Phase III trials on Remedicivir taking place in multiple countries, according to a report submitted in late April.
As per the April 2020 report, a dynamic review of clinical development for COVID-19 vaccine and drug candidates is in progress.Many existing antiviral drugs have been evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19, including Remdesivir, Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine, Lopinavir/Ryotoquine, and Lopinavir/Ryotoquine with Interferon Beta.
As of March 2020, there is tentative evidence for an effect of Remedicivir.
Patients treated with remdesivir had shown clinical improvement.
Phase-III clinical trials are being conducted in the US, China and Italy. Chloroquine, which was previously used for malaria, was studied in China in February 2020, with preliminary results.
However, this research requires a collective review.
Korean and Chinese health authorities have recommended the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology recommends a daily dose of one gram of it, noting that a double dose is very dangerous and can even kill.
The FDA issued an emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine on March 28, 2020, based on the discretion of physicians treating patients with COVID-19.The Chinese Seventh Edition Guide also includes interferon, ribavirin or imifenovir for use against CORONA-19.
Preliminary data suggest that high doses of ribavirin are required to prevent SARS-CoV-2 in the trial.
Nitzazoxanide is recommended for further testing after demonstrating low concentration inhibition of SARS-CoV-2.Studies have shown that initially spike protein priming via Transmembrane Protease Serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is required for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 via interaction with ACE-2 mechanism.
Studies with or without azithromycin with chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have had major difficulties that have prevented the medical community from adopting these therapies without further study.Oceltamyvir did not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in experiments and has not been found to have any known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
Cytokine storms can be complicated in the later stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have anti-cytokine storm properties.Tosilizuumab has been included in the treatment guidelines by the National Health Commission of China after a small study.
After positive results in people with severe illness, Italy is currently conducting national phase II non-randomized trials.
Combining serum ferritin with a blood test to identify cytokine storms means resisting the development of a virus that has been implicated as a cause of death in some infected people.
In 2017, the interleukin-6 neurotoxin was approved by the FDA based on a pre-effectiveness study for the treatment of the steroid refractory cytokine release syndrome in the lungs due to a different cause called CAR T cell therapy.
To date, there is no randomized, controlled evidence that tosalizumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
Research is underway as a non-vaccine method of passive vaccination of people who have recovered from COVID-19 by transferring purified and concentrated antibodies created by the immune system to people who need it.
This strategy was used for SARS, but it didn't have any particular effect.
There is an expected mechanism of viral neutralization action, whereby inactivated antibody therapy against SARS-CoV-2 can be performed.
However, other mechanisms, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and/or phagocytes, may be possible.
Other forms of inactive antibody therapy are under development, for example, using synthetic monoclonal antibodies.
Production of clonalisant serums, which include fluid proteins from the blood of recovered patients and which contain antibodies specific to this virus, can be ramped up for rapid development.
Coronavirus disease, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at the Central Hospital of Wuhan, contracted COVID-19 and died after raising awareness about the spread of the virus.
