Members of the National Assembly for Wales fear confusion with the Muppets
The proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament) is causing consternation among some members of the National Assembly.
The reason for this is plans to change the name of the National Assembly to Welsh Parliament.
Members of the National Assembly of all political stripes fear being the target of ridicule.
A Labour MP said his group was concerned that the name rymed with Twp and Pwp.
For non-Welsh readers: In Welsh, twp stands for doof and pwp for Aa.
A member of the National Assembly for Plaid Cymru party said the whole group was 'not happy' and had proposed alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said his group was open to the name change, but pointed to the strong similarity between MWP and Muppet.
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced similarly to the letter u in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting a law on the name changes, said: "The final decision on the designation of the members of the National Assembly is, of course, up to the members themselves".
The Government of Wales Act 2017 authorised the Welsh National Assembly to change its name.
In June, the panel published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which showed broad support for the name 'Welsh Parliament' for the National Assembly.
As regards the titles of the National Assembly members, the panel favoured Welsh Parliament Members or WMPs, while in a public hearing the option MWP found the most support.
The members of the National Assembly seem to be proposing alternative options, but the struggle for consensus could pose a problem for Speaker Elin Jones, who is expected to present a draft law within weeks.
The reform law will include further changes to the way the National Assembly works, including rules on disqualifying members of the National Assembly and on the structure of the committee system.
The members of the National Assembly may vote on their names in their final debate on the law.
Macedonians vote in referendum on changing the country's name
Voters will decide on Sunday whether to change their country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia".
The referendum was called to settle a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has a province with a similar name, Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour means that it claims Greek territory and has repeatedly spoken out against its inclusion in the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the referendum on the name change, said he would not recognize the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is the price to pay for EU and NATO membership.
The bells of St. Martin's are silent in the face of the difficulties of the churches in Harlem
"The old people I spoke to said that in the past there used to be a bar and a church on every corner", said Adams.
Today, neither exists.
He said the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
"People's social life is different today", he said.
Bars are no longer the neighborhood living rooms where people regularly hang out.
He fears that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as church leaders think and that sooner or later the churches will be back to square one.
Churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment buildings with condos where people live who do not support the remaining shelters.
"The overwhelming majority of people who buy condominiums in these buildings will be white", he said, "thus accelerating the complete closure of these churches, as it is unlikely that most of the people who move into these condominiums will become members of these churches".
Both churches were built by white communities before Harlem became a black metropolis: Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved out in the 1930's.
A black congregation that held its services nearby became the owner of the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation under Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, a major shopping street in Harlem, who refused to hire or support blacks.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but when Johnson's father's parishioners planned to rebuild, they commissioned the bell tower.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the bells as "the bells of the poor".
The expert who rang the bell in July used other words: "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, further noted that this was the world's first bell set played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who had switched to the larger bell set at Riverside Church 18 years earlier.
Merriweather said he wasn't replaced by St. Martin's.
What has been going on in St. Martin's over the last few months is a complicated history with architects and contractors being brought in part by the lay leaders of the church and partly by the Episcopal Diocese.
The parish council  the governing body of the parish  made written comments to the diocese in July expressing concerns that the diocese would try to pass the costs on to the parish council, even though the latter had not been involved in commissioning the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark injures 13-year-old boy while diving for lobsters in California
In California, on Saturday, the first day of lobster season, a shark attacked a 13-year-old boy while diving for lobsters, according to official reports.
The attack took place just before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about a half hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy's cries for help and paddled with several others to help him get out of the water.
Hammel said he thought at first the boy was happy to have caught a lobster, but then he realized that the boy was screaming, "I've been bitten!"
I got bit!
When Hammel arrived at the boy, he found that his entire collarbone was torn.
"I shouted that everyone should come out of the water: "There's a shark in the water!"
The boy was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is in critical condition.
The type of shark responsible for the attack was not known.
Rescue swimmer Captain Larry Giles told the media that a shark had been seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous shark.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper body.
For investigation and security reasons, officials have blocked beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Encinitas for 48 hours.
Giles says that there are over 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK cosmetics market
Sainsbury's is attacking with department stores-like cosmetics departments staffed by specialized assistants, boots, superdrugs and Debenhams.
As part of a large-scale push into the UK's £2.8 billion cosmetics market, which continues to grow while fashion and household goods sales are declining, the larger cosmetics departments are being tested in 11 branches across the country, and if successful, will be expanded to more branches next year.
The investment in cosmetics coincides with the search by supermarkets for opportunities to reuse previously used retail space for TV sets, microwave ovens and household goods.
Sainsbury's says it is doubling its cosmetics range to 3,000 for the first time, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees series are also given more space and branded areas similar to those in shops such as boats.
The supermarket is also relaunching its Boutique make-up line, so that most of the products are vegan-friendly  an aspect increasingly demanded by younger customers.
In addition, the perfume retailer Fragrance Shop will be testing at two Sainsbury's outlets, the first opening last week in Croydon, south London, and a second opening later this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Online shopping and the shift to buying small quantities of food every day from local grocery stores means that supermarkets need to do more to get customers to visit them.
According to Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, the outlets are increasingly looking like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to fight the discount stores Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food items.
Since the acquisition of the Argos and Habitat chains two years ago, Sainsbury's has established hundreds of Argos outlets in its branches and a number of Habitat outlets, which have increased food sales and the profitability of the acquisitions.
The supermarket's previous attempt to reorganize its cosmetics and pharmacy departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but it ended after a dispute over the distribution of proceeds from the drug dealer's supermarket stores.
The new strategy follows Sainsbury's sale of its 281-shop pharmacy business to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125 million three years ago.
The company stated that Lloyds will play a role in the plan in that it will add an extended range of luxury skincare brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director at Sainsbury's, said: "We have redesigned the appearance of our cosmetics departments to create a more attractive environment for our customers.
We also invested in specially trained colleagues who are available as consultants.
Our range of brands is tailored to all needs.Due to the attractive environment and convenient locations, we are now an attractive destination for cosmetics purchases that challenge the previous way of shopping.
Peter Jones angry after Holly Willoughby withdrew from a deal worth 11 million British pounds
"Dragons" star Peter Jones is "angry" after TV presenter Holly Willoughby pulled out of an £11 million deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for the joint homewear and accessories brand Truly.
The two of them were compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop.
The 37-year-old This Morning host announced her retirement on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby angered Dragon's Den star Peter Jones by her extremely short-term withdrawal from her lucrative lifestyle brand business to focus on her own new affiliate contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Jones was reportedly "angry" when the television "Golden Girl" admitted at a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of her business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that she could no longer devote enough time to her new business - worth up to £1.5 million - in the joint homewear and accessories brand Truly.
The company has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and would have likely doubled Willoughby's estimated fortune of £11 million.
While Willoughby, 37, announced her withdrawal from Truly on Instagram, Jones left the UK on his way to one of his holiday homes.
A source said that Truth was by far Holly's top priority.
It was to secure their future for decades to come.
Her decision to withdraw came as a complete surprise to all concerned.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to the launch.
At the headquarters in Marlow, a warehouse full of goods is waiting to be sold.
Experts believe the departure of the This Morning host, one of Britain's most promising stars, could cost the company millions due to high investment in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and homewear and possible further delays in the market launch.
Moreover, it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been close friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly in 2016 with Capp, and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
The couples are spending the holidays together, and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby is set to become brand ambassador for M&S and replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night: "We do not comment on his business affairs".
Hard words and then we fell in love
He joked about the criticism he expected from the news media for a comment that some would consider "not presidential" and for such positive statements about the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said, imitating the voice of a news anchor:
I didn't give up on anything.
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting, as the first meeting in Singapore in June was hailed by Trump as a major step toward denuclearization of North Korea.
The denuclearization negotiations have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, Ri Yong Ho, North Korea's top diplomat, told leading politicians from around the world at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the North sees no "appropriate response" from the US to North Korea's initial disarmament measures.
Instead, he noted, the US was sticking to sanctions designed to keep the pressure up.
Trump was much more optimistic in his rally speech.
"We have been very successful with North Korea", he said.
We were on the verge of war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have this great relationship.
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have shown positive results: ending missile tests, supporting the release of hostages and returning the remains of American military personnel.
He also defended his unusual way of talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to be president, but instead of 10,000 people standing outside trying to get into this crowded arena, there would be about 200 people standing here", Trump said, pointing to the crowd directly in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake devastate an island in Indonesia, killing hundreds
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told they were not needed.
Although over 10 percent of Lombok's population has been displaced, no national emergency has been declared, a prerequisite for mobilizing international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it very clear that they are not asking for international support, so that is a bit difficult", said Sumbung.
While Save the Children is assembling a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet certain whether foreign staff can work there.
Sutopo, a spokesman for the disaster management agency, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies could participate in the relief effort.
In view of the earthquakes that Indonesia constantly faces, the country is still unfortunately ill-prepared for natural disasters.
While tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not a common sight in other coastal areas.
The apparent absence of a tsunami warning in Palu despite a warning that had been in effect is likely to have contributed to the deaths.
Traveling between Indonesia's many islands is a challenge at best.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but will arrive at the site of the new disaster in three days at the earliest.
President Joko Widodo has made improving Indonesia's planned infrastructure the centerpiece of his election campaign, spending ample funds on roads and railways.
However, the government of Joko, who is seeking re-election next year, is suffering from funding deficits.
Joko is also under pressure from persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority practice a more conservative form of religion.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were driven from their homes and apartments as gangs of Christians and Muslims fought in the streets with machetes, arrows and bows and other primitive weapons.
Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge has scored deep draws against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool on Saturday at London's Stamford Bridge Stadium with an 89th-minute goal before a Premier League defeat to Chelsea.
Sturridge was given a pass by Xherdan Shaqiri at a 0-1 deficit, about 27 metres from Chelsea's goal.
He aimed the ball to the left and then shot it towards the back of the post.
The shot sailed high over the penalty area and drifted into the upper right corner of the net.
Finally, the ball fell over the jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and then into the net.
"I was just trying to get in that position and get the ball, players like Shaq always play as much forward as possible, so I just tried to make as much time for myself as possible", Sturridge told Liverpool FC.com.
I saw Kante coming and I had contact with the ball, I didn't think too much about it and I just took the shot.
Chelsea took the lead at half-time with a 1-0 lead after a 25th-minute goal by Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The Blues striker returned a pass with the heel to Mateo, then turned around near midfield and sprinted into the Liverpool half.
Kovacic played a fast double in midfield.
He then threw a good pass to get Hazard into the penalty area.
Hazard left the defenders behind and closed with a left-handed shot to Liverpool's Alisson Becker past the back of the net.
Liverpool play in the Champions League group stage on Wednesday at 15:00 at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples.
Chelsea are set to face each other in the UEFA Europa League videoton at 3:00pm on Thursday in London.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the disaster management agency said Sunday morning.
Many people are believed to be trapped in the rubble of buildings that collapsed after Friday's 7.5 magnitude earthquake, which caused waves as high as six meters to collapse, government spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
The city of Palu, with a population of more than 380,000, was littered with the rubble of collapsed buildings.
Police arrest man, 32, on suspicion of murder after woman was stabbed
A murder investigation has been launched following the discovery of a woman's body this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old was found stabbed at 7:55 a.m. in Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police are asking residents to report if they see or hear anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in an early stage, but I would ask anyone who has been in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead and seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I would also ask anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have taken a dashcam to contact us if they have information of major importance to our investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found lived in Birkenhead and was found in a building.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the woman arrived at the scene to find out where she was found this morning.
Investigations are ongoing, and police said they're in the process of informing the victim's next of kin.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews was trying to get into his apartment, but was informed by police that no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
He was speechless when he learned what had happened.
Residents are being informed that it will take hours before they can re-enter the building.
A police officer was heard telling a man that the entire area was now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared at the scene, dissolved in tears.
She keeps saying, "This is so terrible".
At 2:00 p.m., two police vehicles were inside the barrier and another vehicle was outside the barrier.
Inside the barricade were several police officers who were guarding the apartment block.
Anyone with information is asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 and refer to the minutes entry 247 of September 30.
The Cromwell statue in front of Parliament is the latest monument to be the subject of controversy over the rewriting of history
Their banishment would be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious artifacts by his fanatical Puritan followers.
However, the Cromwell Society described Crick's proposal as "nonsense" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate about the removal of statues that the statue of Oliver Cromwell in front of the Palace of Westminster was targeted.
The image storm in the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the false Cromwell would be sacrificed for the deeds of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent portrayal of Cromwell is evidence of the 19th-century opinion and part of the history of a figure who many still consider worthy of celebration.
Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is seen by many, perhaps in the late 19th century more than today, as someone who defended Parliament against outside pressure, in his case of course from the monarchy.
Whether this is a completely accurate account is the subject of ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid-17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a single recognizable figure who represents one side of that divide.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and remembrance.
Killer pig bites Chinese farmers dead
Local media reports that a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig at a market in southwest China.
The man, whose surname was only Yuan, was found dead with a severed artery near a pigsty in the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inject pigs with vaccines in Xining, Qinghai Province, China, on May 30, 2005.
He reportedly traveled with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and saw that a door to a neighboring pigsty was open.
He said that in the stable was a large male pig with blood on its snout.
According to the report, a forensic examination confirmed that the 250-pound pig had bitten the farmer to death.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and mutilated", the cousin, whose surname was Wu, was quoted as saying by the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told the Evening News that the pig had been locked up to prevent further attacks on people while police gathered evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and the market authorities are reportedly negotiating a settlement for his death.
Although it is rare for pigs to attack humans, such cases are known.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, seriously injuring the man.
Ten years ago, a 300-pound pig caught a Welsh farmer between himself and a tractor until the farmer's wife could scare the animal away.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a "trigger".
They're just playing.
They're very curious and they don't want to hurt anyone.
He said that the only thing that was needed was to treat them with the right amount of respect.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa bring widespread heavy rainfall to the southwest of the United States
As forecast, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it makes its way over the colder waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring flood-causing rains to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the coming days.
At 5:00 a.m. eastern time Sunday, Rosa was recording wind speeds of 135 miles per hour, equivalent to a Category 1 hurricane, and was located 620 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to head north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a trough is forming over the Pacific Ocean, moving eastward to the west coast of the U.S. When Rosa hits the Baja California Peninsula as a tropical storm on Monday, it will carry high tropical humidity northward into the southwestern United States.
Rosa will produce up to 25 centimeters of rainfall in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, in the coming days, the tropical moisture will interact with the approaching trough to produce widespread heavy rainfall in the southwest.
Locally, rainfall of 2.5 to 10 centimeters can cause dangerous flooding, debris floating in the water, and possibly landslides in the desert.
High tropical humidity results in rainfall rates of nearly two to three inches [5 to 7.5 cm] an hour in some places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In the southwest, especially in much of Arizona, rainfall is expected to be up to two to three inches [5-10 cm].
The dispersal of tropical rainfall means that there is a possibility of flash floods with rapidly deteriorating conditions.
In view of the threat of tropical rainfall, it is strongly discouraged to walk into the desert.
Heavy rainfall can cause canyons to become rippling streams, and thunderstorms can bring local wind gusts and dust-carrying winds.
The approaching storm brings local heavy rainfall to parts of the southern California coast.
Total precipitation of more than one centimetre is possible, which can lead to small amounts of debris floating in the water and smooth roadways.
This would be the first rainfall of the rainy season in this region.
The first isolated tropical showers will reach Arizona on Sunday evening and Monday morning, with widespread rainfall on Monday evening and Tuesday.
On Tuesday, heavy rain spreads to the Four Corners region and continues through Wednesday.
In October, severe temperature fluctuations are possible throughout the United States as the Arctic cools while the tropics remain relatively warm.
This sometimes results in drastic temperature differences over short distances.
Sunday is a good example of a dramatic temperature change in the central United States.
Between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, there is a temperature difference of almost 12 degrees.
In the next few days, the continuing summer heat will try to develop and expand.
For much of the central and eastern United States, a warm start to October is expected, with temperatures ranging from the Southern Plains to parts of the Northeast to 27°C.
New York City could get up to 27 degrees on Tuesday, about 6 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a high probability of above-average temperatures in the first half of October in the eastern United States.
Over 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million viewers on six television networks on Thursday watched the compelling testimony of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman, Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual assault in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political stalemate continued, with television stations interrupting their regular programming on Friday because of a last-minute twist: an agreement negotiated by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake to have the FBI conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100% sure that Kavanaugh was drunk at a high school party, harassed her, and tried to remove her clothes.
Kavanaugh said in a passionate statement that he was 100% sure that this hadn't happened.
It is likely that more than the 20.4 million viewers reported by Nielsen watched the hearing.
The company determined the average viewership of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
For other networks such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, which broadcast the hearing, the figures were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen usually has problems measuring viewership in offices.
To put this in perspective, this is about the size of the audience at a playoff football game or the Oscars.
The Fox News Channel, whose opinion-oriented hosts strongly support Kavanaugh's nomination, had the highest ratings of any network, averaging 5.69 million viewers for the daytime hearing, according to Nielsen.
ABC came in second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, according to data from Nielsen.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican's office released a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was filmed by CNN and CBS cameras Friday morning as protesters loudly threatened him in the elevator on his way to a Judiciary Committee hearing.
He stood with his eyes down for minutes while he was scolded, and the scene was broadcast live on CNN.
"I'm standing right in front of you", said a woman.
Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
"You have power, while so many women are powerless", said one woman.
Flake said his office released a statement and supplemented it before the elevator closed, saying he would have more to say at the committee hearing.
All cable and radio networks were broadcasting live hours later as the Judiciary Committee was to vote on whether to send Kavanaugh's nomination to the full Senate.
Flake said, however, that he would only do so on the condition that the FBI investigate the allegations against the candidate next week, as requested by the Democratic minority.
Flake was convinced in part by talks with a friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a discussion with Coons and subsequently several senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision was significant because it was obvious that without the investigation, the Republicans wouldn't have enough votes to confirm Kavanaugh.
President Trump has ordered an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of using Brexit for political purposes
Prime Minister Theresa May, in an interview with the Sunday Times, accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of using Britain's future for political purposes and undermining the nation's interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party convention in Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
In another interview published alongside her interview on the front page of the paper, her former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson intensified his attack on her so-called "Chequers" plan for Brexit by calling a proposal for the UK and EU to collect tariffs on each other "totally absurd".
Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson in connection with LSU player's death
Police have arrested a suspect in connection with the fatal shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old Louisiana State University (LSU) basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and detained for manslaughter, according to Baton Rouge police.
The agency released video footage of Sims and Simpson arguing, and police say Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
As CBS affiliate WAFB reports, police secured the glasses at the scene and said they contained Simpson's DNA.
After questioning Simpson, the police said he confessed to the fatal shots on Wayde.
The attorney reports that the bail has been set at $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office released a preliminary report Friday, stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the neck.
Police are grateful to the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Task Force, the state police forensic laboratory, Southern University Police and the local community for their support in the investigation leading to the arrest.
LSU Athletic Director Joe Alleva thanked the regional enforcement agency for "their care and their pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-3 wingman grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne played basketball for LSU.
Last season, he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "deeply shocked" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
"You're always afraid of something like that", Wade said.
Volcano spewing ash on Mexico City.
Ashes from the Popocatepetl volcano have reached the southern quarter of Mexico City.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity in the crater increased and 183 gas and ash eruptions were recorded within 24 hours.
The agency monitored numerous cases of grumbling and shaking.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash on the windshields of cars in neighborhoods of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed increased activity at the volcano, located 45 miles [72 km] southeast of the capital, since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Clashes between police and Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
In Barcelona, six people were arrested on Saturday after clashes between riot police and pro-independence protesters, as thousands took part in other demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarizing independence referendum.
A group of masked pro-separatists, held back by the emergency police, threw eggs and also threw paint powder, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that are usually crowded with tourists.
In the course of the day, there were also handshakes with the police, who used their batons to contain the fighting.
For several hours, pro-independence groups chanted "No forget, no forgive" as they were confronted by unionists who shouted "Long live Spain".
Local media reported that 14 people were treated for minor injuries sustained during the protests.
One year after the referendum of 1 October, which Madrid considered illegal but was celebrated by separatist Catalans, the situation in the independent region remains very tense.
Voters had overwhelmingly voted for independence, although turnout was low as the anti-secessionists largely boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year when police tried to prevent voting in violent clashes outside polling stations.
Pro-independence groups had camped outdoors overnight on Friday to prevent a demonstration for the national police.
The demonstration took place, but was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated with his wife in the separatist protest, said he no longer sees the prospects of Catalonia achieving independence with hope.
Last year was one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying for joy because they could vote, but now we're stuck, he said.
Despite a major, if brief, victory in the regional elections last December, Catalan pro-independence parties have struggled to maintain momentum this year, with many of their most prominent leaders either in self-imposed exile or in prison awaiting trial for their role in organising the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the pro-police protest on his phone, said the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
"The situation is getting more and more tense", he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in detention since the end of last year, announced his candidacy for next year's European Parliament elections.
'Candidating for the European elections is the best way to denounce the degradation of democratic values and the repression by the Spanish government', he said.
London: Men arrested after house was hit by car
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 have been arrested after a house in Londonderry was hit by a car several times.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 7:30 PM UK time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building itself were damaged.
Also, the car may have been shot with a sternum.
Menga hit means Livingston win 1-0 against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured the win.
The rising Livingston FC surprised the Rangers and led to only the second defeat for Steven Gerrard in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's hit proved crucial in helping Gary Holt's team to a second-half tie with Hibernian.
Gerrard's side remain without a away win in the Premiership this season and next Sunday face Hearts, who are eight points behind.
Before that, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston can now increase his division winning streak to six games, meaning head coach Holt hasn't had a losing record since taking over from Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses chances against frankly playing guests
Holt's team should have been in the lead long before the hit, as his directness posed the Rangers with a variety of problems.
Scott Robinson broke through, but slowed down before the goal, and then Alan Lithgow could only shoot far after slipping in to pass Craig Halkett's head shot at the goal.
The hosts were content to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could hinder the guests in standard situations.
Thus the decisive gate came into being.
The Rangers allowed a free throw, and Livingston prepared an opportunity in which Declan Gallagher and Robinson jointly put Menga in the shooting position, who shot the goal with a ball contact from the center of the penalty area.
At this stage, the Rangers had dominated possession, but could not overcome the hosts' defense, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly remained largely unhindered.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos once forced Kelly to defend.
Scott Pittman was defended by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor with his feet, and Lithgow snagged the ball from another standard situation bypassing Livingston.
Flanks were repeatedly brought into Livingston's penalty area and regularly removed from the danger zone, while two required penalties - one by Halkett against the substituted Glenn Middleton and one for a handshake - were refused.
 phenomenon by Livingston  analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and a strong result for Livingston.
They have been exceptionally excellent and have once again exceeded expectations in this upward trend.
Her playing style and her team have hardly changed since her return to the top teams, but Holt deserves much praise for the way he has rocked the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great, leading a well-organized defense, while Menga Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall kept the ball rolling throughout the game.
But the Rangers lacked inspiration.
As good as they were at times under Gerrard, they could not reach that standard.
Their last ball was inadequate  they only managed to penetrate the home team once , and that's kind of a wake-up call for the Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan received mixed reactions in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29), smiles and blue skies were the scene as the heads of government of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which was intended to repair relations between NATO allies.
There had been disputes over issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Afterwards, Erdogan traveled to Cologne to open a large new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police cited security reasons for preventing a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering outside the mosque, but many supporters were in the vicinity to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - many of them Kurds - also made their voices heard, condemning Erdogan's policies as well as the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
The opposing protests reflect the polarizing effect of the Visitor, who is hailed as a hero by some German Turks and despised by others as an autocrat.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist killed in collision with car
A cyclist was killed in a car crash in London.
The collision occurred at approximately 10:15 am British time near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford in the south-east of the city.
The driver of the car stopped, and paramedics took care of the man, who died at the scene.
Months before the accident, another cyclist had been killed in a hit-and-run accident on Childers Street, about a mile (1.6 km) from Saturday's accident.
According to the Metropolitan Police, officers were working to identify the man and notify his next of kin.
Roadblocks and bus routes have been set up, and motorists have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in riots
According to the Prison Office, six prison officers were injured in a riot at a maximum security men's prison.
The riots began at around 9:30am British Summer Time on Sunday at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire and are still ongoing.
Specialist Tornado officials have been called in to put an end to the riots involving eight inmates confined to one wing.
The officers were treated on the spot for minor facial injuries.
A Prison Service spokesman said: "Specially trained prison staff have been deployed to resolve an ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and would like to make it clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and may spend longer behind bars.
HMP Long Lartin houses over 500 convicts, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the warden was being treated in hospital after being attacked by a convict.
In October last year, emergency officials were called to the prison to deal with a major riot in which staff were attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with flash flooding (drought areas may benefit)
It's rare for a tropical depression to reach Arizona, but that's what's likely to happen early next week as the remnants of Hurricane Rosa move across the desert-ridden southwest, bringing the risk of tidal flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flash flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada and southeastern California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to approach Monday night with rain and move directly over Phoenix on Tuesday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix tweeted that since 1950 only 10 tropical cyclones as a tropical storm or tropical depression have come within 200 miles of Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border.
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 centimeters of rainfall, with occasional up to 15 centimeters in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
In other areas of the deserted Southwest, including the Central Rockies and the Great Basin, 2.5 to 5 centimeters are likely and occasionally up to 10 centimeters in total.
For those who are not at risk of flash floods, the rainfall associated with pink can be a blessing because of the drought in the region.
Although flooding is a major concern, some of this rain is likely to be useful, since the southwest is currently experiencing drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, more than 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought, the second-highest category, weather.com reported.
First, the path of the hurricane means that Rosa will make landfall on the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday morning, Rosa will be at hurricane strength with maximum sustained winds of 136 miles per hour, located 620 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and then moving north at 19 miles per hour.
In the Pacific, the storm will encounter colder waters and weaken.
Rosa is expected to make landfall in Mexico on Monday afternoon or evening with the strength of a tropical storm.
Rainfall in parts of Mexico may be heavy, creating a significant risk of flooding.
From Baja California to the northwest Sonoran Desert, rainfall totals of 7.5 to 15 centimeters are expected, with up to 25 centimeters possible, weather.com reported.
Then Rosa will move northward over Mexico as a tropical storm, reach the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, and then move up through Arizona into southern Utah by late Tuesday evening.
"The main threat posed by Rosa or its remnants is expected to be very heavy rainfall in Baja California, the northwest Sonoran Desert and the deserts of the southwest", the National Hurricane Center said.
As a result of these precipitations, life-threatening floods and debris flooding in the desert and landslides in mountainous areas are expected.
Midsomer Norton attack: four arrested for attempted murder
Following the discovery of a 16-year-old with stab wounds in Somerset, three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder.
The teenager was found wounded at around 4:00 p.m. British Summer Time on Saturday in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton.
He was taken to a hospital and his condition is stable.
According to Avon and Somerset Police, a 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area.
Officials are asking anyone with a recording of the incident on a cell phone to come forward.
Trump said Kavanaugh suffered from the meanness, the wrath of the Democrats.
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democrats", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh suffered the "meanness" and "the wrath" of the Democrats throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, rejecting the allegation made by Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were both teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing to support her accusation.
The president said Saturday that the American people saw Kavanaugh's brilliance, quality and courage that day.
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for one of the most experienced legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an outstanding record of public service", he told his crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The President was referring indirectly to Kavanaugh's nomination when he was talking about the importance of Republican voter turnout in the midterm elections.
Five weeks before one of the most important elections of our lives.
I am not going to sign, but I am actually going to sign, he said.
That's why I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere.
Trump argued that the Democrats saw their mission as "resisting and blocking".
The first major procedural vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place in the Senate no later than Friday, a senior GOP official told CNN.
Hundreds killed in earthquake in Indonesia, casualty numbers rise
At least 384 people were killed, according to authorities on Saturday, many of them drowned when a powerful earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi sent huge waves washing ashore.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach party in the city of Palu on Friday when, as darkness fell, waves as high as six meters hit the beach, killing many people and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami was preceded by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat came yesterday, people were still on the beach doing their activities and didn't run away immediately, and they fell victim to it", Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's disaster management agency BNPB, told a conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come alone, it flooded cars, tree trunks and houses, it hit everything on land", Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had traveled at a speed of 800 km/h across the open sea before hitting the coast.
Some people had climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
Some 16,700 people were evacuated and housed in 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the National Disaster Management Agency showed numerous destroyed buildings and businesses, crooked and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal city was rocked by further aftershocks.
The earthquake series was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's BPPT (Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology) said in a statement that the energy released in Friday's massive quake was 200 times the energy of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The city's location at the end of a long, narrow bay could have caused the tsunami to become larger, the agency said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
He said bodies of some victims were found in the rubble of collapsed buildings, 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the number of casualties and damage could be higher along the coast 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the quake.
Communication with Donggala was completely paralyzed, according to Nugroho, and there was no information.
According to a statement by the Red Cross, more than 300,000 people live there, and its staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse", the statement said.
On Saturday, the authority was widely criticized for failing to report that a tsunami had hit Palu, even though the waves were arriving at the time of the warning, according to official data.
Amateur footage posted on social media shows a man on the top floor of a building desperately screaming to warn people on the street below him of the approaching tsunami.
Within minutes, a wall of water breaks up on the shore, flooding buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to immediately verify the authenticity of the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a massive power outage that disrupted communications around Palu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
According to the authorities, the military has begun sending cargo planes with support from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuees still need food and other essentials urgently.
The city's airport remains closed until October and has only been reopened for relief operations.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The number of tsunami victims has risen to more than 800.
The situation is very bad.
World Vision employees from Donggala reached Palu City safely, where the employees are housed in tented shelters in the courtyard of their office, but Dosebas said they passed scenes of devastation on the way.
"They told me they saw many destroyed houses", he said.
The situation is very bad.
Even as the aid groups began the arduous task of getting disaster relief started, some complained that skilled foreign aid workers were being prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian law, financial aid, supplies and personnel from abroad are only allowed after the site of an accident has been declared a national disaster area.
That has not happened yet.
"At the moment, it is still a provincial disaster", said Aulia Arriani, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"As soon as the government says, 'OK, this is a national disaster,' we can accept international support, but that status is not valid yet".
As the second night since Friday's earthquake and tsunami descended over Palu, friends and family members of those still missing were hoping for one of the miracles that would shed some light on the sad stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled from a sewer.
On Sunday, rescue workers rescued a woman who had been trapped for two days under debris next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others who were imprisoned at the Roa-Roa Hotel, Mandagi added, were his students.
"As a senior in paragliding, I have my own emotional burden to carry", he said.
Gendon told how in the hours after the news of the Roa-Roa hotel collapse circulated under the paragliders, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the Palu contestants who were attending the beach party.
But instead of blue ticks, his messages were grey question marks.
"I think that means the messages were not delivered", he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 while refilling an ATM in Newport on the Levee
According to a press release from Newport Police, a Brink's employee was robbed of $26,750 by thieves in Newport on the Levee Friday morning while filling an ATM.
The driver of the vehicle had emptied an ATM at the entertainment complex and wanted to spend more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press release.
While he was busy, a man ran in behind the Brink's employee and stole a bag full of money intended for the vending machine.
According to the press release, witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but police did not say how many people were involved in the incident.
Anyone with information regarding the identity of the suspects is requested to contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
Announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: The being formally known as Kanye West.
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for some time and has used it as the title of his eighth album released in June.
The change comes ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where the release of his new album Yandhi is expected.
He appears on the show as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, who according to the producer canceled for "emotional reasons".
The word is not only an abbreviation of his current professional name, but it has a religious meaning for West, according to his own statement.
"I think ye is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means you", West said this year in an interview about his album with radio host Big Boy.
So I'm you, I'm us, it is us.
From Kanye, which means "the one", it became just "Ye" just a reflection of our good, our bad, our confused, of everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.
He's one of several famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but announced this year that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
Jay-Z, who West used to work with, has spelled his name in and out of parentheses and uppercase.
Mexico's AMLO vows not to use the military against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador vowed never to use military force against the civilian population as the 50th anniversary of the bloody repression against students in his country approaches.
Lopez Obrador pledged Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he will "never use the military to oppress the Mexican people".
On October 2, 1968, soldiers opened fire on a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing 300 people, at a time when leftist student movements were taking hold throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly student aid and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of training opportunities led young people into criminal gangs.
US should double funding for artificial intelligence
Given China's increased activity in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double its spending on research in this area, says AI investor and practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments follow AI announcements from various parts of the US government, even though the US generally lacks a formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China unveiled its plan last year: the country aims to become the number one in AI innovation by 2030.
"Doubling the AI research budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are so far behind the US. We are looking for the next AI breakthrough", Lee said.
Doubling funding could double the chances of the next big AI success in the U.S., Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's most prominent AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an AI system that beat the highest-ranked American Othello player, and later became a senior executive at Microsoft Research and president of Google's China office.
Lee praised previous U.S. government technology competitions such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's (DARPA) Robotics Challenge and asked when the next competition would be, as he wanted to help identify the next visionaries.
Lee says that researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get government subsidies.
"China is not taking away the academic elite, it is taking away the enterprise", Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have been hiring university craftsmen to work on AI in recent years.
Lee also believes that a change in U.S. immigration policy could be beneficial to U.S. AI efforts.
"I think people with PhDs in AI should be automatically offered green cards", he said.
In July 2017, the State Council of China presented its plan for the development of the next generation of AI technologies (Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan).
Lee said the National Natural Science Foundation of China funds individuals at academic institutions similar to the way the National Science Foundation and other government organizations give funds to US researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which is designed to involve partners from industry and science, and the White House announced the formation of a special committee on artificial intelligence.
Also this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in the AI Next initiative.
The National Science Foundation (NSF) is currently investing more than $100 million annually in AI research.
Meanwhile, US legislation regarding the formation of the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has been stalled for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on changing the country's name
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday to change the country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia, a move that would settle a decades-old dispute with Greece that had blocked Macedonia's bids for European Union and NATO membership.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbour means that it claims Greek territory, and therefore has vetoed Macedonia's admission to NATO and the EU.
The two governments concluded an agreement in June on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority population.
President Gyorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and a boycott campaign has cast doubt on whether the turnout will reach the 50 percent required for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the ballot was: Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership by adopting the agreement with Greece?
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the break-up of Yugoslavia, membership in organizations like the EU and NATO is worth the price.
'I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us', said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the vote is not legally binding, enough Members have said they would stick to the result to make it decisive.
The name change would require a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The state election commission said there were no reports of irregularities until 1 p.m.
However, turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters cast their votes.
"I am here to vote for my children, our place is in Europe", said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko cast their votes in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018 in a referendum on changing the country's name, which would pave the way for Macedonia to join NATO and the European Union.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, set up a small stage and placed chairs in front of tents set up by people who wanted to boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads held high, not through the back door", Kavadarkov said.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of the integration between Europe and Asia.
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, where unemployment is more than 20 percent.
"I think a large majority will be in favour, as more than 80 percent of our citizens are for the EU and NATO", Zaev said after casting his vote.
He said a "yes" vote would be a "confirmation of our future".
According to a poll published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research, between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum, which is below the required turnout.
Another poll conducted by Macedonian TV station Telma TV found that 57 percent of those polled plan to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent said they would vote "yes".
For the referendum to be successful, the turnout must be 50 percent plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the policies of the pro-Western government since it took power in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero maneuvers through the whole Brighton defence to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling defeated Brighton's defence in a 2-0 win over Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester on Saturday.
Aguero made his shot look ridiculously simple in the 65th minute.
The Argentine forward was given a pass in midfield at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran between three Brighton defenders and then ran into the open field.
Aguero saw himself surrounded by four green jerseys.
He played around a defender and then overtook several other defenders on the edge of Brighton's penalty area.
He then fired a pass to Sterling's left.
The English striker used his first contact with the ball in the penalty area to play the ball back to Aguero, who with his right shoe overtook Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan and shot into the right side of the net.
Aguero is struggling with problems in his feet, City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We talked about him playing for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at that moment.
However, it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League duel.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball on that move far on Brighton's side.
He shot a good steep pass along the left flank to Leroy Sané.
Sané needed a few moves to steer Sterling to the long corner.
The Sky Blues forward aimed the ball into the net just before he slipped into the outfield.
City play in the Champions League group stage on Tuesday at 12:55 at the Rhein-Neckar Arena in Sinsheim against Hoffenheim.
Scherzer wants to ruin the Rockies game.
With the Nationals out of playoff contention, there was little reason to force another bet.
The always-powerful prankster, however, hopes to face the Colorado Rockies on the hill on Sunday, but only if it's relevant to the Rockies, who are one game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West, for the playoffs.
The Rockies scored at least a wild card with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but they're still looking to secure their first division title.
Even though we're not playing for anything, we can at least throw, because we know the atmosphere in the crowd here in Denver and the other team would probably play at the highest level that I would face this year.
Why should I not want to participate in this competition?
The Nationals have yet to announce a starter for Sunday, but are reportedly inclined to let jokers throw in a situation like this.
Scherzer, for whom this would be his 34th start, was training in the bullpen on Thursday and would throw on his normal day off on Sunday.
The Washington right-hander has a record of 18-7, an ERA of 2.53, and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump holds rally in West Virginia
The President was referring indirectly to the situation in connection with his choice for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, when he spoke about the importance of Republican voter turnout in the midterm elections.
Everything we've done is at stake in November.
Five weeks before one of the most important elections of our lives.
This is one of the big, big ones. I'm not running, but I'm actually running, so I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere", he said.
Trump went on, "You see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they're determined to take back power by any means, you see the meanness, the abomination.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control, we're not going to give it to them.
The Democrats, he said, saw their mission as "resisting and blocking".
"And you've seen it over the last four days", he said, calling the Democrats "angry and mean and abhorrent and dishonest".
He named the highest-ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator Dianne Feinstein, prompting loud cheers from the audience.
Do you remember her answer?
Did you get the document out?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh, no, I'll wait a minute. That was really bad body language.
Labour no longer allows all opinions to be accepted.
The party is intolerant of those who speak their minds.
When the Momentum activists in my local party voted to blame me, it came as little surprise.
I am the last of a series of Labour MPs who are told they are not welcome just because we are speaking our minds.
My colleague Joan Ryan, who had been a strong voice against anti-Semitism, was treated in a similar way.
In my case, I was criticized with the indictment for expressing a different opinion than Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically on similar issues, on which Jeremy disagreed with former top politicians.
The announcement of the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday said that 'the meetings should be inclusive and productive'.
Most of the Friday night GC meetings in my eight years as a local Labour MP were just that.
Unfortunately, most meetings today are not held in that tone, and the promised "friendlier, more cautious" policies have long since been forgotten, if they ever started.
It is becoming increasingly clear that dissenting views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that any opinion is judged by whether it is accepted by the party leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became party leader, and colleagues with whom I had previously thought I shared similar political views now expected me to turn around and take positions I would never have agreed with otherwise, whether on national security or the European single market.
Whenever I speak in public  no matter what I say , a rumour on social media follows calling for my removal, denouncing the political centre and saying that I should not be a member of the Labour Party.
And with that experience, I'm not alone.
In fact, I know I'm doing better than some of my colleagues, because the comments I get are mostly political in nature.
I admire the professionalism and determination of the colleagues who face a flood of sexist or racist insults every day and never give in.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political age is that abuse has become the norm.
Jeremy Corbyn last week called for the Labour Party to promote a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we no longer accept all opinions, and with every motion of censure and every change in the electoral rules, the party becomes more narrow.
I have been advised many times over the last two years to keep my head down and not express my opinion so clearly.
But that's not why I got into politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student, driven by the neglect of the Thatcher government, which literally broke up my classroom in the comprehensive school, I have fought for better public services for those who need them most, as a councillor as well as a cabinet minister.
I never made a hole in my political views, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could be in any way unaware of my political positions and of areas where I disagree with the current leadership.
I would just like to say to the supporters of Friday's motion that, given the fact that the country is rushing towards a Brexit that will hurt households, businesses and our public service, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leadership of the Labour Party.
But in fact, I am not sending this message to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether they are Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no more electoral threats or political expediency will stop me from acting in what I believe is the best interests of all of you.

Ayr vs Melrose 38:17: Undefeated Ayr team is on the rise
Two late attempts may have skewed the final score a bit, but there's no doubt that Ayr deserved the win in this extremely entertaining game of the day in Tennent's Premiership.
They are now the only team out of ten to remain undefeated at the top of the table.
In the end, the home team's success was due to their superior defense as well as their better use of opportunities, and coach Peter Murchie had every reason to be pleased.
"We have been tested in our games so far, and we are still unbeaten, so I must be happy", he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "Acknowledgement for Ayr, they've taken their chances better than we have".
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute attempt, which was increased by Frazier Climo, put Ayr in the lead, but Melrose was able to make the numbers speak due to a yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who had been released by the Warriors for the game, and Jason Baggot caught an un-increased attempt.
Climo extended Ayr's lead with a penalty, before scoring a goal directly at half-time and then scoring an increased try in the solo, making it 17-5 for Ayr at half-time.
Melrose started the second half well, however, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, increased by Baggot, reduced the gap to five points.
After a long break due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was carried off the field, Ayr extended their lead with a Climo-enhanced attempt by Stafford McDowall.
Then Ayr captain Blair Macpherson was given a yellow card, and again at the end of a period of enormous pressure, Melrose had the extra man paid by an un-increased attempt by Bruce Colvine.
However, the home team came back, and when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card for tackling without a ball against Climo, MacPherson scored from the penalty spot behind the advancing Ayr Pack.
Climo increased as he had almost since the break, after Kyle Rowe intercepted David Armstrong's box kick and sent out winger Gregor Henry for the home team's fifth attempt.
Still Game star seems ready for a new career in the food industry
"Still Game" star Ford Kieran appears poised to make a move into the hospitality industry after it emerged he was named as the CEO of a licensed restaurant business.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, for which he is writing the script and in which he plays one of the main roles alongside his long-time comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The two have announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the show's last, and Kiernan seems to be planning a life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he's the managing director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a source in the Scottish Sun suggested Kiernan was interested in getting into Glasgow's "flourishing restaurant business".
The sea is ours: landlocked Bolivia hopes a court will open its way to the Pacific
Sailors patrol the cobblestone naval headquarters in La Paz.
A blue flag is flying at public buildings.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, naval bases carry the slogan: "The sea is our rightful property".
To win it back is a duty.
All over landlocked Bolivia, the memory of the 19th-century Chilean coastline lost in a bloody resource conflict is as vivid as the desire to cross the Pacific again.
These hopes may not be as strong as they have been for decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling from the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and calm and is naturally expecting the outcome with a positive attitude", said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians across the country will be watching the IEC ruling on large screens, hoping that the Hague court will rule in favor of Bolivia's demand, which, after decades of sporadic talks, commits Chile to negotiating Bolivia's sovereign access to the sea.
For Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president, who faces a controversial re-election battle next year, the verdict on Monday also has a lot at stake.
"We are about to return to the Pacific", he promised at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe it is unlikely that the court will rule in favor of Bolivia, and believe that this will change little.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no authority to allocate Chilean territory and has determined that it will not decide on the outcome of any talks.
The fact that the ECJ's judgment was delivered six months after the closing arguments, according to Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law, suggests that the case was 'not complicated'.
Far from supporting Bolivia's case, the last four years could also be a setback.
"The current Bolivian government has taken the issue of access to the sea", said Zárate.
She suggested that Morales' belligerent rhetoric had stifled any remaining goodwill in Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will at some point resume their talks, but after these events it will be extremely difficult.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the view that the court's decision had been unusually swift.
On Monday, Bolivia will have an exceptional opportunity to usher in a new era of relations with Chile and a chance to end 139 years of disputes to their mutual advantage, he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales  still one of Latin America's most popular presidents  uses the issue of the sea as a political crutch.
"Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific", he added.
The verdict is a chance to realize that we have to overcome the past.
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will only happen if it can trust the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never disarm its nuclear weapons first if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke before the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to put into action the promises made during a summit between the heads of the rival states in Singapore.
His comments come at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears on the verge of resuming stalled nuclear diplomacy more than three months after his summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Singapore.
Ri called the idea that further sanctions and US resistance to a declaration to end the Korean War would ever bring the North to its knees a "brain drain".
Washington is skeptical and does not want to agree to the declaration without Pyongyang first taking substantial disarmament steps.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about giving up an arsenal that it probably sees as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo is planning a visit to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion show showcases the latest collections of giant headgear, which will soon be available in shopping streets near you
If you want to expand your hat collection or completely shield the sun, you don't have to look any further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne showed off a range of crazy oversized headwear for their 2019 summer collection, which captivated the fashion world at Paris Fashion Week.
Highly impractical hats flooded Instagram this summer, and these designers sent their spectacular creations across the aisle.
Valentino's most outstanding piece was an extravagant beige hat with a feathery wide rim that almost crushed the heads of the models.
Other oversized accessories included jewelled watermelons, a magician's hat, and even a pineapple, but these are not meant to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also unveiled a series of bizarre masks just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks were sewn on lips and more like Hannibal Lecter than Haute Couture.
One creature resembled diving gear, including snorkels and diving goggles, while another looked like a molten ice pack.
And if you want to put another huge fashion statement, you're in luck.
Fashion watchers predict that the giant headgear could find its way into shopping streets near you.
The oversized hats follow directly on from La Bomba, the 60-centimeter-wide straw hat that everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski wears.
The iconic label behind the extremely impractical hat, which made huge waves on social media, sent another great creation across the aisle: a straw beach bag, almost as big as the model wearing a bathing suit that held the bag.
The red orange bust bag with bust fringe and a white leather ankle was the standout piece of Jacquemus' summer-2019 collection La Riviera at the Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect large hats and beach bags to be available on the shopping streets next summer.The designer has generated such a stir that the demand for oversized accessories will be hard to ignore".
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Scotland's independent schools continue to be distinguished by academic excellence, which continued in 2018 with further outstanding examination results, and is only further underpinned by individual and joint successes in sport, the arts, music and other community initiatives.
With over 30,000 pupils from all over Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the highest possible level of care for their pupils and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their pupils for further and higher education, the profession of their choice and their place as global citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a tailored curriculum, we see that modern languages are still popular and sought after as electives in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to someone in a language they understand, you reach their head".
If you speak to him in his own language, you will reach his heart.
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely on English alone when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
The current results of this year show that languages with the highest pass rates are at the top of the rankings of independent schools.
A total of 68 per cent of pupils who studied foreign languages scored A on the higher examinations.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of students in Mandarin scored A's in the higher examinations, while 72 percent of students learning German, 69 percent of students learning French, and 63 percent of students learning Spanish also scored A's.
This illustrates that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as an important skill which children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now considered as electives as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curricula of independent schools and elsewhere.
According to a 2014 survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills, 17 per cent of the reasons employers cited for problems filling vacancies were related to a lack of language skills.
Language skills are therefore becoming increasingly essential in preparing young people for their future careers.
As more and more job openings require languages, this knowledge is essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the profession chosen, young people who have learned a second language will have a real advantage in the future from such a lifelong skill.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically give multilinguals an edge over competitors.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage (15 percent).
That's why it's important for today's children that we invest now in language teaching.
Children who speak several languages, especially languages from developing countries, will have a better chance of finding meaningful employment.
In Scotland, all schools teach different languages.
A number of schools will focus on the more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages considered to be the most important for the UK in the 2020 perspective, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Wherever your child's interests lie, independent schools will always have a range of languages with a suitable range of specialised teachers.
Scottish independent schools are committed to creating a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to succeed, whatever the future may hold.
At this point in a global economic environment, it cannot be denied that languages are still of fundamental importance for the future of the country.
In fact, modern languages should be considered as international communication capability.
Independent schools will continue to offer young people in Scotland this choice, diversity and excellence.
It's got to be fair.
John Edward is the head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron before his Lakers debut Sunday in San Diego .
For fans who want to see LeBron James make his debut for the Los Angeles Lakers, the wait is over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in the opening preseason game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday.
However, it is not yet clear how many minutes he will play.
"It's going to be more than one and less than 48", Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James will probably only play a few minutes.
Earlier this week, James was asked after practice about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
"I don't need pre-season games to prepare myself at this stage of my career", he said.
Time for Trump rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting a series of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of five rallies Trump is planning for next week, including in his well-liked locations like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the pending vote to confirm his election to the Supreme Court vacancy, Trump is looking to build support for the upcoming November midterm elections as Republicans risk losing control of Congress.
When is Trump's rally in West Virginia tonight, and how can you watch it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 7:00 p.m. Eastern Time.
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia live on YouTube below.
Trump is likely to address the hearings of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh on sexual misconduct allegations, which were held in tense atmosphere this week, with the expected Senate confirmation vote pending for a week while the FBI conducts investigations.
But the main goal of this series of rallies is to support Republicans facing a difficult November election.
That's why President Trump's campaign told Reuters that these five rallies next week are to "mobilize volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to maintain and expand their majority in the Senate and House".
"Control of Congress is so important to his plans that the president will travel to as many states as possible as the busy election season approaches", a Trump campaign spokesman, who declined to be named, told Reuters.
According to West Virginia Metro News, the rally scheduled for tonight at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could be attended by supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, with media coverage from Pittsburgh.
Saturday's visit is Trump's second visit this month to West Virginia, the state he won in 2016 by more than 40 percent.
Trump is trying to support the Republican Senate nominee from West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who is falling behind in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrissey that the president has to come in to try to give him a boost in the polls", said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows up to fight to keep the hope alive for Sunday's singles
After three one-sided rounds, the four-a-side game on Saturday afternoon may have been just what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging pendulum of momentum is a pure invention as a sporting concept, but one that players really believe in, especially in competitions like this.
So where do you think the momentum is now?
"They were ahead by six points, and now it's four, so I think that's a little bit of momentum for us", Jordan Spieth said as he left the field.
Europe is of course in the lead, four points ahead, with 12 more to follow.
However, Spieth said the Americans were feeling a bit of wind in their sails and had reason to feel encouraged, not least by the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each managed to score three points out of four.
Spieth was incredibly strong from the start to the green and is leading by example.
The guttural cries of enthusiasm grew louder as his round progressed as he sank an important putt to decide the fourth match by four points for both of them after he and Thomas had been two-pointers behind after two holes.
His bitch, who decided the match for them on the 15th hole, made a similar scream, suggesting that the American team is not out of the game yet.
"I really have to get down on my knees and take care of my own game", said Spieth.
That's all that's left for each player.
18 holes to make a mark.
Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood are the only players to score more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days, and thus, without a doubt, write the history of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's unequal but sympathetic duo is at four points out of four and can do no wrong.
Mollywood was not the only couple who had not hit a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they had also avoided bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes on Friday morning.
This series and the seeming energy flowing between them and the crowd that is being left out, confirms that they are the players to beat on Sunday, Fleetwood and Molinari would be the most popular players to seal a possible European victory at sunset over Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
But it would be premature to speak of European fame.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson had a brief trial with Sergio Garcia, the Four Heroes of the Morning, who played alongside Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the front nine holes put the Spaniard and the Swede in a bind they could not overcome nearly.
But on Sunday, no one can help them out of their predicament.
The fours and fours are fascinating to look at up close because of the interactions between the couples, the advice they give and don't give, and the way a strategy can change in the blink of an eye.
The Europeans have played better as a team so far and are clearly in the lead on the final day, but this round of four has also shown that the US team is ready to fight, something that some, especially in the US, had doubted.
Europe leads 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe is ahead of the U.S. 10-6 after Saturday's fours and fours and is headed into the final day of the Ryder Cup with a solid lead.
The brilliant playing duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari went on to win two victories over the struggling Tiger Woods, earning four points at Le Golf National.
The European team, led by Thomas Bjørn, who are looking to win back the trophy lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the morning's fours against the flawed American team, winning the series 3-1.
In the four-match series, the USA put up more resistance and won two matches, but could not catch up.
Jim Furyck's team needed eight points in the 12 singles matches played on Sunday to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood became the first European rookie to win four consecutive points, while he and Molinari, who were named after a sensational weekend, became only the second duo in Ryder Cup history to win four points in their four opening matches.
After beating Woods and Patrick Reed in the fours, they harmonized brilliantly, beating the disillusioned Woods and the American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with an even more emphatic 5&4.
Woods, who had dragged himself through two matches on Saturday, let his brilliance flash on occasion, but now has lost 19 of his 29 matches in fours and fours and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who had rested during the morning fours, returned and played the fours as Henrik Stenson's partner, winning 2&1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the world's number one and number three.
But for Europe, not everything went as planned on that pleasant windy day southwest of Paris.
Three-time major winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the American record with two points on Saturday.
They scored a tough 2-1 win over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fours, beating Poulter and Rory McIlroy in the fours 4-3 after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team come back from a four-point deficit to win the singles title, but Furyck's team is tied for the title.
After two days of being only second, it doesn't look like they'll be able to launch a counter-attack on Sunday.
North Korea rejects unilateral disarmament without confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions deepened its mistrust of the United States and that under these circumstances the country would not unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told the UN's annual general assembly that North Korea had taken "significant measures" last year in good faith, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site and pledging not to proliferate nuclear weapons and technologies.
"We do not see a corresponding reaction from the US", he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, there is no confidence in our national security, and under these circumstances, we will not unilaterally disarm first".
While Ri repeated familiar North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phased" approach to denuclearization, in which North Korea would be rewarded for successive steps, his statement seemed significant in that it did not reject unilateral denuclearization from the outset, as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first summit between a sitting US president and a North Korean leader on June 12 in Singapore, in which Kim had promised to work towards the "denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula", while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea is seeking an official end to the 1950-53 Korean War, while the United States has said Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
In addition, Washington is resisting calls for an easing of the severe international sanctions against North Korea.
"The US insists on denuclearization first and is increasing pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal through force, and is even against declaring the end of the war", Ri said.
The idea that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a brainchild of people who know nothing about us.
The problem is that the continued sanctions are deepening our suspicions.
Ri did not discuss plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US head of state had highlighted at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister pointed to three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months, adding: 'If South Korea had been the other party to the denuclearization issue, instead of the US, this stalemate would not have been reached in the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.'
Yet the tone of Ri's speech was vastly different from his speech last year when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to target the US mainland with North Korean missiles after the evil President Trump called Kim a "missile man" on a suicide mission.
This year, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim at the United Nations for his courage in taking disarmament steps, but said there was still much work to be done and sanctions would have to remain in place until North Korea denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time frame for this: "Whether it takes two years, three years or five months doesn't matter".
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps it has taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The enforcement of the Security Council's sanctions must in any case be vigorously continued until we achieve complete, final and verified denuclearization".
The Security Council has unanimously tightened sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to financially dry up Pyongyang's nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was unsuccessful.
In July, on leaving Pyongyang, he said progress had been made, only to be accused by North Korea hours later of making "gang-like" demands.
North Korea promised at a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a missile base and a nuclear complex if the United States took "appropriate action".
He said Kim told him that the "appropriate measures" he was seeking were security guarantees Trump had given in Singapore, as well as steps to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn in a course to get enough sleep
A new course at Harvard University is making sure all undergraduates get more sleep this year, a measure against the growing machismo culture of staying awake with caffeine and studying all night.
One scientist has found that students at the world's leading university often lack self-care.
The course was designed by Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, and he believes it is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a talk about the effects of sleep deprivation on learning.
"At the end, a girl came to me and asked, 'Why am I only learning about this now, in my last year?'
"I was surprised", he told The Telegraph.
This year's first course taught students how the basics of good sleep contribute to academic and athletic performance and to overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after noticing that students were suffering from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section, students see a picture of a room in a residential home and click on coffee cups, curtains, exercise shoes and books, which provide information on the effects of caffeine and light, the effects of sleep deprivation on athletic performance and the importance of a sleep routine.
In another section, participants learn that long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, and cancer.
Then, with the help of a map of the university campus, which includes interactive symbols, they are encouraged to reflect on their daily routine.
We know it's not going to change student behavior immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know this  just as you have a right to know how your choice to smoke affects your health, Professor Czeisler added.
Pride in "sending night shifts" is still prevalent, he said, adding that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students are making sleep deprivation a growing problem.
Ensuring adequate sleep should be the "secret weapon" of all students against stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said, and weight gain can be avoided, since sleep deprivation puts the brain in hunger mode, causing them to be hungry all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student studying chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, having taken one of his courses last year in his first year at Harvard.
He said the course had opened his eyes and motivated him to push for a university-wide course.
He hopes that in the next step all postgraduate students will be encouraged to complete a similar programme of study before they start their studies at the competitive university.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students set up a wake-up and bedtime alarm and be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can disturb circadian rhythms and lead to problems falling asleep.
Livingston against Rangers 1:0 Menga-Gor defeats Gerrard's players
The Rangers lost another away game, when Dolly Menga's hit for Steven Gerrard's disagreeing team meant a 0-1 loss to Livingston.
Ibrox were looking to record their first away win since the 4-1 triumph at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's side added Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager, leaving his side eight points behind Ladbroke's Premiership-leading Hearts.
Menga hit seven minutes before halftime, and the inspiring Rangers didn't seem to have a chance to make up.
While the Rangers are now down to sixth, Livingston is up to third, just behind Hibernian in goal difference.
The Rangers are also in for more trouble after linebacker Calum Spence was treated for a head injury sustained by an apparent object thrown from the guest block.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that overtook Ayr to reach the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, stayed with the same 11 Livingston players who took the Hearts one point off last week and should be thrilled with how his well-trained team kept their opponents under pressure step by step.
The Rangers dominated possession, but Livingston achieved more when they had the ball.
They should have scored a goal after just two minutes, when Menga's first pass led Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder missed his chance and missed.
Then a long free kick from Keaghan Jacobs reached Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could only shoot past the rear post.
The Rangers took control, but their play in the last third seemed more hopeful than convincing.
Alfredo Morelos apparently felt that he should have been given a penalty kick after a 15 minute clash between him and Steven Lawless, but referee Steven Thomson dismissed the Colombian's complaints.
The Rangers only managed two goals in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly had little difficulty with Lassana Coulibaly's headball and a tame shot from Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livingston's shot in the 34th minute may not have been in keeping with the game, there's no denying that they deserved it for their hard work alone.
Again, the Rangers couldn't handle a long shot by Jacobs in a standard situation.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher threw the ball to Scott Robinson, who held his breath and selected Menga for an easy finish.
Gerrard acted at half-time and traded Coulibaly for Ryan Kent, the switch having an almost immediate effect when winger Morelos put him in position, but the impressive Kelly rushed from his line to block the ball.
Livingston, however, continued to get the guests to play exactly the game they deserved, with Lithgow and Halkett receiving a long ball one after the other.
Holt's team could have extended their lead in the final period, but McGregor held on well and defended Jacobs before Lithgow shot a head ball past the corner.
Rangers replacement Glenn Middleton also called a late penalty after a run-in with Jacobs, but Thomson looked away again.
Almanac: The Inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our Sunday Morning calendar: On September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm Hans Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as the Geiger counter.
The Geiger counter, which has since become a standard element of science, has also become a standard element of pop culture, for example in the 1950 film Bells of Coronado with the seemingly unusual cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
What the hell is that?
Rogers: This is a Geiger counter used to look for radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can hear the effects of radioactive radiation in the minerals.
I hear a crack!
Hans Viiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New cancer vaccine may teach the immune system to see degenerate cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" and "defeat" degenerate cells.
The vaccine helps the immune system to detect degenerated cells as part of the treatment.
The method involves taking immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory.
These cells can see a protein common to many cancers and then be injected again.
A test vaccine is showing promising results in patients with various cancers.
The ovarian cancer of a woman who was treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to detect degenerate cells disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method involves taking immune cells from a patient, modifying them in the laboratory to allow them to see the protein HER2 , common to many cancers, and then injecting the cells again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine".
HER2 promotes the growth of various types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancer, as Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar method, in which immune cells are harvested from patients and trained to attack cancer cells, has helped in treating a type of leukemia.
Kanye West released a pro-Trump rant after his appearance on SNL, wearing a MAGA cap (Make America Great Again).
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was booed in the studio on Saturday Night Live after he lavished praise on US President Donald Trump and said he wanted to run for president in 2020.
After singing his third song of the evening, "Ghost Town", wearing a Make America Great Again cap, he continued with a scathing cannonade against the Democrats, reiterating his support for Trump.
I'm often asked by white people, "How can you like Trump? He's a racist".
So, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago, he said.
SNL began the show with a sketch with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on allegations of sexual harassment raised by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although the recording of West's rant was not aired, it was uploaded on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was making fun of West's publication.
West also complained to the audience that he had trouble behind the scenes because of his head covering.
You were harassing me behind the scenes.
You said, "Don't go out with the hat on".
You've been harassing me!
And then they say I'm in a sunken area, he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see the sunken area?" He said he was going to put on my Supermancape, because that means you can't tell me what to do.
Try it with love.
His remarks prompted at least two public outcryes, and SNL staffers appeared embarrassed, Variety reported.
West had been hired late as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West confused many with a talk titled "I Love It" in which he was dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West was supported by Candace Turner, the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest minds: THANK YOU for BEING THE OPPOSITE OF THE MASS".
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was just himself and that was absolutely wonderful.
But I do NOT want to reward someone who embraces and gives of himself to an ideology that I think is harmful to my community (by buying his music or his clothes or supporting his art).
He's free to go.
The same is true for us", she added.
Before the show, the rapper had announced on Twitter that he had changed his name to The being formally known as Kanye West.
He is not the first artist to change his name, following in the footsteps of Diddy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His fellow rapper Snoop Dogg was named Snoop Lion, and of course Prince, the late music legend, changed his name to a symbol and then to The Artist Formerly Known As Prince.
Charged with attempted murder in connection with stabbing at Belfast restaurant.
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed at a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident occurred in Ballyhackamore, according to police.
The defendant is to appear before the Belfast Arbitration Court on Monday.
The charges are being reviewed by the prosecution.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington is attacking toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for his role as sword-wielding Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
However, the 31-year-old actor has attacked the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that such roles on screen often make boys feel they have to be strong to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Harington said he believed something had gone wrong and asked how to solve the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Harington, who recently married Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, 31, admitted that he was "very concerned" about solving the problem.
"I personally find the question of what went wrong with masculinity very important at the moment", he said.
What have we taught young men about the problem we are now seeing?
Harington believes that television, due to its very masculine characters, may be partly responsible for the increasing toxic masculinity.
He continued: "What is innate, and what is learned?
What is taught on television and on the street that makes boys feel that they have to embody that particular side of a man?
I think that's really one of the big questions of our time: How do we change this?
Because something has clearly gone wrong with the young men.
He also admitted in the interview that he will not be participating in prequels or sequels of Game of Thrones after the series ends next summer.
Starting in November, Harington will appear in a new edition of Sam Shepard's True West, the story of a film producer and his brother, a bandit.
The actor recently revealed that for him the best part of "Game of Thrones" was meeting his wife Rose.
"I met my wife on this show, so I saved my future family and my life from now on", he said.
Rose Leslie played Ygritte, the mistress of Harington's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The two married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has reported a 14°% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV or AIDS.
According to health officials, more than 820,000 people in the country are affected.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, approximately 40,000 new cases were reported.
In contrast to the past, the vast majority of new cases were transmitted through sexual intercourse.
Previously, HIV had spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, in China, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS has increased by 100,000 in one year.
HIV transmission through sexual intercourse is an acute problem in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against members of the LGBT community is said to be widespread.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men end up marrying women.
Many of the diseases are transmitted through inadequate protection during sexual intercourse in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised, among other things, universal access to HIV medicines to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that staff leaked the GOP senators' data, criticizes "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. House of Representatives Rep. Maxine Waters on Saturday denied claims that a member of her staff had posted the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on the congressmen's Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat said the claims were being spread by "ultra-right" experts and websites.
"Lies, lies and more disgusting lies", Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information released is said to include the private addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information surfaced online on Thursday, released during a Senate committee hearing on sexual misconduct allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh by an unknown person in government quarters.
The release came after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites like Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the posts was associated with Waters' office, and published the information of a member of Waters' staff, The Hill reported.
"This unfounded accusation is completely false and an absolute lie", Waters continued.
The member of my staff whose identity, personal data and security were compromised by these fraudulent and false allegations was in no way responsible for the leakage of this information.
This unfounded accusation is completely false and an absolute lie.
Waters's statement quickly sparked online criticism, including from Ari Fleischer, a former White House press secretary.
"This denial is angry", Fleischer wrote.
This suggests she doesn't have the right temperament to be a congresswoman.
People who are accused of something they did not do should not be angry.
You must not be defiant.
You cannot question the prosecution's motives.
You must be calm and at ease.
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of acting too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running in the midterm elections to replace Waters, also tweeted his thoughts.
"Great thing, if that's true", he tweeted.
Waters said in her statement that her office had informed the relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies of these fraudulent claims.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed", she continued, "and that they are held accountable for all their actions, which are destructive and dangerous for all members of my staff".
Reviews of Johnny English You only live three times Rowan Atkinson's weak spy parody
It is now a tradition to look for references to Brexit in every new British coloured film, and this seems to be true of this revival of the action-comedy parody franchise, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and was stutteringly revived in 2011 with Johnny English.
Is an ironic self-parody on how obviously stupid we are becoming the nation's new export opportunity?
In any case, the license of the glossy, grimacing and incompetent Johnny English to screw up has been renewed for the second time, and his name more than anything else signals that he is a common comic creation for non-English-speaking cinema-goers.
Of course, he's the clever undercover agent again, who bizarrely thinks he's cool and worldly, when in reality he's a bit of Clouseau, a pinch of Mr. Bean and a bang of this guy who contributed a single note to the title tune of "The Hour of the Winner" at the 2012 London Olympics opening ceremony.
The character was also based on the chaos-laden traveller and international secret agent played by Atkinson in the now-forgotten Barclaycard television commercials.
Johnny English's latest adventure has a nice moment or two.
I liked how Johnny English approached a helicopter in medieval armor and the rotor blades briefly dangled at his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is evident, but the humor seems rather weak and strangely redundant, especially since the "serious" film series such as "007" and "Mission Impossible" have now also offered confident comedic elements.
The humor seems to be more aimed at children than adults, and to me, Johnny English's crazy misadventures are not as inventive and focused as Atkinson's silent film gags in the role of the Bean.
The ever-present premise is that Britain is in great danger.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated the super-secret British spy network and revealed the identities of all British agents in operation, much to the displeasure of the acting agent, a regrettably small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the final straw for the Prime Minister, a bloated and depressed figure who is already on the verge of total collapse because of her political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing her best with this quasi-Teresa May character, but the script doesn't give her much to work with.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that all active spies have been exposed and she must therefore bring someone out of retirement.
This includes the goofy Johnny English himself, who now works as a teacher at a fancy institution, but has unofficial training in working as an undercover agent, and there are a few gags, because English offers a "School of Rock" -like spy academy.
English is taken back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and reunited with his former hard-tested sidekick Bough, who is again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine commander, an annoying woman of high society, whose role Vicki Pepperdine is somewhat wasted.
So Batman and Robin, who have always been terribly wrong in Her Majesty's Secret Service, are back in action, and they meet Olga Kurylenko's beautiful and fatal wife, Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is dangerously under the spell of a charismatic tech billionaire, the dark Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy, who claims to be able to solve Britain's computer problems.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of grotesque jokes: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a fancy French restaurant, they cause chaos as they smuggle themselves aboard Volta's luxury yacht, and English unleashes sheer anarchy as he tries to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's house using a virtual reality headset.
This last sequence is a drawing of the dice, but as sympathetic and funny as it is, the subject is already being discussed at length on children's television.
It's a very moderate stuff.
As with the other Johnny English films, I had to ask myself: "Can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that truly lives up to her talent?"
Labour denies working on a plan whereby the British work four days a week but are paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is said to be considering a radical plan that would see Britons working four days a week but getting paid for five.
The party reportedly wants business leaders to pass on the savings made by the AI (artificial intelligence) revolution in the form of an extra day off to employees.
This would give the workers a three-day weekend, but still give them the same pay.
Sources say the idea fits with the party's economic agenda and plans to shift the balance in the country to the workers.
The change to a four-day week was advocated by the Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party source told the Sunday Times: "A review of the directive is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
A change will not happen overnight, but a four-day working week is an effort that is consistent with the party's approach to restoring economic balance for workers and with the party's general industrial policy strategy.
The Labour Party would not be the first party to advocate such an idea, as the Green Party already promised to introduce a four-day week during the 2017 general election campaign.
The approach is not currently supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "A four-day week is not party politics and is not considered by the party".
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell made concrete his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy at the Labour conference last week.
McDonnell said he was determined to reclaim the power of "anonymous directors" and "profit-makers" in public utilities.
The Shadow Chancellor's plans also mean that the current shareholders of the water companies may not get their full stake back, as a Labour government could make "deductions" due to alleged misconduct.
He also confirmed plans to appoint employees to company boards and to set up Inclusive Ownership Funds to transfer 10% of the equity of private companies to employees who receive annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy speak to 60 Minutes News whether the FBI investigation into the Kavanaugh case could change their minds
The FBI investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed a final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court by at least a week, raising the question of whether the agency's findings could influence Republican senators to win their support.
In an interview on Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could uncover anything that might ultimately change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open-minded than his South Carolina counterpart.
"I mean, of course", Kennedy said.
I told the court I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after that allegation was made, and asked if he did it.
He was determined, determined and unmistakable.
Graham's voice, however, seems to be set in stone.
"My opinion is clear on Brett Kavanaugh, and there should be a bomb", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett vehemently denied it", Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
But they could not confirm it.
It's been 36 years.
And I can't see any changes.
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it helped to alleviate poverty?
This Saturday, New York is hosting the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music festival with an impressive lineup of stars and an equally impressive mission  to fight poverty in the world.
Tens of thousands will attend the Global Citizen Festival, which is in its seventh year, to not only see the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event's real goal: to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which was first held in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that seeks to combat poverty by motivating more and more people to actively participate in the fight against poverty.
To get a free ticket to the event (the other option would be to buy a VIP ticket), you have to complete a number of tasks, including volunteering, communicating with a leading politician around the world (by email or phone) or similar actions to raise awareness of the goal of  combating poverty .
How successful is the project, considering that Global Citizen has 12 years left to reach its goal?
Is the idea of offering a cool free concert a meaningful way to convince others that it's time to act, or just another case of so-called clicktivism  when you feel like you can make a difference by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Global Citizen reported that the project has seen more than 19 million actions by its supporters since 2011 and has achieved various goals.
These actions are said to have helped to inspire leaders around the world to announce commitments and strategies worth more than $37 billion that will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the Group cited 390 commitments and announcements arising from its actions, of which at least US$10 billion had already been paid out or raised through fundraising.
The group estimates that the funds secured have so far directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the most important commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of UK-based investors and implementers who have committed to supporting children in their optimal development and have pledged US$35 million to help Rwanda fight malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history", The Power of Nutrition ambassador Tracey Ullman told the audience during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also announced that after more than 5,000 actions calling on the UK to improve the nutrition situation of mothers and children, the government announced funding for The Power of Nutrition, a project to reach 5 million women and children and provide nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the most frequently asked questions on the website, which is the question of what are the reasons why Global Citizen can fight extreme poverty,
And they said unto me, It shall be a long and hard journey, with high and low.
But like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed because together we are stronger and more influential.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the artists performing at this year's event in New York, with Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman as hosts.
US could use navy blockade to block Russian energy exports  Interior Ministry
According to Washington Examine, Washington can use the Navy if necessary to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets including the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke said.
Zinke claimed that Russia's deployment in Syria is a pretext to explore new energy markets.
"I think the real reason for Russia's involvement in the Middle East is to negotiate new energy markets, just like in Eastern Europe", he is said to have said.
And according to the official, there are means and ways to do this.
"The United States can work with the Navy to ensure that the sea lanes remain open and block them if necessary to ensure that energy from Russia does not reach the market", he said.
Zinke addressed the participants of the Consumer Energy Alliance event, a non-profit group that sees itself as the "voice of the electricity consumer" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approaches to Russia and Iran and found that they were virtually identical.
"The use and replacement of fuels is more or less the economic option in Iran and Russia", he said, while describing Russia as a "one-trick pony" with a fossil fuel-dependent economy.
The statements came as the Trump administration was expanding exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, the far cheaper option for consumers in Europe.
To this end, government officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump says has turned Berlin into a "trapped" Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is intended to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is an exclusively economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's massive opposition to the project is due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we all agree that energy should not be used as a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their own suppliers", Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The United States has received a counter-blow from Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industrial organisation, the Bundesverband der Deutschen Industrie (BDI), has called on the US to stay out of EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"It is a big problem when a third country interferes in our energy supply", said BDI's CEO Dieter Kempf after a meeting between Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren wants to "crucify" a 2020 presidential bid, says the Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren announced Saturday that she would "carefully" consider a presidential candidate after the midterm elections.
During a town hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering a run.
According to The Hill, Warren said it was time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and that includes women at the top.
Warren plans to "crucify" a presidential run after November 6.
Warren said during the meeting that President Trump is leading this country in the wrong direction.
"I am extremely concerned about the way Donald Trump is treating our democracy", she said.
Warren has been very vocal in her criticism of Donald Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court nominee.
In a tweet on Friday, she announced that before the vote, of course, an FBI investigation is needed.
However, a poll released Thursday showed that a majority of Warren voters don't believe she should run in 2020.
According to a poll by the Suffolk University Political Research Center and the Boston Globe, 58 percent of potential voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run.
Thirty-two percent of the electorate supported such a candidacy.
The poll showed more support for a candidate of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent in favor of a potential candidate and 48 percent against.
Other prominent Democrats who are considered for a possible 2020 nomination include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden said he would make an official decision by January.
Sarah Palin speaks at the Donald Trump rally on post-traumatic stress disorder, which Track Palin suffers from
Track Palin, 26, was in Iraq for a year.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence Monday night.
"What my son is going through, what he's going through when he comes back, all of this can be felt by other families who are feeling the effects of PTSD and some of the wounds our soldiers are coming back with", she told the audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest the "elephant in the room" and said about her son and other war veterans that they come back changed, that they come back more discouraged, that they come back and wonder if there is that respect for what other soldiers and pilots and every other member of the military have given to this country.
He was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, on Monday and charged with domestic violence against a woman, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and D.C. support appeal of new asylum policy
18 states and the District of Columbia support an appeal against a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims of gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the District filed a court-appointed statement Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker who challenges the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the federal policy has not been disclosed.
She reported that her partner and his violent gang-bangers abused her, but U.S. officials denied her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Prosecutors supporting Grace have identified El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where many people are seeking asylum in the United States, as nations that have major problems with criminal gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals that allowed illegal immigrants fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of legislation at the state, federal and international levels".
The Federal Law requires that all asylum applications be assessed on the basis of the facts and circumstances of the application, and this court is in breach of this principle, was stated in the expert's statement.
The lawyers further argued in the statement that the policy of denying immigrants entry to the country adversely affects the US economy, as immigrants may be more likely to be entrepreneurs and provide the necessary manpower.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions in June ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
"Asylum is for anyone who leaves their home country because of persecution or fear of persecution because of race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion", Sessions said in his June 11 policy announcement.
It was never intended that by granting asylum, we would alleviate all the problems, even the serious problems that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as the number of deaths in the race for time doubles
For the survivors, the situation became increasingly worse.
"It's very tense", says 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, as she calms her feverish little son at a rescue center in the devastated city of Palu.
Every minute, a new ambulance comes with dead bodies.
Clean drinking water is scarce.
Residents returned to their destroyed homes to collect their soiled belongings and salvage whatever they could find.
Hundreds were injured, and the staff of the hospitals damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake were completely overwhelmed.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered spinal fractures and a broken shoulder, remained outside the Palu Military Hospital, where patients were being treated in the outskirts due to the ongoing strong aftershocks.
With tears in his eyes, he told how the powerful earthquake shook the fifth-floor hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
It all happened too fast.
I think I was trapped under the collapsed walls, he told the Associated Press, adding that the reason for his stay in the city was a wedding.
I heard my wife's cries for help, but then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to my wife and kid.
I can only hope they're in a safe place.
US ambassador accuses China of tyranny with propaganda ads
A week after an official Chinese newspaper ran a four-page ad in an American daily announcing the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused the capital Beijing of exploiting the American press for propaganda purposes.
US Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to the paid-for supplement of the China Daily in the Des Moines Register, Iowa's best-selling newspaper, after accusing China of interfering in the US congressional elections on November 6, an accusation that China denies.
Trump's accusations that Beijing has tried to interfere in the US election are in line with the announcement by US officials to Reuters; a new phase of an escalating campaign, triggered by Washington, to put pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to advertise to boost the economy, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in a raging trade war, with tariffs on imports for both countries.
Chinese retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade war should hit exporters in states like Iowa that supported Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts said.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, which exports large amounts of agricultural products to China, said Beijing has hurt workers, farm owners and businesses.
China, Branstad said in a Sunday Des Moines Register opinion piece, is now doubling down on this tyranny by running propaganda ads in its own free press in the United States.
"By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is claiming America's long-standing tradition of free speech and an independent press by putting paid advertising in the Des Moines Register", Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, you will find only a limited number of opposing voices at newsstands here in Beijing and no real reflection of the different opinions that Chinese people may have about China's worrying economic development, given the fact that the media is firmly in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party", he wrote.
He added that one of China's most prominent newspapers had not accepted the offer to publish his article, but did not name the newspaper.
Republicans are screwing up voters ahead of the midterm elections with the Kavanaugh debacle, warn observers
With many of the most influential Republicans supporting and defending Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh amid multiple sexual assault allegations, observers have warned of a backlash during the upcoming midterm elections, which could be particularly from women.
The mood in this regard has been extremely tense, and most Republicans have already announced that they will proceed with a vote.
"These things are irreversible", Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, told The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that the last-minute push by Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) for an FBI investigation would be enough to calm angry voters.
"Women don't forget what happened yesterday, they don't forget it tomorrow and they don't forget it in November", said Karine Jean-Pierre, first counselor and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, according to the Washington, D.C., daily.
On Friday morning, protesters in the Senate lobby shouted "November is coming!" as the Republicans who control the Judiciary Committee decided to stick with Kavanaugh's nomination, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are an extremely important issue, Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political observer of the news site, told the BBC.
People say it's high already, that's true.
But it could be higher, especially among suburban female voters and younger voters, people aged 18 to 29, who, although they don't like the president, often don't vote.
Even before Ford's public testimony, which details her allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, observers hinted that a backlash might follow if the Republicans advance confirmation.
"This situation is a mess for the GOP", Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News earlier this week.
"It's not just about the vote of the board, the final vote or the review of Kavanaugh; it's about the way the Republicans handled it and how they treated it", Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that supports the election of Democrats, told the news channel.
But Americans seem to be divided as to who to believe on the basis of the statements of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a slightly larger proportion taking the side of the latter.
A new YouGov poll showed that 41% of respondents were definitely or probably convinced by Ford's statement, while 35% indicated that they definitely or probably believed Kavanaugh.
Further, 38 percent said they believe Kavanaugh was probably or definitely lying in his testimony, while 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford and at least one other plaintiff, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that she was assaulted by Kavanaugh when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee had exposed his genitals to her when they were at a party during her time at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning to launch a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is currently launching a startup with the goal of establishing a competition with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company based on the open source platform Solid by Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who gets access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee said that the intent behind Inrupt is "world domination".
"We need to get active now", he said of startups.
This is a historic moment.
The app uses Solid's technology, allowing users to create their own personal online data storage or POD.
It can include contact lists, to-do lists, a calendar, a music library and other tools for the private and business sectors.
Like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, all content is in one browser and available at the same time.
The special feature of personal online data storage is that the user can decide for himself who can access which data.
The company describes this concept as personal empowerment and development through data.
According to CEO John Bruce, the idea behind Inrupt is that the company is putting resources, processes and capabilities to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, some developers who were hired to work on this project, as well as a community of volunteer programmers, and uses a security platform acquired by IBM.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can build their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team will not discuss with Facebook and Google whether to make a sweeping change that completely transforms their entire business models overnight.
We don't ask for their permission.
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy generation and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new solid-state web.
In 1994, Berners-Lee helped redesign the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been a key player in the debate on net neutrality.
Even with the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely confident about this new era of the web", he added.
Priest Bernard Vann, Victoria Cross winner in World War I, was honored
The only Church of England clergyman to be awarded the Victoria Cross as a combatant during World War I was honored in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel and Priest Bernard Vann won the award for his actions during the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt on 29 September 1918.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later, never knowing that he had won Britain's highest war award.
His two grandchildren unveiled a memorial stone at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Sunday.
One of the grandchildren, Michael Vann, felt that this act was full of symbolic power, since the memorial stone was unveiled exactly 100 years after the heroic act for which his grandfather was awarded.
According to The London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin, through thick fog and heavy shelling from field guns and machine guns.
Later, he advanced to the line of fire and led the line forward with "greatest bravery" before advancing alone with a field gun and taking out three of the military units.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was shot by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, a little more than a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were something he could never do justice to, and at the same time something that makes you humble.
Together with his brother Dr. James Vann, he laid a wreath after the parade, conducted by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was very honored to be able to participate in the parade, adding that the bravery of a true hero is seen above all by the support of many people.
MMA fans stayed up all night watching Bellator 206 instead of Peppa Pig.
Imagine you stayed up all night to watch a thrilling Bellator 206 and then you can't watch the main event.
The San Jose bill featured 13 fights, including 6 on the main map, and was broadcast live all night in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
Then, at 6 o'clock, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for their fight, the UK audience was not too surprised when Peppa Pig was suddenly seen.
Some remained untouched after staying up until the early hours of the morning to watch the fight specifically.
One fan described the move to the cartoon character on Twitter as a kind of bad joke.
"Because of a government regulation, this content is not considered youth-friendly, so it had to be switched to a children's program at 6", Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications, said when asked about the broadcast.
Peppa, the pig, that's right.
Scott Coker, CEO of Bellator, said the company would revise the schedule to accommodate UK viewers in the future.
"I think the problem could have been solved in the replay", he said.
But it's 6 a.m. on a Sunday in the UK, and we won't solve the incident until Sunday, our local time, Monday there.
But we're sticking with it.
There was a lot of communication during the move, and it was a mess, and it wasn't always nice.
We tried to solve the problem and assumed it was a technical malfunction.
What wasn't, was a problem on the part of the government.
I promise it won't happen again.
We're going to reduce it to five fights instead of six, as usual, and we've tried to give the fans the best possible experience.
The whole situation is rather regrettable.
Tom Daley feels inferior when it comes to sexuality
Tom Daley, who has competed in various Olympic Games as a water-jump rider, says that he grew up feeling inferior to everyone else because of his sexuality, but that feeling motivated him to become so successful.
The 24-year-old said that it was only in secondary school that he realized he was different from others.
On the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs with Lauren Laverne, he said that he spoke out about gay rights to encourage others.
He also said that since he became a father, winning the Olympic Games is no longer so important to him.
The original host of the long-running show, Kirsty Young, is taking a break for a few months due to illness.
In the first episode of Laverne, he said that he used to consider himself inferior compared to others, because love for boys and girls was socially completely unacceptable.
He said: "To this day, the feeling of being inferior and different from others is the reason for my power and strength and ultimately for my success".
He wanted to prove that he was a very special personality, so that no one would be disappointed if his sexual orientation was revealed.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist is now a prominent LGBT activist, using his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to push for the decriminalization of homosexuality in other countries.
He said he spoke out on this issue because he is fortunate to be able to live without restrictions and without discrimination and wants to encourage others.
The three-time world champion fell in love with American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married the Oscar winner 20 years his senior last year, but he shared that the age gap has never been an issue.
He says that when you have to go through so much as a child and teenager - he participated in the Olympics for the first time at 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - it's hard to find someone of the same age with similar experiences.
The couple have a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley since June, and Daley says his whole outlook has changed since then.
Last year, he was all about gold medals.
But there's more to him now than Olympic gold medals.
His son Robbie is now his main prize.
He bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with a brain tumor.
Daley said his father didn't accept the impending death, and one of the last things he asked for were the tickets to London 2012 because he wanted to be there in the first place.
"I couldn't tell him he wasn't going to be there anymore", he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only after that did I finally realize that he was not invincible", he continued.
The following year, Daley won the bronze medal at the 2012 Olympics.
"I just knew it was always my dream to dive in front of a home crowd at the Olympics", he said.
His first song selection  Proud by Heather Small  was also influenced by it, which he heard in the run-up to the Olympics and still cared for goose bumps.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, who is currently out of shape, is sitting on the bench for the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson will set a record in his 47th Ryder Cup game on Sunday, but he'll have to work hard to keep things from turning into a debacle.
Mickelson, who is playing in the event for the 12th time, was sent to the bench by Captain Jim Furyk for the Fourballs and Foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being the center of attention, as he usually does, the five-time major winner spent his day encouraging others and working on his game, hoping to solve the problems that were plaguing him.
Even at the peak of his career, 48-year-old Mickelson was never the most direct golfer and thus not an ideal lineup for the cramped Le Golf National golf course, where misdirected balls are regularly penalized.
And as if the field itself wasn't daunting enough, Mickelson meets the perfectionist British Open champion Francesco Molinari in Game 9 on Sunday, who has teamed up with Tommy Fleetwood, a newcomer to these tournaments, to win all four games this week.
If the Americans are four points behind in the 12 singles, and they get off to a hot start, Mickelson's game could prove to be absolutely decisive.
Furyk spoke confidently to Mickelson and could not add much to that.
"He was completely clear about his role today, slapped me on the back and put his arm around me and said he was ready for tomorrow", Furyk said.
He's got a lot of confidence.
He's one of the world's great personalities and he's done so much for these teams in the past and this week.
I didn't think he was gonna be in two games.
I had imagined more, but that's how it turned out and that's what we expected.
He wants to be in it, just like everybody else.
Mickelson will break Nick Faldos' record for most Sunday Ryder Cup games played.
It could mean the end of a Ryder Cup career that never quite matched the highs of his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven half-time wins, although Furyk said his presence alone has enriched the team.
"He's funny and sarcastic, original and likes to make a few jokes, and he's a great guy who's loved by the whole team", he explained.
I think the younger players were happy to get to know him a little bit more this week.
He's a really interesting person, who gives a lot of impulses.
Captain Thomas Bjørn knows that the lead may soon be over.
Thomas Bjørn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a big lead leading into the final singles of the Ryder Cup can quickly turn into an unpleasant situation.
The Danes made their debut in 1997 at Valderrama, where a team led by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but only narrowly crossed the finish line and took the lead with the smallest possible lead, scoring a victory of 141⁄2131⁄2 .
"The thought remains that we had a big lead in Valderrama, we had a big lead in Brookline where we lost, and in Valderrama where we won but only by a narrow margin", Bjørn (pictured) said after watching the Class of 2018 win 53 both on Friday and yesterday to lead 10-6 at Le Golf National.
Experience has shown me and all my teammates that it's not over.
Tomorrow is the big day.
Get your shit together and do the right thing.
This whole thing's not over until the points are on the scoreboard.
We have a goal, we want to win this trophy, and that's what we're focused on.
I've always said I'm focused on the 12 players on our side, but we're very aware of what's on the other side: the best players in the world.
Bjorn, who was happy with the performance of his players on a difficult golf course, continued: "I would never rush it.
Tomorrow, it will be a different caliber.
Tomorrow, the focus will be on individual achievements, and that is a whole other matter.
It's great to work with a partner when things are going well, but when you're out there by yourself, you're being tested to the limit of your golfing skills.
You have to make it clear to the players, tomorrow, you're gonna get the best out of yourself.
Now you're leaving your partner behind and he's got to get the best out of himself, too.
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent Jim Furyk will make sure that his players individually score better than the team, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have won three out of four points.
Furyk himself was on both sides of those big turns on the last day of the tournament, he was on the winning side in Brooklyn before he was on the losing side after the "miracle of Medina" in Europe.
"I remember every damn word", he said when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain, motivated his players before the final day.
We have 12 big games tomorrow, but you'd like to get the fast start you saw in Brooklyn and Medina.
If the momentum is going in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle games.
We'll set up our team accordingly and send our guys out as we feel like, you know, we'll try to do the magic tomorrow.
Thomas has been given the task of catching up for the counter-attack, he has to compete in the top game against Rory McIlroy, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as other Europeans in the top half of the standings.
'I chose the boys in this order because I think it covers everything,' says Bjorn about his selection for the individual meetings.
Germany's new warship delayed again
The latest frigate of the German Navy was supposed to be commissioned in 2014 to replace the aging warships of the Cold War, but according to local media, due to faulty systems and rapidly growing costs, it will not be delivered until next year at the earliest.
The commissioning of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the flagship of the brand new Baden-Württemberg class frigates, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the time cited by a military spokesman.
The ship was scheduled to enter service in 2014, but the ambitious project was plagued by troubling problems after delivery.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class vessels, ordered by the Navy in 2007, are to replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
They are to include a high-powered cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and sea-target missiles, and stealth technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic reflection.
Another important feature is longer maintenance periods, which should allow the newest frigates to be unable to return to their home ports for up to two years.
However, the continuing delays may lead to the highly modern warships, which are supposed to represent Germany as a naval power, being obsolete by the time they are commissioned, according to Die Zeit.
The F125 frigate that was hit by the accident made headlines last year when the German navy officially refused to take the ship off the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to the shipyard after it had been delivered.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media cited a number of significant "software and hardware flaws" that would have rendered the new ship unusable in a combat situation.
Software problems are particularly serious, as ships of the Baden-Württemberg class are operated by a crew of only 120 sailors, only about half as many as on the older frigates of the Bremen class.
It was also known that the ship was much too heavy, which led to a loss of performance and prevented the Navy from carrying out future upgrades.
The 7,000-tonne "Rheinland-Pfalz" was apparently twice as heavy as similar-class ships used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to the defective hardware, the cost of the whole project, including the cost of training the crew, became a problem.
The costs seem to have risen to a staggering €3.1 billion, compared with the €2.2 billion originally planned.
The problems with the latest frigates are particularly significant in view of recent warnings that Germany's naval power is shrinking.
At the beginning of the year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the German Bundestag's defense commissioner, confirmed that the navy was running out of 'fit ships'.
Bartels said the problem grew over time as old ships were taken out of service but no replacement ships were provided.
He complained that none of the Baden-Württemberg-class frigates could be taken over by the navy.
National Trust listens to the secret life of bats
New research is being conducted at a farm in the Scottish Highlands to show how bats use the landscape to search for food.
It is hoped that the results will provide further insights into the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation efforts.
The study, carried out by researchers at the National Trust for Scotland, will track midget and mosquito bats, as well as brown-eared long-eared bats and water bats at Inverewe Garden in Wester Ross.
Special recording devices are placed at key locations on the property to record the bat's activities throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile tests with portable detectors.
A sound analysis of all the recordings by experts determines the frequency of the bats' calls and determines which species is doing what.
A map and habitat report are then produced to provide a detailed picture of their behaviour at the landscape level.
Rob Dewar, conservation consultant for the NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of the habitat are most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This data will help to identify the benefits of habitat management measures such as grassland creation and show how to preserve forest areas for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and the whole of the United Kingdom have declined significantly over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work which affects sleeping places and leads to habitat loss.
Windmills and lighting can also pose a risk, as can fly traps and the chemical treatment of building materials or attacks by domestic cats.
Bats aren't really blind.
However, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey because of their nocturnal hunting habits.
They use sophisticated echo-tracing to detect insects and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the upkeep of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout Scotland, takes the bat issue very seriously.
It has 10 trained experts who regularly conduct investigations, sleeping places inspections and sometimes rescue operations.
The organisation has even set up Scotland's first and only bat sanctuary at Threave Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's 10 bat species.
Landlord David Thompson explains that the property is the ideal living space for them.
"Here in Threave we have a great bat area", he explains.
We have the old buildings, lots of old trees and a great habitat.
But there is much we don't know about bats, so we are doing this work here and at other properties that will help us learn more about what bats need to feel comfortable.
It stresses the importance of first eliminating the presence of bats before maintenance work on the holdings, as the accidental destruction of a single nesting site could kill up to 400 females and young and wipe out the entire population on site.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass or destroy them or their nesting sites.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official with the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help.
She explains: "We still have a lot to learn about bats, and we don't know the status of many of our species' populations".
Ronaldo denies rape charges while his lawyers want to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape allegations against him "fake news" and said people want to be "famous" by using his name.
His lawyers plan to sue the news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The striker of the Portugal national team and Juventus Turin was accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He allegedly paid her $375,000 to buy her silence on the incident, according to Der Spiegel am Freitag.
In an Instagram live video to his 142 million followers, 33-year-old Ronaldo called the reports "fake news" just hours after they were published.
No, no, no, no, no, I'm not going to do this.
What you've reported today: Fake News, the five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the camera.
You want to make a name for yourself by using my name.
That's what happens.
You want to be famous with my name, but that's part of the job.
"I'm a happy man and everything is fine", the player added, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue the Mirror over allegations they described as "inappropriate reporting on suspicious privacy concerns", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player was seeking compensation for moral damage in an amount commensurate with the severity of the infringement, which is believed to be one of the most serious violations of personality rights in recent years.
The alleged incident is said to have occurred in 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anal, according to documents filed with the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo got down on his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was 99 percent a good guy who had succumbed to the 1 percent.
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirms that the two had sex, but says it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had her injuries photographed in a hospital, but later settled out of court because she was "fearful of retaliation" and worried about being "publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old said she is now trying to undo the settlement as she is still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of transferring from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged incident and he made the move to Italian giant Juve this summer in a €100 million deal.
Brexit: UK would regret the loss of car manufacturers forever
The UK would 'regret it forever' if it lost its status as a world leading car manufacturer after Brexit, Economy Minister Greg Clark said.
He went on to say that it was 'worrying' that Toyota UK had told the BBC that it would temporarily halt production at its Burnaston plant near Derby should the UK leave the EU.
We need a deal, Clark said.
The Japanese car manufacturer stated that the impact of delays at the border in a no-deal Brexit could lead to job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which produces Toyota's Auris and Avensis product lines, produced almost 150,000 vehicles last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"I am convinced that if there is an uncontrolled Brexit at the end of March, we will see production stoppages at our plant", said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director in Burnaston.
Other UK carmakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also raised concerns about a hard no-deal exit from the EU and its impact on cross-border trade.
BMW, for example, says it will close its mini-factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns, according to the car manufacturers, are related to risks within the supply chain in the event of a hard Brexit.
Toyota's manufacturing facility is run on a just-in-time basis, meaning that parts are delivered every 37 minutes from suppliers from both the UK and the EU to make the cars to order.
If the UK leaves the EU on 29 March without an agreement, there could be disruptions at the borders, which the industry believes could lead to delays and bottlenecks in parts.
It was impossible for Toyota to keep stock for more than one day at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, which is why production had to be stopped.
Clark explained that Theresa May's Chequers plan for the future relationship with the EU is 'exactly designed to avoid such checks at the border'.
"We need a deal. We want the best deal that allows us, as I said, not only to enjoy the current success but also to take that opportunity", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
The findings from not only Toyota but also other manufacturers show that we must be able to continue the very successful supply chains so far.
Toyota could not specify how long the production would have to be suspended, but warned in the long term that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and eventually lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the top official in the Unite union at the plant, explained that its members are increasingly concerned: In my experience, once these jobs are gone, they never come back.
A government spokesman said: 'We have put forward a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.'
Trump's scheduled meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, according to the White House
Donald Trump's important meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be "postponed for another week" as the dispute over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein has overseen the work of special investigator Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian election interference, ties between Trump's advisers and Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The question of whether Trump would fire the deputy attorney general and thus jeopardize Mueller's independence has been the subject of rumours in Washington for a month.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had raised the possibility of secretly recording his conversations with Trump and impeaching the president using the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
However, he made his way to the White House last Monday as new reports emerged about his supposed resignation.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was at the UN General Assembly in New York at the time, was announced for next Thursday.
Trump stated that he would prefer not to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was then postponed to avoid it colliding with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which both Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who had accused him of sexual abuse, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh for a week, further delaying the full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: "A date has not been set for that yet. It could be this week, but I can also imagine that it will be postponed for another week, given all the things that are going on with the Supreme Court.
That'll come out, but I always like to keep the press informed.
Some reporters would disagree with this assertion: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked them why.
Sanders explained that the low frequency of press conferences was not due to a dislike of the "effects-cheating" of TV reporters, but admitted: "I would not deny that they are doing effects-cheating".
She then claimed that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
The President is doing more Q&A than any other President before him, she explained, without providing any specific evidence: "We looked at these numbers".
There will still be press conferences, Sanders said, but that would be if the press had the opportunity to ask the President of the United States questions directly, but far better than talking to me.
We try to do this often, and you've seen that we've done this a lot in the last few weeks, and it's going to take the place of the press conference when you can talk to the President of the United States.
Trump regularly accepts questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Press conferences with him alone are rare.
In New York, the president may have shown why when he made an outrageous and sometimes bizarre appearance before a gathering of reporters.
Health Minister writes to EU NHS staff about Brexit concerns
The Minister for Health is addressing people from outside the EU who work in Scotland's National Health Service (NHS) to express the country's gratitude and wish that they remain in the country after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before the UK left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already agreed to cover the costs of residence permit applications for EU citizens working in the decentralised public service in Scotland.
In your letter, Freeman wrote: Within the summer, the UK-EU withdrawal negotiations continued and decisions are expected this autumn.
However, the UK government has also stepped up preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I am aware of what a troubling time this must be for all of you.
I therefore wanted to express once again how much I appreciate the contribution of each and every employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, benefiting the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we would be very happy if you stayed here.
Christion Abercrombie has undergone emergency surgery after suffering a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie has been given emergency surgery, according to Tennessee State's Mike Organ, after suffering a head injury in Saturday's 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores.
Rod Reed, Tennessee State's head coach, told reporters that the injury occurred just before halftime.
"He came to the sideline and just collapsed there", Reed said.
Trainer and medical staff supplied Abercrombie with oxygen at the sideline before he was placed on a stretcher and transported for further examination.
A spokesman for Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie has left the operating room at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "no details are known as to the nature or extent of the injury" and Tennessee State is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a so-called redshirt, is in his first season at Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
Before leaving the game on Saturday, he recorded a total of five tackles, bringing his total for the season to 18.
Foreign investors will have to pay higher stamp duty on property purchases in the UK
Foreign investors will have to pay a higher stamp duty on property purchases in the UK in the future, with the additional revenue to benefit the homeless, according to the Conservative Party's new plans.
This move is intended to curb the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign for young voters
The increase in the stamp duty will affect all those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The Treasury Department expects to raise up to £120 million a year to help homeless people.
Theresa May is to announce today that foreign investors will have to pay a higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK, with the additional revenue to benefit the homeless.
This move is an attempt to curb the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign for young voters, who promises to provide more affordable housing and target the top earners.
The increase in the stamp duty is levied on individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK, and the additional proceeds are intended to be used to support the government's campaign against homelessness.
The surcharge, which is added to the current stamp duty and includes the increase introduced two years ago on second homes and rental housing, could be as high as three per cent.
The Treasury Department expects the move to generate up to £120 million in additional revenue per year.
An estimated 13 percent of newly built properties in London are bought by investors outside the United Kingdom, driving up prices and making it harder for first-time buyers to gain a foothold in the real estate business.
Many prosperous areas of the country, particularly in the capital, have become 'ghost towns' due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the UK.
The new strategy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in stamp duty to enable more young people to have their first home.
He accused construction companies of keeping property prices high by buying up land without using it and urged Theresa May to give up quotas on affordable housing to end Britain's 'housing scandal'.
Opposition leader Corbyn announced a series of sensational proposals for housing reform, ranging from a fixing of rents to a ban on evictions without good reason.
He also wants to give city councillors more power in building new housing.
May said: "Last year I said I would devote my time as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream of a better life for generations to come.
And that means fixing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live and work here and build a life.
However, it cannot be true that it is as easy for non-UK residents and companies based abroad to buy property as it is for hardworking British citizens.
The dream of home has become too distant for too many people and the unworthiness of homelessness remains too big a problem.
Jack Ross: "My main goal is to manage Scotland"
Jack Ross, the manager of Sunderland, says that his "greatest goal" is to one day become the manager of the Scottish team.
The 42-year-old Scot is enjoying the challenge of breathing new life into the club from the north-east of England, which is currently third in League One and three points short of the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I made it to the bench and that was it, Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
But I used to watch Scotland play in Hampden with my father when I was a kid and that's something that always draws me back.
But this opportunity would only come if I was successful in club management.
Ross's predecessors in the role as manager of Sunderland include Dock Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic boss said he was not afraid to follow in the footsteps of such an established name at such a club after previously turning down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
My success will be measured by my ability to get the club back into the Premier League.
"Given the structure and the possibilities at this club, it is without doubt a Premier League club", he said.
"It's not an easy task to get him there, but I would consider my time here as a success only if I bring the club back there".
Ross has a three-year management career, after a stint as deputy chief at Dumbarton and a 15-month stint as a trainer at Hearts.
He then helped Alloa recover from relegation to the third tier and helped St Mirren from the edge of relegation to win the championship the following season.
Ross says he is now more comfortable than ever in his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was a real split", he recalls, "when he took over responsibility for Alloa.
I really think management was the right thing for me, more than playing.
It sounds weird, because I didn't do badly, I made a good living out of it, and I had some very pleasant highs.
But playing can be tough.
There's a lot of things you have to go through every week.
I'm still going through the stress and pressure of my job, but management feels right.
I've always wanted to manage and now I'm managing. I've never felt so comfortable in my adult life.
You can listen to the full interview on Sunday 30 September between 12:00 and 13:00 BST on Sportsound on Radio Scotland.
The perfect time for a glass of beer is Saturday at 5:30 p.m., according to a study
The summer heat wave has seen the revenues of Britain's crumbling pubs rebound, while restaurant chains have come under greater pressure.
Pubs and bars recorded a 2.7 percent increase in sales in July, but restaurant revenues fell by 4.8 percent, according to statistics.
Peter Martin of the consultancy CGA, which compiled the figures, said: Continued sunshine and England's longer-than-expected participation in the World Cup meant that July followed a similar pattern to the previous June, with pubs seeing 2.8 per cent sales increases, but restaurants hit harder.
The decline of 1.8% in June in the restaurant industry continued in July.
Pubs and bars with a beverage focus were by far the best performers, with area-adjusted revenue growth higher than it was in restaurants.
Food-oriented pubs also suffered from sun exposure, but not as drastically as restaurant operators.
It seems like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In the pubs and bars managed, beverage sales rose by 6.6 per cent in the month, while food sales fell by 3 per cent.
Paul Newman, from the leisure and catering industry analysts RSM, said: These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the influence of major social or sporting events remain the main factors for sales in the out-of-home market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to struggle, but a 4.8% year-on-year decline in sales will be particularly painful, in addition to the ongoing cost pressure.
The long, hot summer could not have come at a worse time for food-focused business operators and it remains to be seen whether the more moderate temperatures in August will provide much needed respite.
The overall sales growth for pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the decline in brand rollouts.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, the industry sales monitor for the UK pub, bar and restaurant sector, collects and analyses performance data from 47 active companies with combined sales of over £9 billion and is the recognised industry benchmark.
One in five children has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents
One study shows that one in five children, some as young as 11, have secret social media accounts that they keep from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students found an increase in so-called fake Insta pages
The news fuels fears that sexual content will be posted
Twenty percent of the students said they had a "main account" to show their parents
One in five children, some as young as 11, have social media accounts that they can keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students showed a rapid increase in so-called fake Insta accounts, a nod to the photo-sharing website Instagram.
The news has fueled fears that sexual content will be shared.
Twenty per cent of pupils said they had a clean "main" account that they could show their parents, but they also had private accounts.
A mother who found her 13-year-old daughter's secret site found a teenager who urged others to rape her.
The study, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 per cent of 11-18 year olds had two profiles, with half admitting to having private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, chairman of HMC, said: "It is disturbing that so many teenagers are being tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them".
Eilidh Doyle will be the 'voice of the athletes' at the Scottish Sports Council
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Board of Scottish Athletics at its Annual General Meeting as a non-executive member.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated athlete and chairman Ian Beattie described the election as a great opportunity for the sporting officials to benefit from their extensive international experience over the last decade.
"Eilidh is respected in the athletics community in Scotland, the UK and the world and we are sure that athletics in Scotland would benefit greatly from her election to the Council", said Beattie.
Doyle said: 'I look forward to acting as the voice of the athletes and hope that I can make a real contribution and lead the sport in Scotland.'
The American, who won the 200 and 400 meters at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, claimed four Olympic gold medals and now frequently appears as a BBC expert, was unable to run after suffering a temporary circulatory disorder.
He tweeted: "A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors say no one can tell if or how far I'll recover.
It was hard work, but I have fully recovered, learned to walk again, and now I do mobility exercises!
Thank you for the encouraging news!
An advertisement for milk pumps comparing mothers to cows is causing a stir on the Internet
A milk pump manufacturer caused a stir on the Internet with an advertising clip comparing nursing mothers to milking cows.
To mark the launch of what it claims is the world's first portable low-noise milk pump, consumer technology maker Elvie is releasing a not-so-serious music video to highlight the freedom it gives breastfeeding mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a haystack with cows in the background to a song that includes lines like, "Yes, I'm milking, but you can't see my dick" or "In case you haven't noticed, these aren't my boobs, these are my breasts".
The chorus goes on to say, "Pump it out, pump it out, I feed the babies, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my ladies".
However, the advertisement posted on the company's Facebook page has sparked controversy on the net.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from viewers, many of whom say it downplays the "horrors" of the dairy industry.
It was a very bad decision to promote this product with cows.
Like us, they must become pregnant and give birth to a calf to produce milk, with the difference that their young are taken away within a few days of birth, a commentary said.
Elvie's milk pump fits nicely into a breast-bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment was, "Understandably traumatic for mother and baby.
But hey, why don't we use it to promote a milk pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their babies?
Another person added: Such an unrealistic advertisement.
Others defended the ad, and one woman admitted that she found the song "humorous".
I think that's a brilliant idea.
I would have bought one if I was still breastfeeding.
I felt like a cow when I was pumping.
The clip is a little crazy, but I'm not trying to over-interpret it.
"This is a brilliant product", one person wrote.
Another person commented: This is a funny advertisement aimed at mothers who use milk pumps (often at work or in toilets) and feel like cows.
This is not an advertisement for or against the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, the group reveals to the women that they all danced with the discreet pumps in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the realization that many women who use milk pumps report feeling like dairy cows.
However, Elvie's pump is completely silent, has no wires or hoses, and fits discreetly into a breast bra, giving women the freedom to move, hold their babies, or even go outside during the pumping process.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother, said: Elvie's pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By comparing nursing mothers to dairy cows, we wanted to bring the focus to the milk pump and all the challenges that come with it, while at the same time presenting in a fun and understandable way the incredible feeling of freedom that the new pump enables.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a double mother appeared on the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski while she was using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children were quietly taken to a tent town on the Texas border
The number of interned migrant children is at an all-time high, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively stable, partly because of the Trump administration's tightening rhetoric and policies that have made it harder to accommodate children in foster care.
Traditionally, most caregivers were illegal immigrants themselves and are now afraid of being targeted for deportation if they report to take in a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential carers and other adult members of their household would be required to hand over their fingerprints and that data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, told Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied for the care of unaccompanied minors.
The authorities later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
Nearly 80 per cent of those who are either carers themselves or members of a carer's household are in the country illegally, and a large proportion of them are foreigners with criminal convictions.
The Commission is also aware of the need to improve the quality of the services provided by the European Union.
To speed up the children's cases, officials introduced new rules that, according to shelter staff, require some children to appear in court within a month of being taken into custody, instead of the standard 60 days.
Many will appear via video call, not in person, to argue their legal status before an immigration judge.
If the person makes a negative decision, they'll be deported quickly.
The longer these children are in custody, the more likely they are, according to the shelter staff and reports that have emerged from the system over the past month, to become anxious and depressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or attempted escapes.
Advocates say that these concerns are heightened at a larger facility like Tornillo, where signs of a child's problems are more easily overlooked due to the size.
They also explained that trauma that many of the children already suffered could be compounded by being taken to a tent city without emotional preparation or sufficient time to say goodbye to friends.
Syria calls on US, French and Turkish "occupation forces" to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the civil war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, stated that foreign forces are illegally on Syrian soil under the pretext of fighting terrorism and are being treated accordingly.
"You must withdraw immediately and unconditionally", he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terror" is almost over in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more have been displaced.
He said Damascus would "continue to fight this holy battle until all Syrian territories are cleared" of both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are aligned against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 ground troops in the war-torn country.
On the refugees, Moualem said that the conditions for their return were in place and accused "some Western countries" of "spreading irrational fears" that prevent refugees from going home.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to allow the return", he said.
You are politicizing a purely humanitarian issue.
The United States and the European Union warned that no reconstruction aid will be provided to Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats said the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib provided an opportunity to advance political talks.
The deal between Russia and Turkey has turned a broad-scale offensive by Russian-backed Syrian forces against the province, home to three million people, around.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement has "clear deadlines" and expressed his hope that military action will be taken against jihadists, including fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, which will be "destroyed".
UN representative Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem mentioned the Syrian government's conditions for participating in the committee, stating that its work should be limited to "revising the articles of the current constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Win His Re-election
With this logic, Trump would win re-election in 2020, should not, as many liberal viewers would probably hope, a impeachment or scandal end his presidency prematurely.
This would undoubtedly be the most dramatic end to a presidency ever.
So far, there's no sign that the audience has had enough.
Since 2014, prime-time viewership at CNN has more than doubled to 1.05 million, and at MSNBC it has nearly tripled to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, Fox News averages 2.4 million viewers at prime time, up from 1.7 million four years ago. MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" led viewership to 3.5 million on important news nights.
"It's like a fire that magically attracts people because it's something we don't understand", says Neal Bear, showrunner of ABC's "Designated Survivor", about a cabinet member who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club", has a different theory.
She remembers a cab ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he was going to vote for Trump.
She asked him why.
He said, "Because he makes me laugh". Scovell told me.
The chaos is entertaining.
Of course, the stories from Washington, unlike anything else on television, can determine the future of the Roe v. Wade decision on abortion, the possible reunification of families, and the health of the global economy.
Turning off the TV is a luxury only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it goes beyond being an informed citizen to being aware that you've already watched six hours of an expert panel discussing Bob Woodward's use of sources from the so-called "Deep Background" for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich leather bomber jacket (according to the Washington Post, a "clothing item rich in self-esteem"), or the impact of Stormy Daniel's riveting description of Trump's, um, anatomy.
I, for one, will never see Super Mario with the same eyes again.
"Some of what he does feels like a reality show he's putting on every night", says Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the "Three from the pawnshop" series, about Trump's rotating cast and daily action (breaking a feud with the NFL, praising Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss an episode, or you're not gonna show up.
When I reached meat this week, it was sunny 27 degrees outside his house on the north shore of the Hawaiian island of Kauai, but he was hiding inside watching MSNBC while simultaneously recording CNN.
He just couldn't get off the screen, not when nominee Brett Kavanaugh was about to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was at stake.
I remember when we were doing all these crazy shows back then and people were saying, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization", Fleiss told me.
I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right.

Donations are pouring in the closest race for congressional seats in the midterm elections.
It's no surprise that Pennsylvania's 17th Congressional District is flooded with donations, thanks to the redrawn boundaries of the congressional districts that have resulted in two incumbents running for the same seat.
The newly-designated suburban district of Pittsburgh is running for Democrat Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in a special election the previous spring.
Lamb is running against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which overlaps heavily with the new 17th district.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old counties violated the Constitution and were manipulated in favor of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district triggered a major swap of campaign funding between the major financial arms of the parties, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after narrowly winning a highly publicized special election in March for the state's 18th congressional district.
This seat was held by a Republican for over a decade, and Trump won there by 20 percentage points.
Political experts are giving the Democrats an easy lead.
The US considered punishing El Salvador for its support for China, but then backed down.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing without much opposition from Washington.
Trump held a friendly meeting with Panama's President Juan Carlos Valero in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until partners kicked out the Trump Organization's management team.
U.S. State Department officials have decided to withdraw the heads of all U.S. foreign missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of "the recent decision to no longer recognize Taiwan", said Heather Nauert, spokeswoman for the department, in a statement earlier this month.
However, only in the case of El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in US aid in 2017, including drug control, development and economic aid, were considerations of punitive measures.
The proposed penalties, including cuts in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity that was to follow a similar meeting the previous year and represented a step forward in efforts to stop migrants from moving toward the United States.
However, in mid-September, senior government officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, effectively ending the consideration of punitive measures against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now scheduled to speak at the conference, scheduled for mid-October, to signal the importance the government is giving to the assembly, according to diplomats.
The three American diplomats have quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without further harsh communications or punitive measures from Washington.
A spokesman for John Bolton's government declined to comment on the details of the debate, which were described by the three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to comment on the internal discussions on condition of anonymity.
Their comments were confirmed by an external analyst close to the government, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Learning from History
The next big surprise could be the report by special investigator Robert Mueller on Trump's possible obstruction of justice, for which there is now enough evidence in the public domain.
Mueller is also reportedly investigating whether Trump's campaign team conspired with Russia in its attack on the US election.
If the majority in Congress changes, Trump will face an accountability body just as he prepares to stand before the voters again, and possibly a jury.
There are many "ifs" and I don't want to say that the fall of Donald Trump or his European counterparts is inevitable.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we must make decisions that will affect how long the fight will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to stage a coup against Hitler if the West had merely resisted him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed, and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of barbarism that followed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points and the unstoppable march of democracy is either accelerated or delayed.
The Americans are now facing several such turning points.
What do we do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who's going to decide the future of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in the devil's kitchen since this paper reported last year that he suggested secretly recording the president and speculating that he was unfit for office.
Rosenstein denies the story as told by the New York Times.
"How will we respond if the newly ordered FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or he is confirmed despite credible allegations of sexual abuse and false testimony in office?"
And most importantly, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that holds Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, we're gonna have a long winter.
But I don't think we're going to fail, based on what I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same regime that once occupied my embassy home.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later sent me out to light Sabbath candles on the swastika table.
How can I not be optimistic about this legacy?

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers optimistic before the game against Vienna
The Rangers welcome Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a win over the Austrians after an impressive draw against Villareal in Spain earlier this month will put them in a good position for qualifying for Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury kept Graham Dorrans out of action until the 2-2 draw against Villareal, but he believes the Rangers can use this as a springboard for bigger things.
"This was an important point for us because Villareal is very good", said the 31-year-old.
We went into the game with the belief that we could make something of it and we went home with a point.
Maybe we could have won in the end, but overall a draw was probably a fair result.
They probably dominated in the first half, but we pushed ourselves in the second half and then we were the better team.
Thursday is another big European evening.
Hopefully we'll get three points, but it's going to be a tough game because they scored a good result in the last game, but I'm sure we can do that with the crowd behind us and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely difficult, with all that's happened with my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now there's a kind of a feel-good factor.
The team is good and the guys are really good; the training is good.
Hopefully we can look forward now, put the last season behind us and be successful.
Fear of retirement leads to sleepless nights for women.
Although the survey respondents knew exactly how to care for them, few of them talked about it with their family members.
About half of the women in the Nationwide study said they talked to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they would talk to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't take the necessary steps to have the conversation", says Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
This is where you should start.
You cannot prepare your family to care for you if you do not make your wishes known in time.
Work with your counsellor and your family to discuss where and how you would like to be cared for, as these decisions can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Bring your financial adviser on board: your adviser can also help you find a way to finance these expenses.
Your financial decisions for long-term care may include traditional care insurance, hybrid capital-generating life insurance to help cover these costs, or self-insurance with your own money - as long as you have the money.
Work out your legal documents: Avoid legal disputes at the last minute.
Set up a power of attorney so that you assign a trusted person to oversee your medical care and ensure that health professionals comply with your wishes should you be unable to express them yourself.
Consider also a power of attorney for your finances.
You choose a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and make sure your bills are paid should you be unable to do so.
Remember the details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about your medications or allergies?
Write down these details in a written plan so that you are ready.
"It's not just the financial issues that matter. Who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
 What is the medication treatment?
Who's taking care of the dog?
Have you finished this plan?
Man shot multiple times with air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air rifle as he walked home from work among friends.
The victim, a man in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Officials described the shooting, which occurred at about 02:30 UK time, as an "arbitrary act".
The victim didn't see the assailant.
His injuries were not life-threatening and police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, authorities said, with the death toll expected to rise.
Due to the failure of the communication systems, aid workers were unable to obtain information from the Donggala government district, an area north of Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, over 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala on Sulawesi Island:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi province and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was just celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a government district that stretches across a coastal strip of over 300 km (180 miles) in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The government district, an administrative unit below the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main sources of income for the economy of Central Sulawesi, especially the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by earthquakes and tsunamis several times in the past 100 years, according to Indonesia's Disaster Management Agency.
In 1938, over 200 people were killed by a tsunami that destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
West Donggala was hit by a tsunami in 1996 that killed nine people.
Indonesia is located on the seismic Pacific Ring of Fire, and earthquakes regularly strike.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A strong earthquake off the west coast of Aceh province in northern Sumatra, Indonesia, triggered a tsunami on December 26, affecting 14 countries and killing 226,000 people in the coastal areas of the Indian Ocean, almost half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra between late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the Nias Islands off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake shook southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that hit the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake hit the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra Province.
Over 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake shook one of the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra, triggering a tsunami as high as 10 meters (33 feet) high, destroying dozens of villages and claiming some 300 lives.
2016: A minor earthquake shook the Pidie Jaya government district in Aceh, causing destruction and panic as people were reminded of the devastation of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time, no tsunami was caused, but over 100 people died in the collapse of buildings.
2018: Severe earthquakes hit the popular Indonesian island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, especially on the northern side of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists stranded on the island.
Sarah Palin's son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the oldest son of the former governor of Alaska and former candidate for vice president, was arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstruction of justice, and resisting state law, according to a report released Saturday by the Alaska State Police.
According to the police report, he answered the phone of an acquaintance when she tried to contact the police.
Palin is currently in custody at the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility, and a $500 bond has been collected.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where, when asked about his plea, he replied with "not guilty, absolutely", according to the network.
Palin is charged with three Class A misdemeanors, punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.
He's also charged with a Class B misdemeanor, which is punishable by up to one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
It's not the first time Palin's been charged.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged assault.
The case is currently pending in the Alaska Veterans' Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstruction of justice and possession of a weapon while intoxicated in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of punching her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans' organizations in 2016 after she attributed her son's behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of his time in Iraq.
Tsunami after earthquake in Indonesia: hundreds dead
At least 384 people died after an earthquake rocked the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude quake triggered a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Power and communications networks have been cut off and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred just off the coast of central Sulawesi, northeast of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
Videos circulating on social networks from the time the wave hit the country.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors are demanding rare death sentences for suspects in New York terror attack
The New York State Attorney's Office is seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the defendant in the New York City terror attack that claimed eight lives, a rare sentence that has not been imposed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, is accused of using a rented Home Depot pickup truck for a terrorist attack in which he raced onto a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan in October, overtaking pedestrians and cyclists.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov "deliberately" killed the eight victims and "deliberately" inflicted serious bodily injury, according to the letter of intent for the death penalty claim filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both charges could be punishable by death, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Saipov on 22 counts, including eight counts of murder in the context of organized crime, which are typically used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and one count of assault and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "profound planning and intent", the prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov carried out the act as "abominable, cruel and depraved".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused damage, pain and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", the statement said.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
For over a decade, the Southern District of New York has not prosecuted a case to seek the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of the murder of two drug suppliers and was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in New York for a federal crime was in 1953 in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple convicted two years earlier of conspiring to commit espionage for the Soviet Union.
Both Rosenbergs were executed by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, who was born in Uzbekistan, showed a lack of remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to court records.
He told investigators he was comfortable with what he did, according to police.
Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to do the deed after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also demanded, according to police, that the ISIS flag be hung in his hospital room.
He pleaded not guilty to all 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "obviously disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty, rather than accepting a guilty plea in exchange for a life sentence without the possibility of parole, will only prolong the trauma that all involved are suffering", Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had asked the prosecution not to seek the death penalty.
A Conservative MP calls for NIGEL FARAGE to be transferred to the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage has vowed to mobilise the power of the people today during a protest at the Tory conference.
The former UKIP party leader said politicians must feel the pressure from Eurosceptics, while a member of Theresa May's party suggested Farage should lead the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told protesters in Birmingham that the UK would be "out" if Farage was Brexit minister.
The challenge May faces in reconciling her deeply contested party was compounded by members of her party who are in favour of remaining in the EU taking part in a separate anti-Brexit demonstration held in the city.
The Prime Minister is having trouble keeping her Chequers compromise plan on track despite attacks from Brexit supporters, opponents and the EU.
Allies insisted that despite the backlash, she should continue to try to negotiate a deal with Brussels, thus forcing Eurosceptics and the opposition Labour Party to choose between her package and the chaos.
Bone explained at the Leave Means Leave demonstration in Solihull that Chequers belongs in the garbage.
He suggested that Farage should be made a peer and given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was responsible, we'd be out by now", he explained.
The MP for Wellingborough added: "I will be in favour of Brexit, but Chequers is a piece of garbage".
He emphasised his opposition to the EU by stating: "We did not fight in world wars to be subservient.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
Bone rejected claims that public opinion has changed since the 2016 referendum: The idea that the British people have changed their minds and now want to stay in the EU is completely wrong.
Conservative Brexit advocate Andrea Jenkyns was also at the demonstration, telling reporters: "I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The compromise is unpopular in the public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular in our own party and among our activists who actually go out into the streets and make sure we get elected.
Please stop checking and start listening.
In a sharp message to May, she continued: Prime Ministers will keep their jobs if you keep your promises.
Farage said in a speech that politicians must feel the pressure if they are to cheat the decision of the 2016 referendum.
"This is a question of trust between us, the people, and our political class", Farage said.
They are trying to cheat Brexit and that is why we are here today to tell them: you will not get away with it.
He went on to say to an enthusiastic crowd: "I want you to feel the pressure on our political class, which is about to betray Brexit.
'We are mobilizing the power of the people of this country who helped us win the referendum and will never rest until we are an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.'
At the same time, anti-Brexit protesters marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A few activists waved banners for the Tories Against Brexit group, a group of anti-Brexit people within May's party that was launched over the weekend.
Lord Adonis, the Labour Party's peer, made fun of the Tories for having security problems with a party app at the opening of the conference.
"These are the people who are telling us that they can make sure that the IT systems, as well as all the technology for Canada Plus Plus, for the smooth border, for free trade without borders, are in place in Ireland", said Adonis.
This is a farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit, he added.
Warren plans to scrutinize the presidential candidacy
US Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would "carefully consider" the presidential candidacy after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at a Saturday meeting with voters in western Massachusetts.
Warren, an outspoken critic of President Donald Trump, is currently in the race for re-election to the Senate against Republican Massachusetts congressman Geoff Diehl, who was the vice chairman of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She has been the focus of speculation that she might challenge Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holyoke was their 36th meeting with voters in what's known as the Town Hall format since Trump took office.
One of the people present asked her if she wanted to run for president.
Warren replied that it was time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and that includes women in leadership.
Arrested after shooting LSU player Sims to death
Baton Rouge, Louisiana, police announced Saturday that they have arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced at a press conference that they had arrested 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at 11:00 a.m. Eastern time.
They had released a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help in identifying the man seen in the footage.
20-year-old Sims was shot Friday morning near the campus of Southern University.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and died as a result", police chief Murphy J. Paul told reporters on Saturday, according to sports media portal 247sports.
Wayde tried to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being at the scene of the crime, possession of a weapon, and shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
The 6-foot-9, 200-pound Sims grew up in Baton Rouge and played in 32 games with 10 starts last season, averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title after his team left him the victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas landed in qualifying ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was clear that Mercedes' stable orders would play a big role in the race.
From pole position, Bottas made a good start and it was almost as if he was leading Hamilton as he defended his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his team-mate.
Vettel went into the pitch first and let Hamilton crash into traffic at the end of the field, a decision that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes went into the pits a lap later and landed behind Vettel, but Hamilton overtook him after a tight wheel-to-wheel maneuver, in which the Ferrari driver reluctantly released the inside, with the risk of holding out after two moves to defend the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from one of the back seats of the field and was seventh on his 21st birthday after the end of the first round.
He was then the fastest for much of the race as he held onto his tyres to finish fast and overtake Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He eventually went into the box in the 44th round and failed to make a step in the remaining eight rounds, while Raikkonen finished fourth.
It was a difficult day, as Valtteri had been doing a great job all weekend and acting like a real gentleman when he was about to let me pass.
The team did an excellent job to win a double, said Hamilton.
A case of really bad body language
President Donald Trump made fun of Senator Dianne Feinstein at a campaign rally on Saturday for insisting she had not released a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
At the event in West Virginia, President Ford did not directly address Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that the proceedings in the Senate show that people are "mean, evil, and dishonest".
"One thing that could happen and the wonderful thing that has happened in the Senate over the last few days is when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and mean and vicious and dishonest", the president said.
When you look at the leaks and you say, "Oh, that wasn't me.
It wasn't me.
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, were you responsible for the leak?
Think about your answer -- did you publish the document -- oh, oh, what?
Oh, no, I'm not going to.
I didn't publish it.
Okay, one moment please.
"Did we... no, we didn't publish it", he added, imitating the senator's voice.
Feinstein was tapped into the letter with Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh in July and it was released in early September, though Feinstein denies the leak came from her office.
"I didn't cover up Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't publish your story", Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
She asked me to keep the letter secret and I complied with her request for secrecy.
Her denial didn't seem to go down well with the president, who said at the campaign rally on Saturday night: "I'll tell you one thing, that was very bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen.
In his continued defense of the judge candidate accused by three women of sexual assault, he claimed that the Democrats were using the accusations for their own ends.
They are determined to recapture power by any means necessary.
You see the meanness, the malice, they don't care who they hurt when they get caught under the wheels to get power and control", the president said, according to media reports.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants and the rest of the league
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars made up for Friday's defeat in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants with a 5-3 win in Saturday's replay in Dundee.
The Giants took the lead early with two goals, after hits by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought home the tie before Dwyer restored the Giants' lead.
Francois Bouchard was equal to Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory with two goals.
This was for Adam Keefe's men, who unexpectedly beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night, their third defeat in the Elite League this season.
This was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
Dwyers' opening goal came in the fourth minute at 3:35 minutes after a Kendall McFaull delivery. Four minutes later, David Rutherford delivered the delivery as Beauvillier extended the lead.
In this exciting opening period, Sullivan brought home the team back into the game after 13:10 minutes before Matt Marquardt helped Cownie to its goal after 15:16.
Dwyer secured the Giants' lead before halftime when he scored his second goal of the evening just before the end of the first half.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard again equaled with a power-play goal in the 28th minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the game late in the second half, and Nielsen secured his team's victory with a fifth goal just after half time.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, play at home next Friday at Milton Keynes Stadium.
Air traffic controller died after making sure that hundreds of people escaped the earthquake in a plane
An Indonesian air traffic controller is being hailed as a hero after he died trying to get a plane with hundreds of people on board safely off the ground.
More than 800 people died and many are missing after the island of Sulawesi was rocked by a devastating earthquake on Friday that triggered a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks are still being felt in the region and many people are trapped under rubble in the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the highly unstable control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He stayed to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could take off safely.
He jumped off the tower when he thought he was going to fall.
Agung later died in hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, a spokesman for the Indonesian Air Safety Service, said that this decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australia's ABC News.
We have deployed a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter could reach Palu.
We are deeply concerned by this news", he added.
At the same time, authorities fear the death toll could rise to several thousand, and the country's disaster management agency said access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The number is expected to rise as many bodies are still under the rubble, while others cannot be reached", said agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves as high as 20 feet have devastated Palu, which is scheduled to hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft carrying relief and supply items.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: Every minute a new ambulance is arriving with dead people.
Clean drinking water is scarce.
Supermarkets are being looted everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help survivors, but we don't know what they'll find there.
This is a tragedy, but it could be much worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and, in a speech to the country's military, said: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the tasks associated with the evacuation.
Are you ready?
This year, Indonesia was already hit by earthquakes in Lombok, killing over 550 people.
Air Niugini reports one missing person after plane crash in Laguna
The airline that operated the flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia is now reporting a missing person after initially claiming that all 47 passengers and crew had been safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that it could not say anything about the whereabouts of a passenger until Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew members after the plane plunged into the water while attempting to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials said seven people had to be taken to a hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in hospital on Saturday but were in stable condition.
The cause and the exact course of the accident remained unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both stated that the plane landed in the lagoon just outside the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane flew out of the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was flying very flat.
"That's a very good thing", Jaynes said.
Jaynes explained that he and others were able to wade through hip-deep water to the emergency exits on the sides of the sinking plane.
He said the flight attendants panicked and screamed and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working nearby on improvements to a docking site rushed in with an inflatable boat to help get people to shore before the plane sank into about 100 feet (30 m) of water.
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people were killed in crashes involving airlines registered in Papua New Guinea, none of which involved Air Niugini.
Analyst reconstructing the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecution concluded its evidentiary hearing Saturday in a retrial of a case involving a man accused of banishing a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert in the field of information analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used cell phone calls to reconstruct the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of her death.
Rowlett said he had obtained location data from several cell phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers on the night of her death, contradicting his earlier statements, according to the Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers during the period he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police spoke to Sanford.
Sanford testified Saturday that he was out of town that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he claimed to have been in Sanford's pickup that night, Sandford said he had lied because my pickup was in Nashville.
Another contradiction was that Tellis said she had known Chambers for two weeks at the time of her death.
But cell phone records indicate they've known each other for a week.
Rowlett explained that Tellis was taking their messages, calls and contact information from his cell phone some time after Chambers' death.
He's erased her from his life, Hale says.
The defense is expected to begin its pleadings on Sunday.
The judge assumes that the trial will then proceed to the jury that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
A hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed of Bristol claim that hip hop has moved away from its roots of political messaging and social engagement.
They want to go back to its roots and make hip hop socially conscious again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently experienced a renaissance in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
New York nanny sues couple for being fired after racist text messages
A New York nanny is suing a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a misdirected message from her mother complaining that she was "still black".
The couple denied being racist and likened the legal battle to "blackmail".
Double mother Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman expressed her dismay when she found out that the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, was black when she started her first day of work in 2016.
"Neeeeeeeeeeee, not a black one", Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
Instead of sending this to her husband, she sent the message to Maurice.
After recognizing her faux pas, the "embarrassed" Plasco-Flaxman fired Maurice, claiming that the open-minded African-American nanny had done a bad job and had expected a Filipino instead, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for her day's work and then sent home by Uber.
Now Maurice is suing the couple for compensation for the dismissal and claims compensation for the $350 a day she was paid over the six months of the job she was originally booked for, but without a contract, and for which she would have lived with the couple.
"I want to show them, look, you don't do that", she told the newspaper on Friday, "I know it's discrimination".
The couple rejected the accusations of racism, arguing that the dismissal was the sensible step, as they feared Maurice would not be able to trust them after they had offended them.
My wife sent her something she didn't want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists, husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
But would you trust your children to someone who was rude to them, even if it was by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on, now.
Plasco compared the legal battle to a "blackmail" and explained that his wife was expecting a baby in just two months and was "in a difficult situation".
You want to sue someone like that?
This is not very nice, the investment banker added.
As the legal battle continued, the couple were quickly condemned in public and denounced on social media, where they were criticized for their behavior and logic.
Paddington publishers feared readers wouldn't identify with a talking bear, a new letter reveals
Karen Jankel, the daughter of author Michael Bond, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: It is difficult to understand someone who reads it for the first time before it is published.
Today, it's very funny with our current knowledge of Paddington's huge success.
She said her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired to write the children's book by a little toy bear, would have had no problem with his work being rejected, adding that the 60th anniversary of the publication after his death last year was "bitter-sweet".
She explained that your father was secretly proud of Paddington's success, whom she describes as "a very important member of the family".
He was a very quiet man, and did not brag, so Jankel.
But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child who did something special: you're proud, even if it wasn't really your own achievement.
I think that's how he saw Paddington's success.
Although he invented and created it, he always gave Paddington himself responsibility for its success.
My daughter died and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
After the landing, her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to say that it looked really bad and that the doctors gave her little chance", says Ednan-Laperouse.
Then I got a call from Nad, telling me that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I told her, "Tashi, I love you so much, my darling".
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medication the doctors gave her to keep her heart pumping was slowly working and leaving her body.
She had died shortly before and this was the moment when it all came crashing down.
I couldn't do anything but wait while I knew what was going on.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by family and other people.
I really had to pull myself together.
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, now grieving the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, who had no idea what she was going through.
"No one knew", she said.
I had my head bowed and tears were running down my cheeks the whole time.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt this overwhelming feeling of sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.
Mourning women hang cards to prevent suicides on bridges
Two women who lost loved ones to suicide try to stop others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelley Humphreys hung up cards on a bridge in Wales with inspirational messages and phone numbers for counseling services.
Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and was just 18 when he committed suicide.
"I don't want parents to feel like I feel every day", she explained.
Davis, 45, of Lydney, explained that her son had a promising career as a chef and that he had an infectious smile.
Everyone knew him for his smile.
Everyone said his smile could brighten a room.
However, he quit his job before his death, as he was in a really dark place.
In 2014, Tyler's body was found by his then 11-year-old brother after he committed suicide.
Davis explained: "I always feared that this might have consequences".
Davis designed the cards to show people that there are people you can go to and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't keep quiet: we have to talk about it.
Humphreys, who has been friends with Davies for years, lost her partner of 15 years, Mark, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say he was feeling down or depressed", she explained.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
On Christmas Day, he was at his lowest point, and when the kids unwrapped their presents, he didn't look them in the eye or anything.
She said that his death was a great trauma for her, but that it was a huge hole in the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we all have to keep going and fight.

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance as the FBI begins its investigation.
"I thought if we could actually get something like what he asked for, which is a limited investigation in time and scope, then maybe we could get some consensus", Flake said on Saturday.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their reluctance can be traced to the timing alone.
The midterm elections on November 6 are only five weeks away, and if the Republicans do as badly as expected, they would be significantly weakened in their attempts to elect their husband to the nation's highest court.
George W. Bush grabbed the answering machine to call Senators and persuade them to support Kavanaugh, who had worked for Bush at the White House and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI submits its report?
There's a vote in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It's still unclear if Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to decide by a unanimous vote and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean defectors 'sinking' under Kim
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean politician.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South Korean Ministry of Unification, said that 1,127 defectors were registered last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park cited tighter border controls between North Korea and China and higher prices for human smugglers as the main factors.
Pyongyang has not commented publicly on this.
The vast majority of North Korean defectors are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says that since the end of the Korean War in 1953, over 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally.
Most are fleeing through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than the heavily guarded demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Korean states.
China views defectors as illegal immigrants rather than refugees, and often forcibly returns them.
Relations between the North and the South, which are technically still at war, have improved considerably in recent months.
At the beginning of the month, the two leaders met in Pyongyang for talks on the halted denuclearization negotiations.
This came as a result of the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June, where they agreed in general to work towards a denuclearized Korean Peninsula.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the lack of progress on the US sanctions.
"Without the United States, we have no confidence in our national security and in such circumstances it is impossible for us to disarm unilaterally first", said Mir Ri in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he's not fit to serve on the Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was character-inappropriate for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but get the impression that a woman who did this would be called 'hysterical,'" Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied all allegations that he sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost screaming and almost bursting into tears as he talked about his family and his high school days.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats on the committee, calling the allegations against him a "grotesque and coordinated reputation killing" organized by liberals angry over Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential defeat.
Pelosi said she believes Kavanaugh's testimony proves he is unfit to serve on the Supreme Court because it shows he is biased against Democrats.
"I think he's declared himself unfit with these statements and the way he's been slandering the Clintons and the Democrats", she explained.
Pelosi hesitated when asked if she would try to remove Kavanaugh from office if he was confirmed and the Democrats won a majority in the House.
"I'm going to say this: If he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's not only unfit for the Supreme Court, but for his current position", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a federal appeals court judge in Washington, D.C.
Pelosi went on to say that as a Democrat, she is concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions against the Affordable Care Act or the abortion-based Roe v. Wade decision, as he is viewed as a conservative judge.
In his hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would revise certain Supreme Court decisions.
"We don't need a hysterical, biased person coming to this court and expecting us to say, 'Oh, that's not wonderful,'" Pelosi said.
Women have to use it as a weapon.
It's a sincere hate speech, months and years of over-boiling anger and she doesn't get it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry", Steinem told me 45 years later.
I don't think that's rare, do you?
She continued: "I was helped a lot by a woman who was a manager somewhere and said that she cries when she gets angry, but she developed a technique, and when she gets angry and starts crying, she says to the person she was talking to, "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm mad at you.
And then just keep talking.
I thought it was great.
Tears are allowed as an outlet for anger, in part because they're completely misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories is of a former job in a male-dominated office, where one day I was crying out of indescribable rage and was grabbed by an older woman, a hypothermic manager, who I was always a little afraid of, by her collar and dragged up a flight of stairs.
"Never let them see you cry", she told me.
They don't know you're pissed off.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy with themselves, because they think you're going to the drug.
Patricia Schroeder, then a congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential bids.
In 1987, when Hart was caught having an extramarital affair aboard a ship called Monkey Business and subsequently withdrew his candidacy, the deeply frustrated Schroeder thought that there was no reason not to consider the idea of running for president himself.
"It was not a well-thought-out decision", she told me 30 years later with a laugh.
There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called the situation "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".
With the campaign already well underway, she was behind on fundraising and she vowed not to run unless she could raise $2 million.
It was a hopeless fight.
She found out that some of her supporters, who gave the men $1,000, were only giving her campaign $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she wondered.
In the speech announcing that she would not launch an official campaign, she was so overwhelmed by her emotions, gratitude for her supporters, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise funds and address voters directly instead of delegates, and anger at sexism, that she was close to tears.
"You could have assumed I was having a nervous breakdown", Schroeder recalls of the press reactions.
You'd think the handkerchief company Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember wondering what they would write on my headstone.
She was crying?
Why Beijing could benefit from a US-China trade war
The opening ointments of the US-China trade war were deafening, and although the battle is far from over, Beijing could benefit from a gulf between the countries in the long run, my experts say.
Donald Trump, the American president, fired the first warning shot earlier this year when he imposed punitive tariffs on key Chinese exports, including solar cells, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation came this week with new punitive tariffs on goods worth $200 billion, effectively affecting half of all goods imported from China to the United States.
Beijing has responded in the same way each time, recently levying punitive tariffs of five to 10 percent on $60 billion worth of American goods.
China has vowed to respond to any action by the United States, and it is unlikely that the world's second-largest economy will stumble anytime soon.
To persuade Washington to bend would be to yield, but to publicly bow to the United States would be too shameful for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts believe that if Beijing plays its cards well, China could benefit from the effects of the trade war in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in either Washington or Beijing could create the conditions for economic turmoil in both countries is actually much more dangerous than many observers have previously realized", says Abigail Grace, an Asia-focused scholar at the Center for New American Security.
The EU is also committed to the implementation of the UN Security Council Resolution on the situation of refugees in Syria.
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is asking for help to rebuild the country devastated by more than seven years of war.
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in the country were improving.
'Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism', he said.
The government is rebuilding the areas destroyed by terrorists to return to normalcy.
The Commission is also concerned about the situation in the Middle East, which is a major source of unemployment and the situation in the Middle East.
The UN estimates that over 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian government welcomes help in rebuilding the devastated country.
He stressed, however, that it would not accept any conditional aid from countries that had supported the insurgency.
Europe has won the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup and defeated Team USA by a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National near Paris.
The United States has now lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown after Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached the 14.5 points it needed to beat the USA.
American star Phil Mickelson, who had problems for much of the tournament, sank his shot at the 16th hole (par 3) in the water and lost to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari excelled in all his rounds, becoming one of only four players to score 5-0-0 since the tournament began in its current format in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was beaten 5:4 by the lowest ranked player in Team Europe, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's highest ranked player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2-1 to England's Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
Spanishman Sergio Garcia, an eight-time Ryder Cup veteran, became the best European Ryder Cup player of all time with 25.5 career points.
I don't usually cry, but I couldn't help myself today.
It's been a tough year.
I'm so grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I'm so happy to win the trophy back.
It's about the team and I'm happy to have contributed", said the emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He passes the torch to his compatriot John Rahm, who won 2-1 against American golfing legend Tiger Woods on Sunday in the singles.
I am so incredibly proud to have beaten Tiger Woods, whom I have watched on television since I was a child, says 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his games in France and now has a Ryder Cup record of 13-21-3.
A strange statistic for one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 major titles and is only surpassed by Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA had trouble finding the fairways all weekend except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who performed exceptionally well throughout the tournament.
American captain Jim Furyk said after a disappointing performance by his team: "I'm proud of the boys, they fought.
There was a moment this morning when we put pressure on Europe.
We didn't make any money.
Hats off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players put in a good performance.
We're gonna regroup, I'm gonna talk to the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and we're gonna look ahead.
I love these 12 boys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You gotta pull the hat.
We were defeated.
Red tide update: Concentrations are decreasing in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows that there is a general decline in red tide concentrations in parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, more gaping flowering conditions are being recorded in the Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties, indicating declining concentrations.
A red algae bloom extends along about 130 miles of coastline from north of Pinellas to south of Lee County.
Spots can be found about 10 miles off the coast of Hillsborough County, but in fewer places than the previous week.
A red tide was also observed in Pasco County.
In the past week, moderate concentrations have been reported in or off the coast of Pinellas County, low to high concentrations off the coast of Manatee County, background to high concentrations in or off the coast of Charlotte County, background to high concentrations in or off the coast of Lee County, and low concentrations in Collier County.
Respiratory complaints continue to be reported from Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties.
No new respiratory problems have been reported in northwest Florida over the past week.
