This not only proves the already widespread theory that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, but it also provides more detail than fossils, such as color and three-dimensional placement.
Scientists say the animal's skin was chestnut brown with a pale or carotenoid undercoat.
The find also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
The researchers concluded that the rachis was likely a later evolutionary development, since dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed shaft, or rachis, but they do have other features of feathers - such as hooves.
The structure of the feathers seems to indicate that they were not used to fly, but to regulate temperature or to control its appearance. The researchers suggested that this is the tail of a young dinosaur, but that this specimen actually shows adult feathers and thus not the thundering of a chick.
The researchers suggested that, despite the tail being that of a young dinosaur, the specimen had the plumage of an adult and not the thump of a chick.

The work completed was mainly theoretical in nature, but the program was written for the simulation of observations of the Sagittarius Galaxy.
The team was looking for the effect that would be caused by the tidal forces between the dark matter of the universe and that of the galaxy.
Similar to the way the moon exerts force on the earth, causing tides, the Milky Way exerts force on the constellation Sagittarius.
The researchers concluded that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter.
According to this theory, most of the dark matter in a galaxy is surrounded by a circle of some kind, and it is made up of a large number of smaller particles.

In France, voting has traditionally required little technology: voters go into a booth and put a pre-printed piece of paper in an envelope that says which candidate they are voting for.
Officials first check the identity of the voter, then the voter slips the envelope into the ballot box and then he puts his signature under the ballot.
The process is relatively narrowly defined in the French electoral law.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have had to be transparent, so that both voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes in them at the beginning of the vote and that no envelopes are added other than those of registered and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to witness each part of the process, and volunteers count the votes in the evening under strict supervision and following specific procedures.

This is common practice in the rest of the UK, but justice in Scotland works differently and courts have deemed the publication of photographs to be potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee observes that "journalists play a dangerous game when they publish photographs, etc., of suspects".
The Crown Office has overall control of prosecutions and has told journalists that no further statements will be made, at least until charges are brought.
Sources say the document refers to a dispute settlement, something the Palestinians wanted based on the borders before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other topics discussed included the future status of Jerusalem, a city sacred to both nations, and the problems in the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for 10 years after signing an agreement, but the PA is only willing to stay for five years.
The shooters in the additional pest control trial had to be closely monitored by forest rangers, as the trial was monitored and its effectiveness assessed.
In a collaboration between the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited for the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting programme.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of park preservation and heritage at the NPWS, the four selected shooters received extensive safety and training training for the first shooting operation.
Yesterday Martelly swore in a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
Martelly has been awarded a CEP five times in the last four years.
Last month, the presidential commission recommended the dismissal of the previous National Electoral Council as part of a package of measures to bring about new elections in the country.
The committee was set up by Martelly in response to widespread anti-government protests since October.
The sometimes violent protests were sparked by the absence of elections, some of which should have been held as early as 2011.
There have been about 60 reported cases of faulty iPods overheating, resulting in a total of six fires and four people with minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported 34 additional incidents of overheating that the company called "not serious".
"Very regrettable", was the department's response to Apple's delay in reporting.
Mariana was hit by the earthquake at 07:19 local time (Friday 2119 GMT).
The Northern Mariana Islands Disaster Management Agency said no damage was reported nationwide.
In addition, the National Tsunami Warning Center reported that there was no tsunami warning.
In Manila, the capital of the Philippines, a former Philippine police officer took hostage Hong Kong tourists by hijacking their bus.
Rolando Mendoza shot the tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six deaths have been confirmed so far.
Six hostages were released earlier, including the children and the elderly, and the Filipino photographers.
Later, the photographers returned in exchange for an elderly woman who had to go to the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and entered the medical profession.
Trained as a midwife, he joined the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins spent his free time researching premature birth.
His research showed that the maturing of fetal lungs in babies was accelerated by the administration of a hormone.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two "black boxes" of flight recorders on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme, my first manager, Luna died on the night of two moons, as unique as she was, a strong woman".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels indicated that "Luna was as weird as I am... maybe even weirder... I love her and I'm gonna miss her... hopefully she's in a better place".
Of the 1,400 people polled for the 2010 federal election, the number of people who opposed Australia becoming a republic rose by 8 percent since 2008.
Resigning Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that Australia should become a republic after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
Thirty-four percent of those surveyed were in favour of this view, and they want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
Twenty-nine percent of respondents thought Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and at the other end, 31 percent said it should never happen.
The Olympic gold medalist swam the 100 and 200-meter freestyle and three relay events during the Commonwealth Games, but his condition was called into question because of his complaints.
He couldn't take the medication he needed to ease his pain because it's banned at the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a professor of mathematics and computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25.
Several people verified the discovery in early February using various hardware and software and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets could have been a source of water on Earth, along with organic material that forms proteins and supports life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially the earth, which has been struck by comets for a long time.
Cuomo, 53, was inaugurated as governor earlier this year and signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage last month.
He called the gossip "political nonsense and gossip".
There is speculation that he may run for president in 2016.
The NextGen system, according to the FAA, would allow aircraft to fly shorter routes, saving millions of tons of fuel annually for lower carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology, as opposed to older technologies with ground-based radar, which allows air traffic controllers to locate aircraft much better, and they can provide pilots with clearer information.
No additional transport is used and no underground trains stop at Wembley; in addition, the car parks and the P&R are not accessible on site.
A possible lack of transportation made it more likely that the match would be played behind closed doors and without fans.
A study published Tuesday in the scientific journal Science examined the formation of a new bird species on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that new species evolved within two generations, a process thought to take much longer because crossing a native Darwin's finch, the Middle Finch, with an immigrant Cactus finch, the Española finch, took longer.
Gold can be machined into many shapes.
It can be drawn into a narrow thread that can be spun and braided, or it can be forged or rolled into sheets.
After it is very thin, it can be glued to another metal, and it can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted illustrations in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called the pH of a chemical, and you're already making an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Then the color of the cabbage juice changes based on the acidity (acid to basic or alkaline) of the chemical.
The amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the test chemical is used to determine the pH value.
Hydrogen atoms are made up of one proton and one electron, and hydrogen ions are protons without electrons.
Mix both dry powders together, get your hands wet and clean, and make a ball of it.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, which feels weird and forms a kind of envelope.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjodaro, almost every home had a flush toilet connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Sewer remnants have been found in houses in the Minoan cities on the Greek islands of Crete and Santorini.
Toilets were also used in ancient China, Egypt, and Persia, and in the Roman era, toilets were often part of a public bathhouse, where both ladies and gentlemen met in a mixed group.
When you call someone who's thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
As soon as the space satellite receives the call, it's sent back immediately.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket, and scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and image.
To launch a satellite or telescope into space, you need a huge rocket that is over 100 feet long.
The wheel has changed the world incredibly, and the most important thing that the wheel has given us is easier and faster transportation.
The train, the car and many other means of transport are the result.
There are medium-sized felines among those medium-sized prey, from hares to antelopes to deer.
In addition, many small cats (such as stray cats kept as pets) hunt small prey in larger numbers, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
Their success stems from the idea of a niche, a special job that each cat has that keeps them from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of cats and live in large groups called troops.
Troops consist of one to three adult males that are related to each other and also have up to thirty females and cubs.
The women are normally closely related and form a large family of sisters and daughters.
A pack of lions behaves much the same as a pack of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not to other large cats), and that are very lethal to their prey.
A versatile athlete, the tiger can climb (though not well), swim, jump long distances, and has five times the traction of a strong person.
The tiger belongs to the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four felines are the only ones who can roar.
A tiger doesn't roar with full power like a lion, it's more like it's roaring a whole sentence.
The ocelots' favorite food is small animals, which they catch if they can, such as monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds.
Scientists suspect that ocelots use their sense of smell to hunt small animals (their prey) by sniffing the soil where they have been.
They have excellent night vision and move very quietly in the dark, hunting prey by blending in with the environment and then jumping on their prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) breaks away from the large population from which they came (for example, by moving over a mountain range or river, or when they are moved to another island from which they cannot easily return), they often find themselves in a different environment than before.
In this new environment, there are different resources and different enemies, so the new population must change or adapt to face the competition.
Because they still need the same adjustments as before, the original population hasn't changed at all.
As the new population began to adapt to the new environment, they also began to look less and less like the other populations.
After thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will be so different in appearance that you can no longer call them the same species.
This process, called speciation, simply involves the formation of new species, and it is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that people breathe and they take in the carbon dioxide that people exhale.
By means of photosynthesis, plants extract nutrients from the sun and provide shade.
Our homes and our clothes are made of plants, and we eat mostly plants, and without plants, animals wouldn't survive.
Mosasaurus was at the top of the food chain at the time, and he had nothing to fear from anyone except other Mosasaurs.
His long jaws had over 70 razor-sharp teeth, plus an extra set in the palate, which means nothing or no one could escape him.
It's not certain, but it's possible that his tongue was forked, eating turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and maybe even his own kind.
In water, too, nothing was safe from the attacks; giant dinosaurs like the Tyrannosaurus Rex were no match for him.
While most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans also had their share of strange or unusual delicacies, including boars, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called a slug.
There was another difference, too: Poor people and women sat on chairs while eating, but rich men liked to have a banquet together where they would lie on their sides while eating.
Meals from ancient Rome do not contain foods that came to Europe in later centuries from the Americas or Asia.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever ate a turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for all their gods, and this temple was seen as the house of that god.
Sacrifices were offered to the gods, and the priests tried to meet the needs of the gods by organizing ceremonies and feasts.
Each temple had a public courtyard and a rear room that was only accessible to priests.
Sometimes pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
Houses were not of great importance in the warm climate of the Middle East.
The daily life of the Hebrew family was often outside.
Women cooked in the garden; shops were nothing more than a counter along the street.
The land of Canaan lacked extensive forests, and wood was very expensive.
Greenland was still sparsely populated, and according to Norse mythology, Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, found Greenland on his way west, and gave it his name.
He made this discovery, but there were Eskimos living there at the time.
Although all of them were 'Scandinavian' countries, the people, the royal family, customs and history of Sweden, Iceland, Denmark and Norway were very different from one another.
You might think, after watching the movie National Treasure, that there's a treasure map on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
But that is a misconception, because there is something written on the back, but it is not a treasure map.
The back of the Declaration of Independence reads "Original American Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776".
While no one is sure who wrote it, it is certain that the large parchment (about 293⁄4 by 241⁄2 inches) was formerly rolled up for storage.
So it seems that the designation was simply added as a kind of label.
The D-Day landings and the fighting that followed liberated the north of France, but the south remained occupied.
It was ruled by Vichy France, and these were Frenchmen who in 1940 sided with the Germans and thus allied with the enemy instead of fighting against them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France with Operation Dragoon.
The Americans and the Free French had liberated the south of France in just two weeks, then they marched on Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a large group of people who live and work together in a society.
From the Latin civilis, which means civil, comes the term civilization, related to the Latin civis, which in turn stands for citizen, and civitas, which means city or city-state; and that also defines in a certain way the format of society.
A civilization with a culture suggests that knowledge is passed down over several generations, a lasting cultural footprint and balanced distribution.
When minority cultures disappear, they often leave behind no relevant historical evidence, and thus are not officially recognized as civilizations.
During the Revolution, thirteen states under the Articles of Confederation formed a weak central government, consisting only of a congress.
Congress lacked the power to levy taxes because it had no national executive or judicial branch and relied on state authorities, often unwilling to cooperate, to enforce all decisions.
Nor did it have the power to ignore tax laws and tariffs between states.
First, all states had to agree unanimously to the articles before they could be amended, but the states did not take the national government so seriously that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is the second most successful team in the world, along with the German team, and won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are especially popular in the northern regions, where Italians participate in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan consists of nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the seventh largest island in the world.
Because of the cluster/group of islands that Japan has, Japan is often referred to geographically as a "peninsula"
Taiwan's history dates back to the 15th century, when European sailors sailed past the island and named it Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch VOC established a base in southwestern Taiwan, where the VOC took over the native grain production processes and employed Chinese workers on rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan were conquered by Qing Dynasty (1644-1912), after which Taiwan was incorporated as a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
After the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, transferring sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Made up of three large structures, Machu Picchu consists of Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Three-Window Room.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what they used to look like.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the restoration is still ongoing.
For example, the most common still image format worldwide is 35 mm, which was the standard film format at the end of the analogue film era.
These are still produced today, although it is mainly the ratio of the image that the digital camera's image sensor took over.
Oddly enough, 35 mm film is actually 36 mm wide, at a height of 24 mm.
The aspect ratio of this size (divided by 12 to get the simplest ratio of whole numbers) would then be 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. APS-like formats) are equal to or close approximations of this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, which is often abused and ridiculed by many, is a simple guideline that makes the image dynamic, yet clear.
The most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines, so you divide the image vertically and horizontally into three (see example).
During this period in European history, the rich and powerful Catholic Church was under attack.
For over a thousand years, Christianity united European nations despite differences in language and customs.
From the king to the common citizen, his all-pervading power affected everyone.
One of the main principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to combat suffering and poverty, and the church has funds for this purpose.
The church had been the central authority in Rome for over a thousand years, and this balance of power and money led many to question whether this principle was being followed.
Britain imposed a naval blockade on Germany shortly after the outbreak of hostilities.
The strategy proved effective, as it prevented the delivery of vital supplies to military and civilian personnel, but this blockade did violate the generally accepted international law laid down in various international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain has placed mines in international waters to prevent ships from sailing in whole parts of the ocean, which was dangerous even for neutral ships.
Because of the limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestrained submarine warfare.
During the 1920's, most citizens and nations had an attitude of pacifism and isolation.
After World War I, nations wanted to prevent such horrors from ever happening again.
Tesla emigrated to the United States in 1884 to work at the Edison Company in New York City.
When he came to the United States, he had only 4 cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former boss) for Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of representing different time periods; each phase of China or each ruling family had a distinctive dynasty.
The most famous was the Three Kingdoms period, which took place in the 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties in China.
At that time, fierce wars were fought between various nobles vying for the throne.
In the history of ancient China, the Three Kingdoms era is one of the bloodiest in recorded history, with thousands of people dying in the battle for the highest place in the great palace in Xi'an.
The Revolution had major social and political consequences, such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolute monarchy to republicanism, nationalism, and the view that the country belongs to its inhabitants rather than a single leader.
All male applicants were offered positions after the revolution, allowing the most ambitious and suitable candidates to succeed.
The same goes for the military, where the ranks are no longer based on a person's class but on the caliber of the person.
The French Revolution also inspired the oppressed working class to revolt in other countries.
Muhammad was intensely concerned with supernatural matters, and he often went to a cave that later became known as the Cave of Hira in the Nour Mountains for contemplation.
The cave itself, which has stood the test of time, gives a very vivid picture of the spirituality of Muhammad.
The cave is located on one of the mountain peaks on the north side of Mecca and is completely cut off from the rest of the world.
Even if the cave was known to exist, it was not easy to find it, because once inside the cave, there is total isolation.
All that can be seen is the clear, beautiful sky and the many surrounding mountains.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders of the world still standing.
The Great Pyramid was built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E. and is one of the countless large pyramid structures in honor of a deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau or 'Pyramids of Giza' in Egypt's Valley of the Dead contains several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), several small tombs, a number of temples, and the great sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and relatives.
The up-bow sign looks like a V and the down-bow sign looks like a wedge or a square with no bottom.
Top means start at the tip and push away the stick, bottom means start at the bow frog (where your hand holds the stick) and pull the stick.
An upward movement usually produces a softer sound, while a downward movement produces a stronger and more assertive sound.
Take the liberty of sketching your own personal lines, but remember that the printed lines are there for a musical purpose, so they usually need to be respected.
A group of market women were behind the departure of the terrified Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette and their two young children (Marie Therese, 11, and Louis-Charles, 4), and the king's sister, Madame Elizabeth, from Versailles to Paris on October 6, 1789.
They drove back to the French capital in a carriage, surrounded by howling and threatening mobs that threatened the royal couple.
The actions of the crowd forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriage completely.
At one point, someone in the crowd held up the head of a royal guard who had been murdered in Versailles before the eyes of a terrified queen.
The war costs of US imperialism in connection with the conquest of the Philippines have been paid by the people of the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to finance a large part of the cost and the interest on bonds was issued through the banks on Wall Street in the name of the Philippine government.
American imperialism relied largely on the enormous profits of its long-term exploitation of the Philippines.
To understand the Templars, one must know the context that gave rise to the order.
The era in which this happened is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, the European history of the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The early Middle Ages were followed by the High Middle Ages, which usually ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term for a wide range of ideas in practice: from technology supply or technological obligation to a strict sense that human fate is driven by an underlying logic that is linked to scientific laws and their appearance in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism have these two general views: that the development of technology follows a trajectory that for the most part extends beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has 'effects' on societies that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, some will say that the arrival of the car automatically leads to the building of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically feasible for only a few cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The mass car ownership also leads to a higher number of road accidents and this leads to the development of new healthcare techniques to repair the human body.
The Romantic movement included a large part of cultural determinism, which came from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the Romantic period, geography shaped the individual and over time, customs and cultures arose as a result of this geography, forming a harmonious society and superior to arbitrarily imposed laws.
Constantinople was seen as the fashion capital of feudal Europe, as Paris is the fashion capital today.
From about 400 AD to about 1100 AD, it was known as an epicenter of luxury.
The empire's status declined in the 12th century, largely because the Crusaders returned with silk and spices more valuable than what the Byzantine markets could offer.
Around this time, Paris also took over the title of fashion capital from Constantinople.
Gothic reached its heyday in the 10th, 11th, and 14th centuries.
Clothing was initially strongly influenced by Byzantine culture from the east.
However, due to the slow communication channels, styles in the West were 25 to 30 years behind.
In the late Middle Ages, a distinctive style began to develop in Western Europe, one of the greatest developments being the result of the Crusades: people began to use buttons to fasten their clothes.
Self-sufficient agriculture is agriculture in which enough food is produced to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Livelihoods farming is a simple system, usually organic, that uses stored seed from the ecoregion, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
In the past, most farmers worked in self-sufficient agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel neglected by societal norms, giving them the opportunity to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished by the age, ethnicity, social class, location and/or gender of their members.
A subculture can be defined by the following types of qualities: linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic or one or more of these factors together.
Members of a subculture often show which group they belong to by a certain symbolic style in what they wear, in how they behave, and in the jargon they speak.
One of the most commonly used methods of illustrating the importance of socialization was the few deplorable cases of children who were not socialized by adults through neglect, setbacks or deliberate abuse during their upbringing.
Some wolf children have been locked up by humans (usually their own parents); sometimes this child was abandoned because the parents did not want to accept the child's severe mental or physical limitation.
Unruly children may have experienced severe child abuse or severe trauma before they were abandoned or walked away.
Others are said to have been raised by animals, and some are said to have lived alone in the wilderness.
A feral child not raised by humans may exhibit behavior similar to that of the animal that raised the child (within the physical limits), such as fear of or indifference toward humans.
Project-based learning should make education simpler and more interesting, but scaffolding goes one step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method but a tool to support individuals who are dealing with a new learning experience, for example a new computer program or who are starting a new project.
Support can be both virtual and real, and a teacher is a form of support, but so is the paper clip man in Microsoft Office.
There is a virtual scaffolding built into the software that asks questions, provides memory sticks, and explains procedures that might be difficult for students to understand without help.
There are various reasons why children enter foster care, such as neglect, abuse, and exploitation.
No child should grow up in an environment where they are not well cared for, where they are not cared for and where they cannot develop, but this is happening.
We consider the foster care system to be a safe zone for these children.
It is intended to provide a safe home, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.
In foster care, all needs that were neglected in the previous home must be met.
The Internet is a fusion of interpersonal and mass communication.
The different characteristics of the Internet lead to new dimensions in the application of the Uses & Gratifications theory.
For example, 'learning' and 'socialization' are suggested as important reasons for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord (1998) introduced new motivational aspects such as 'personal involvement' and 'lasting relationships' when they examined audience responses to websites.
Using video recording has led to some remarkable discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, which are facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is argued that no one can recognize a lie by looking at micro-expressions alone.
In his essay The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks described how people who cannot understand speech because of brain damage can accurately judge its sincerity.
He even suggested that other animal species, such as domestic dogs, also have the ability to interpret human behavior.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two groups of genetic variants: hidden and visible.
Mutation adds new genetic variation; selection eliminates this variation from the pool of expressed variation.
For each generation, there is variation between the two groups through separation and recombination.
A primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans can live on the savannah but find it difficult to obtain the necessary amino acids from the plant sources found there.
Furthermore, failure to observe it can have serious consequences: stunting, malnutrition and eventually even death.
The easiest plant sources to find are the proteins in leaves and legumes, but unless they're cooked, they're hard for primates like us to digest.
Not only is animal food (ants, termites, eggs) easily digestible, but it also contains a very high amount of protein, which contains all the essential amino acids.
All in all, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved their protein problem the same way chimpanzees on the savannah solve this problem today.
Interrupted sleep means that you wake up for a reason during your normal sleep period and fall back asleep within a short time (10-60 minutes).
This is quite easy by using a relatively soft alarm clock that brings you back to consciousness without waking you up completely right away.
If you turn off your clock in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, so you have to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options based on the biorhythm are drinking plenty of fluids before going to sleep (and especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic).
The amount of inner calmness a person has is in contrast with the amount of stress a person carries in his or her body and mind.
The less stress, the more positive the life force present, and every human being is capable of achieving contentment and total peace.
Anyone can lighten their minds, and only their own stress and negativity stand in the way of that.
Tibetan Buddhism has its basis in the teachings of Buddha, but this form of Buddhism has been extended with the Mahayana path of love and with a large number of techniques from Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism consists of a relatively simple core of kundalini yoga, meditation and an imitation of universal love.
Through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualized images, the energy of Kundalini yoga (enlightenment energy) is generated.
The core of Tibetan meditation is yoga with one deity as the focus, through the visualization of different deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras activated, and the mind is brought into an enlightened state.
Because Germany was a common enemy in World War II, a cooperation was established between the USSR and the United States. When the war ended, the conflicts between system, process and culture caused the countries to quarrel with each other.
Two years after the war ended, the former allies were facing each other, and this was the beginning of the Cold War.
The war would last 40 years and proxy wars took place on battlefields in Africa, Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
The Polish defense forces held out only until 17 September 1939, when they had to retreat and reorganize along the bridgehead in Romania.
However, these plans were overshadowed overnight when 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Union's Red Army invaded and formed the Latvian and Ukrainian fronts after occupying the eastern parts of Poland, in violation of the Peace of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Treaty and other international peace treaties that were both bilateral and multilateral.
The transport of goods by ship is the most efficient way of transporting large numbers of people and goods across the ocean.
Traditionally, the Navy's job has been to ensure that a country maintains the ability to transport people and goods while impeding the ability of the enemy to transport people and goods.
The United States tried to get men and equipment across the Atlantic to the British, and with this North Atlantic campaign of WWII, this is one of the most notable recent examples.
At the same time, the German Navy tried to stop this traffic, using mainly U-boats.
Like the rest of Europe, Britain would probably have fallen into German hands if the Allies had failed.
It seems that the goats were first domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran some 10,000 years ago.
In ancient times, cultures and tribes began to keep them so that they could always get their hands on hair, meat, milk and skins.
Domesticated goats were usually kept in herds on a hill or other pasture, guarded by goatherds, and the more well-known shepherd was often a child or younger.
As early as the 16th century, horse-drawn railways were built in England.
Although horse-drawn railways consisted of only a rack of planks, the horses had to run faster and pull more than on the somewhat difficult roads of the day.
Cross-beams were used fairly early to hold the rails in place, but gradually it was realized that rails would be more efficient if there was an iron point on top.
This soon became common practice, but the iron resulted in more wear on the wooden carriage wheels.
Iron wheels eventually replaced the wooden variants, and in 1767 the first all-iron rails were laid.
The first form of transportation we know of was walking, and people started walking upright two million years ago when Homo erectus came along.
Their predecessor, the Australopithecus, walked upright less often.
Two-legged specialization is found in fossils of the Australopithecus from 4.2-3.9 million years ago.
We can live more environmentally friendly lives, join an environmental movement, or even take action to alleviate some of future suffering.
It is often a symptomatic treatment, but if we want more than a temporary solution, we need to identify the root cause of the problem and eliminate it.
The scientific and technological advances of human society have obviously changed the earth dramatically, and overpopulation and extravagant human lifestyles have exacerbated the problems.
After the Declaration of Independence was passed by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft was sent to John Dunlap's printing house a few blocks away, signed by President of the Continental Congress John Hancock and Secretary of State Charles Thomson.
Between 150 and 200 were made overnight, now known as Dunlap broadsides.
John Nixon gave the first public reading of the document on July 8 in the garden of Independence Hall.
One copy was sent to George Washington on July 6 and read to his troops in New York on July 9. Another copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap flyers are the oldest surviving copies of the document.
Many paleontologists believe that there is a species of dinosaur still alive today.
Many people don't consider them dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still remind you of a dinosaur.
They have claws and scales on their feet, lay eggs and walk on their two hind legs, just like the Tyrannosaurus Rex.
Manipulating data encoded in binary digits forms the basis of almost all computers in use today.
A binary number can have only two values, 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits (and in computer language "bits").
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent, and symptoms such as vomiting are so common that a diagnosis cannot be made immediately.
The presence of open boxes of medication or toxic household chemicals is the best indication of internal poisoning.
Check the label for specific EHBO instructions for that specific poison.
This group of insects is formally called "worms" by entomologists.
The term comes from an ancient resemblance to bed bugs, which are insects that are very good parasites on humans.
Both red bed bugs and bed bugs are nest-bound, adapted to live in their host's nest or house.
In the United States, there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disorder in both young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Studies have shown that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interests, or that of their child, to raise a baby.
These couples can choose to give up their baby for adoption.
In an adoption, the parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
Discovering how the world works using the scientific method is the main goal of science. This method is the guideline for most scientific research.
However, this is more than just testing; a test is a test to rule out one or more potential assumptions, to question and to make observations, as a guide for scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and especially on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on science, including psychology, were accepted.
The West understood Greek philosophy and science less and less as knowledge of Greek declined.
Physiological and behavioural observations of rhythms often have a strong dependence on endogenous processes and production by the biological clock.
Most creatures, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals, live in periodic rhythms, not just reactions to external periodic signals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that cycle for a period of time, even when no external signals are given.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the most important clues that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages or viruses to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
Two experiments were carried out: one experiment marked the DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus and the other experiment marked the protein in the phage with radioactive sulphur.
Mutations can have many different effects, depending on the type, the importance of the genetic material involved, and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only mutations in germ cells are heritable, and other mutations can cause cells to die or develop cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people who like to visit nature reserves because they want to enjoy the landscape, including the flora and fauna.
The sites include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, parks, and ecosystem study.
An example is visiting, photographing and learning about the orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people drive from small villages to their workplaces and pass people whose workplaces are located in the village from which they just came.
Everyone in this dynamic transport shuttle is in some way connected to and supports a private car-based transport system.
Science shows that this huge carbon economy is no longer keeping the biosphere in the stable state that allowed human evolution to take place over the past two million years.
Everyone is a part of society and uses transportation systems, and almost everyone complains about it.
In developed countries, water quality problems or collapsing bridges are comparatively rare.
Why are there so many complaints about transport systems, why do they go wrong every day? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is it something more fundamental?
A traffic flow looks at the movements of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that take place between the individuals.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flow because the behaviour of drivers cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers are reasonably predictable, which means that traffic flows are somewhat consistent and that there is something to be said for this in mathematical terms.
The three key characteristics have been linked to better reflect traffic flow: (1) intensity, (2) density and (3) speed.
These links will facilitate the planning, design and operation of road infrastructure.
Insects were the first animals to fly, and their ability to fly made it easier for them to escape from enemies and find food and mates more efficiently.
The advantage of most insects is that they can fold their wings along the body.
This allows them to hide from predators in a larger number of small places.
Currently, only dragonflies and mealybugs can't flap their wings.
A few thousand years ago, Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
While some thought he was right, many believed just the opposite - that the solar system moved around the earth, and so did the sun (and other stars).
This sounds pretty logical, because you don't feel the earth move, right?
The Amazon River is the world's largest and second longest river, carrying more than eight times as much water as the second largest.
The Amazon is also the widest river on earth, reaching six miles in some places.
At least 20 percent of all the water that flows into the ocean through the rivers comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River's main stream is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long, draining water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza remain unsurpassed in size and technical excellence.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom admired the monument of their predecessors, which was over a thousand years old at the time.
Vatican City has about 800 inhabitants, making it the smallest independent country in the world and also the least populous.
Italian is the language of official communication and legislation in Vatican City.
Italian is the language most commonly spoken by the people who work there, while Latin is widely used during religious ceremonies.
Everyone who lives in Vatican City is Roman Catholic.
Humans have known about the most basic chemical elements, such as gold, silver, and copper, since ancient times because they are all found in nature and are relatively easy to mine with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle speculated that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like what we know of the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, but he also theorized that they transition into new substances to form into what we see.
Alloys are simply a combination of at least a few metals, and as you probably know, the periodic table contains many elements.
Elements like calcium and potassium are among the metals.
Alloys may also contain a small amount of non-metallic elements, for example carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that a trillion atoms fit in the period at the end of this sentence.
That's why the pencil was a trusted friend to many people when it was first launched.
Unfortunately, the pen has been downgraded in status and is much less used as newer writing methods have emerged.
Today, people type messages on a computer screen without ever needing a dot sharpener.
You may wonder what will happen to the keyboard once something new comes on the market.
The atomic bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to make a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like pushing a heavy cart up a hill, but when the core splits back up, some of the energy is released.
Some atoms have an unstable nucleus, which means they break apart at the slightest.
The surface of the moon is characterized by dust and rock.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the nearest side and 100 km thick on the other side.
The crust is thinner under the maria and thicker under the highlands.
There may be more marshes on the side, because the crust is thinner there, and it's easier for lava to come to the surface.
Content theories are about figuring out what moves people and what appeals to them.
This theory suggests that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they grow older.
These theories seek to investigate the reasons why certain people want certain things and what environmental factors influence them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's need pyramid and Hertzberg's motivation-hygiene theory.
Generally, there are two approaches to management when it comes to taking over from former colleagues.
This type of manager finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions and disciplinary measures, conduct evaluation interviews, delegate and call people to their responsibility.
At the other end of the spectrum, he or she transforms into an unrecognizable individual, who feels compelled to change everything the team has done so far, and wants to take it all in.
Ultimately, the leader is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
Often, this behavior creates a gap between leaders and team members.
Virtual teams must meet the same standards of excellence as normal teams, although there are slight differences.
In most cases, virtual team members are the first point of contact for their direct physical group.
They are often more independent than traditional team members, because their teams can meet in different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management.
The idea of a truly 'invisible team' (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, pp. 109) is a unique element of a virtual team.
The invisible team is the management team to which each member reports, and the invisible team also sets the standard for each member.
Why would an organisation want to embark on the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organisation?
Creativity and ingenuity are shown when all available resources are used effectively within the functional departments of an organization.
The result is that the process of an organisation working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet customer needs.
To enable innovation in an organisation, management must foster a culture that places innovation, knowledge sharing and organisational learning at the centre.
According to Angel (2006), organisations can perform better with a continuum model approach.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to cognition research, which can shrink the scope of research and allow more accurate data to be collected.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior helps scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain injury, trauma, wounds and tumors can affect behavior and lead to changes in mental ability.
As new technologies become available, we are learning more and more about the structures and processes in the brain.
This provides us with a wealth of information and material to develop simulation models that can help us better understand the processes of our minds.
AI is a science fiction-like phenomenon, but it's also an essential part of computer science, and it's used in research on machine behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation.
The development of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior is part of AI research.
Some examples are management, planning, the ability to answer diagnoses and customer questions, and handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
These have become separate disciplines for finding solutions to real-life problems.
Today, this artificial intelligence system is widely used in economic, medical, technical and military fields, such as in various software applications for PCs and video games.
Many excursions are planned for each class, and often a teacher would take her students to places where a bus trip is not an option.
Thanks to technological developments, virtual excursions are now possible, allowing students to view artifacts in a museum, peer inside an aquarium or see beautiful works of art from the classroom.
Virtual excursion sharing is also a fantastic way to look back on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, each year, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital, which is redesigned each year and previous versions of which are kept online to serve as a sticker.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing skills, often with poor grammar and spelling at first, but quickly changing as they have an audience.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger strives to improve the writing and thus avoid criticism.
Blogging "also forces students to learn more about the world around them". The need to keep the public interested inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend learning far beyond the traditional school day.
When used properly, blogs can 'help learners develop analytical and critical thinking; by actively engaging in the discussion on the Internet, learners can find their own place in the context of other people's material and at the same time determine their own position on certain issues' (Oravec, 2002).
Canada's bilingual capital is the charming Ottawa, full of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and future.
Further south, you'll find Niagara Falls, and further north, you'll find the beautiful, pristine Muskoka and more.
This is what makes Ontario so Canadian to outsiders.
Further north, large areas are sparsely populated and some of these areas are virtually uninhabited wilderness.
A population equation that will surprise many: There are more African Americans living in the United States than the total population of Canada.
The East African islands are located along the east coast of Africa in the Indian Ocean.
Madagascar is by far the largest and in terms of fauna it is almost a separate continent.
Most of the smaller islands are independent countries or are connected to France and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought the Islamic faith with them, after which it spread widely to the Comoros and Mayotte.
The Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the European-India trade route, ushering in European influence and colonization in the 15th century.
The region is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west and the Sahel to the north.
Women: Female travelers are advised to say they are married, whether that is true or not.
It also helps to make rings (not too expensive looking rings).
Women should be aware that cultural differences can lead to behaviour they find intimidating and that it is common to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be clear when rejecting a man and don't be afraid to stand up for your man (cultural differences don't speak well of this!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded in the 10th century BC by Berber fishermen.
The Portuguese destroyed the port and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city and named it Daru l-Bayad, and the Spanish traders who established their trading base here named it Casablanca.
In Morocco, Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop.
Around the old Medina you can find many places where you can buy traditional Moroccan items, such as tagines, pots, leather goods, water pipes and other hand-me-downs, but it is purely geared towards tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava eruptions from the Nyiragongo volcano, and most of the city's streets, especially the city center, were buried.
Although Goma itself is relatively safe, before visiting outside Goma, check the situation regarding the fighting going on in North Kivu province.
In addition, the city is the base for climbing Nyiragongo Volcano and offers some of the most profitable mountain gorilla tracking trips in Africa.
A bodaboda (a motor taxi) is the most common way to get around Goma.
"Timbo-Too" is relatively inaccessible and is therefore used today as a metaphor for exotic, faraway lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor town, though its reputation makes it a tourist hotspot and has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage in Danger due to desert storms.
It was one of the main stops for the PBS exhibit Special Wonders of the African World by Henry Louis Gates.
The city differs from other cities in the country because it has a more Arab than African feel.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and runs east along the border with Mozambique, north along the border with Zimbabwe and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park is 19,500 square kilometers [1,900 sq mi] in size, divided into 14 different eco-zones, which house various wildlife species.
As a major attraction in South Africa, this park is the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, daily maintenance fees and entrance fees apply.
It may also be useful to purchase a Wild Card, which provides access to certain parts of parks in South Africa or to all national parks in South Africa.
The whole territory of Hong Kong is named after Hong Kong Island, which is considered by many tourists to be the main place.
The sheer number of buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline has already been likened to a shimmering bar chart that is visible thanks to the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head for the Kowloon waterfront on the other side.
The vast majority of the population of Hong Kong Island lives very close together on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is where the British settlers settled, so if you're looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest mangrove forests in the entire world, stretching 80 kilometers (50 miles) from the coast to the Indian and Bengal interior.
The Sundarbans are now officially listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
The forests, however, are more than just mangrove swamps  they also contain some of the last mighty patches of jungle that once covered the Gangetic Plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 square kilometres, of which one third is swamp and marshland.
The Sundarbans have been a game reserve since 1966, and the area now contains an estimated 400 Bengal tigers and some 30,000 axis deer.
Buses depart from the station on the border of the districts (across the river) during the day, most departing between 6.30 and 7.30 am, mainly in the east direction and Jakar/Bumthang.
It is wise to buy a ticket a few days in advance, since the buses are often full.
In most neighborhoods, there are small Japanese Coaster buses that are comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxis allow quick and comfortable travel to nearby places, such as Paro (150 ngultrum) and Punakha (200 ngultrum).
The Oyapock Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River to connect the Brazilian city of Oiapoque and the French Guianan city of Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock.
The two towers are 83 metres high, the building is 378 metres long and has two passageways, each 3.50 metres wide.
The bridge was completed in August 2011 but was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs posts are expected to be ready for use.
The Guarani were the most prominent indigenous group, living in what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters and also engaged in subsistence agriculture.
Other indigenous tribes lived in the Chaco region, including the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who found their food by hunting, fishing, and gathering.
Paraguay, formerly called "the great province of India", was founded in the 16th century when Spanish colonists encountered the indigenous population.
A three-century period of colonization by the Spanish followed.
Asunción was founded in 1537, and Paraguay has retained much of its indigenous character and identity since then.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
In December, the biggest tournament of the year takes place on the half-fields of Las Cañitas.
At other times of the year, smaller tournaments and competitions are also held here.
Check the Asociación Argentina de Polo for more information on tournaments and buying tickets for polo matches.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is approximately one British pound (GBP).
There's only one bank on the islands, and that's in Stanley, across from the FIC West store.
British pounds are generally accepted throughout the islands, and credit cards and US dollars are also often available in Stanley.
In remote islands, you probably can't pay with a credit card, but you probably can with British and American currency.
Change your money before you leave the islands, because Falklands currency is very difficult to change outside.
Montevideo is below the equator, so if it's summer there, it's winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics, and temperatures may exceed +30°C in the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures almost never drop below freezing, but the wind combined with humidity makes it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
The rainfall level remains approximately the same throughout the year, with no distinct wet or dry periods.
Many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, but wild animals are basically wild, so they should not be fed or disturbed.
In the park, keep at least 100 meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 meters from any other wildlife.
Moose, bison, reindeer, bear, and almost any other large animal can attack you, no matter how tame they seem.
Every year, dozens of visitors get injured because they don't keep proper distance, and these animals are big, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
Also, be aware that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking smelly food and keep the campsite clean.
The capital of Samoa is Apia, and the city of nearly 40,000 is located on the island of Upolu.
Apia was founded around 1850 and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889, seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the port, in what became known as the infamous stalemate.
All but one British battleship was sunk, and nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
In the Mau movement's struggle for independence, the supreme leader, Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III, died at a violent rally in the city that went out of control.
There are many beaches, especially because of Auckland's two harbours.
The North Shore beaches in the North Harbour district extend north to south along the Pacific Ocean, from Long Bay to Devonport.
Almost all of these are sandy beaches where swimming is safe, and most have pohutukawa trees that provide shade.
At Waitemata Harbour, in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, located in Central Auckland, you'll find the Tamaki Drive beaches.
These family beaches are sometimes crowded and have a good range of shopping along the coast.
'Number One' is the main local beer which is not a complex beer but pleasant and refreshing.
There are many French wines to be found, but the New Zealand and Australian wines may be better suited for travel.
Local drinking water is safe to drink, but bottled water is also easy to find if you don't trust it.
A flat white is a strange concept to Australians. Black coffee is espresso, cappuccino has a lot of coffee milk (without foam) and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate milk is Belgian quality, the fruit juices are expensive, but they're delicious.
Reef trips are available year-round and injuries from these trips are rare.
Nevertheless, seek professional advice and follow all signs and safety warnings.
Cube jellyfish are found from October to April near beaches and estuaries north of the Town of 1770.
Sharks are common, but they rarely attack humans, and most sharks are afraid of humans and would rather swim away.
The main habitat of saltwater crocodiles is in the estuaries north of Rockhampton and they do not normally live in the ocean.
Booking in advance gives the traveler peace of mind, knowing that he will have a place to sleep when he arrives at his destination.
Travel agencies often have deals with certain hotels, although you can usually book other types of accommodation, such as a campsite, through a travel agency.
Travel agencies often offer packages with breakfast and transport to and from the airport and sometimes even flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold your reservation if you need to think about the offer a little longer or if you need to obtain documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, if you have a request or want to make a change, you should do so through the travel agent instead of the hotel.
For some festivals, the majority of music festival attendees choose to camp on site and most visitors consider this an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you'll have to get there early to secure a campsite near the music.
And remember this: Even after the music on the main stage has ended, music may play into the late hours in other parts of the festival grounds.
For families with young children, special campsites are provided at some festivals.
Be careful where you sit when crossing the Baltic Sea in winter, because the passage through the ice makes a lot of noise if you sit too close.
Cruises to St. Petersburg include time to explore the city.
Casinos usually strive to make the most of the time and money that guests spend. Windows and clocks are usually absent and the exit is sometimes difficult to find.
They usually have special food, drink, and entertainment offers to keep them in a good mood and to keep them from leaving.
Some venues offer free alcoholic beverages, but when people are drunk, it affects their judgment, and all seasoned gamblers know that staying sober is extremely important.
If you are going to go up into the mountains or over mountain passes, you should take into account that there may be snow or ice and the temperature may be very low.
On icy and snowy roads, there is little friction and the road is different from asphalt.
During snowstorms, enough snow can fall in a very short period of time to get stuck.
The visibility may also be affected by falling or rising snow or by condensation or ice on the windows of the vehicle.
On the other hand, in many countries ice and snow are normal and do not hinder traffic.
The main tourist attraction in Africa are safaris, which for many visitors are the highlight of their trip.
The term safari is popularly used to refer to travel by land to view the beautiful African wildlife, especially on the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, often get close to cars, and standard equipment allows for a good view.
If you want to see lions, cheetahs and leopards, you need binoculars. Otherwise, the chances of seeing them are slim.
A walking safari (also called a "forest walk" or "walking safari") involves walking for several hours or days at a time.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021, with some parts being played at other venues in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host the Olympics twice, the first time in 1964.
If you've already booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the delay was announced, you could be in a tough spot.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of the end of March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies are no longer valid until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
Most event tickets are expected to cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000.
You can dry wet clothes by ironing them. Many hotels have an ironing iron and an ironing board available. You can often borrow these items even if they are not in the room.
If an iron is not available or if you do not want to wear ironing socks, you can also use a hairdryer if available.
Make sure that the fabric does not become too hot (this may cause the fabric to shrink or, in extreme cases, burn).
There are a number of ways to purify water, and some of these methods are effective at reducing specific risks.
In some areas it is sufficient to boil water for one minute, in other areas water must be boiled for several minutes.
Not every filter is equally effective, so if in doubt, the best water to drink is from a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animal diseases that are not found in their own country.
Insects can spoil food, cause irritation, or, in the worst case, cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Usually, infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that violently injure or kill people, are not considered pests.
Tax-free shopping means that you can buy goods at certain locations that are exempt from taxes and excise duties.
Travelers going to countries with high excise duties can sometimes save considerable money on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
Point Marion and Fairmont are connected by the Buffalo to Pittsburgh freeway, and you often drive through abandoned backcountry, which makes this a very challenging route.
If you're not used to driving on country roads, keep your head down, you'll find many steep slopes, narrow streets and sharp curves.
The maximum speed limits are noticeably lower than in previous and successive areas  usually around 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h)  and it is even more important to stick to them here than elsewhere.
Surprisingly, you have much more range here than in other corners of the route, like the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries taste great, and Bavarian pastries are quite rich and varied, as are those of their southern neighbor, Austria.
You see a lot of fruit cakes, and all year round, the cakes contain apples, and in the summer months, cherries and plums.
Many popular German pastries contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts, and they taste great with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want some small but powerful pastries, try some locally called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen.
To make a curry, you need spicy and spicy ingredients, combined with vegetables or meat.
Depending on the amount of liquid, a curry can be "dry" or "wet".
In the interior of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is often used.
Indonesian cuisine includes dishes from 17,000 islands and is an umbrella term for a variety of regional cuisines from across the country.
But without further information, the term refers to the food originally from the central and eastern part of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine is now available throughout the archipelago and offers various simple spicy dishes.
The riders' feet are supported by buckles that hang down on either side of the saddle.
They provide more stability for the rider, but they can also cause safety problems by getting the rider's feet stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown off a horse but remains with his foot in the stirrup, they can be dragged along with the horse.
Most riders first wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, rather narrow sole.
Some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety brackets, which allow a riding cramp to fall off the saddle when pulled back because a rider falls off the horse.
Cochamó Valley - This is Chile's most popular climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, and has many different large granite walls and rocks.
The peaks offer breathtaking views, and climbers from all over the world are constantly discovering new routes on the cliffs that seem to have endless potential.
Winter sports that involve downhill skiing and snowboarding are very popular, with skiers or snowboards at your feet.
Skiing is a popular travel activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes called "ski bums", who plan entire vacations around skiing in a particular location.
Skiing has been around for a very long time: there are cave paintings of skiers dating back to 5000 BC!
The beginnings of skiing date back to at least the 17th century and in 1861 the first recreational ski resort in Australia was opened by Norwegians.
Backpacking with skis: this activity is also called off-piste skiing, ski touring or ski hiking.
It's not quite the same, but it's similar to alpine skiing or mountain climbing, which is done a lot on steep terrain, and you need much stiffer skis and boots for that.
You can think of the ski route as a hiking route.
Under good conditions, you can cover greater distances than walking, but it is rare to reach cross-country skiing speed on paved trails without a heavy backpack.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries. Normally, travelers between different countries have to apply for a visa and undergo passport checks several times.
However, the Schengen area functions almost as one country in this area.
As long as you are in this zone, you can usually cross the border without having to undergo a second passport check.
If you have a Schengen visa, you do not have to apply for a visa for each Schengen country separately, which saves you time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of antiques, and some tax authorities define antiques as goods that are more than 100 years old.
The definition may vary from place to place, but in North America, for example, the age limit is lower than in Europe.
It is possible to classify handicraft products as antiques, even though they are newer than similar mass-produced products.
Among the Sámi, reindeer herding is an important way of life, and the culture surrounding trade is very important for many with other professions.
Even traditionally, however, not all Sámi were involved in large-scale reindeer farming, but they lived off of fishing, hunting, and other activities, usually using reindeer as pack animals.
Many Sámi people today work in modern occupations.
The word 'gypsy' is mainly used by non-Romani people, but it is also often considered offensive because of its associations with negative stereotypes and incorrect perceptions of the Roma.
If the country you are going to is subject to a travel advisory, this may affect your travel insurance or cancellation insurance.
You can also consult advice from other authorities, but they are directed at their own citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
Opinions are only a brief summary of the political situation in a single country.
They often present a fleeting, general and extremely simplistic picture compared with other, more detailed sources.
Emergency weather is the general term for any dangerous weather phenomenon that may cause damage, serious social disruption or loss of human life.
Extreme weather events can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different types of weather events, which vary based on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
The phenomena and consequences of severe weather include, for example, strong winds, hail, heavy rainfall and forest fires, but also thunderstorms, tornadoes, hailstorms and hurricanes.
Snowstorms, ice storms and dust storms are examples of regional and seasonal extreme weather events.
Travellers are strongly advised to be aware of the risks posed by extreme weather conditions in their environment, as they can also affect some travel plans.
Anyone who wants to visit a country that is considered a war zone should be professionally trained.
A search of the Internet for "hostile environment course" will likely yield the address of a local business.
A course normally covers all the issues outlined here in more detail, usually in combination with practical experience.
A course normally lasts 2 to 5 days and consists of role-playing, lots of BRE and occasional weapons training.
There are many books and magazines with articles on wilderness survival, but few publications on war zones.
Travellers planning to have a sex operation abroad should ensure that they have the proper documentation for the return journey.
The differences between the two are considerable, whether the authorities want to issue passports that do not contain an X gender or to update a name or gender on documents.
There is just as much variation in the willingness of foreign governments to recognize these documents.
Moreover, security checkpoints have been searched on a much larger scale since 11 September 2001.
Transgender individuals who have not had surgery can expect to pass this scan with their privacy and dignity intact.
A rip current is the recurrent flow of waves that break on a reef or similar area and flow onto the beach.
Due to the underwater topology, the return current is in some deeper parts, where a rapid flow to deep water can occur.
Most deaths are caused by fatigue from trying to swim against the current.
Once you've escaped the strong current, swimming back is a no-no.
Try to focus on a spot where you won't get caught again, and depending on your skills and whether you're noticed, you can wait for help.
The shock of returning is worse than culture shock (you have a less intense honeymoon feeling), it lasts longer, and it can be more intense.
Travelers who easily adapt to new cultures may find it difficult to adjust to their own culture.
If you have lived abroad and then return, you have adapted to the new culture and have lost some of the customs of your own culture.
In the past, when you went to a foreign country, you found that the people were patient and understanding, because they understood that travelers had to adapt to a new country.
Patience and understanding are not usually expected of travelers returning home.
For children, the pyramid show with light and sound is one of the most interesting activities in the area.
You see the pyramids in the dark and you see them in all the silence before the show starts.
Often the sound of vendors and tourists is always heard here.
The Sphinx is the backdrop and the narrator of a long story.
The scenes appear as projections onto the pyramids and the rest of the pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands were discovered in 1819 and have since been claimed by several countries.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula.
Others are Livingston Island, and Deception, where you'll find the flooded crater of an active volcano that serves as a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth is on the south side of the peninsula, bordering the Bellingshaussee.
Here the mountains of the peninsula merge into the plateau, after which they emerge again to form the 200-mile-long (360-km) Mount Ellsworth range, which is crisscrossed by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, also known as the Sentinel Range, includes Antarctica's highest mountains, the Vinson Massif.
A satellite phone may be your only option in remote locations where there is no cell phone reception.
A satellite phone is not really a replacement for a cell phone, since you have to be outside with clear view of the satellite to make a phone call.
This service is often used by shipping, including pleasure craft, and for expeditions requiring external data and communication.
Your local telephone provider can give you more information on how to connect to this service.
It is becoming increasingly popular for people who plan a gap year to travel and learn.
This is particularly useful for school leavers to take a gap year before university without affecting their education.
Often, enrolling in a study abroad course during a gap year can increase your chances of returning to higher education in your own country.
The student must pay a tuition fee to enroll in these educational programmes.
Finland is a fantastic sailing destination, and the 'Land of a Thousand Lakes' also has thousands of islands, in the lakes and in the islands off the coast.
Hunting is not necessary for the archipelago or the lakes.
The coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are indeed large enough for any yacht, but with smaller boats or even a kayak you get a completely different experience.
In Finland, so many people sail in their spare time that the ratio of boats to people is one in seven or eight.
The figure is similar to that of Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but is also quite unique (in the Netherlands, for example, the figure is one in forty).
Most Baltic cruises include a long stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This will allow you to spend several full days in the historic site and to stay on the ship.
Since 2009, you do not need a separate visa if you go ashore alone on a boat excursion.
Some cruises include a visit to the German capital Berlin, but as you can see on the map, Berlin is not near the sea. A visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Air travel can be scary for people of all backgrounds and ages, especially if they have never flown before or if they have had a traumatic experience.
It's nothing to be ashamed of: it's just like many other fears that other people have.
Knowing how airplanes work can help to remove fear of the unknown or of not having control of the plane.
Courier companies are generously compensated for delivering items quickly. Time is often very important for business documents, merchandise, or spare parts for a necessary repair.
Larger companies could use their own aircraft on certain routes, but for other routes and smaller companies it became more difficult.
If they send things by air, some routes can take days to unload and clear customs.
The only way to process it more quickly was to check it in, because airline rules say there must be at least one passenger, and that is you.
The most obvious way to fly first or business class is to count down a bag of money (or better yet, have your employer do it) for this privilege.
This is not cheap, however: the rule of thumb is that you pay about four times economy class for business, and about 11 times for first class.
It is usually pointless to seek discounts on business or first class tickets on direct flights from A to B.
The airlines know all too well that there is a group of pilots who are willing to pay a lot of money to fly somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they charge a corresponding fee for this.
Chişinău is the capital of Moldova. The Romanian language is spoken here mainly, but Russian is also spoken a lot.
As a multi-ethnic republic, Moldova was beset by ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognised by UN members.
Economic ties have been re-established between these two parts of Moldova, despite the failure of political negotiations.
Orthodox Christianity is the main religion in Moldova.
İzmir is the third largest city in Turkey with about 3.7 million inhabitants, the largest port next to Istanbul and a good transport hub.
The once ancient city of İzmir is now a modern, developed and busy commercial center on a bay and surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, the glass buildings and the modern shopping malls covered with red tiles, the 18th-century markets, the old mosques and churches, yet the city feels more like a Mediterranean, European city than a traditional Turkish one.
In the village of Haldarsvík you can enjoy views of the nearby island of Eysturoy, as well as a remarkable church with eight corners.
On a number of tombs near the church are fascinating marble dove sculptures.
If you have half an hour, you should definitely look around this village.
To the north is the easily accessible, romantic and fascinating town of Sintra, which became famous among foreigners after Lord Byron spoke highly of its magnificent monuments.
Scotturb bus 403 runs regularly to Sintra, with a stopover at Cabo da Roca.
Also head north and see the beautiful Shrine of Our Lady of Fatima (a temple complex), where internationally famous Marian apparitions have taken place.
Remember, you are not merely visiting a mass grave, but you are also visiting a place that has almost immeasurable meaning for a large part of the world's population.
Many men and women who survived their time here are still alive and many of them have loved ones who were killed or worked themselves to death there, both Jews and Gentiles.
During your visit, show all due respect, ceremony and dignity, and do not trivialize the Holocaust or Nazism.
Do not damage the site by placing markings or graffiti on the construction sites.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the inhabitants prefer to speak Catalan, the vast majority can understand it, and almost everyone speaks Spanish.
However, most signs are in Catalan, as that is the first official language by law.
Spanish is widely spoken in public transport and other facilities.
Regular announcements in the metro are only in Catalan, but unplanned interruptions are made by an automated system in several languages, including French, Arabic, Spanish, English and also in Japanese.
The people of Paris are known to be selfish, rude and arrogant.
Although this is usually just a misguided stereotype, it can't hurt to put your best foot forward in Paris and behave like someone who is 'bien élevé' (well-behaved).
The hard exterior of the Parisians quickly disappears when you show that you are familiar with their way of doing things.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested and this wooded area consists mainly of beech, fir and pine, and includes a combination of alpine and Mediterranean flora.
There are a great many different plant communities, due to the different microclimates, the different soil types and the varying altitudes.
This area is also home to a very wide variety of animal and bird species.
Rare animals such as the European brown bear, the wolf, the eagle, the owl, the lynx, the wildcat, and the moose are found, along with all sorts of more common species.
When women visit a monastery, they are required to wear a skirt up to the knees and must have their shoulders covered.
Usually, a woman will be given a headscarf if she arrives unprepared at a monastery, but if you bring your own, with nice, showy colors, the monk or nun at the entrance will smile kindly.
On the other hand, men should wear pants at least over their knees.
You can also borrow them from the store at the entrance, but these clothes are not washed every time they are finished, so you may not feel comfortable with them.
Like many other Mediterranean regions, Mallorcan cuisine is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and makes extensive use of olive oil.
A simple and popular dinner dish, especially during the summer months, is the Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes and whatever is available to flavourers, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
Nouns, like Sie, which means you, always have a capital letter at the beginning, even if they're in the middle of the sentence.
This way you make a pronoun distinction between a number of verbs and objects.
It probably makes reading easier, too, but writing is more complicated, because you have to figure out whether to use a verb or an adjective as a noun.
Most Italian words are written exactly as they are pronounced, so the pronunciation is generally not a problem.
The most important thing to pay attention to is the C and the G. Their pronunciation depends on the vowel that follows them.
Also, you have to pronounce the r and rr differently: caro means sweetheart, while carro means car.
The Persian language has a relatively simple and usually regular grammar.
Reading this introduction to grammar will, therefore, teach you much about Persian grammar and help you to understand sentences.
It's quite logical that if you know a Romance language, it's easier for you to learn Portuguese.
But people who speak a little Spanish can quickly conclude that Portuguese is so similar that you don't need to learn it separately.
Pre-modern observatories are now obsolete, serving as museums or educational attractions.
Light pollution wasn't as big a problem back then as it is today, so they were often built in cities or on campuses, more accessible than today.
Most modern research telescopes are huge facilities built in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Hanami is the sight of cherry blossoms and this has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
In China, plum blossoms were the favorite flower, and that's where the concept came from.
Japan's first cherry blossom festivals were organized by the emperor and were reserved for himself and other aristocrats at the imperial court.
Plants look best in a natural setting, which requires that you suppress the tendency to remove even 'just one' species.
If you collect samples while visiting a landscaped garden, you are immediately and without question denied entry into the garden.
Singapore is generally a very safe place to stay, very easy to navigate, and almost everything is available upon arrival.
But if you are in the 'high tropics,' but a few degrees north of the equator, you experience both heat (always) and strong sun (when the sky is clear, this is less common).
There are also some buses heading north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the Bible patriarchs Isaac, Jacob, Abraham, and their wives.
Make sure the bus you're taking actually goes into Hebron and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good vacation destination.
For example, you can visit castles in the Loire Valley or the Rhine Valley, book a cruise to the interesting towns along the Danube or take a boat trip along the Erie Canal.
They also indicate popular hiking and cycling routes.
Christmas is one of Christianity's most important holidays, celebrating the birth of Jesus.
Moreover, non-believers in Christian lands and non-Christians around the world have adopted many traditions associated with the holiday.
There's a tradition where you stay up all Easter until you can see the sunrise at some point.
Of course, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may as well be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
In traditional churches, an Easter vigil is often held on the Saturday evening of Easter weekend, with congregations often celebrating a feast in honor of Christ's resurrection at midnight.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands came here by swimming, flying or floating.
Because of the long distance from the mainland, mammals were not able to make the journey, making the giant tortoise the most common grazing mammal on the Galapagos Islands.
Since man first set foot on the Galapagos Islands, all kinds of mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
During winter, the Arctic and Antarctic regions experience the Arctic Night, which means that the sun does not actually rise.
There's a good chance you'll be able to see the aurora borealis, since the sky will be dark more or less day and night.
The areas are sparsely populated and therefore light pollution is not often a problem, which means you can also enjoy the starry sky.
The Japanese work environment is more structured and formal than in the Western world.
Suits are standard work clothes and colleagues call each other by their last name or job title.
Unity in the workplace is crucial, with a focus on group performance rather than individual performance.
Employees often need to get their superiors' permission before making a decision and are expected to follow their instructions thoughtlessly.
