This not only confirms the fact that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, an already widespread theory, but provides us with details that fossils generally cannot, such as their colors and three-dimensional layouts.
Scientists say that the plumage of this animal was brownish-brown at the top with a pale or carotenoid underparts.
The discovery also provides a first look at the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a highly developed structure called a rachis, but do have other feather traits  beard and beard, researchers have concluded that the rachis was probably a later evolutionary development than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but for temperature regulation or display.The researchers suggested that, although this was the tail of a young dinosaur, the spatula showed adult plumage and not a chick.
The researchers suggested that, although it was the tail of a young dinosaur, the spider monkey showed adult plumage and no pocket feathers.
A car bomb exploded at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey yesterday morning killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty others.

The brightness and rotation are used together to determine a star's Rossby number, which is related to the plasma flux.
Where the Rossby number is smaller, the star is less active relative to magnetic inversions.

The work done was essentially theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius Galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by the strength of the tides between the galaxy's dark matter and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon exerts an attraction on Earth, causing tides, the Milky Way exerts a similar force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that normal matter does.
This theory states that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is located around a galaxy in a kind of corona, and is made up of very small particles.

They are cooler than the surrounding surface during the day and hotter at night.
Their thermal behavior is not as constant as in the large caves on Earth which often maintain a fairly constant temperature, but it is consistent with the fact that they are deep caves in the ground", said Glen Cushing, of the astrogeology team at the American Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experiment: voters isolate themselves in a booth, place a sheet of pre-printed paper indicating the candidate of their choice in an envelope.
After verification by officials of the voter's identity, the voter drops the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voter list.
French electoral law codifies the procedures rather strictly.
Since 1988, the polls have had to be transparent so that voters and observers can testify that no envelope was present at the start of the vote and that no envelope was added if the electors were not properly counted and authorized.
Candidates may send representatives to witness the proceedings. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under heavy supervision, following specific procedures.

Although three people were inside the house when the car hit, none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services released the driver of the red Audi TT.
He was initially hospitalized at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was later transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged at Edinburgh Sheriff Court with the murder of his son.
She is being held pending her indictment and trial, but any eyewitness evidence may be tainted by the fact that her image has been widely published.
It is a common practice elsewhere in the UK but the Scottish judiciary operates differently and the courts have seen the publication of photos as potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee remarks "journalists really seem to be walking a dangerous line if they publish suspicious photos and stuff".
The Crown Office, which generally deals with legal actions, has advised the press that no further comment will be made at least until the indictment.
The document, according to the leak, will address the border dispute, which Palestine wants to be based on those before the 1967 Middle East War.
Other topics that would be discussed include the future status of Jerusalem as sacred to both nations and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years unless an agreement is signed while the PA agrees to leave such a presence for only five years.
The participants in the supplemental control trial of the known populations were to be closely monitored by the guards, as the trial was being monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
As part of a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited for the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the acting director of conservation and heritage at the park with the NPWS, the four hunters selected for the first hunt were given comprehensive safety and training instructions.
Martelly was sworn in before a new nine-member provisional electoral board (CEP).
It is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the former CEP as part of a package of measures that will lead the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread anti-regime demonstrations that began in October.
Occasionally violent demonstrations were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some due to take place in 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of overheating of dysfunctional iPods have been reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents involving the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company described as "not serious".
The ministry responded by calling Apple's delay in reporting "truly regrettable".
The earthquake struck Mariana at 7:19 am local time (9:19 pm GMT on Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands emergency management office stated that no damage had been reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer has taken Hong Kong tourists hostage after hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six of them are confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and elderly people, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers then took the place of an elderly woman who needed to go to the Commons.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
She trained as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital Liggins began to study premature labor in her spare time.
His research showed that if a hormone was administered it would accelerate the fetal lung of the baby.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two flight recorders 'black box' on Wednesday.
Fellow fighters also paid homage to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said "Luna was the first queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna has lived through the night of the two moons. She is truly unique just like her. A strong woman".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as troubled as I was... maybe even more... I love her and will miss her... I hope she's in a better place".
Of the 1,400 people polled ahead of the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 per cent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard reiterated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic by the end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
34 percent of those polled share this view, wanting Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
At the end of the poll, 29 percent of respondents believed Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believed Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was due to swim in the 100 and 200 metre freestyle and triple relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to her complaints, her fitness has been called into question.
He was unable to take the medications needed to alleviate his pain as they were banned for the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri discovered the first ever large number on January 25.
Several people verified the discovery using computer hardware and software as early as February and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been the source of the supply of water to Earth along with organic matter that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, particularly how the Earth formed, since comets collided with the Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor earlier this year and signed a bill last month to legalize same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as "political bullshit and stupidity".
He is speculated to run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says would allow aircraft to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to older ground-based radar technology to allow air traffic controllers to determine the position of an aircraft with greater accuracy and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transport is provided and the surface trains will not stop at Wembley and parking and relay parking facilities are unavailable on the ground.
Fears of a lack of transportation raised the possibility that he would be forced to play the game behind closed doors without the team's supporters.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reports the formation of a new species of bird on the equatorial islands of the Galapagos.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species had evolved in just two generations, although this process was thought to take longer, due to the breeding between an endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into all kinds of shapes. It can be rolled into tiny shapes.
It can be pulled to become a thin wire, which can be twisted and dragged. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin, and embedded in another metal. It can be made so thin that it is sometimes used to decorate hand-painted illustrations in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
It's called chemical pH. You can make an indicator using red-collar juice.
The juice of cabbage changes color depending on the degree of acidity or base (alkalinity) of the chemical.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their protons removed from them (as hydrogen atoms are made up of a proton and an electron).
Put all two dry powders together and then, with clean, wet hands, squeeze them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will make you feel strange and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had communes with water in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated roof system.
Remains of roof systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also commones in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, commones were sometimes a part of public bathhouses where men and women were together in mixed company.
Since you're calling someone who's thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it back to Earth, almost instantaneously.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
It requires a giant rocket over 100 feet high to launch a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The most important thing the wheel has done for us is to give us a much easier and faster means of transportation.
We took the train, the car, and many other means of transportation.
Below them are medium-sized cats that feed on medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including stray domestic cats) that eat the vast majority of small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of the head, a special job that each cat has and which prevents them from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of cats, living in large groups called lions.
Lion packs are composed of one to three adult males of the same family, along with as many as thirty females and cubs.
Females are usually closely related to each other, being a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion packs act as pack dogs or wolves, animals that are similar in some ways to lions (but not to other cats) in behavior, and also very lethal to their prey.
A well-trained athlete, the tiger can climb (though not well), swim, jump great distances and pull five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of the tiger is not like the full-voice roar of the lion, but rather like a phrase of reborn and fussy words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. If they do, they will eat monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds. Most of the animals that ocelots hunt are much smaller than they are.
Scientists believe that ocelots follow and find animals to eat (catch) by their smell, telling where they have passed on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with their night vision and also move very stealthily.
When a small group of living things (a small population) is separated from the main population from which they came (such as by crossing a mountain range or a river, or moving to a new island so that they cannot easily return) they will often find themselves in a different environment than they were before.
This new environment has different resources and rivals, so the new population will need different traits or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than they needed before.
The original population has not changed at all, and still needs the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new surroundings, it begins to look less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, both populations will appear so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants make the oxygen that humans breathe, and take up the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (i.e. exhale).
Plants obtain their food from the sun by photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our homes from plants and we make our clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is from plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
Mosasaur was the most important predator of its time, and so it was not afraid of anything except other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were studded with more than 70 razor-like teeth, along with an extra blade in the roof of its mouth, meaning that there was no way to escape anything that crossed its path.
We do not know for sure, but he may have had a forked tongue. His diet included turtles, largemouth bass, other mosasaurs, and he may have been a cannibal himself.
It also attacked anything in the water; even a giant dinosaur like T. rex could not have weighed against it.
And although most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had their share of strange or unusual celebration elements, which included wild boars, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called a missara.
Another difference was that while the poor and women ate their food while sitting on chairs, the rich men liked to have banquets together where they were spread out on the side while eating their meals.
The ancient Roman diet may not have included foods that arrived in Europe from the Americas or Asia centuries later.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted a pot.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods which was considered to be the house of the god.
People brought sacrifices to the gods and priests tried to meet the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner sanctuary where only priests could enter.
Sometimes special pyramidal towers, called ziggurats, were built to be a part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the home was not so important.
Most of the Jewish family life was outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; shops were just open planks overlooking the street.
There were no significant forests in the land of Canaan, and so timber was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely settled. It is told in Norse sagas that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland because of a murder and, when he traveled further west, found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But even beyond its discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Although each country was 'Scandinavian', there were many differences between the people, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you probably think of a treasure map inscribed on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true. And although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
Written on the reverse of the Declaration of Independence were the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776". The text appears at the bottom of the document, on the reverse.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that early in his life, this large parchment document (measuring 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was wrapped for safekeeping.
It is therefore likely that the notation was added simply as a label.
The landings of D-Day, and the battles that followed, had liberated northern France, but the south was not yet free.
It was ruled by the "Vichy" French, who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders rather than fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
Within two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were turning toward Germany.
A civilization is a singular culture shared by a large, significant group of people who live and work cooperatively, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, a cognate of the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and also defines in some way the size of society.
A civilized culture involves the passing of knowledge over several generations, a persistent cultural weight, and an equitable diffusion.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving significant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as distinct civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states for the first time formed a weak central government - with Congress as its sole component - by virtue of the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no powers to impose taxes, and, as there was no national executive or judicial branch, it relied on state authorities, who were often uncooperative, to enforce all its decisions.
It also had no authority to pass tax laws and tariffs between states.
The articles required the unanimous consent of all states before they could be amended and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italy national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and were the 2006 FIFA World Cup champions.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, figure skating and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians taking part in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the seventh largest island in the world.
Because of the island group Japan has, Japan is often called, from a geographic point of view, an "archipel"
Taiwan's beginnings date back to the 15th century when passing European sailors recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or Polished Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a transformation in native grain production practices and employing Chinese laborers to work on its rice paddies and sugar plantations.
In 1683, forces of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal regions of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Three Window Chamber.
Most of the buildings on the sides of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of their original appearance.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration continues today.
For example, the most common format for still photography worldwide is 35mm, which was the dominant film format at the end of the analogue film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly its aspect ratio has been inherited by the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
The 35 mm format is actually, somewhat surprisingly, 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest integer ratio) is therefore said to be 3:2.
Many frequencies (the APS family of frequencies, for example) are equal to or very close to this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, which is widely abused and often ridiculed, is a simple guide that creates dynamism while maintaining a measure of order in an image.
He states that the most effective location for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into three vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic church, which had become wealthy and powerful, came under scrutiny.
For over a thousand years the Christian religion had bound together the European states despite differences in language and customs.
His omnipresent power affected everyone from the king to the villain.
One of the main Christian tenets is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church's monetary funds are specifically for this reason.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years and this concentration of power and money caused many people to question whether this principle was being respected.
Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain launched a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although the blockade violated the generally accepted international law codified by various international agreements of the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent all ships from entering entire sections of the ocean, causing further dangers to neutral shipping.
As there was a limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the dominant attitudes of most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, nations wanted to prevent such a situation from happening again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla went to the United States to accept a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with four cents to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his employer in his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of describing different time periods; each stage of China or each ruling family represented a distinct dynasty.
There was also an unstable period of divided provinces between each dynasty, the most well-known of which was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods a fierce war raged between many nobles vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying fighting to be seated on the highest seat in the great palace in Xian.
There are many social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Even after the Revolution the professions were open to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and bright to succeed.
It is the same for the military because instead of having rank-based army rankings, they are now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other people from the oppressed working classes in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond this mundane life. He frequented a pool which became known as "Hira" on the Mountain of "Noor" (the light) for contemplation.
The shroud itself, which has survived the test of time, gives a vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Perched on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the balma is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to find even if one knew it existed. Once inside the shell, it is completely isolated.
Nothing is visible except the clear, beautiful surrounding sky and the numerous surrounding mountains. Not much of this world can be seen or heard from the inside of the dome.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World that is still standing today.
Built by the Egyptians during the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramidal structures built to honor the dead pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Necropolis of Giza" in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several smaller tombs, several temples, and the great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was created to honor Pharaoh Khofo and mantles of the pyramids, tombs and smaller temples were built to honor Khofo's wives and family members.
The "high arch" mark looks like a V and the "low arch" mark looks like a graph or a square that lacks a bottom.
Up means you should start at the punch and throw the arrow, and down means you should start at the top (where your hand holds the arrow) and throw the arrow.
A high bow usually generates a softer sound, while a low bow is louder and more assertive.
You should feel free to make your own trademarks with a gray, but remember that printed trademarks are here for a musical reason, so they should be routinely respected.
The terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two young children (Marie Thérèse, 11, and Louis-Charles, 4) and the king's sister, Madame Elizabeth, on 6 October 1789 were sent back from Versailles to Paris by a crowd of market women.
They returned to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a mob of people shouting and shouting threats against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to have the windows of their carriage completely open.
In an instant a member of the crowd shook the head of a royal guard who had been killed at Versailles in the face of the terrified queen.
The war costs of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to recover money from a large part of the expenses and interest on bonds issued on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
Certainly, the superprofits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipinos would constitute the basic gains of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context in which they incited the creation of order.
The period in which these events took place is commonly known as the High Middle Ages, the period of European history during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 BC).
The High Middle Ages was preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technological progress or technological imperative to a strict sense that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the very development of technology follows a path that goes well beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has "effects" on societies that are inherent, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, it could be argued that the automobile necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However a national road network is not economically viable for just a handful of cars, and so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
The mass ownership of cars also leads to a higher incidence of road accidents, which leads to the invention of new medical techniques to repair bodily damage.
Romanticism had a strong element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time customs and culture linked to that geography emerged, and these, being in harmony with the place of society, were superior to arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was perceived as the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as an epicenter of luxury began around 400 BC and lasted until about 1100 BC.
Its status declined during the 12th century mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders had returned with gifts such as silks and spices that were more valuable than what the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this time that the transfer of the title of fashion capital from Constantinople to Paris was made.
Gothic architecture reached its peak during the period between the 10th-11th centuries and the 14th century.
At first the clothing was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to slow communication channels, styles in the west could reverberate backwards by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the major advances of this era was that as a result of the Crusades people began to use buttons to fasten their clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is an agriculture that is performed by producing enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often biological, system using stored seeds native to the ecoregion, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically many peasants were engaged in subsistence agriculture and this is still the case in many developing nations.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel neglected by societal norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished by age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The qualities that determine a subculture as distinct may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their belonging through a distinctive and symbolic use of a style, which may include fashion, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most frequently used methods to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw inspiration from some of the unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, abuse or deliberate mistreatment, were not socialized by adults during their growing up years.
Some feral children have been confined by persons (usually the parents themselves); in some cases, this abandonment of children was due to the rejection by the parents of a severe intellectual or physical disability of a child.
Wild children may have suffered violence or severe trauma during their childhood before being abandoned or fled.
Others are supposed to have been abducted by animals; some are said to have lived in the wild alone.
When completely abused by non-human animals, the feral child manifests behaviors (within its physical limits) almost entirely similar to those of the particular animal it adopts, such as its fear or indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning should be easier and more interesting to learn, it goes one step further.
Empowerment is not a learning method but rather an aid that provides support to individuals who are experiencing a new learning experience such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The Stags can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of a stage but is also the case with the Microsoft Office trombone man.
Virtual Improvements are built into software and have the function of questioning, prompting, and explaining processes that may have been too complex for the student to handle alone.
Children are placed in foster care for a wide variety of reasons ranging from neglect, abuse, and even extortion.
No child should have to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring, and educational, but they do.
We perceive the Foster Care system as a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving care staff, stable education and reliable health care.
Host families are supposed to provide all the needs that were missing in the home where they were taken in the first place.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive characteristics of Internat lead to additional dimensions in terms of uses and rewards.
For example, learning and socialization are suggested as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
Personal involvement and continuous relationships have also been identified as novel aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements that last for milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can detect if a person is lying by interpreting their microexpressions correctly.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, pointed out how people who were unable to understand a speech because of brain damage were nevertheless able to accurately assess sincerity.
It also suggests that such abilities to interpret human behavior may be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
20th century research has shown that there are two types of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
The mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the reservoir of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination blend the two-way variation between all two stocks in each generation.
In the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to humans to meet its amino acid needs from the resources available in plants.
In addition, failure to do so has serious consequences: growth disorders, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The most readily accessible plant resources would be the proteins available in leaves and vegetables, but they are difficult for primates like us to digest unless cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ants, chickens, eggs) are not only easily digested, but provide a large amount of protein that contains all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" to some extent in the same way that chimpanzees do in the savannah today.
Sleep interruption is the process of deliberately waking during your normal sleep period and falling asleep a little later (10 to 60 minutes).
This can be done easily by using a relatively discreet awakening to bring you into awareness without fully waking you up.
If you find yourself resetting the alarm during your sleep, it may be placed on the other side of the room, which will force you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options involve drinking a lot of fluids (particularly water or tea, a known diuretic) before bed, which forces you to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is in direct correlation to the amount of tension in the body and mind.
Where the tension is lower, the life force is more positive. All people have the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way of that goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but they were spread by the Mahayana path of love and by many techniques of Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is very simple in principle, consisting of kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of universal love.
With kundalini yoga, kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the yogi of divinity. Through visualization of various deities, energy channels are cleared, chakras are activated and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy during World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. From the end of the war onwards, confrontations of systems, processes and culture led to a break between these countries.
After two years of war, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It was to last for the next 40 years and would be fought for real, with proxy armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences were in full swing, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight, when more than 800,000 Soviet Union Red Army soldiers entered and established the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts following the invasion of the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to move large amounts of people and goods across oceans.
The job of the Marines has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains its ability to move its people and goods, while interfering with your enemy's ability to move its people and goods.
One of the most recent examples of this is the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, in which the Americans tried to move men and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, which used mainly U-boats, was trying to stop this movement.
If the Allies had been defeated, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain as it had with the rest of Europe.
Goats were apparently first domesticated some 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them for easy access to milk, fur, meat, and fur.
Domestic goats were generally kept in flocks that grazed on hillsides or other grassland, often overseen by shepherds who were often children or teenagers, similar to the generally better-known shepherds.
Hipomobile railways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the hippomobile railways consisted simply of parallel wooden posts, they allowed the horses that pulled them to reach higher speeds and pull larger loads than on the slightly rougher roads of the time.
Crosses were introduced early enough to keep the railings in place, but it was soon realized that the tracks would be more effective if they had an iron band over them.
This became common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones. In 1767, the first all-iron rails were introduced.
The earliest known means of transportation was walking, humans began walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus (which means erect man).
In their predecessors, australopithecines did not walk upright as they usually did.
Biped specialization is found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start by living more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and we can also be activists to reduce future suffering to some degree.
It's not just a symptomatic treatment in most cases. However, if we don't want a temporary solution, then we need to find the root of the problem, and we need to deactivate it.
It is quite obvious that the world has changed a lot because of humanity's scientific and technological advances, and the problems have become greater because of humanity's overpopulation and extravagant lifestyle.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten note signed by Speaker of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's printing house.
Overnight between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as the "Dunlap leaves".
The first public reading of the document was given by John NIxon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on 6 July, who had it read to his troops in New York on 9 July. A copy reached London on 10 August.
The 25 Dunlap leaflets that are known to still exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document.
Many paleontologists now believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are alive today.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have wings and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that go back to dinosaurs.
They have legs with claws and claws, lay eggs and walk on their hind legs like a T-Rex.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, such as 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits - or bits, in computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are sufficiently general that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indication of an internal poisoning may be the presence of an open medicine container or toxic household chemicals.
You should check the label for specific first aid instructions for this specific poison.
The term insect is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term derives from an ancient familiarity with worms, which are highly adapted insects that parasitize humans.
Both worms and killer worms are both nesting birds, adapted to live in a nest or housing of their host.
Across the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the dominant neurological disease in younger and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the nervous system, which is composed of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has found that women are twice as likely to have multiple sclerosis as men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interests, or in the best interests of their child, to adopt a child.
These couples may choose to make an adoption plan for their child.
In an adoption, the biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another partner can become the child's parent.
The main goal of science is to discover the way the world works through the scientific method, which actually guides most scientific research.
However, it is not just that, experimentation, and an experiment is a test that is used to rule out one or more possible hypotheses, ask questions, and make observations that also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, in particular, on the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views were accepted in all areas of science, including psychology.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend crucially on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to periodic external signals, have been documented in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue a period of free-running cycle even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main suggestions that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They performed two experiments by labeling either the DNA in the beech with radioactive phosphorus or the beech protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the size of the piece of genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas with the aim of enjoying the landscape, including flora and fauna.
Examples of field activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
One example is visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small rural towns in cars to their workplace and are passed by others whose work destination is the place they just left.
In this dynamic transportation shuttle, everyone is somehow connected to, and supports, a transportation system based on private cars.
Science indicates that this massive carbon economy has stripped the biosphere of one of its stable states that has sustained human evolution for the past two billion years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries you rarely hear similar levels of complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transportation systems generate such complaints, why do they not function properly on a daily basis? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they create with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult since driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
By contrast, drivers tend to behave in a reasonably consistent fan; thus, circulation currents tend to have some consistency and can be mathematically represented in a rough way.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help with the planning, design, and operations of road installations.
Insects were the first animals to fly, and their ability to fly helped them to escape from their enemies more easily and to find food and mates more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along the body.
This gives them a wider range of small prey to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and the ephemeral.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the Solar System moved around the Sun.
Some people thought he was right but many people believed otherwise; that the Solar System moved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
That sounds crazy, because it doesn't look like the Earth is moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the first largest river on Earth, carrying more than eight times the volume of water of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes as much as four miles (6 km) wide.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows through the world's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long, and collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in size and technical excellence in their construction.
Ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were admirers of the monuments of their predecessors, which were much older than a thousand years.
The population of Vatican City is around 800 people, making it the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the smallest population.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the language of everyday life for most of those who work in the state while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, since they can all be found in nature in their native forms and are relatively easy to mine with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
It was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although it was also theorized that they change into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are basically mixtures of two or more metals.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
It may also contain alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly tiny that trillions of them could fit into the dot at the end of this sentence.
And so, the grasshopper was a good friend to many people when it first appeared.
It is sad but with the advent of new writing methods, the greedon has been relegated to a lesser status and employment.
People now write messages on their computers or on computer screens, without ever having to shut themselves off from a lawn.
One can only wonder what will become of the keyboard when something new comes along.
The fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to push a nucleus together and force protons and neutrons together.
It is a bit like rolling a heavy cart up a hill. Fractionating the nucleus back up then releases some of this energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei which means they tend to separate with a small push or even less.
The Moon's surface is made of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the opposite side.
It is thinner under the sea and thicker under the highlands.
There may be more sea on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what people choose or what is of interest to them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized from the time they mature into adulthood.
These theories examine what it is about certain people that makes them envious of the things they do and what things in their environment will or will not make them do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally, two behaviors can emerge when managers start to lead their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is trying to remain "one of the guys" (or the girls).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, exercising disciplinary actions, evaluating performance, assigning responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, another becomes a misrecognized individual who feels he or she must change everything his or her team has done and take ownership of it.
Ultimately, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of his team.
This behavior often results in rifts between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
The members of a virtual team often function as the point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members as their teams can meet in varying time zones that may not be covered by their local government.
The presence of a real invisible team (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The invisible team is the leadership team to which each member reports. The invisible team sets the rules for each member.
Why should an organization want to go through the laborious process of building a learning organization? Innovation is one of the goals when implementing organizational learning concepts.
When all available resources are effectively used across the functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
Consequently, an organization's process of working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to serve the needs of the customer.
Before an organization can be innovative, management must create a culture of innovation and at the same time share knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006), describes the continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to research on cognition, thus limiting the scope of research and making it much more accurate.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior validates the research of scientists.
It has long been known that different types of brain injury, trauma, injury, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and study brain structures and processes never seen before.
This provides us with a wealth of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although AI has a strong science fiction connotation, AI forms a very important branch of computing, dealing with behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
AI research involves building machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, scheduling and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
Such things have become separate disciplines, which focus on providing solutions to real problems in life.
The dIA system is now widely used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, having been built into various computer applications and home video games.
Field trips are an important part of every classroom. Often a teacher would like to take their students to places where a bus ride is not an option.
Technology provides the solution with virtual field trips, where students can view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire fine art while sitting with their class.
Sharing a field trip virtually is also a great way to catch up on an excursion and share experiences with future classes.
For example, each year students at the Bennet School in North Carolina create a website about their trip to the state capital, and each year the website is redesigned, but older versions are kept online to serve as albums.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing. While students often start their blogging experience with a neglected grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience generally changes that.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blog writer begins to make a good effort to improve his writing and avoid criticism.
At the same time, blogging "forces students to become more aware of the world around them". The need to nurture the interest of the audience inspires students to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Using a blog is a tool that inspires collaboration, and encourages students to extend learning beyond the traditional school day.
Proper use of blogs "can stimulate students to become more analytical and critical; through active responses to Internet material, students can define their positions in the context of other writings as well as highlight their own perspectives on particular topics (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the attractive bilingual capital of Canada and features a good array of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Niagara Falls lies much further south and the north is the Muskoka Region of Outstanding Natural Beauty and beyond.
All of these things and more highlight Ontario in what is considered the quintessence of what is Canadian to outsiders.
The larger northern ranges are rather sparsely populated and some are mostly uninhabited wilderness regions.
To make a population comparison that may surprise many people: There are more African Americans living in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and a continent in its own right in terms of wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known as luxury resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the territories, and it became established in a significant way in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began during the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found the Cape European route to India.
To the north the region is bounded by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
For women: It is recommended that all female travelers report being married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It is also useful to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
Women should realize that cultural differences can result in what they might consider harassment and it is not unusual for them to be followed, handcuffed, etc.
You must be firm when you reject men, and not be afraid to defend your territory (cultural differences or not, that's not normal!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen during the 10th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merenians as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1775.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya and Spanish traders who had established trading bases named it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina it is easy to find stalls selling traditional Moroccan products, such as tajinas, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and a whole range of other things, but it is all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo on the far eastern coast of Rwanda.
In 2002 Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano which buried most of the streets in the city, particularly the city centre.
Although Goma is reasonably safe, all visits outside Goma should be studied to understand the state of ongoing fighting in North Kivu province.
The town is also the base for climbing Nyiragongo volcano along with some of the least expensive mountain gorilla trails in Africa.
A boda-boda (a motorcycle taxi) can be used to get around Goma. The normal (local) fare is ~500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, "Timboctó" has come to be used as a metaphor for exotic and distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a city of poverty, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger, due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the main stages during the special program Wonders of the African World by Henry Louis Gates on PBS.
The city is in stark contrast to the rest of the country's cities, as it has a more Arab than African style.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and borders Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered the hallmark of South Africa's National Parks (SANParks).
As with all national parks in South Africa, there is a daily fee for preservation and admission to the park.
It can also be advantageous for someone to purchase a Wild Card, which provides entry to either select parks in South Africa or all of South Africa's national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the place that many tourists consider as their main attraction.
The cluster of buildings that make up the skyline of Hong Kong has been compared to a bright bar chart made visible by the presence of Victoria Harbour's waters.
For the best views of Hong Kong, you should leave the island and head towards the Kowloon waterfront in front.
The vast majority of urban development on Hong Kong Island is densely packed on reclaimed land along the north shore.
This is where the British colonists took over as their own and if you are looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, it is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the world's largest belt of coastal mangroves, extending 80 km (50 mi) across the Bangladeshi and Indian hinterlands from the coast.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest in the interior of Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not just mangrove swamps but also include some of the last remaining patches of the mighty forests that once covered the Gangetic Plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, of which about one-third is covered by water or swamps.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are currently 400 royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 deer in the area.
Buses leave from the inter-district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, particularly those heading east and Jakar/Bumthang depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since buses between districts are often full, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most of the districts are served by small Japanese Coaster buses, which are comfortable and robust.
Sharing a taxi is a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby destinations, such as Paro (No. 150) and Punakha (No. 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge spanning the Oyapock River connecting the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The twin towers rise to a height of 83 metres, are 378 metres long and have two lanes each 3.50 metres wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres (49 ft).[citation needed] Construction was completed in August 2011, but the bridge was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational by September 2017 when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most significant indigenous group to inhabit what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes such as the guaycurús and payaguás, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
During the 16th century Paraguay, which was formerly called "the giant Province of the Indies", was born as a result of the encounter between the Spanish conquistadors and the native indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to maintain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is well known for having one of the best teams and polo players in the world.
The most important tournament of the year is held in December at the polo grounds in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For tournament news and where to buy tickets for polo matches, visit Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falklands pound (FKP) which is equivalent in value to one British pound (GBP).
Cash can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands which is located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
British pounds will be generally accepted anywhere in the islands and inside Stanley credit cards and US dollars are also commonly accepted.
On remote islands, credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, although British and American currencies may be taken; check with property owners in advance to determine what is an acceptable method of payment.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falklands currency outside the islands, so exchange your money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the Equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; during the summer months, temperatures above 30°C are common.
Winters can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no particularly "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are used to seeing humans, the wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or harassed.
According to park officials, you must stay at least 100 yards away from bears and wolves and 25 yards away from all other wildlife!
It doesn't matter if they look like ducks, bison, wapitis, orcas, bears, and almost any other beautiful animal can attack.
Each year, dozens of visitors are injured because they do not keep a proper distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them their space.
Also, be aware that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or eating contaminated food and keep the field clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on Upolu Island and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of an infamous naval encounter in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships were sunk, one British cruiser missing. Nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful rally in the town resulted in the death of the supreme leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, due to Auckland's location between two ports. The most popular are in three areas.
The beaches of the North Shore (in the North Harbour district) are on the Pacific Ocean and stretch as far as Long Bay to the north and Devonport to the south.
Most of them are sandy beaches where you can swim safely, and most have shady areas provided by pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located on the Waitemata Harbour, in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
They are family beaches sometimes very busy with a good range of shops lined up on the shore.
The main local beer is 'Number One', which is not a complex beer, but is pleasant and refreshing.
There are many French wines to choose from, but wines from New Zealand and Australia could travel better.
Local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but bottled water is good to find if you have any concerns.
For Australians, the concept of 'flat white' coffee is foreign; a short black coffee is an espresso, the cappuccino comes with a very creamy crust (no foam), and the tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Many trips to the islands are made year-round, and accidents due to any of these things on the islands are rare.
However, you should take the advice of the authorities, respect all signs and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish appear on beaches and along river estuaries from October to April in the north of the 1770s.
The larvae do exist, although they rarely attack humans. Most larvae are afraid of humans and would swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live actively in the ocean, their main habitat being in the estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler the peace of mind that they will have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with specific hotels, although you may be able to book other forms of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agent.
Travel agents often offer packages that include breakfast, transportation arrangements to and from the airport or some package that combines flights with hotels.
They can also hold your reservation if you need time to think about the proposal or to obtain other documents for your destination (such as a visa).
Any changes or requests should however be notified through the travel agent first and not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of music festival attendees choose to live on site, and most attendees consider it a vital part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action you'll need to get up early to get a campsite close to the music.
Remember that although the music on the main stages may have ended, there may be sections of the festival that will continue to play music late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping roles for families with young children.
If you are crossing the North Baltic in winter, you should check the location of the cabin, as crossing the ice causes a rather horrible noise for the most affected people.
Cruises to St. Petersburg include time spent in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from the visa requirement (check conditions).
Casinos typically make great efforts to maximize time and money spent by customers. Windows and clocks are usually absent, and exits can be difficult to find.
They usually have special food and drink and entertainment proposals, to keep customers in a good mood, and to keep them in their place.
Some establishments offer alcoholic beverages on the premises, however, drunkenness alters judgment and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Those who are driving at high latitudes or on mountain slopes should consider the possibility of encountering snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is weak and you cannot drive as if you were on bare asphalt.
During blizzards, enough snow to keep you still can fall in a very short time.
Visibility may also be restricted by snow falling or carried by wind, condensation or ice on the vehicle's windshields.
On the other hand, conditions under ice and snow are normal in many countries, and traffic is almost uninterrupted year-round.
Safaris are perhaps the most important tourist attraction in Africa and are a strong point for many visitors.
The term safari in popular usage refers to land travel to observe the magnificent African wildlife, particularly the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get close to cars and standard equipment will allow them to be well observed.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy and you'll see them best with twins.
A walking safari (also called a "bushwalk", "safari excursion", or "footing") consists of walking, either for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some events will be held in other venues throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, having hosted the games in 1964.
If you have booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the report is announced, you may have a problem.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March most cancellation policies due to the coronavirus do not extend until July 2020, when the Olympic Games were originally scheduled.
It is expected that most tickets for the competitions will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with typical tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Straightening wet clothes can help dry them. Many hotels have a iron and a straightening post available to borrow, even if there are no presents in the room.
If a hair dryer is not available or you do not feel comfortable wearing smooth tapes, then you can try using a hair dryer, if one is available.
You should be careful not to let the fabric get too hot (which can cause a discharge, or in extreme cases, a burn).
There are different ways of purifying water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some places boiling water for a minute is sufficient, in others several minutes are necessary.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and in the event of a problem, you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter unfamiliar animals that they are not familiar with in their home regions.
Nose-catching animals can spoil food, cause irritation or, in the worst cases, cause allergic reactions, spread worms or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people by force, do not fall into the category of harmful things.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to purchase products exempt from taxes and special duties in certain locations.
Travelers heading to countries with high tariffs can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, particularly on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh freeway, frequently passing through isolated woodland.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, keep a calm mind: steep ski slopes, narrow lanes and tight turns predominate.
The posted speed limits are significantly lower than in the previous and subsequent sections  frequently 35 to 40 miles per hour (56 to 64 km/h)  and strict adherence to them is even more important than otherwise.
Interestingly, however, mobile phone service is much stronger here than in many other portions of the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German cooking is very good, and in Bavaria, it is very rich and varied, similar to that of its southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruits in the pastry shop are frequent, with apples cooked in cakes all year round, and cherries and plums making their appearance during the summer.
Many baked German products also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Popular cakes go particularly well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want some small but rich pastries, try what, depending on the region, is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
A curry is a dish based on aromatic herbs and spices, accompanied by either meat or vegetables.
A curry can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on the liquid content.
In the inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is an umbrella term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines found across the nation.
However, when used without qualification, the term tends to mean food that is originally from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine has a range of simple seasoned dishes, the predominant flavors that Javanese people prefer are cocoa, peppers, sugar (particularly coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The stirrups are supports for the rider's feet that hang on either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability to the rider but can create safety concerns due to the potential for the rider's feet to become trapped.
If a rider is ejected from a horse but has a foot caught in the stirrup, he may be knocked down if the horse runs away. To minimize this risk, a number of safety precautions can be taken.
First, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a soft, narrow sole.
Furthermore, some saddles, particularly English saddles, have safety bars that allow a straw leather to fall off the saddle if pulled back by a falling rider.
Cochamó Valley - Chile's premier climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of large granite walls and gorges.
The peaks include breathtaking views from the peaks. Climbers from all parts of the world continually establish new routes between its potentially infinite walls.
Snow sports in the fall, which include skiing and snow surfing, are popular sports that involve skating on a snow-covered terrain with skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity that has many enthusiasts, occasionally known as "ski vagabonds", who plan entire ski-centric vacations in a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old  cave paintings depicting squares date back as far as 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century and, in 1861, the first leisure ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Skiing: This activity is also called backcountry skiing, hiking skiing or skiing excursion.
It is a relative but not usually included in alpine-style skiing or mountaineering trips, the latter of which are done on steep terrain and require much stiffer skis and boots.
You should think of a ski itinerary as a similar itinerary to a hiking trip.
Under good conditions you can cover relatively longer distances than walking  but you will very rarely reach cross-country skiing speeds without a heavy bag on damaged slopes.
Europe is a relatively small continent with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through multiple countries would mean having to go through visa applications and passport controls repeatedly.
The Schengen area, however, functions to some extent like a country in this case.
As long as you stay in this area, you can generally cross borders without going through passport control points again.
Similarly, when you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa for each Schengen member country separately, and you will save time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition on what manufactured objects are antiques. Some tax agencies define goods older than 100 years as antiques.
This definition has some geographic variations, as the age limit may be lower in places like North America than in Europe.
Craft products could be defined as ancient, even if they are more recent than similar mass-produced products.
Reindeer herding is an important source of income among the Sami and the culture surrounding the trade is also important for many who have other professions.
More traditionally, not all Sami have participated in large-scale reindeer herding, but have lived off fishing, hunting and the like, keeping reindeer primarily as game animals.
Today many Sami work in modern trades. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sami country.
Although in common usage, particularly among non-Roma, the word "gypsy" is often considered offensive because of its associations with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of Roma people.
If the country you are visiting is the subject of travel advisories, your travel health insurance or your travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
You may also wish to consult the advice of governments that are not your own, although their advice is intended for their citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may be confronted with situations different from those of Europeans or Arabs.
Travel advice is simply a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The opinions presented are often superficial, general, and oversimplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Inclement weather is the generic term for any type of weather phenomenon that has the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of human life.
Inclement weather can occur anywhere in the world, and there are several different types, depending on geography, topography, and weather conditions.
High winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and wildfires are forms and effects of inclement weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, sea-thunderstorms, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal violent weather phenomena include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travellers are strongly advised to be aware of all risks of severe weather that may affect their area as it may affect all their travel plans.
Those planning to visit a country that could be considered a war zone should undergo professional training.
An Internet search for 'cursed by hostile environment' will likely provide the address of a local company.
A course should normally cover all the topics discussed here in much more detail, usually with some practical experience.
A course will normally last between 2 and 5 days and will include role-playing games, many elements of first aid and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines dealing with survival in the wilderness are frequent, but publications dealing with war zones are scarce.
Travelers planning to have sex reassignment surgery abroad should ensure that they bring valid documents for the return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports with an unmarked gender (X) or documents updated to match a desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to honor these documents is simply variable everywhere.
Scratches at security checkpoints also became much more intrusive after September 11, 2001.
Preoperative transgender people should not expect to pass through the scans with their privacy and dignity intact.
The rip currents are the ebb and flow of waves that move away from the shore, often to a cliff or something nearby.
Because of the underwater topology the return flow is concentrated in a few deep sections, and a rapid current to the deep waters can form.
Most deaths occur as a result of fatigue from trying to swim to shore against the current, which may be impossible.
Once you are out of the stream, swimming back is no more difficult than it normally is.
Try to head somewhere where you won't be trapped again or, depending on your abilities and if you've been noticed, you may want to wait for help.
Rebound shock occurs faster than culture shock (and less than a honeymoon phase), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who have had an easy time adapting to their new culture sometimes have particularly difficult times adjusting to their original culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you have adapted to the new culture and have lost some of the habits of your original culture.
When you first travel abroad, people are likely to be patient and understanding, knowing that travelers to a new country need to adapt.
People may not anticipate that patience and understanding are also needed for travelers returning home.
The sound and light show is one of the area's most interesting things for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the show starts.
You usually hear the sound of tourists and vendors at a distance. The history of sounds and lights is simply like a storybook.
The Sphinx serves as a backdrop and narrator for a long story.
Scenes are projected onto the pyramids and the different pyramids are alluded to.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several nations and hold the most bases, with sixteen active as of 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula, the largest being King George Island with the village of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island, and Deception where the flooded caldera of a still active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the region to the south of the peninsula, bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula merge into the plateau, and then re-emerge to form the Ellsworth Mountains range, cut in half by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part of the Sentinel Range includes Antarctica's highest mountain, the Vinson Massif, which peaks at 12,950 feet (4,892 m) above Mount Vinson.
In remote areas, without mobile phone coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone is generally not a replacement for a mobile phone, as you need to be outside with a clear line of sight to the satellite to make a call.
The service is frequently used by ships, including pleasure craft, as well as expeditions that require data and voices.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide more information about how to connect to this service.
An increasingly popular option for those planning to take a gap year is to travel to learn.
It is particularly popular with high school dropouts, who can take a gap year before college without compromising their education.
In most cases, enrolling for a gap year to study abroad can actually improve your chances of entering higher education when you return to your home country.
There will generally be tuition fees to enroll in these educational programs.
Finland is an excellent destination for boating. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" has thousands of islands as well, in its lakes and coastal archipelagoes.
In the archipelagos and lakes you don't necessarily need a yacht.
Although the coastal archipelagos and larger lakes are actually large enough for all types of yachts, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every seven to eight people.
This coincides with Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but is otherwise quite unique (for example in the Netherlands the number is one in forty).
Most of the different Baltic Cruises include a long stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can visit the historic town for a couple of full days and then sleep on the night boat again.
If you are only going ashore as part of the ship's excursions you will not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some cruise lines feature Berlin, Germany in the brochures. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not near the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Air travel can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and circumstances, particularly if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
It's not something to be ashamed of: it's no different than the personal fears and aversions of other things that most people have.
For some, understanding something about the operation of an aircraft and what happens during a flight can help overcome a fear that is based on the unknown or being unable to control anything.
Courier companies are well paid for delivering things quickly. Frequently, time is very important for business documents, goods or spare parts for an emergency repair.
On some routes, the major airlines had their own aircraft, but for other routes and smaller companies there was a problem.
If the goods are sent by air freight, on some routes, it may take days to get through the unloading and customs stages.
The only way to get it through faster was to send it as baggage in the trunk.
The obvious way to fly first class or business class is to spend a good amount of money on this privilege (or, even better, have your company do it for you).
However, it is not cheap: as a general rule, you can expect to pay up to at least four times the regular price in economy class for business class and eleven times the regular price for first class!
In general, there is no point in looking for discounts for business class or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a certain core group of travelers who are willing to pay big bucks for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, and are billed accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău, where the local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely spoken.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any UN member states.
Economic ties were re-established between these two parts of Moldova despite the failure of political negotiations.
The most important religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of approximately 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transport hub.
Formerly the ancient city of Smyrna, it is now a modern, developed and busy center of commercial operations, set around a huge bay and surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, glass-faced buildings and modern shopping malls are lined with traditional red-tiled roofs, the 18th-century marketplace and the old mosques and churches, although the city has a more Mediterranean European than traditional Turkish feel.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the neighbouring island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the cemetery, there are interesting marble dove carvings on some of the tombs.
It's worth a half-hour's walk in this strange village.
To the north is easy access to the romantic and fascinating town of Sintra which was made famous by foreigners after a soothing account of its splendors documented by Lord Byron.
Scotturb Bus 403 travels regularly to Sintra, stopping at Cabo da Roca.
In the north you should also visit the great Shrine of Our Lady of Fatima (holy place), a site of world-famous Marian apparitions.
Please remember that you are visiting a site of mass graves and also a site that has a significantly incalculable significance for a significant portion of the world's population.
There are still many living men and women who survived their time here, and many more who had loved ones who were murdered or worked there until their deaths, both Jews and non-Jews.
Please treat the site with all the dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves. Do not make fun of the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not degrade the site by writing or scratching graffiti on the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half prefer to speak Catalan, a vast majority understand it, and virtually all are fluent in Spanish.
However, most of the panels are shown only in Catalan as it is established by law as the first official language.
However, Spanish is also widely used in public transportation and other facilities.
Regular announcements in the metro are made only in Catalan, but unforeseen disruptions are announced by an automated system in a wide variety of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, rude, and arrogant.
Although often an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get a haircut in Paris is still to prove your best behavior, by acting like someone who is "bien élevé" (very polite).
The abrupt exterior of Parisians will evaporate quickly if you try a few basic courtesies.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, mostly with forests, pine forests and spruce, and features a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a remarkably wide variety of plant communities, due to its range of microclimates, different soils, and varying altitude levels.
The range also hosts an extremely wide variety of animal and bird species.
Rare wildlife can be found here, including the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, cat, lynx, feral cat and wild peacock, as well as many other common species.
When visiting monasteries, women are asked to wear gowns that cover their knees and have their shoulders covered as well.
Most monasteries provide women with shawls that are not prepared, but if you wear your own, particularly one with bright colors, you will receive a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
In the same way, men were required to wear trousers that covered their knees.
This can also be borrowed from the back of the store at the entrance but this dress is not washed after each use and so you may not feel comfortable wearing these gowns.
Maltese cuisine, like that of similar Mediterranean regions, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (usually pork), and uses olive oil throughout.
A popular simple dinner, especially during the summer, is the oil bread: bread with olive oil, tomatoes, and all sorts of accompaniment available such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All names, including the word Sie for you, always begin with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and objects.
It certainly makes reading easier, although the writing is a bit complicated by the need to figure out if a verb or an adjective is used in a substantivized form.
Pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian as most words are pronounced exactly as they are written
The main letters to look out for are c and g, as their pronunciation varies depending on the next vowel.
Also, make sure you pronounce the r and rr differently: caro means car, while carro means cart.
Persian has a relatively easy and generally regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this introduction to grammar will help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand the phrases.
Needless to say, if you know a Romance language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
However, people who know a little Spanish can quickly conclude that Portuguese is close enough that it does not need to be studied separately.
Pre-modern observatories are usually obsolete today and remain as museums, or educational sites.
Since light pollution in their heyday was not the type of problem they are today, they are usually located in cities or on campuses, easier to reach than those built during the modern era.
Most modern research telescopes are large installations in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Watching the cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China where plum blossoms were the flower of choice.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were hosted by the emperor alone for him and other members of the aristocracy around the Imperial Court.
Plants look better when they are in a natural setting, so you need to resist the temptation to pick "just one" specimen.
If you visit a formal landscaped garden, collecting a few "specimens" will also leave you stunned, no question.
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place to visit and very easy to navigate, and you can shop almost anything as soon as you arrive.
But since it is located in the "high tropics" just a few degrees north of the equator you will have to manage both the heat (continuously) and the strong sun (when the sky is clear, more rarely).
There are also some buses that go north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives.
You should check that the bus you are planning to take is going to Hebron and not just to the neighboring Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good base theme for a holiday.
Examples include visiting the castles of the Leire Valley, the Rhine Valley or cruising to interesting sites on the Danube or boating on the Erie Canal.
They also define routes for popular hiking and biking trails.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity, and is celebrated as the birth of Jesus.
Several of the traditions surrounding the holidays have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian and non-Christian countries around the world.
There is a tradition of spending Easter night awake at an exposed spot to watch the sun rise.
There are certainly Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may have been a pre-Christian ritual of spring and fertility.
Most traditional churches often celebrate an Easter Vigil on Saturday night during Easter Sunday, with congregations often starting the celebration as early as the first of midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All animals that first arrived on the islands arrived either by swimming, flying or floating.
Because of the long distance from the mainland mammals were unable to make the journey, making the giant tortoise the main animal to be found in the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of humans in the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This offers a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights, as the sky will be dark for most of the day.
Since the areas are sparsely populated, and light pollution is therefore often not a problem, you will also be able to take advantage of the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners are used to.
The costumes are standard work clothes and the colleagues are called by their surname or by their job title.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial, emphasizing group effort rather than praising individual performance.
Workers often have to obtain approval from their superiors for all decisions they make, and are expected to obey their superiors' instructions without question.
