Members of the Welsh Assembly fear that they will look like the "Mappet dolls"
Some feared the name of the assembly could be changed to MWPs (Member of the Welsh Parliament) , meaning Members of the Welsh Parliament.
This controversy arose over plans to change the Assembly to the Parliament of Wales.
AM means that the members of the assembly, on all political spectrums, think that they can be laughed at.
One AM Labourist reported that his team was "worried about the rhyme with Twp and Pwp".
Readers of Welsh news from abroad: twp means "wonderful", pwp means "wonderful" in Welsh.
He said that the nationalist and social-democratic political parties in Wales were generally "not liberal" and offered alternative options.
Although the Conservative Party of Wales was open to the change of name, the transition from the MWP to the Muppets was swift.
In this context, the Welsh letter w is read similarly to the English u for Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently working on a bill to amend the name, declared: "The decision as to how the members of the Assembly are to be called is, of course, up to the members themselves".
Under the Government of Wales Act 2017, the Welsh Assembly has the right to change its name.
When the Commission published the results of the public consultation on the proposals in June, it became clear that they preferred to call the assembly the Parliament of Wales.
As for the name, the Commission preferred the Welsh MPs' variant WMP, but the MWP variant received the most votes during the public consultation.
Assembly members seem to have proposed alternative options, but reaching an agreement on this debate could prove difficult for Chairman Elin Jones, who is expected to present the amended bill within a few weeks.
The reform legislation includes the methods of operation of the assembly, as well as the rules for the disqualification of assembly members and the structure of the committee system.
The Assembly members, after deliberating on the legislation, will make a final choice on how they should be named.
Macedonians vote on the name change in referendum
On Sunday, voters will be able to decide whether to accept or reject the name change to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The referendum was part of a long-running dispute with neighboring Greece over its own province of Macedonia.
Athens' leaders, on the other hand, believed that their northern neighbors could lay claim to their lands because of the name of the state, and opposed their accession to the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President George Ivanov, who has been opposed to the change of name by the people, said he was cool to the vote.
However, the supporters of the referendum, as well as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that the change of the name of the state is the price that the country can pay for joining the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's Church are silent, as are the churches in Harlem
All the old people I talked to, there were historical bars and churches in every corner  said Mr. Adam.
There is nothing here today.
He says that the disappearance of Barz is understandable.
"Today, people communicate in many ways", he says.
Bars are not the neighboring hotels that other people regularly frequent.
As for the churches, the leaders feared that the money they had bought the assets with would not last long, and sooner or later they would return to where they had started.
He added that churches could be made into houses in large numbers, and that condominiums could be filled with people who were indifferent to other churches or temples.
"Most of the people who live in these condominiums will be white", he said, "and they'll be waiting for these churches to close down, because it's suspicious that people who move into these condominiums will go to these churches".
Both churches were built by the Union of the Whites, before Harlem became a black community in 1870, and St. Martin's Church was built ten years later.
The first white Methodist community moved in the 1930s.
The black community had been praying nearby, and they were granted ownership of the building.
The St. Martin's Church was occupied by a black community led by John Howard Johnson, also known for leading the boycott of 125th Street, a major shopping street in Harlem that opposed the hiring of blacks.
The 1939 fire caused considerable damage to the building, but Johnson's followers still made plans to rebuild the building, and they commissioned the carillon.
David Johnson, the son and successor of John Johnson, proudly called the carillon of St. Martin's Church the "Bells of the Swordsmen".
However, in July, a specialist who played the coryolin gave it another name: "Cultural treasure" and "indisputable historical instrument".
Experts from the University of Michigan, such as Tiffany Ann, also claimed that this was the first carillon played by black musician Dionicio A. Lind, who had moved to the large carillon of the Riverside Church 18 years earlier.
Mr. Merriweather said that the carillon in St. Martin's Church had not been replaced.
The situation at St. Martin's Cathedral during the last few months was a complicated one for architects and contractors, some of whom were invited by secular church leaders and others by the Episcopal Diocese.
The organ that administered the visitation of the relic, consisting of the common people, wrote a letter to the Eparchy in July, fearing that it would not attempt to "receive the expenses of the Eparchy", because the architects and contractors sent by the Eparchy were not hired.
Some churchgoers complained that the diocese was not being openly transparent.
13-year-old California lobster catcher attacked by shark
A shark attack on a 13-year-old boy who was being chased by lobsters in California on Saturday left him injured, officials said.
The attack took place at 7 a.m., near the beach of Bicon in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he and his friends had been swimming for about half an hour on Saturday morning when they heard a child screaming for help and they and their friends went to help the boy.
Hamel first thinks the boy is excited to catch the lobsters, but then he realizes that the boy is screaming "They bit me!"
I was bitten!
When he reached the boy, Hammel noticed that his arm was torn.
"I shouted to everyone to get out of the water: There's a shark in the water!" added Hammel.
The boy was airlifted to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was in critical condition.
The species of the shark that attacked is unknown.
Rescue captain Larry Dжайls said that the shark was seen in the area a few weeks ago, but that it was a safe species, he told a briefing for the SMI.
Dжайls noted that the victim had suffered an injury to the upper body.
Officials closed the beaches of Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami Beach in Echinita for 48 hours for safety and investigative purposes.
More than 135 species of sharks live in the area, but most of them do not pose a threat to humans, Dжайls added.
Sainsbury plans to conquer the British beauty market
Sainsbury bought the universal style of beauty wardrobe from the Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams stores, which were staffed by assistant-experts.
The British beauty market, which had grown to £2.8 billion, continued to grow, while fashion and household goods fell in price, so the 11 stores across the country had to consider setting up larger beauty salons, and if all went well, the next year would have to be followed by more stores.
Investments in beauty come in the form of using the space of shelves in supermarkets that used to be occupied by televisions, microwaves and household goods.
Sainsbury said they will increase their beauty cosmetics offer to 3,000 products, including the brands Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. Pawd.
The existing L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees lines will also be expanded, with a special section, as in the Boots store.
The supermarket also updated its range of boutique cosmetics, most of which were vegan cosmetics, as there was a demand for such cosmetics among young people.
In addition, fragrance retailer Fragrance Shop will test the discounts in two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened last week in the Croydon area of south London, and the second of which will open later this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Due to the shift from online stores and local 24-hour stores to buying groceries on a daily basis, supermarkets have had to work harder to attract people.
Sainsbury's chief executive Mike Coop said that retailers will become more like department stores as supermarkets try to counter the discounting of Aldi and Lidl, which sell a wide range of promotional and non-food items.
Sainsbury had established points of sale in Argos, as well as a good site obtained two years earlier, which, he said, had increased the revenue from the barn.
The supermarket's previous attempt to revamp its beauty and pharmacy departments had been unsuccessful.
Sainsbury and Boots had tried to do business together in the early 2000s, but the relationship broke down when they were unable to share the profits from the sale.
The new strategy came three years after Sainsbury sold its 281-store Celesio pharmacy business to the Lloyds Pharmacy pharmacy chain for £125 million.
It said the Lloyds chain would add luxury brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy to its expanded assortment of four stores.
Paul Mills Hicks, Commercial Director at Sainsbury's, said: "We have changed the look and feel of our beauty salons to make our customers feel good.
We also had special inquisition officers who could give advice.
Our brand range is designed with all the needs of the buyer in mind, and with a charming appearance and convenient location, we have now become a place of ideal beauty, which defies the old laws of marketing.
After Holly Willoughby walked out of an £11 million deal, Peter Jones was "enraged"
Peter Jones, the star of Dragon's Den, was "deeply offended" when presenter Holly Willoughby's £11 million lifestyle brand went out of business, with Willoughby signing new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for the homewear and accessories brand Truly.
The couple's business has been compared to the Goop brand by Gwyneth Paltrow.
Today, the 37-year-old morning TV presenter announced his departure from the project on Instagram.
Holly Willow, who was with Dragons Den star Peter Jones, walked out of the lifestyle brand business at the last minute and began working on her new contracts with M&S and ITV.
Sources said that during a tense meeting at the headquarters of Marlow, the business empire in Buckinghamshire, on Tuesday, Jones was "exasperated" after Willoughby told him he had "no time left at all" for his new £1.5 million contracts for the Truly brand.
As the business was similar to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand, it could double Willowby's estimated £11 million fortune.
After 37-year-old Willoughby announced his departure from Truly on Instagram, Jones left Britain for one of his vacation homes.
According to a source, "In fact, Truly  was one of Holly's main priorities.
This was his chance to live the next few decades with ease, rather than a long future.
The decision to let her go was a shock to all.
No one could believe what had happened on Tuesday, as the project was about to begin.
The headquarters of Marlow has a warehouse full of ready-to-sell goods.
Experts believe that the exit of the star of Britain's most profitable morning show, "Today", could cost the firm millions of dollars, as inventions of everything from beds to clothing have been made for a long time and may be delayed.
This may explain the end of a long-standing friendship.
The mother of three, Willowby, and her husband, Dan Bolduin Jones, were close friends of Jones and his wife, Tara Kapp, for ten years.
Willoughby co-founded Truly with Kapp in 2016, and the 52-year-old Jones joined them as chairman in March.
The families were on vacation together, and Jones owned 40% of the Bolduin television firm.
Willoughby will become the new brand ambassador for M&S and will replace former ITV presenter Ent McPartlin, who was the host of I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said the following on Tuesday: "We don't comment on his business dealings".
The conversation got complicated, and then we fell in love.
Some considered the comment to be "unworthy of the president", and Trump joked that he would be criticized by the media for his positive attitude toward the North Korean leader.
Why is President Trump so resigned?
Trump grins in the voice of a news anchor.
I have not given up.
Kim had agreed to meet with Kim for the second time after their first meeting in Singapore in June was hailed by Trump as a major step toward North Korea's denuclearisation.
However, the talks on the abandonment of nuclear weapons did not produce results.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong-ho, told state leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the United States had not seen a "proper response" to North Korea's initial steps toward denuclearization.
Instead, he says, the U.S. continues to exert pressure with the help of sanctions.
Trump's speech at the rally was particularly optimistic.
"We have a good relationship with North Korea", he said.
We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
Now we have a good relationship.
He said efforts to improve relations with Kim have had positive results: missile tests have been halted, hostages have been released and the remains of American soldiers have been returned to their homeland.
And he maintains his strange attitude in the conversation about Kim.
"It's so easy to be president, but instead of trying to get 10,000 people from outside into this small arena, we have about 200 people standing right here", Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
An earthquake and tsunami devastate the islands of Indonesia, killing hundreds
For example, after the earthquake in Lombok, foreign NGOs were said to be unnecessary.
Despite the evacuation of more than 10% of the population of Lombok, the status of national disaster was not declared, which was a prerequisite for the activation of international support.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it very clear that they do not need international support, which has caused some complications", Ms. Sumbuung said.
At the same time, Save the Children was assembling a team to go to the Palace, but she was not sure that foreign staff could help.
The representative of the National Emergency Agency, Mr. Sutopo, said that the officials assessed the need for international assistance in the situation in Palu, Indonesia.
They were unprepared for the natural disasters, considering that Indonesia regularly experiences earthquakes.
Although tsunami refuges have been built in Acheha, they are not common on the other coastlines.
The lack of warning sirens in Palu, despite warnings of a tsunami, can be the cause of many deaths.
Traveling through the many islands of Indonesia was a challenge even in good times.
The logistics of natural disasters are further complicated.
The hospital ship, sent to Lombaca to treat earthquake victims, was headed for Palo, but it took at least three days to reach the new site.
President Joko Widodo made improving Indonesia's damaged infrastructure a key element of his election campaign, and allocated the money for road and railway works.
However, the lack of funding weakened the administration of Mr. Joco, as the next year's election was imminent.
Mr. Joco also opposed the increasing pressure in Indonesia to convert most Muslims to a conservative form of religion.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were forced to flee their homes when Muslim and Christian gangs fought on the streets using machetes, bows and arrows and other brutal weapons.

Danielle Starridge saved Liverpool from relegation by scoring a goal in the 89th minute of the match at Stamford Bridge in London on Saturday.
When his team was 1-0 down, about 30 yards from Chelsea's gates, Starridge received a pass from Herdan Shakiri.
He played the ball to his blind side, then hit the farthest away pole.
The ball is flown up into the top corner of the goal.
The ball then bounces back through the Kepu Arrizabálag and hits the goal.
"I was trying to get into that position and score a goal with the ball, and players like Shaq always put their best foot forward, so I tried to give myself more time", Starridge told Liverpool.
I saw Kant approaching and I said that he had hit without thinking much in one stroke.
After a goal from Belgian star Edén Azar in the 25th minute, Chelsea led the game with a score of 1:0.
The Sky forward gave a pass to the back of Mateo Kowačič, while the backs turned in the middle of the field and ran towards Liverpool.
Kowacich made a fast pass to the center of the field.
He then made a nice pass and knocked Hazard off the bench.
Hazard came up ahead of the guards and scored a goal through "Liverpool" player Alison Becker with a blind leg on the far shantytown.
Liverpool will play in the group stage of the Champions League against Napoli on Wednesday at 3pm at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play against VideoTon in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3pm in London.
The number of people killed in the tsunami in Indonesia has reached 832
The death toll from the tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia has risen to 832, the Emergency Situations Agency reported Sunday morning.
A magnitude 7.5 earthquake on Friday caused various structures to collapse, the tremor also caused waves up to 20 feet high, and many people were trapped under the debris of buildings, a representative of the Suoto Purvo Nukrho Agency told a press conference.
The city of Palou, with a population of over 380,000, is a pile of ruins.
Police officers arrested a 32-year-old man, who is accused of killing a woman.
Investigations began this morning after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old man was found stabbed at 7:55 a.m. in the Grayson-Muse building on John Street with a 32-year-old man, the 32-year-old suspect was arrested immediately.
Police officers searched the area for anyone who had seen or heard anything.
Detective-Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is still in its early stages, but I would like to ask all those in Birkenhead near John Street to contact us if you see or hear anything suspicious.
I also ask others, especially taxi drivers, to contact us, as their video recorders may contain video that is important to our investigation.
The woman whose body was found lived in Birkenhond, and a police spokesman confirmed that she had been found inside the house.
Friends who thought they knew the woman arrived at the scene this afternoon to ask where she was found.
The investigation is ongoing as police are still in the process of notifying the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver from Grayson-Muz tried to enter his home, but police officers refused to let anyone in or out.
When he learned of the incident, he wrote a verbal letter.
Residents of the building were told that they would be able to return to their homes after a few hours.
It was also heard that a police officer informed a man that the entire area was now considered a crime scene.
A crying woman appeared at the scene of the crime.
He repeats Kot fly-
At 2 o'clock in the afternoon, 2 police vans were inside the enclosure and another one was outside.

The statue of the Cromwellian Parliament has become the latest memorial hit to the attempt to rewrite history.
The destruction of the statue would have been viewed by his Puritan followers as poetic justice, as he had destroyed most of the cultural and religious monuments of colourful England.
However, the Cromwell Society called Mr. Krick's proposal "a travesty" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "In the current debate over the destruction of statues, it is of course no surprise that the figure of Oliver Cromwell, who was not in Westminster, has been turned into a statue.
During the English Civil War, there was no order to destroy the icons, nor was it done by Cromwell.
Perhaps Cromwell was to be sacrificed for the mistakes of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
A fine drawing of Cromwell by Sir William H. Thornycroft reflects 19th-century thought, and is part of a historical personality image that is still celebrated by many.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph that "Cromwell's persona was seen by many, more so in the late 19th century than today, as a protector of the parliamentary pressures, in his case the monarchy.
Whether this is an accurate prediction is a matter of ongoing historical debate.
The conflict of the mid-17th century undoubtedly marked the further development of our nation, and the figure of Cromwell illustrates one aspect of this passage.
His achievements as lord-protector are also worthy of praise and immortality.
Farmer killed by pig in China
According to local media reports, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a southwest market in China.
A man identified only by his surname " Yuan" was found dead on Sunday morning with a ruptured artery in his shirt, near a pig farm in the market town of Luopanshū, Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported.
A pig farmer in Xinjin, Qinghai Province, China, prepared to vaccinate pigs in his barns on May 30, 2005.
He arrived at the market on Wednesday with his twin brother from the neighboring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs.
The next morning, his brother found him dead, with the door to the adjacent pigsty open.
According to her, inside the palace stood a large male pig with a mouth stained with blood.
The report said that the forensic examination confirmed that the 550-pound pig killed the farmer.
My cousin's legs were bruised and bloodied,   told Guiyang Evening News by his brother U, who was named after him.
The surveillance camera footage shows that Yuan entered the market at 4.40 am on Thursday to feed the pigs.
About an hour later, his body was found.
The creature that killed the male was not that of either Yu'an or his cousin.
The market manager told the evening news that the pig was locked up so that it would not attack anyone else while the police gathered evidence at the scene.
It is reported that Yuan's family is in talks with the market authorities about compensation for the death.
Although rare, there have been cases of pigs attacking humans in the past.
In 2016, a woman and her husband were attacked by a pig on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the husband with serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 650-pound pig had pushed a Welsh farmer onto a tractor, frightening the animal's wife.
In 2012, after an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs, a farmer from Manitoba reported for CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but the taste of blood has a negative effect on them.
They just play.
They are curious... they don't mean to hurt.
He added that they should be given due respect.
Remains of Hurricane Rosa bring heavy rain to southwestern U.S.
As forecasts predict, the cold waters off the coast of the Gulf of Mexico will weaken the hurricane Roza.
However, the impending flood of the northern Mexico and southwestern United States is expected soon.
On Sunday, at 5 a.m. local time, Rosa had winds of 85 mph, and a Category 1 hurricane was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
On Sunday, it is expected that Rosa will travel north.
At the same time, an air hole formed over the Pacific Ocean that was moving eastward toward the west coast of the United States, and on Monday, the tropical storm began pushing deep tropical moisture northward into the southwestern United States, reaching the peninsula of Rosa Alta California.
Monday saw up to 10 inches of rain in some parts of Mexico.
Later, tropical moisture, in contact with the approaching frost, will produce heavy rainfall, which is widespread in the southwest during these days.
In places, rainfall ranging from 1 to 4 may lead to sudden dangerous flooding, mudflows, and possibly landslides in the desert.
Strong tropical moisture will cause precipitation to reach 2-3 inches per hour in some places, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
Parts of the Southwest, especially most of Arizona, are expected to receive between 2 and 4 inches of precipitation.
As tropical rains are rare, conditions can worsen and sudden floods can occur.
Walking in the desert during tropical rains is pointless.
Heavy rain can cause rivers to flow through canyons, and in places with thunderstorms, sudden winds and dust can cause flooding.
The approaching air hole will bring heavy local rain to the Southern California coast.
Rainfall may be about half an inch in total, which will cause very little litter and roadway slipperiness.
During the rainy season, this will be the first rain in the region.
A few tropical showers will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, and rainfall will increase late Monday and early Tuesday.
Heavy rains will spread in four directions on Tuesday and will continue until Tuesday.
October saw a sudden change in temperature across the entire United States, as the Arctic began to cool off, while the tropics still remained warm.
Temperatures can change abruptly over time and over small distances.
A great example of this change in temperature was the Sunday in the middle part of the United States.
Temperature differences between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, as well as St. Louis and De Moyne, Iowa, can reach as much as 20 degrees.
The next few days will be another long summer of warm weather.
Most of the central and eastern portions of the United States will likely see a warm October that is as widespread as the 80s, from the southern plains to some northeastern portions.
Tuesdays in New York City can be as high as 80 degrees, which is 10 degrees above average.
Our long-range forecast suggests that the eastern U.S. will likely experience above-average temperatures in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched the Brett Kavanaugh hearings
The case between Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual assault, Christine Blaysi-Ford, in the 1980s, was watched by more than 20 million viewers on 6 television channels on Thursday.
The Friday regular was interrupted at the last moment to show the continuing political opposition: Arizona Senator Jeff Flake had signed a contract to conduct a week-long FBI investigation.
At a school disco, while she was drunk, Kavano had beaten her and tried to take off her clothes, and Ford testified before a Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 percent sober.
In his emotional response, Kavanaugh said that he was 100 percent sure that such a thing never happened.
Nielsen reported that more than 20.4 million people could have seen the report on Friday.
The company has defined the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers of the channels that also showed it, like PBS, C-SPAN, the Fox Business Network and others, were not known at first.
And the number of viewers in the offices was difficult for Nielsen to determine.
In perspective, the size of the audience is roughly equal to the number of people watching a football playoff match or the awarding of an Oscar.
Nielsen said that Fox News Channel, whose hosts have reportedly supported Kavanaugh's nomination, had about 5.69 million viewers during the day of the hearings.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
After the hearings, the interest continued.
Flayck became the central figure of the Friday drama.
After the Republican team announced that they would vote for Kavanaugh, he was caught on camera by CNN and CBS on Friday morning as he attempted to take the elevator to the Judiciary Committee, where the hearings were taking place, while protesters were shouting.
He stared at the floor for a few minutes before being interrupted on live television by CNN.
"I'm standing right in front of you", says a woman.
Do you think he is telling the truth to the country?
"When you have strength, so many women tell you that you are weak".
Before the elevator could be closed, Flake received a reply from his office, which said that he would have more to say before the next committee hearings.
Within hours, cable television and radio networks were live when the Judiciary Committee had to vote in the full Senate to decide on Kavanaugh's candidacy.
But Flake said the vote would be possible only after the FBI examines the allegations against the candidate in the next week, a move supported by the Democratic Party, which is in the minority.
Flake was persuaded by a conversation with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Koons.
After consulting with Kunz and a few other senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake's vote was important because the Republican Party could not elect him without conducting an investigation into the Kavanaugh case.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the accuser of Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accuses critics of playing politics with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of playing a "political game" that undermines Britain's future and the nation's development, the Sunday Times newspaper said in an interview.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK, on 29 September 2018.
In a second front-page interview, former foreign secretary Boris Johnson criticised his "checkered" Brexit plan, saying that the proposal to create a common customs territory between Britain and the EU was "totally ridiculous".
Wade Sims shot: Police arrested Dayton Simpson for the death of LSU player
Police arrested a man accused of shooting Wade Simms, a 20-year-old player on the LSU basketball team.
The Baton Rouge police chief reported that 20-year-old Dayton Simpson had been arrested and was being held on a second-degree felony charge.
Officials posted a video of Simms and Simpson fighting, and police officials said that Sims lost his sight there.
Police recovered a photo from the crime scene, and found Simpson's DNA, CBS affiliate WAFB reported.
Simpson was questioned by police, who said he confessed to shooting Wade.
According to his lawyer, his bail was set at $350,000.
An officer of the East Baton Rouge County Coroner on Friday published a preliminary report on the results, stating that the cause of death was a bullet wound to the head and neck.
The department thanks the Louisiana State Police's Fugitive Search Task Force, the state police's Criminal Laboratory, Southern University police officers, and local residents who helped to find the perpetrators.
The sports director of LSU, Joe Alleva, thanked local law enforcement for their "efforts and commitment to justice".
Sims was only 20 years old.
The 6 foot 6 inch forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at LSU.
Last season, he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade announced that the team was in mourning over his death.
"It's always sad to see things like this happen", says Wade.
Volcanic ash washes down on Mexico City
The ash from the volcano Pocopatepetl reaches the southern districts of Mexico City.
After the crater became more active, with 183 gas and ash explosions recorded in 24 hours, the National Center for Disaster Management warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano on Saturday.
The center detects a large number of sounds and vibrations.
Photos on social media show a thin layer of dust on the windows of cars in the neighborhood of Hochimilco near Mexico City.
After a magnitude 7.1 quake struck central Mexico in September 2017, geophysicists noted an increase in volcanic activity about 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital.
The volcano, named Don Goy, has been active since 1994.
As the independence vote year approaches, police officers clash with Catalan separatists
On Saturday, after a clash with a radical group protesting for independence, six people were arrested in Barcelona, and thousands joined a demonstration to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's secession.
The group, which held radical views, attacked the OMON with eggs and powder paints, which in turn raised clouds of black dust in the crowded streets.
Later that day, after police officers used batons to restrain the crowd, various clashes broke out.
For several hours, the pro-independence group chanted "We do not forget, we do not forgive", while the anti-independence group shouted "Long live Spain!"
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries sustained during the protests, according to local press.
The tension in the region, which aims to achieve independence, remains high, especially after Madrid declared the referendum on October 1 illegal, a year after the Catalan separatists celebrated it.
Although the number of voters who wanted to be independent was small, those who wanted to leave Spain mostly boycotted the election.
According to the Catalan government, more than 1,000 people were injured during the elections last year, which were caused by violent clashes at the polling stations when the police tried to stop the elections.
The pro-independence group camped out until Friday night, with the intention of preventing a demonstration by supporters of the national police.
The demonstration continued, but was forced to go another way.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who was with his wife at the separatist protest, said he no longer believed Catalonia could be independent.
Last year we had one of our best moments.
My parents were crying for joy at their choice, and now we are delayed", she said.
Despite losing a small regional election last December, Catalan parties that had campaigned for independence have tried to continue their work this year, with their most prominent leaders either going into voluntary exile or in prison awaiting a court decision to declare independence by holding a referendum.
The 42-year-old mechanic, Joan Puig, who recorded the protest on his cell phone, said that the conflict was started by politicians from both sides.
The debate started to get more intense, he said.
On Saturday, one of the nine Catalan leaders, Oriole Junqueras, who has been in prison since the end of last year, announced his candidacy for the European Parliament elections for a second year.
The fact that the candidate is a member of the European elections will not allow the regression of democratic values and repression that we have just seen from the Spanish government to continue.
Londonderry: men arrested after being hit by car
In the city of Londderry, men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after being hit by a car while driving home.
The incident occurred on Thursday at around 19:30 GMT in Ballinagarda-Kresent.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemming said that the gate and the building itself had been damaged.
The car was also shot at some point from an arbalest.
A goal from Menga helped Livingston beat Rangers 1-0
Dolly Menga's first goal for the Livingstones secured the team's victory.
The "Rangers" were surprised to see that the "Livingstons" "Ibrox" sent their manager Steven Gerrard to the second round of the 18 match.
When Gary Holton's side was level with Hibernia for the second time, Dolly Menga's strike came out differently.
The team of Gerrard will be eliminated and will meet the leading team of Harts on the next Sunday of this season of the Premier League, which is eight points behind.
The previous day, the Rangers hosted the Vienna Rapids in the Europa League.
At the time, Livingston had extended his unbeaten streak to sixth in his division, with head coach Holte still feeling the pinch after replacing Kenny Mayler last month.
Livingston missed chances against the visitors.
Holt's team was perceived to be ahead even before the scoring started, with a cleverness that posed a variety of difficulties for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson was able to get past, but his persistence was over by the gate, and Alan Litgow tried his luck, but the ball failed to meet Craig Helkett's head.
The owners allowed the Rangers to play in front of them, knowing that they could disturb the guests during the pitch.
This was accomplished.
With a pass from the Rangers' penalty, Livingston opened the scoring, and Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined forces against the penalty-kicking Menga.
By this time the Rangers were in the lead, but decided that they could not break through the owners' defence, with goalkeeper Liam Kelly being calm to a high degree.
This continued into the second half, though Alfredo Morelos was able to protect Kelly.
Scott Pittman was caught in the foot of Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and the ball went from the second-placed Livingston.
The attack continued on the Livingston goal, but was unsuccessful, while the two penalty requests for the touchdowns were rejected after Helket was called to the midfield by Glenn Middleton.
The phenomenal result of the Livingston
You were with Alasdair Lamont at the Tony Makaroni Arena, BBC Scotland.
It was a phenomenal effort and result for Livingston.
These guys played very well, just exceeding expectations in the upper trajectory.
Their style of play and staff have hardly changed since their arrival at the top level, but they must be grateful to Holte, who has lifted the team's spirits.
He has so many heroes.
While Captain Helkett led a well-organized defense, Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrell on the edge.
However, the Rangers were not inspired.
No matter how well they played in Gerard's day, they were just short of these standards.
Their last ball, the only one in which the owners are on the field, should be the sign for Reinjers" who fell in the middle of the table.
Erdogan received a double welcome in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29), the leaders of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin under a blue sky and smiled.
Today is President Erdogan's last day in Germany, a meeting aimed at rebuilding relations with NATO ally Germany.
They had come to debate human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the European Union.
Later, Erdoğan traveled to the city of Köln to open a large new mosque.
For the large Turkish population living outside Turkey, it is a second home.
The police, citing security reasons, surrounded the crowd of 25000 people gathered in front of the mosque, but many were able to get closer and see their Pride leaders.
Hundreds of protesters, many of them Kurdish, have criticized Erdogan's political work and the German government's decision to recall him.
A two-sided split emerged: some German Turks greeted Erdogan as a hero, while others treated him as a dictator.
Dettford road accident: cyclist killed after being hit by car
A cyclist in London was killed after being hit by a car.
The accident occurred at 10:15 a.m. local time, southeast of the city, at the intersection of Beestwood and Evelyn Streets, the busiest roads in Dettford.
The driver of the car behind the wheel stopped, and medical personnel arrived, but the young man died on the spot.
Saturday's accident occurred about a mile away, several months after another cyclist was killed in a collision on Childers Street.
The city police are working on identifying the man, and said that relatives will be notified.
Nowadays, it is recommended that motorists avoid this area, as the roads are blocked and the buses are crowded.
Long-Lartin prison: six officers wounded in clash
In the men's prison, six staff members were injured in the clash, the prison administration reported.
Riots broke out in Long Lartain, Worcestershire, at 09:30 on Sunday, and have continued into the day.
To put an end to the disturbances, which involved eight prisoners on one side, special Tornado officers had to be called in.
Officers received minor facial injuries at the scene.
A prison spokesman said: "Special trained prison officers were sent to the scene to stop the ongoing clash in Long-Lartain.
Six workers were injured.
We don't want to tolerate these kinds of clashes in our prisons, we hand off the culprits to the police, and of course they can spend more time behind bars.
The prison at Long Larkin houses over 500 inmates, some of whom are the country's most notorious criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison's chief had been rushed to hospital after an inmate attacked him.
In October of last year, inmates attacked the prison with billiard balls during a serious riot, and OMO officials were called to the prison to solve the case.
Hurricane Rosa threatens to bring flash flooding to areas of Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City (which could benefit from drought-prone areas).
Tropical rainfall is rare in Arizona, but it is likely to occur next week, with the remaining energy from Hurricane Rosa moving southwest across the desert, potentially causing flash flooding.
National weather service officials issued flash flood watches for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, as well as Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected to arrive with rain on Monday evening and cross Phoenix twice on Tuesday.
Phoenix National Meteorological Service notes in their report that since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones within 200 miles of Phoenix have been given the status of tropical storm or disaster.
Hurricane Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that struck 40 miles from the Asian border.
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center expect rainfall of 2 to 4 inches, with isolated Mogollon, Arizona, receiving up to 6 inches.
The area around the rocky mountains and large basins will likely have a 1-2 inches drop, eventually reaching 4 inches with the isolated areas.
In areas that are not affected by flash floods, the Rosas may be a blessing, as the region is in drought.
Although flooding is a serious problem, some rainfall is likely to be beneficial, as drought is currently observed in the southwest.
According to US monitoring data, at least 40% of Arizona is experiencing extreme drought, a category two magnitude, reports weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa traveled along the coast of the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday morning, still a hurricane, Rosa had maximum sustained winds of 85 mph, was located 385 miles south of Punt-Euhenia, Mexico, and was moving north at 12 mph.
The storm will lose its strength upon encountering cooler waters of the Pacific Ocean.
Thus, it is expected to make landfall on the Mexican coast in the afternoon or on Monday evening, with the strength of a tropical storm.
The storm is expected to cause heavy rainfall in some parts of Mexico, which could lead to flooding.
From the northwest of California to the northwest of Sonora, 3-6 inches of rain may fall, weather.com reported.
Rosa will move northward through Mexico as a tropical storm, becoming a tropical depression before reaching the Arizona border on Tuesday morning, and heading south from Arizona to Utah on Tuesday evening.
The main hazard from the storm is heavy rainfall in the deserts of Lower California, northwestern Sonora, and the southwestern United States, the National Hurricane Center reports.
These rains are expected to cause flash floods, debris flows in deserts, landslides in mountainous areas, and other hazards to safety.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four people arrested for attempted murder
After a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in Somerset, three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder.
The teenager, who was found wounded, was found around 04:00 CST on Saturday in the Ecclesiastical District of Terras near Midsomer Norton.
He was taken to the hospital, where he is now stable.
Police in both the towns of Somerset and Avon said a 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old were arrested in the Reddstock area overnight.
Police officers asked anyone who had a cell phone recording to tell them what was happening.
Trump says Kavanaugh is suffering at the hands of the Democratic Party
"We need to reject the ruthless and vile tactics of the Democratic Party, so vote for Judge Kavanaugh", Trump said in a speech in West Virginia's Wheeling County.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has been suffering from the Democratic Party's "viciousness" since he announced his candidacy for the election.
Kavanaugh on Thursday testified before Congress, strongly and emotionally denouncing allegations that Christine Blasey Ford had raped her when they were young, a decade or so ago.
During the hearing, Ford also gave his own statement.
On Saturday, the President said that "the American people saw the extraordinary qualities and courage of Kavanaugh that day".
"Voting for Judge Kavanaugh, the most brilliant legal mind of our era, was a vote of confidence in the candidacy of a lawyer who had rendered an ideal service to the state", he told the supporters of West Virginia.
The president, while saying that it is important for members of the republican party to come to the elections, also mentioned the candidacy of Kavano.
 You have 5 weeks left before one of the most important decisions of your life.
I'm not in this game, I'm just telling you, he says.
That's why I fight for good candidates everywhere.
Trump added that Democrats are on a mission to stand up and take action.
The first important vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's candidacy, as we know, should be no later than Friday, a senior aide to the Republican Party leader told CNN.
Hundreds of people die in earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, death toll rises
Authorities said at least 384 people were killed Saturday after an earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, with many more swept away by the waves.
Hundreds of people gathered on the beach of the city of Palu for the holiday, while waves up to six meters (18 feet) high swept the coast in the dark of night, destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami was triggered by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
When the tsunami threat hit yesterday, people were still on the beach helping with their own affairs and died when they failed to flee the area immediately,  said SuTopo PURVO Nugroho, a spokesman for an Indonesian agency assisting with the aftermath of the disaster, told a briefing in Jakarta.
 The tsunami did not come alone, it was followed by cars, trees, and houses,   said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had first come in open sea at 800 km/h (497 mph) before hitting the coast.
Some people escaped the tsunami by climbing trees, and that was the only way they survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in the city of Palou.
Air photos of the Emergency Management Agency show most of the destroyed buildings, commercial buildings, bridges and mosques surrounded by water.
The earthquake also devastated the coastal city on Saturday.
The quake was felt in the area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Assessment and Technology Application Agency (BPPT) said Friday that the energy output of the earthquake was about 200 times the yield of the bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The city was reported to have been able to increase the tsunami's intensity due to its location in a long, narrow bay.
The nucroho classified the damage as "severe", and reported that hundreds of homes, hospitals, commercial buildings, and hotels had been destroyed.
Some victims were found under the debris of buildings that had been swept away, 540 people had various injuries, and 29 were missing, he added.
According to Nugraho, the damage could be greater around 300 km (190 miles) north of Palun, in the area called Donggala, close to the epicenter of the earthquake.
According to Nugroho, communication with the city of Dongola was completely lost.
It is home to more than 300,000 people, the Red Cross reports, adding that their volunteers and workers have also travelled to the affected areas.
"It's still a tragedy, but things could get worse", he said.
On Saturday, the agency received widespread criticism for failing to notify the tsunami warning to the island, but officials responded that the warning came with a wave announcement.
In a video posted on social media by eyewitnesses, a man can be heard shouting from an upper floor about the danger of a tsunami approaching people on the street below.
Within minutes, a wall of water washed ashore, sweeping away buildings and cars.
The Reuters news agency was unable to confirm the authenticity of the leaked material.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a power outage that disrupted communications around Palou and caused difficulties for the authorities in coordinating relief efforts.
Authorities announced that they had begun sending military cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuees still needed food and other necessities.
The city's airport, which had been opened only for emergency assistance, was closed again until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
More than 800 people died in Indonesia ' s tsunami
This is very bad.
From the Dongala, World Vision staff reported that they had passed by the paintings of the void before they safely reached the breeze shelters located inside their office gate in Palu.
"They told me that they saw many houses destroyed", he said.
This is very bad.
Even after the relief efforts that the relief groups had initiated during the disaster, some were concerned that foreign workers with extensive experience were not allowed to enter the territory of Palu.
Indonesian regulations state that foreign financial, food, and personnel assistance can only be received if the disaster is declared a national disaster.
No such announcement has been made yet.
Autely speaking only at the provincial level  spoken by the representative of the Indonesian Red Cross, Arriana.
As soon as the government declares the disaster as national, we can apply for international help, which is not yet a status.
It was the second night after the earthquake and tsunami, and friends and relatives of those who had gone missing believed that their loved ones would be found miraculously during the disaster.
On Saturday, the little boy was removed from the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman buried under the rubble, who had been crushed alongside her dead mother for two days.
Genon Subandino, the coach of the Indonesian national para-planing team, has trained the two missing para-planers for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others who were caught in the hotel Роа-Роа, as well as the lord of the Mandaghi, were his pupils.
"As the oldest of the para-planetary types, I have my own emotional burden", he said.
Mr. Gendon said that after the destruction of the Roa-Roa hotel became known among the paraplanetist community, he sent a few hours of text messages via WhatsApp to the participants of the beach festival competition in Palua.
However, his SMSs were marked with only one grey letter, not two blue ones.
I think the SMS says they didn't get it.
Thieves robbed $26,750 from an ATM at the NeNewport Recreation Complex in Damba
On Friday morning, the thieves stole $26,750 from a Brinck worker who was filling up a Newport ATM in Dumba, Newport Police reported.
The employee had taken money from the ATM at the entertainment complex and was about to take it to the next location, detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a press release.
But before he could do so, a man ran up behind the bank employee and stole the bag, which was meant to be carried, along with the money.
Witnesses saw several suspicious people fleeing the scene, but the police did not record the exact number of criminals associated with this situation.
Anyone with information about the criminals is urged to contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
He announced this on Twitter on Saturday, writing: "The creature known as Kanye West.
The 41-year-old rapper has been known for some time under the nickname of Ye, and his eighth album, released in June, is also named Ye.
The changes are due to Kanye's appearance on Saturday Night Live, which is also when his new album, Yandhi, is expected to be released.
The show's director said that she would replace singer Ariana Grande, who had resigned for "emotional reasons".
Although this is an abbreviation of his current professional name, the word also has religious significance for West.
The title of the album was suggested by West in a conversation with his radio host Big Boy earlier in the year, who said that "I think Ye is the most common word in the Bible, 
So I am you, I am we, this is us.
He moved from the name Kanye, meaning "one of one", to the name that embraces our goodness, our confusion, everything - that simple Ye, that is, "your".
Who we are is reflected in the album.
He is one of the most famous rappers who changed his name.
Sean Combs has been known variously as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
Western collaborationist JAY-Z also spells his name with various dashes or dashes, or with capital letters.
Mexican leader vows not to use military force against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andrés Manuel López Obrador has promised not to use military force against civilians, as the 50th anniversary of the bloody torture of the students approaches.
On Saturday, Lopez Obrador, in the Triple-Culture Plaza (Tlatelolco Plaza), vowed never to use military force against the Mexican people to suppress them.
On October 2, 1968, during a peaceful demonstration on the square, military forces opened fire on the students, killing about 300, a typical student movement in Latin America at the time.
López Obrador promised to help young Mexicans, to give monthly subsidies to students, to open more public universities with free tuition.
He said that youths were drawn into criminal organizations because of unemployment and lack of opportunities to study.
The US will double its funding for artificial intelligence
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double its funding for research in this area, said Kai-Fu Li, an investor and expert on artificial intelligence at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Such comments have been made after the U.S. government reported on AI in some parts, despite the fact that the U.S. has no formal AI development strategy.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan for the second year: it aims to be the number 1 in innovation by 2030.
Given that other countries are far behind the US, it would be good to double the research budget for AI, and we are looking for further breakthroughs in AI, Li said.
The doubling of financial support will also increase the chances of the next big discovery on nuclear energy being made in the US, Li said in an interview for CNBC.
His own book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order was published this month by Hawton Mifflin Harcourt, and Li is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, a company that invests in China's most prominent AI company Face+++.
In the 1980s, he worked on AI systems at Carnegie Mellon University, which set the highest records in the American game of Otello, and later became the executive director of Microsoft Research and president of the Google subsidiary in China.
Li knew of previous US technological competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next competition would be held to help find the next genius.
U.S. researchers have to work hard to find government grants, Li said.
 Academic leaders are not picked by China but by corporations, says Li.
Recently, Facebook, Google, and other tech companies have been hiring the brightest minds from universities to work on AI.
Changes in immigration policy will also help the US to strengthen its position in the field of AI, Li said.
"I think green cards should be presented automatically to doctors of science in the field of AI", he said.
In July 2017, the Chinese government presented its second-generation development plan for AI.
The National Science Foundation and other government organizations have distributed funds to American researchers, while the National Natural Science Foundation of China provides financial support to people in academic institutions, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Li said.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense announced the creation of a joint artificial intelligence center, which includes partners from industry and science, and the formation of a special committee on artificial intelligence at the White House.
And this month, DARPA announced that it has invested $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it currently invests over 100 million in AI research.
He has not shown any work for several months since he wanted to form his commission.
Macedonians voted in a referendum to decide whether to change the name of their country
Macedonians voted in a referendum on Sunday to decide whether to change the name of their country to "Republic of North Macedonia", a change that would help resolve a decade-long dispute with Greece, which has blocked Macedonia's entry into the European Union and NATO.
Greece believes that its northern neighbours can claim their lands because of the name of the province, Macedonia, and opposes their accession to the EU and NATO.
In June, the two governments reached an agreement based on a new name proposal, but nationalist opposition argued that the change would have a devastating effect on the ethnic identity of the Macedonian people, who are predominantly Slavic.
President George Ivanov, after announcing that he would not vote in the referendum, expressed his doubts that the boycott campaign could achieve 50 percent turnout for the referendum to become a reality.
The question asked in the bulletin was: "Do you agree to accept the agreement with Greece and join NATO and the EU?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that the name change is simply the price for joining the EU and NATO, and that it is the price that Macedonia, which emerged from the breakup of Yugoslavia, would pay.
"I came here today to vote for the future of my country, for the future of Macedonian youth to live freely under the wings of the European Union, because it promises us all a safe life", said 79-year-old Olivera Georgievsky from Skopje.
Although a referendum does not necessarily have legal force, most members of parliament say that it should be decided with the results of the election in mind.
Two-thirds of the votes in parliament are required to change the name.
The government election commission said that until 1 p.m. there were no violations of the rules.
However, turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 66 percent of registered voters and 34 percent of those who cast ballots in the last parliamentary election in 2016.
"I came to vote for my children, because our place is in Europe", said 62-year-old Joze Taневsky from Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Duško vote in a referendum to change the name of Macedonia to allow it to join NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
Vladimir Kavardarkov, aged 54, was preparing a small stage in front of the parliament building, with benches for the organisers of the referendum boycott.
"We are on the side of NATO and the EU, but we want to be on the same level, with our heads held high", said Kavadarkov.
Although our country is poor, we have a conscience.
If they don't want to see us as Macedonia, we can be part of the Eurasian integration by appealing to other countries, such as China and Russia.
According to Prime Minister Zaev, NATO membership would bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has a 20 percent unemployment rate.
"I believe that most of them will agree, because 80 percent of our population supports joining the EU and NATO", Zaev said after the vote.
He said that the result would confirm our bright future.
The Macedonian Institute for Policy Studies conducted a poll on Monday, showing that 30-43% of voters voted for the referendum, which is less than the required number.
A poll conducted by Macedonian television channel Telma TV revealed that 57 percent of voters were planning to go to the polls on Sunday.
70% of them said they would vote for ei.
For a successful referendum, the turnout must be 50 percent and plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would have been the first serious test for the Western-oriented government since it came to power in May of last year.
See also: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero runs through all of Brighton's defence to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling were sent to the Brighton reserve after Manchester City's 2-0 win over England on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
In the 65th minute, Agüero made his manoeuvres very easy.
The Argentine forward made a pass in the middle of the field at the start of the series.
He ran past three of Brighton's guards before escaping into the open.
Then four green garments surrounded Agüero.
He passed one guard and several others at the edge of Brighton's bench.
He then found Sterling and gave him a pass to the left.
The English forward took advantage of the penalty for a touchdown and returned the ball to Aguero, who had already used his right boot to play the Brighton defender, and hit the right side of the net to score a goal for Matthew Ryan.
According to Manchester City football club coach Pep Guardiola, the Aguero footballer is currently suffering from foot pain.
We had agreed that he would be out for 55 or 60 minutes.
And that is exactly what happened.
The footballer scored a goal and gave us a great joy.
However, it was the Sunderland player in particular who led the way for the Sky Blues in the Premier League clash.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball at the bottom of the Brighton team's territory.
And LeRoy made a very good pass from the side flank behind the footballer of the Sane.
Before taking Sterling to the farther shed, Sané had worked out a few tricks.
The forward of the Sky Blues team delivered the ball into the goal of the opposing team just before leaving the football field.
The next Champions League group game will be played on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Zinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play against the Rockies
After being eliminated from the playoffs by the Washington Nationals, the team of a new composition was no longer needed.
But the ever-competitive Scherzer hopes to beat the Colorado Rockies next Sunday; however, he has one condition: the Rockies must still have a chance to reach the playoffs, currently one game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in New Zealand's Western Division.
In any case, the Rockies won the title last Friday, defeating the Nationals 5-2, but still wanted to consolidate their victory in the first division.
"Even though we played for nothing, I'm going to have to go through the atmosphere of Denver with the football fans and other teams and maybe experience the highest level of play this year.
Is there any reason I should not participate?
Although the Nationals had announced the team's roster for Sunday, it was reported that Scherzer was allowed to play on that basis.
Scherzer, who will be the 34th in the new lineup, will leave the bench for the reserves game on Thursday and will take the field as usual on Sunday.
This season, the Washington team has an 18-7 throwing record, a 2.53-point passing rate, and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings.
Anti-Trump rally in West Virginia
Speaking about the importance of the Republican Party's participation in the upcoming elections, the President also omitted to mention the Supreme Court's newly elected judge, Brett Kavanaugh.
Everything that has been done in our name may be put at risk in November.
We are now just five weeks away from one of the most important choices we will ever make.
This is a very important event - I am not voted, but I have to try not to give - so I actively fight for worthy candidates.
And Trump continues: "You can see for yourself how evil the Radical Party Democrats are.
They are determined to use any means to regain power - to the point of making a fuss or even to the point of being in a panic.
They don't think about harming people at all - they don't care - they think about power and control, but we're not going to give them that.
According to the president, the Democrats are "performing a mission of tactical deterrence and obstruction".
"You've been doing this for the last four days", Trump said, calling Democrats "bad, dangerous, unfriendly, and untrustworthy".
With these words, he addressed the Senate Committee on Judicial Issues, naming Democrat-Senator Дайэнн Файнстайн, which led to a public outcry.
Do you remember what he said?
Did you pull out the document?
What is it?
No, no, I was just waiting for something - a very rude hand gesture - the worst I've ever seen.
The Labour Party refused to accept any more.
Those who like to speak their minds are not tolerated there
I was not surprised to see activists from my current political organization turn against me.
Finally, among those who were not happy to speak their minds, I was the last Labour Party member of Parliament.
For her firm stand against anti-Semitism, my colleague Joan Ryan was treated just as cruelly.
In my case, the no-confidence motion criticized my disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
As fate would have it, Jeremy had similar disagreements with previous party leaders about the importance of economic policy in Europe and national security.
"We want our meetings to be open and effective for everyone", said the Labour Party of East Nottingham in a statement announcing their meeting on Friday.
As a Labour Party Member of Parliament for almost 8 years, this is exactly what the Friday morning General Conference has become.
Unfortunately, nowadays the meetings are not held in such a warm atmosphere, and the politics of hope has long been forgotten, even if it is difficult to remember.
It is becoming increasingly evident that the Labour Party does not allow for differences of opinion, and that the views of each individual are only considered when it is convenient for the party.
This started when Jeremy was the leader of the party, because those who worked with me (before, I think, we shared the same political views) expected some drastic changes from me, some of which I did not agree with at all - it was, at least, national security or the single market of the European Union.
Every time I speak in public - it doesn't matter what I say - then on social media, there are insults about me, about the way I go about elections, about discussing politics, about not even being a member of the Labour Party.
Again, this is not just my experience.
Some of my colleagues, however, were not as successful in this regard, because many of the comments made to me were political, so I know my talent.
I am proud of my hardworking and courageous fellow workers who endure every day of humiliation.
One of the most frustrating aspects of this political measure is the normalization of such extremely brutal behavior.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn spoke of the need to develop a culture of tolerance within the Labour Party.
In fact, our party no longer opens its doors wide to everyone - every time it expresses disapproval or talks about changing the way it votes, the party shrinks.
For the last two years, I have often received advice from many people that if you keep your mouth shut, no one will touch you.
But I didn't come to politics for him.
I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a schoolboy, prompted by Thatcher's derogatory government - which had virtually destroyed my class in the general education school I attended; I tried to provide and maintain better public services for all sorts of people - whether they were ordinary local people's councillors or government ministers.
I never hid my past politics.
No one in East Nottingham has yet been implicated in my ongoing political conflicts with the current government.
I have only one word to say to the leader of the Friday gathering - that while the whole country is against Brexit, I am not going to waste my time and my energy and my loyalty on the leader of the Labour Party, who is already aware of the damage that Brexit will do to the whole house, to various organisations and to public workers.
But I want to say my only real word, not to the Momentum organisation in Nottingham, but to my constituents, whether they are Labour or not: it is a great honour to serve you, and I give you my word that it will not hurt me to overturn an election, to emphasise in political irresponsibility, anything, the importance of defending your interests.
Chris Lesley, Member of Parliament for East Nottingham, said
United beat Melrose by 38:17: undefeated team of United tops the standings
The last two attempts may have slightly altered the final result, but it is certain that the Ténant Premier League will be the main triumph for the Er team after today's spectacular match.
They are now at the top of the rankings, the only team among the ten competitors to have never lost.
At the end of the game, they showed remarkable defense and, thanks to that, took control of the football field, so that the coach Peter MURCHI had every right to be pleased.
"We may have to go through some tough games, but we're not giving up, so it's nice to be happy", the coach said.
We're going to repeat the words of Robin Christie, a player from the Melrose team: Congratulations to the United team, who played this game better than we did.
A 14-minute attempt by Grant Anderson to score a goal was continued by Frazier Climot, which led the Eagles to a lead, but gave a yellow card to Rory Hughes of the Scottish Warriors - allowing the Melrozes to draw and Jason Baggot to seal the deal.
First, with a penalty, Klimo led the Eriks to another goal, and just before the break, he scored a goal, and then the score was reduced to 17:5 in favor of the Eriks.
However, Melrose's team started the second half well and Baghott made Patrick Anderson's attempt a reality, winning the game by 5 points.
Then, due to a serious injury to Ruairis Notta, the game was delayed for a while and the player had to be removed from the match; when the game was restarted, Stafford's effort with McDowell and Climo pushed the team further ahead.
Team captain Blair MacPherson was issued a yellow card and another player from Melrose was denied a reception by Bruce Colvin, who was under pressure to finish the game.
The owners of the field returned, but Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card for taking the ball from Klimo on the penalty line, and McPherson was behind the players of Er.
Just as at the beginning of the period, Climo again sent a penalty and after Kyle Rowe caught David Armstrong's ball, he tried to make the fifth hole on the side of the home team by passing the forward Gregor Henry.
Star of the game Hamman ends his career in the restaurant industry
It was revealed that Hamman was considering a move into the hospitality industry after being appointed head of a licensed restaurant company by gaming star Ford Keirnan.
Ford, 56, is known for his long-time collaborator Gregory Hemphill on the BBC channel, playing Jack Jarvis and writing the script.
Together they announced that the ninth installment would be the last, and that Kirnan had planned his fate after Kreiglang.
According to official statements, he was currently the head of the company Адрифтморн Лимитед.
The actor declined to answer questions about it, but a source in the Scottish newspaper the Sun hinted that Kirnan was interested in participating in a flourishing restaurant sale in Glasgow.
The sea is ours: Bolivia hopes to reopen the courthouse to those who have no access to the Pacific
The sailors are currently patrolling the naval headquarters in La Paz.
The blue flag of the sea waves in public buildings.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the military-naval bases even have their own language: "The sea is ours by right".
The main task is to return it.
Bolivia, which had no access to the sea, had a nationwide shortage of ships and a desire to navigate the Pacific, which was passed to the Republic of Chile in the bloody disputes over resources in the 19th century.
The Bolivian International Court of Justice held its five-year-long trial on October 1, the day of the country's biggest public hope in a decade.
"Our country has the drive, the unity and the resilience, so we are waiting for the result with a positive attitude", Bolivian Ambassador Roberto Calsadilla said.
After years of tumultuous negotiations, Chile must settle the issue of independent access to the sea, a decision that will be decided by the International Court in The Hague and watched hopefully by the entire Bolivian population through blue screens.
Evo Morales, a prominent president of Bolivia's indigenous community, is also tied to a controversial re-election next year - a court ruling that was handed down on Monday.
In August, he vowed to "retrieve the Pacific as soon as possible".
But while some analysts believe that the court's verdict will not be in favor of Bolivia, much will not change.
The United Nations, which is based in the Netherlands, has no right to influence the territory of the Republic of Chile, so it cannot be determined in the next round of negotiations.
The expert on international law of the Republic of Chile, Pas Sarate, commented on the situation: "The fact that the decision of the International Court of Justice was issued only six months after the last hearings shows that this action was not very difficult".
So the last four years have not been in Bolivia's favor.
"The question of access to the sea has been captured by the current Bolivian administration", Sarate said.
He thought that President Morales' belligerent rhetoric had destroyed the last remaining goodwill of Chile.
Negotiations between Bolivia and Chile will continue, but after this they will be very difficult to conduct.
The two countries have not held an ambassadorial meeting since 1962.
The former president of Bolivia and representative in The Hague, Eduardo Rodríguez Velze, rejected the notion that the trial was not very difficult.
He said Monday that the people of Bolivia have a "great opportunity to forge a new relationship with Chile and a mutually beneficial opportunity to end 139 years of conflict".
Morales was one of the most prominent presidents of Latin America; Calsadilla, in turn, was criticized for his political use of the sea.
"Bolivia will never give up its fight for the right to access the sea", he added.
The verdict is an opportunity for us to forget the past.
North Korea: Do not expect nuclear disarmament without trusting the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho said that the Korean people would never give up their nuclear weapons without showing confidence in Washington.
The minister made the remarks in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly on Sunday.
And the United States asked that the Singapore summit commitments be kept.
The minister's comments surprised the United States, as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seemed ready to resume his unwavering nuclear diplomacy after a meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Singapore three months earlier.
Due to the continuing sanctions from the United States and the lack of agreement on the demands for an end to the Korean War, the North Korean government's attempts to contain North Korea will be a pipe dream.
We will refrain from agreeing to the Washington declaration until Pyongyang takes the first important steps toward disarmament.
Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump have both expressed interest in holding a second summit.
But it is hard to believe that Korea will soon give up its weapons, which are the only guarantee of security for the country.
Pompeo planned to travel to Pyongyang the following month to prepare for a summit for Trump and Kim.
The latest collection of the massive headscarves presented at the Paris fashion show has made its way to the shops of your city's central street
If you are looking for a new headwear or a complete sunshade - no further trace.
The designers Valentino and Tom Brown delivered a line of elegant hats from their SS19 collection on the podium and surprised members of the entire Paris Fashion Week.
This summer, uncomfortable hats filled the Instagram network and designers sent these lines across the podium.
Valentino's light brown hat, with the wings of the head covering the heads of the models, was a class distinction.
Other major accessories include a magic hat-like design with a caramel and pineapple finish - but they won't keep your head warm.
Tom Brown showed in his clever masks that it would be just in time for Halloween.
The masks were even sewn lipstick on - in a horror movie, it is not necessary to call it high fashion.
One was a synthetic tool for swimming under water with a wrapper and goggles, and the other was like a vessel of melted ice cream.
If you follow high fashion - it's time to rejoice.
The people who know will cry - soon these infinite beings will be very close to your house.
The large hats resembled the collection of the La Bomb - a collection of straw hats with a width of almost a meter, and the black hats were worn by the singer from Riana to the model of Emili Ratajkovski.
The famous sign, which was created by uncomfortable hats, quickly spread on social media; it was followed by a similarly large number of bags made of straw that went on the podium, so large that the model in the swimsuit that held it was not visible.
The red bag made of burnt rafia fabric, with a rafia-stitched skirt and white leather handkerchief - the collection of Жакема La Riviera SS19 was the brightest element of the Paris Fashion Week.
The famous stylist Luke Armitage said: "I expect to see large bag hats in stores next summer, as the designers have made a significant impact, and sellers will feel the need for more mature items".
John Edward, head of the Independent Schools Council of Scotland: "All citizens of the world need to have language skills".
Scottish independent schools have a strong record of academic success, so that the performance of individual and group students in sports, culture, music and other various community initiatives has been very good in 2018.
The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) is committed to providing the best possible service to pupils and their parents, and has over 30,000 pupils in schools across Scotland.
The main task of independent schools is to prepare students for higher education, career choices, and finding a place in the world.
As an educational system that develops and implements its programs individually, we are convinced that modern language lessons are very popular and necessary.
Nelson Mandela, former president of South Africa, said, "If you talk to someone who has learned the language, you are talking to their brain.
If you speak to a person in his or her native language, you are speaking to his or her heart.
These words remind us that we cannot rely solely on English to build strong bonds and trust with people from other countries.
According to the results of this year's exams in independent schools, language learning is at the top of the list.
Among the students who studied foreign languages, 68% of them received the best result.
According to the data collected, among 74 such schools, 72 percent of Chinese, 72 percent of German, 69 percent of French and 63 percent of Spanish were the only ones with a best-performing language.
Independent schools in Scotland have acknowledged that learning foreign languages is a skill that children will need in the future.
Language study is also frequently chosen among other subjects (science, craft, engineering and mathematics) in the curriculum of independent schools and elsewhere.
In the UK, a 2014 survey by the Employment and Skills Survey found that 17% of job vacancies were due to the lack of non-native speakers.
Therefore, the knowledge of other languages is becoming more and more important, since for young people it is the main issue to get a good job.
As the need for language experts in high-performance jobs increases, foreign language speakers are essential in a globalized world.
No matter what profession a second language learner chooses, the knowledge that remains for life will always be a real advantage.
A person who can communicate directly with someone from another country will automatically always be ahead of the others.
In a 2013 survey conducted by YouGov, among more than 4,000 adults in the UK, 75% spoke no foreign languages and only 10% spoke French - a figure that was 15% higher than the previous year.
This is why emphasizing language learning is so important for today's children.
It will always be easier for a person who speaks several languages to get a full-time job, especially in developing countries.
In Scotland, each school will teach in a different language.
Some schools will focus on classical modern languages, while others will focus on those considered to be important for the UK in 2020, such as Chinese and Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests, independent schools will always have teachers who teach these subjects in several languages.
Scottish schools are committed to creating an educational environment that prepares children for the various challenges that await them in the future and teaches them to fight for success.
In today's global business environment, languages are of paramount importance to the future of a country, and this position should be reflected in education.
If not, modern languages should be considered as a form of international communication.
Independent schools will offer the opportunity, variety and high quality of this education to the younger population of Scotland.
The first sentence of the French phrase "il faut bien le faire" is "You must do well in everything".
The head of the Independent Schools Council of Scotland, John Edward.
LeBron will make his first NBA debut in San Diego with the Lakers
Fans who have been waiting for James Lebron's basketball will soon see him in the Los Angeles Lakers.
According to Lakers coach Luke Walton, James will play against the Denver Nuggets in the preseason opener in San Diego on Sunday.
The exact number of minutes he played has not been revealed.
The team's official website states that Walton's speech was "more than a minute, but less than 48 minutes".
Lakers' correspondent Mike Trudeau tweeted that James will likely be given less playing time.
After a training session earlier in the week, James told his brother about his intentions for the upcoming three-game preseason.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need to play pre-season", he said.
YouTube hacking: Trump's rallies in West Virginia are in the offing
President Donald Trump is scheduled to begin a series of pre-election rallies in Willing, West Virginia, this evening.
The rally was one of five planned, including in quiet places such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
After the Supreme Court delayed the presidential election, Trump sought to gain support for the upcoming midterm elections, as the Republicans were determined to lose their leadership in Congress if the election was postponed until November.
When and how can Trump's rallies in West Virginia be viewed online?
The rally was scheduled to take place at 7 p.m. on Saturday, September 29, 2018, on the Iti Tunayt channel.
You can also watch Trump's rally in West Virginia live on YouTube at the link below.
The president may have been forced to appeal to Bretta Kavanaugh, who sat on the Supreme Court, because of allegations of sexual impropriety; this delayed the upcoming Senate confirmation vote by a week, while the FBI was still investigating.
But the main issue of these rallies was to help the Republicans with some direction of development, which had to face the challenges associated with the November elections.
Thus, five rallies for Trump's campaign next week will activate volunteers and supporters, as Republicans try to grow and maintain their party with people in the House of Representatives and Senate, according to Reuters.
A spokesman for the Trump campaign, who declined to be named, told Reuters: "The president is very important to the leadership of Congress, so he is ready to go to all the states, and we will then be ready for the pre-election campaign season".
West Virginia Metro News Channel reported that The rally, which will be held today at the WessBanco Arena in Wheeling, could include supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and media from the city of Pittsburgh.
Trump, who plans to visit on Saturday, will make his second visit to West Virginia in the past month, a state where he received more than 40% of the vote in 2016.
Trump is forced to help Patrick Morris, the Senate candidate from West Virginia, who is running in the Republican primary.
"It's not a good idea for Morrissey to have a president who has to put you on trial", political scientist Simon Hader of West Virginia University told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: United States team ready to fight for its hopes in singles on Sunday
After a total of three one-goal games, the fourth golf event on Saturday was the Ryder Cup.
This change of direction is a complete invention of the sport, but it is precisely in such competitions that athletes sincerely trust it.
Where is that upward trend now?
Golfer Jordan Spit, who was taking a day off, said: "We were six points ahead, but now we are only four, so we are not giving up because of the upward trend".
Albietta, the dominant European side - 4 points ahead, 12 points ahead of the rest of the game.
According to Spit, the Americans are very excited and encouraged at this time, as, for example, Spit and Thomas, who played together, can boast of three out of four points scored.
From start to finish, Spit was the main player.
Every decisive touch on his court was a sound of celebration, as he had to fight for the two points he had lost to Thomas.
His goal was accompanied by the same thunderous voices on the field 15 days into the game. The golfer's genuine desire to win showed his belief in the American team.
"The others need to think more deeply now and worry about their matches", Spit said.
The only thing these players had to worry about was the noise.
18 points was not enough to leave a mark in history.
The last two days of the Ryder Cup were dominated by the two undoubted historic players, Franchesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, who were only a few points ahead of Spitt and Thomas.
The European variation, but very well known, is that these two golfers have four of the four possible points, so everything should be fine.
In all of their games, whether Friday night, Saturday afternoon, or Saturday morning, Tommie and Francesco did not make a single bogey (the number of extra strokes that should have been made in a single over).
If Molinari and Flitwood are the winners of all Europe on the Sunday at Le Golf National, there will be no more famous golfers than them, for they have such a passion for the fans.
As expected, the two players won two separate games.
However, it is still too early to talk about a sign for the whole of Europe.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly defeated the hero of the morning four-ball match, Sergio Garcia, who in turn played in a pair with Alex Noren.
The Spaniards, Garsio and Noren, were left behind by a bogey and two dabbles (a shoulder overhead of a stroke that should have been done in a nest).
Of course, no one can help you on Sunday.
It was interesting to watch the four golfers: how they interacted with each other, what advice they gave, which of them they followed and which of them they did not, and how the game changed in the blink of an eye.
In fact, the European team had much better results than that, for example, even in the final game, but these four-way games proved that America had the courage to fight, even if the States had little confidence in it.
Europe goes to the final with a score of 10:6 in the Ryder Cup
After Saturday's four-player match, Europe is 10-6 ahead of the Americans, which is already a big advantage for them in the Ryder Cup final.
The pair of wings, Francesco Molinari and Tommi Flitwood, beat Tiger Woods in the Le Golf National, bringing their score to four points.
The European team of Thomas Bjørn, which was about to take the first place, defeated the American team in the series by 3:1 in today's morning game after being left behind at the golf club in Heizeltine two years ago.
Despite winning two matches in the States, they were short of points.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points in 12 singles games on Sunday to retain the trophy.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, Flitwood is the first European golfer to have four consecutive points, while he and Molitari (who are known as Moliwood after the surprise weekend games) are only the second duo to have won four consecutive points in the first four games.
After leaving Woods and Patrick Reed behind, they also beat the American starter Bryson DeChambon, who was also a standout, 5-4.
Woods, who played two matches on Saturday, had some bright moments in his temporary play, but lost 19 of his 29 matches between four men.
After four straight games in the morning, Justin Rose, who had taken a break, returned to his partner, Henrik Stenson, and defeated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who had won the first and third places in the world competition, by 2:1.
Although the weather was clear and sunny on the southwestern side of Paris, the European team did not fare well.
Triple winners Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas scored two points on Saturday to set a new American record.
They fought hard against the Spaniards John Ram and Jan Poulter, winning 2-1 and later coming back to win 4-3 against Polter and Rory Maquilroy in a four-way tie.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, the team has only twice come back from four points down in singles, and a tie would have been enough to keep the trophy for Furik's team.
With two days of second-to-last power, a counter-attack on Sunday seemed unlikely.
North Korea says there can never be unilateral disarmament without trust
North Korea's foreign minister said Saturday that continued U.S. sanctions on the United Nations have eroded trust between the two countries, and that under the circumstances, nuclear disarmament is unlikely to be discussed.
According to the annual General Assembly of the World Organization for Nuclear Disarmament, North Korea made important commitments last year: it completed nuclear and missile tests, it decommissioned nuclear test sites, and it pledged not to proliferate nuclear weapons and technology.
"But we have not seen an equivalent response from the United States", the minister said.
"Without any confidence in the United States, we will not have national security, and in these conditions we cannot unilaterally disarm".
Although the minister's complaints about Washington's lack of response to North Korea's slow changes seem familiar, his statements were rightly felt, as Pyongyang had last year rejected any attempt at unilateral disarmament.
In his message, Ri recalled the agreement reached by President Donald Trump and leader Kim Jong-un at their first joint summit in Singapore on June 12, when the leaders of the two countries promised each other that Korea would begin disarmament efforts and that America would, in turn, guarantee their security.
North Korea has achieved an official end to the Korean War of 1950-53, but expects the United States to first give up its nuclear weapons altogether.
Washington, in turn, refused to relax the harsh international sanctions against Korea.
"America is determined to disarm first and therefore opposes even the imposition of sanctions and refusal to declare the end of the war", said Ri.
These people who make up vain dreams about bringing us to our knees, don't know our country at all.
And the fact that sanctions are still in place only exacerbates our distrust.
Ri did not mention the plans for the next summit between the leaders of the two countries, which was mentioned by the American president at the United Nations.
In particular, the minister drew attention to the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months: "If South Korea had been on the side of the autocracy during this period, instead of America, we would not have been in a situation where we could go forward or backward".
However, the mood of the speech by Minister Ri, as told to the Organization, was different from last year, when the General Assembly asserted that North Korea could not avoid launching missiles at the United States, due to President Trump's past references to Kim as "rocket man".
At the United Nations this year, the American president, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised the leader Kim for taking steps to disarm, but said that sanctions would remain in place unless North Korea was de-escalated, so much of the work ahead had to be done first.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he had no time limit for this: "It doesn't matter if you spend two years, three years or five months on this question".
China and Russia have both told the United Nations Security Council that they should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
In the meantime, the US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the United Nations Security Council on Thursday that the Security Council must continue to ensure that sanctions are enforced without interruption, until such time as the hard core is fully decentralized.
The Security Council unanimously tightened sanctions against North Korea beginning in 2006, in an attempt to cut off funding for Pyongyang's missile and nuclear programs.
Pompeo met with Ri, a delegate to the United Nations General Assembly, and shared with him his plans to return to Pyongyang the following month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not go well.
And in July, he returned from Pyongyang, claiming good results, but only hours later, North Korea accused the politician of making dangerous demands.
At a meeting this month, North Korea promised Moon that it would withdraw from the missile and nuclear cooperation unless the United States took appropriate action.
According to him, these measures were necessary for Kim only to ensure the security that Trump demanded in Singapore and to maintain good communication with Washington.
Harvard students learn to relax properly
A new class at Harvard University has forced students of all levels to sleep more - a move designed to counter the culture of caffeinated sleepless nights among students.
Among the most educated students at the world's top university, there are some who have no idea how to take care of themselves.
Charles C. Цейслер, a professor at Harvard Medical School, a professor at Brigham Young University and the Women's Hospital, developed a special course that he said was unique in America.
He was inspired to start this work after he told me how sleep deprivation affects reading.
After the lecture, a girl came to the professor and asked: "Why am I only hearing about this in my last year?"
The professor was surprised that the student had never told him about the importance of sleep, according to the journal Telegraph.
The first course, released this year, explains to students how sleep helps them to study, play sports, and feel better overall.
According to Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the university's executive director of health services, the university decided to include the course after learning how many students were sleeping less than they were during the week.
There are many interesting, interactive problems in the one-hour class.
For example, the picture of the dormitory shows students standing on coffee cups, standing on the fire, and not sleeping, and even teaches students what to do before they go to bed.
Students then learned that sleep deprivation can lead to heart attacks, strokes, depression, and even cancer.
The school's landscape with various interactive signs makes the class audience think about how they should spend their day.
We know that students' behavior cannot be changed now.
But they should have a right to know about it - just like you have a right to know about the harm of tobacco", added Professor Ceisler.
According to him, the culture of sleepless nights for preparing for exams is very common, especially with modern technologies and the increasing difficulty of studying - not being able to sleep is a major problem.
Convincing students of the importance of adequate sleep would be a secret weapon against stress, fatigue, and overweight, and thus avoid obesity - because less sleep means more brain demands.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian, was studying chemistry and physical biology; he had helped Professor Цейслер to organize the class better after he had started taking it in his first year of classes.
He said he liked the lesson so much that he decided to make it a general education class.
She hopes that the next step will be to ask the aspirants to take this course before they are able to move on to other educational settings.
Professor Цейслер advised students to set an alarm clock for both bedtime and wake-up time, and to be mindful of the dangers of blue screens and light-diode lamps.
The goal of the Menga was scored by Gerrard, who was the first player to score a goal in the game.
In the away game, the Rangers suffered another defeat, losing 1-0 to the team of Steven Gerrard in the final against the Leeward Minstrel.
4:1 After a triumphant win over St. John's in February, Ibrox's team were confident of their first win on the road, but Gary Holtans' team suffered a second defeat to coach Gerrard in 18 games, leaving his team 8 points behind and the runner overtaking the premier league leader Lendbrookers Harts.
With 7 minutes to go, Menga scored, but the Murrays failed to satisfy the Rangers.
The Rangers were relegated to sixth place, while Livingston moved up to third, just one point behind Hibernian.
Other problems could have been expected for the Ranger, as the lainsman (outside line judge) Calum Spence had to be treated after being hit in the head by something.
The team was beaten in the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup by the team of Gerrard, who produced eight errors.
On the other hand, Holt, who had taken a draw from Hart a week earlier, was competing with the same Linvingston XI and his fine preparation was putting them through the motions.
The Rangers may have been on top of the ball, but the team from Livingston was better with the ball.
They were due to score two minutes in the penalty shootout when Scott Menzies knocked out Allan McGregor, but the halfback took advantage of his big break.
Keegan Jacobs's penalty kick was deeply fought by captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Litgow was hit from the back of the stand.
The Rangers got their first look at the ball, but their third was more of a hopeful than confident.
In the 15th minute, Alfredo Morelos was able to score a goal after a collision with Steven Loulless, but the referee, Steven Thomson, refused to allow the Columbian to score.
In the first half, the Rangers scored twice, but former goalkeeper Ibrooks's shot from Lassana Kulibaly's head and Ovi Ejerie's hand did not disturb Liam Kelly.
The first match was over in the 34th minute with Livi, who was probably not the only one who refused to give money to win.
The Rangers again failed to beat the well-trained Jacobs.
Scott Arfield was not impressed when Declan Gallagher gave the ball to Scott Robinson, who had kept his cool by picking Menga to finish the game.
During the break, Gerrard decided to replace Kulibaly with Oaiana Kent, and this replacement had the same effect as the substitution of striker Morelos, but affected the country's Kelly on his block line.
But Livingston was always inviting visitors to a similar game: Littow and Halkett always got the ball.
Holt's team could have doubled the margin in the final stage, but McGregor held on to eliminate Jacobs before Litgow was able to take a corner kick.
Glenn Middleton of the Rangers, who had been substituting, was again late on a penalty in the tie with Jacobs, but again missed Thomson.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
The time for the "Morning Sunday" of the Almanac is 136 years ago, on September 30, 1882, the day when the great German physicist Johann Wilhelm Hans Geiger was born.
Geiger invented a method of measuring and protecting against radioactive material, which is now known as the Geiger count.
Since then, Geiger has been credited with many science-fiction films, including the 1950 film The Bells of Colorado, with scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Questioner: What is the world need for this?
Rogers: This is called a Geiger counter and it helps to find the location of radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
If you put your ear to it, you can actually hear the radioactivity of the minerals.
Evans: "Listen, there is a real explosion going on!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, a few days after his 63rd birthday.
But his invention lives in the shadows.
Newly developed vaccine against cancer helps immune system to see the bad sides
A vaccine developed to fight cancer teaches the immune system to recognize and eliminate the defects.
This vaccine is seen as a way to fix the problem of finding the wrong loopholes.
Again, this methodology involves removing the defects from the person and modifying them in laboratories.
He was later able to remove the protein from many common cancers and re-introduce it.
The test-tube vaccine has shown excellent results in patients with various cancers.
One woman with ovarian cancer was cured for 18 months by this vaccine.
In this method, a vaccine can be used to find the bad cells, remove them from the person, and then modify them in the laboratory, where they can be detected and re-inserted by a protein called HER2, which is present in many common cancers.
Jay Berzofsky, a professor at the National Cancer Institute of America in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show that the new vaccine holds great promise".
Professor Berzofsky explained that HER2 stimulates the growth of several types of cancer, such as breast, ovarian, lung and stomach cancers.
A similar approach has been used to treat certain types of leukemia.
Kanye West, Trump's running mate, made the release on Saturday Night Live.
But the graduation did not go well.
Saturday Night Live embarrassed Kanye West after he graduated, as he decided to support Donald Trump, who was set to be elected in 2020.
When she released her third song, "Goost Town", she wore a Trump hat, and then began to speak out against the Democrats and express her support for the president.
"A lot of white people I talk to have said, 'How can you like Trump when he's a racist?'
If I cared about racism, I would have left America long ago", he said.
Saturday Night Live began with a parody starring Matt Damon; the Hollywood star was mocked for how Bret Kavanaugh had given instructions to the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding Christine Blasey Ford's sexual misconduct allegations.
Although West was not shown on blue screens, comedian Chris Rock posted a few shots on social media.
It is unclear whether this publication was intended to humiliate the singer.
West also told the audience backstage how he had a hard time with that helmet.
I was ridiculed backstage.
They said, "Don't even think about wearing it".
They made fun of me backstage!
And I was given a very distant look", she told the Washington Examiner.
And West continued:  If you want to see someone who is an outsider, don't look at me, because I will wear a hat on someone if I want to, and I won't have to ask you what to do He said. Do you want to see the world go on ahead?
Try to be more human.
His words were greeted with applause by the audience at least twice and by the actors present, and one witness told the magazine Veriety: "There was a long silence in the entire studio.
Kanye West was invited to the show in place of Ariana Grande, whose boyfriend, the famous rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
The singer surprised everyone by dressing up as a spray bottle and singing "This is what I like".
The head of the conservative organization Tipuyusaye, Kendis Turner, tweeted in support of the singer: To the most courageous person: Thank you for standing up to the People!
But Talk show guest Karen Hunter tweeted West was just being himself and it was so weird.
But I will not make a man who honors my community alive by listening to his songs and buying his clothes.
He is a free man.
And we are as free as he is.
Before the show, the rapper tweeted that he was forced to change his name to "Now my official name is Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name: the famous star, Didi, seems to be followed by other names such as Paff Daddie, Paffy and Pi Didi.
During the time of fellow rapper Snoop Dogg, Snoop was known as Lion, and of course, the late artist Prince had changed his name.
A man was killed in a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was arrested in a restaurant on the east side of Belfast after he stabbed a man to death.
According to police, the incident took place in Ballikhakamor.
The defendant is to appear in the Magistrate's Court on Monday.
The charges will be decided by the Public Trial.
The Game of Thrones star Keith Harington: toxic youth
Keith is best known for his starring role in the HBO series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor broke the heroic mold: according to him, it is often necessary to show a tough temper to be respectful of men who play such roles.
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Keith expressed concern that the issue was acute and how it could have been resolved in the days of activism.
Recently, the Whale took his Game of Thrones co-star, 31-year-old Rosie Leslie, as his bride - and the actor has said he is ready to resolve the issue.
I am currently asking myself, when did we create the male-male problem?
How are we supposed to raise our sons when this is a problem?
According to the actor, the television should be largely responsible for the emergence of this problem.
And he goes on to say, "Is it something we are born with or are we taught to do?"
What do they teach on TV, outside, when boys often have problems with their boyhood?
I think the question that's most important right now is, how do we change this?
Because it is understandable that something has gone wrong with young men.
In this interview, Keith expressed his desire not to participate in any future Game of Thrones projects, as he was too tired of the spectacle of combat.
Starting in November, Keith will play the lead role in Sam Shepard's "The Real West", about the producer and his brother-in-law.
Actor Keith recently told the truth when he said that Rosie was the best thing that ever happened to him in Game of Thrones.
"That's how I met my future wife, and that's how I started my family".
The first game in the series was played by the main character, Rosie, who was the favorite of Kit's family.
In June 2018, the couple celebrated their wedding in the home of the Leslie family in Scotland.
China reports 14% increase in infections due to HIV and AIDS
China reports a 14% increase in infections among citizens with HIV and AIDS.
According to health officials, more than 820 000 people are sick in the country.
In the second half of 2018, it was reported that about 40 000 new cases were detected.
Most of the new cases of infection were of a sexual nature, as seen in the past.
Traditionally, HIV infection is caused by bleeding in some parts of China.
But the number of people infected in this way is now almost non-existent, Chinese health officials reported at a conference in Yunnan province.
In the same year, the number of people infected with HIV and AIDS increased by 100 000 people.
Sexual transmission of HIV cases is a major problem in the LGBTI community in China.
Homosexuality was legalized in China in 1997, but the LGBT community is considered to be extremely hostile.
Due to conservative values in the country, it is estimated that 70-90% of LGBT men in the country are married to women.
In these relationships, the disease is caused by a lack of sexual protection
To help with this, the Chinese government has pledged to increase the availability and availability of HIV-prevention drugs since 2003.
Maxine Waters rejects the data leak of the Republican Senators' Party and the conspiracy theory against the United States and the dangerous deception
On Saturday, Representative Maxine Waters, a member of the House of Representatives, exposed allegations that one of her representatives had posted personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on the Internet.
According to the Los Angeles Democrat, these unjustified claims are being fed by uninformed experts and web sites.
In a tweet, Waters said "False, false and just a nasty lie".
The data contained the home addresses and phone numbers of two U.S. senators, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch of Utah.
The information was posted online on Thursday and named by the state's attorney general, Capito Hill, during hearings against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The dispute arose after three senators asked for Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the source's IP address was associated with Waters's family and that the information was posted by one of Waters's employees.
"There is no real context in this message", said Waters.
The personal data and safety of a member of my office has been compromised by these unfounded accusations, and I cannot accept any responsibility for it.
"There is no real context in this message", said Waters.
Waters's comments were immediately reported on social media, with former White House press secretary Ari Flaysher saying:
He wrote: "It was very badly spoken".
Such a procedure meant that he could not become a member of the Congress.
If he is accused of something that he did not do, he should not be defeated until he is.
It should be quiet.
He should not question the accuser's words.
It should be quiet.
It was noted that Flaysher compared Waters's match to that of Kavanaugh, who had been reprimanded by the judges for being badly fought in Thursday's hearings.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate who was forced to replace Waters in the upcoming election, tweeted his thoughts:
If true, this is a very surprising situation.
Waters stated that law enforcement officials had told him that the allegations were false.
"We will find the perpetrators and bring them to the jurisdiction of the legal entity, because such actions are more shameful for each member".
Agent Johnny English film preview - a spy parody of the late Rowan Atkinson
It is now common for each film to have something to say about Brexit - as has been the case with the comedy franchise that has been revived; the comedy boomerang with Johnny English, which began in 2003, was revived in 2011.
Will this film, which makes fun of the ugly, be a new export opportunity for our country?
Somehow, with eyes like a ball and a face like a rubber mask, Johnnie English was released for the second time and licensed to all Bulgarians - this movie, according to cinematographers, was a work of great comedy, but it was released for non-English speaking countries.
Of course, he is only a more cunning spy, and his more aggressive behavior, his resemblance to Mr. Bean and even his voice, which is similar to the singer at the 2012 Olympics opening ceremony - makes him such a unique character.
He is also the hero, in the image of the traveller and the mysterious man, whom Atkinsons played in the long-forgotten Barclayard adventure.
The last Johnny English had a few very interesting moments.
I was fascinated by the way Johnny English was dressed in medieval military uniforms and the helicopter's air screws repeatedly struck his helmet.
Atkinsons ability for witty comedy is well known, but the level of humor is weak and overblown, as modern serious films such as 007 and Unfinished Mission show good humor.
To me, this adult humor is like a child's humor, and the Johnny English's misbehavior is no longer interesting, and the silent film with Mr. Bean is even more entertaining.
The fact that Britain is now in a very bad shape is always an issue.
A small role-playing agent for Kevin Eldon was surprised to learn that a cyber-hacker had somehow infiltrated the top-secret British intelligence agency and had begun to reveal the names of other agents.
This was the last straw for the barely functioning prime minister, whose reputation was in such a bad shape that the script was not nearly as difficult as it was when actress Emma Thompson was cast in the role of the fake Theresa May.
His advisers on the discovery said that he would have to release a retired agent, as the names of every active spy were known to everyone.
And that episode, with Johnny English, a retired shoeless man who now works as a teacher in a wealthy school and, if he is unwell, gives lessons in spying, was the only one that struck me as a bit funny.
English was quickly sent back to Whitehall for an emergency organization, where he was reunited with his formerly arrogant assistant, Bowe, played by the good Ben Miller.
Bo is now a family man, like a commander to his bride, and it seems that this pleasant role was played by Vicky Pepperdini for nothing.
Thus, Batman and Robin are reunited, and are wrongly mistaken for the Secret Service of the Queen, and are then seen with the beautiful Ophelia Bulletova, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is being duped by a very charismatic tech billionaire; he promises to eliminate all of Britain's computer problems, and the evil Jason Volta is played by Jake Lacey.
English and Bowe begin their comedy journey by dressing up as waiters and lighting fires in a French restaurant, stepping onto the steamy yacht of the Voolt, and having a go at the English virtual reality set.
I don't know how to continue, but of course, the humor of this film seems to be for children.
It is a very average film.
And finally, I ask, recalling other films of Johnny English, could the British film industry not have given such a talented Rowan Atkinson a more suitable role?
The Labour Party refused to accept a plan designed for the British to work four days but be paid for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn of the Labour Party developed a plan for the Bitanni, in which he worked four days but was paid for five.
The money raised by the AI will reportedly be used by company executives to pay workers for the fifth day.
So the workers will enjoy a three-day holiday, but they will take home the same amount of money.
According to the sources, this opinion is very much in line with the financial side of the party and the plans of the country to get closer to the workers.
The move to a four-day work week was supported by the Congress of Trade Unions, as a way for working people to take advantage of the opportunities of a rapidly changing economy.
A senior Labour Party source told the Sunday Times that the political changes were expected to be announced by the end of the year.
This would not happen quickly, but a four-day week would be more conducive to the party's march toward a sound economy and general industrial plans.
The Labour Party was not the first to make this plan - the Green Party had already made a speech in 2017 ahead of the general election with a four-day election cycle.
However, this effort was not fully supported by the Labour Party.
The party's spokesman: "The four-day workday is not the party's policy and we cannot care about it now".
Chancellor John Macdonell held a Labour conference last week to outline his approach to social change in the economy.
According to MacDonnell, it was important for him to regain control of directors and speculators.
These plans of the Chancellor meant that the shareholders of the water companies could not get their share, as the Labour Party could send the government a message of consequences in the event of a disorder.
He also proposed plans to introduce ordinary workers into the boards of directors of companies and then to create funds for the transfer of ownership, transferring 10% of its capital to the workers of private firms, giving them dividends of up to 500 feet per year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy spoke on the political TV show "60 Minutes" about the possibility that the FBI investigation of Kavanaugh could change their minds.
The FBI's investigation into the indictment of Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final selection of his Supreme Court nominee by at least a week and raised the pressing question of whether the bureau's results would be able to rely on the support of Republican senators.
On Sunday's 60 Minutes, correspondent Scott Pelli told Republican Senators John F. Kennedy and Lindsey Graham that the FBI's investigation could change their minds.
Kennedy appeared more sober than his South Carolina counterpart.
"No, sir", said Kennedy.
I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh, who was scheduled to be on the hearing.
When I learned about all that had happened, I immediately called him and asked him, "Is this your fault?"
He was very determined, determined, and single-minded".
However, Graham's voice seems to be unchanged.
"I have made my decision about Brett Kavanaugh, but he will need a strong indictment", he said.
"Doctor Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know one thing: Brett has absolutely refused to do this", Graham added, referring to Christine Blesy Ford.
"And no one can prove that he said that.
He was 36 years old.
I don't see any new changes".
What is the Global Urbanists Day and has it helped in any way with the charity?
This Saturday, the city will host the annual Global City Festival, a musical event that features influential stars as it takes on the crucial issue of how to fight poverty.
Now in its 7th year, tens of thousands of people are gathering in the Elder Bushes of Central Park, not just to watch the release of the famous Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but to remember the event's ultimate goal: to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Urbanist Day, which was launched in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Project to Combat Poverty, an international charity whose main goal is to end poverty by increasing the number of people who struggle against it.
If you are not ready to get a VIP-ticket, the audience must do various activities to get a free ticket, such as volunteering, sending a letter to the world leader, making a call, and other effective measures to raise this issue.
But has the Festival produced any results in 12 years?
Is the idea of giving free concerts the right way to convince real people, or is it just another case of clictivism - believing that signing online petitions and posting various posts is really good for you?
Since 2011, Global Citizen Day has registered over 19 million cases of aid and support for various causes.
These goals have reportedly forced various world leaders and politicians to commit to more than $37 million in funding to help more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the event's organizers reported that 390 cases had been paid or collected, totaling nearly $10 billion.
The organization estimates that the current collection of money has cost the lives of at least 649 million people worldwide.
One of the most important is the British investor and executive organization The Power of Nutrition, whose primary goal is to help children. Thanks to the 4700 tweets written in their name, the organization has pledged to donate $35 million to the country of Rwanda to fight the problem of malnutrition.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, the people's government and people everywhere, we can make history by eliminating hunger forever", said Tracy Ullman, spokesperson for the organization, at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The organisation also reiterated that after more than 5,000 steps had been taken to address the UK's mother-child nutrition problem, the government announced a project to fund more than 5 million women with children.
One of the most frequently asked questions is "How can we end extreme poverty?"
The festival website responds: "This will be a long and difficult journey - going through difficult times.
But if we remember the great forgotten movements for human rights, we will surely win this war, because unity is strength.
Janet Jackson, Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are the stars who will perform at this year's event; Deborah-Lee Ferness and Hyu Jackman will host the festival in New York.
US interior minister: We can use naval forces to block Russian energy exports
The Washington Examiner quoted U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke as saying that Washington could deploy naval forces to demand Russian energy exports in the Middle East if it were to do so.
According to Zinke, Russia is not involved in Syria in vain, especially since the Lawful Government is only calling for an investigation of the energy market.
"I think the reason why Russia is a frequent visitor to the Middle East is that they are intermediaries in the energy sphere, because the same is true in Eastern and Southern Europe", the minister said.
According to the leaders, there are many ways to solve this problem.
"The United States has the advantage that our Navy is open and when needed, their energy resources are not available on the free market", he said.
Zinké addressed the participants of the Non-Profit Organization Meeting held by the Alliance of Energy Consumers, who considered themselves "the voice of energy consumers in the United States".
He compared Washington's position to that of Russia and Iran, saying they were identical.
"The only option for Iran and Russia is to use and exchange fuel", he said, adding that Russia's profile was limited because its economy was tied to fossil fuel deposits.
The announcement came after the Trump administration raised the issue of increasing the export of natural gas to Europe and selling it at a much lower price in order to outpace Russia.
In fact, US President Donald Trump and his administration have urged Germany not to participate in the construction of the Nord Stream 2 project, which they believe will increase Russian influence in Europe.
Moscow has repeatedly noted that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline will double its capacity to 110 billion cubic meters and is purely an economic project.
The Kremlin claimed that Washington's fierce opposition to the project was due to economic reasons only and was an example of dishonest struggle.
Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak stated during his September meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow: "I believe that energy resources should not be a tool of pressure and that consumers have the right to choose their suppliers".
The negative position of the United States had a negative impact on Germany, which had agreed to the project.
Germany's leading industrial organization, the Federation of German Industries, advised to stay away from the US Energy Policy Organization and the Berlin and Moscow bilateral agreements.
After German Chancellor Angela Merkel's meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, the head of the Federation of German Industries, Dieter Kempf, said: "I would be in a very difficult situation if a third country interfered with our energy issues".
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren announced that she plans to run for president in 2020
On Saturday, Massachusetts State Senator Elizabeth Warren confirmed that she intends to run for president after the Congressional midterm elections.
In a town hall in Holiock, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering running for president.
The New York Times quoted her as saying, "It's time for women to take the road to Washington and change the government's hard-line approach to us and give us the right to run the country".
I will think seriously about my participation in the presidential elections after November 6.
Warren expressed his opinion that U.S. President Donald Trump was not leading the county in the right direction.
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", he said.
Warrens, boldly, gave Trump and his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh their negative assessment.
On Friday, he wrote in his Twitter feed: "Well, we're going to need an FBI investigation before the election".
However, according to the results of the poll published on Thursday, many voters are not happy with Warren's participation in the 2020 election.
According to a survey by the Center for Political Research at Saffolk University, 58% of Massachusetts voters believe that a senator will not win the election, according to the Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported his candidacy.
According to polls, the former governor of the state, Deval Patrick, received the most votes; 38 percent supported the potential rival and 48 percent opposed it.
In the run-up to the 2020 presidential race, former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont State Senator Bernie Sanders were mentioned alongside other prominent Democrats.
According to the Associated Press news agency, Biden said he would make his official decision in January.
In a rally of Donald Trump voters, Sarah Palin said, "My son is suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder".
Track Palin, 26, served in Iraq for a year.
On Monday night, he was arrested on charges of domestic violence.
"I understand that when my son returns from the war, other families, our soldiers have returned with not only physical wounds, but also with wounds of life", he said at a rally of Donald Trump voters in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Paye called the arrest of his son a "controversial topic" and said that his son and other veterans had returned from the war changed and hardened. They were concerned about one thing - how much honor did their soldiers, the military, have for the country?
According to Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department in Alaska, Treak Pailin was arrested for domestic violence - assaulting a woman with a weapon while intoxicated.
18 states and the District of Columbia oppose new U.S. policy on housing affordability
The District of Columbia and eighteen states have a favorable legal position on U.S. policy supporting criminal groups, domestic violence, and domestic violence.
To counter such a policy, representatives of 18 states and the District of Columbia in Washington filed a petition Friday for protection of refugees, as reported by NBC News.
In August, the American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit against Sessions, claiming that the federal policy was not in accordance with the law, and that Grace's real name was not used.
Grace was persecuted by her own partner and his gang of thugs, but on July 20 the U.S. refused to grant her asylum.
He was arrested in Texas.
Lawyers for the states defending Gray have cited gangs and domestic violence in El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala as the most prevalent problem, as these countries have the highest number of asylum seekers in the United States.
A new U.S. law in 2014 overturned a previous decision by the Immigration Council to grant asylum to refugees fleeing undocumented domestic violence.
On Friday, District of Columbia Attorney General Carl Rasin noted that the new policy "abolishes state, federal, and international laws".
According to the court consultation, "All appeals under federal law have been considered as a particular fact or circumstance, and this prohibition overrides all principles".
The policy of not admitting refugees harms the U.S. economy, as most would be entrepreneurs and create jobs, the lawyers said in their appeal.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions in June allowed immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to refugees.
In his statement of 11 June: "Asylum is only granted to certain social groups that are persecuted or threatened on the basis of race, religion, nationality or political opinion", Sessions said.
The refuge has never been able to solve all the problems, even the major daily problems that are faced on the globe.
Number of deaths in search of rescue operation in Palu doubled
The situation is very difficult for the survivors.
In an evacuation center in the city of Palú, 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma comforted her son who was in a critical condition by saying, "The situation is very tense".
A ambulance car will take care of the most critical cases every minute.
There is a shortage of fresh water.
People saw people returning to their homes trying to save their flooded belongings.
The quake, measuring 7.5 on the Richter scale, destroyed hospitals and injured hundreds of people.
Some of the injured, including Dvi Harris, who suffered fractures of the back and shoulder, remained in the Army Hospital in Palu, where patients were treated in the open air due to prolonged tremors.
He remembered the strong earthquake that struck his hotel room with his wife and daughter, and he was moved to tears.
There was no time to recover.
"I think I was crushed by the walls", Harris told the Associated Press, "and we were in town with our family for a wedding".
I heard my wife screaming for help, then silence.
I don't know what happened to my wife and child.
I hope they are safe somewhere.
The American ambassador blamed China for the use of propaganda advertising.
A week after the official Chinese newspaper placed a four-page ad in an American daily newspaper about the benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of propagandizing the U.S. media.
Last Wednesday, US President Donald Trump accused China of interfering in the November 6 US congressional elections, citing a best-selling newspaper in Iowa that published a paid advertisement by the China Daily in the Des Moines Register, but China denied the accusation.
US officials told Reuters news agency that Trump accused Beijing of interfering in the US election, creating a new company in Washington to increase pressure on China.
Beijing and Washington had to balance import tariffs due to their trade wars, while other countries were able to promote their goods through advertising.
Chinese and American experts believe that Trump's support for the Republican Party has led to the development of new tariffs in China to reduce exports from other states, such as Iowa.
U.S. Ambassador to China and former Iowa governor Terry Branstad, who sold agricultural products to China, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
In his article in the Sunday edition of the Des Moines Register, Branstead wrote: "China is now doing double-crossing by publishing propaganda in our free press".
"The Chinese leadership has used the paid advertising of the Des Moines Register to spread its propaganda, taking advantage of the American tradition of free speech and the free press", wrote Bransted.
In contrast, in Beijing newspaper kiosks you will not find articles that cover the Chinese people who disagree with government policy and worry about economic development, as press materials are under the control of the Chinese Communist Party.
A Chinese newspaper objected to the publication of his article, though he did not specify which publication.
According to analysts, Republicans are sidelined by the failure of Kavanaugh's campaign in the run-up to the election.
Many Republicans support and support Brett Kavanaugh's candidacy for the Supreme Court despite the accusations of sexual harassment; in the run-up to the election, they will see a backlash, especially from women, the analyst noted.
In these tense times, most of the republicans expressed their desire to vote.
Grant Richer, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, said in an interview in the Saturday edition of The Hill: "These things are irreversible".
"The question of whether the unexpected demand of Arizona State Senator Jeff Flake, who said an FBI investigation would be enough to silence angry voters, is doubtful", said Riher.
As reported in Washington, D.C., on Friday, senior adviser and press secretary of the inter-ethnic progressive group Move on!, Karin Jean-Pierre, noted that "this was a women's evening that will not be forgotten tomorrow or in November".
As reported by the Mic news agency, on Friday, when protesters saw Kavanaugh in the Senate corridor, they staged a demonstration under the slogan November is coming!, as Republicans overseeing the Judiciary Committee refused to take the testimony of Christine Blaysey Ford, and wanted to move forward with Kavanaugh's candidacy.
According to the impartial political analyst Stju Rotenberg: "The interest in this work will be raised by citizens".
This is already happening in the vernacular and this is a reality according to the words of people.
But this may be higher, especially amongst hesitant suburban female voters and younger voters aged 18 to 29, who often do not vote even if they dislike the president".
Until Ford's public testimony, which pointed to a sexual assault charge, analysts predicted a backlash if Republicans rushed the Supreme Court to confirm his candidacy.
Earlier last week, former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele said that "this moment was very confusing for the Republican Party", wrote NBC News.
Guy Cecil, the director of the U.S. Preferred Committee, who helped elect Democrats, noted: "It's not about whether or not to elect to the committee, it's about putting Kavanaugh on the bench and showing how they're going to get out of this situation, what their views are".
However, following the arguments of Ford and Kavano, the Americans were divided into two groups, but the supporters of the latter were more numerous.
A new poll by YouGov showed that 41 percent of respondents trust or partially trust Ford's testimony, and 35 percent trust or partially trust Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent believe that Kavanaugh was deceived in his presentation, and 30 percent think the same of Ford.
Under pressure from Flake, the FBI is investigating another of Kavanaugh's victims, Deborah Ramirez, a witness, reports The Gardian.
Last week, before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Kavanaugh testified under oath that he had been thrown into a Ford at age 17 while drunk.
During his time at Yale University in the 1980s, Ramirez claimed that during a party, the Supreme Court nominee exposed his genitals.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning to create a new Internet to counter Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, has launched a new startup that will compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The project, built on the Solid platform with open source code from Berners-Lee, was called Inrupt.
Solid gives users the choice of where to store their data, who to share it with, or what information to share.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that "Inrupt's goal is to rule the world".
"We have to do it now", he said of the startup.
This is a historical event.
The application uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own personal online data.
It includes a list of contacts, a list of tasks, a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional tools.
Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all similar to a single browser and all at once.
The unique feature of personal online data storage is that the user chooses what information he or she can access.
The company calls this "expanding personal capability with information".
According to the company's CEO John Bruce, the idea behind Inrupt is that the company provides the resources, processes, and training needed to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of a security platform purchased from Berner-Lee, Bruce, IBM, and a number of state-based developers and a volunteer organization of programmers hired to work on the project.
Starting this week, developers of the technology will be able to use their centralized application, the tool that can be used on the Inrupt website, worldwide.
According to Berners-Lee, he and his team are not going to consult with Facebook or Google to consider a complete change of business model.
 We do not ask their permission.
Berners-Lee wrote on his Medium portal on Saturday that "Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystems, and to protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid".
The Internet was created in 1994 when the World Wide Web Consortium was founded at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has played a key role in the debate over net neutrality.
Although she has resigned from Inrupt, Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the Institute for Open Information, the World Wide Web Consortium, and the Web Foundation, an international non-profit organization.
"I remain optimistic about the future of the internet", Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Victoria Cross recipient of the First World War, who was awarded the Victoria Cross in 1917.
100 years later, the only Anglican cleric to be awarded the Victoria Cross for bravery in the First World War.
On 29 September 1918, in the attack on the communes of Belanglish and Leokure, the rector, the Reverend Bernard Van, received the award.
However, he did not receive the highest British military award until he was killed by a sniper four days later.
A memorial stone was placed in his honor on Saturday at a parade in the town of Rashden, Northamptonshire, attended by his grandchildren.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that the plaque was a tribute to the heroism of his grandfather 100 years later.
The London Gazette reported that on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Saint-Canté Canal under heavy fog, heavy artillery and heavy gunfire.
He then advanced to the firing line, where he single-handedly destroyed three of the troops.
A month before the end of the war, on October 4, 1918, German sniper killed Colonel Vann.
Michael Vann, 72, said he could never replicate his grandfather's courage.
After a parade of the Imperial Youth Orchestra of Brentwood, he and his brother, Dr. James Vann, laid flowers for their grandfather.
"We are very happy to be able to participate in the parade, which is a demonstration of the heroic courage of the people", James Vann said.
Fans of mixed martial arts stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, but instead received Svinka Peppa
Imagine that you have left your sleeping nights to watch the Bellator 206 tournament, and you have been denied access to it.
The tournament, which took place in San Jose, featured 13 matches, six of which were shown on the UK's Channel 5 on the main map throughout the night.
At 6 o'clock, when Geogard Musasi and Rory Macdonald were preparing for a face-to-face meeting, the British audience was shocked when the replacement for the reporter was Svinka Peppa.
For some people, this left no trace, because they were awake to watch this fight.
One fan called the change to a children's animation on his Twitter "some kind of crazy joke".
Bellator's senior vice president for marketing and communications, Dave Schwartz, said: "In line with the government's view, this content at 6am was not worth the load, so we had to move it to a children's program", when asked about the broadcast.
Yes, Swinka is a Peppa.
Scott Cocker, president of Bellator, said that in the future, the British public will work on their own table so that they can watch the tournament.
"I think we will think about the translation and work on it", said Koker.
Now in the UK it's six in the morning on Sunday and we can't decide until Sunday with our time because they have Monday.
But we are working on it.
Believe me, when we started the broadcast, we were thinking about technical flaws and trying to fix them, there were many messages from both sides, and they were not friendly.
We thought about the technical problems and tried to fix them.
But it didn't work out that way, and all the questions were for the government.
He promised that he would never do it again.
This time we increased the number of battles for the fans from five to six and we did not fit in the time - there will always be five battles in the future.
This is a sad situation.
Radio program Desert Island Discs reports that Tom DeLay felt himself to be sexually attracted to a woman.
Olympic champion diver Tom Daley grew up feeling sexually attracted to himself, but this was a major strengthening for him to win.
"I didn't realize that all people are not like me until I went to middle school", said the 24-year-old.
In an interview with Lauren Lavern, host of Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, he spoke out in support of gay rights to give others hope.
He also said that he was less concerned about winning the Olympic Games as he was the head of the family.
The regular host of the multi-year show, Christie Young, took a few months off due to illness.
"In Laverne's first broadcast, she felt inferior to the others, because it was unacceptable to be attracted to both boys and girls at the same time", said Daley.
Her words: "Until that day, I kept feeling inferior and second to others, and that gave me the strength and energy to succeed".
She stated that she wanted to prove herself as a person so that people would not change their attitude towards her by knowing her sexual orientation.
At this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia, the two-time bronze medalist and member of the LGBTI campaign called on other countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He explained the reason for his courage by his ability to live openly and to bring shame to others.
I fell in love with American director Dustin Lenz Black, whom I met in 2013, when I was just a kid", the three-time world champion said.
She married a man 20 years her senior last year, and she says the age gap was never a problem for her.
She went to her first Olympics at the age of 14 and three years later her father died of cancer - "It's hard to find someone who has had a rise and fall at the same age and has experienced so much despite being young", she said.
In June, Robert Ray apologized to Black-Daley: "My whole worldview has changed", said Dealey.
"If you asked me last year, I would have said that I should have won the gold medal", he said.
There are things in the world that are more important than Olympic gold medals.
I have a gold medal from the Olympics - Robbie.
His son, Roberta, is named after his grandfather, who died of a brain tumor in 2011 at the age of 40.
"My mother couldn't come to terms with her death and one of the questions she asked was about the availability of tickets for the London 2012 Olympics, because she wanted to sit in the front row", said Dailey.
"I couldn't say that you couldn't sit in the first row, Dad", he said.
"I held his hand until it was dry and when he stopped taking it, I thought he was a gentle man", she said.
In her second year, Daley won a bronze medal at the 2012 Olympic Games.
"I knew that diving in front of my homeland at the Olympic Games was my lifelong dream", he said.
She was also inspired by Heather Smalls song Proud, which inspired her during her Olympic preparations and still haunts her body to this day.

Mikelson ' s Ryder Cup game is very slow
On Sunday, the American Phil Mikelso will break his own record in the 47th Ryder Cup match, but he needs to get back in shape so that the record is not pitiful.
After two years of competition, the 12th time that Mickelson had competed, he was replaced by captain Jim Furik in Saturday's forehand and forehand games.
The five-time U.S. Open champion, who was often at the center of U.S. events, spent half the day sitting in the fans' stands and the rest of the day working on the game he was worried about on the field.
The 48-year-old was not easy even at the peak of his career, and the uneven, narrow Le Golf National pitch was not very suitable for him and his mistaken strokes gave the player his punishment.
Although the golf course was not threatened in Sunday's game, Mikelson was on his way to winning all four of the week's games, and the new player, Tommy Fleetwood, was paired with the veteran British Open champion, Francesco Momenari.
If the Americans, who are now four points behind in 12 consecutive games, get a hot start, the game could be tense for Mickelson.
Furich confided in his companion, which was all he could say about him.
"He understood his role in the game he was playing today, touched my rope and hugged me and said he was ready for the game tomorrow", said Furik.
He is very confident.
He's a member of the Hall of Fame, and he's worked hard on this team before and this week.
I didn't know he had played two matches.
I tried to show myself that we should go as we thought, and that did happen.
He wants to be where everyone else is.
On Sunday, Mickelson broke the record for most Ryder Cup matches by a player, beating Nick Faldo's record.
This may have marked the end of his Ryder Cup career, which never matched his personal best.
Mikelson had 18 wins, 20 losses in 7 innings, but Furik felt that his presence on the team had a different feeling.
"He's a very talkative, hot, picky, he likes to make fun of people and he's a very nice guy in the team", she explained.
I think the young players were encouraged when they played with him last week.
It offers more than just a game.
Thomas Bjorn , captain of the European team , knows that big advantages can be lost
Thomas Björn, captain of the European teams, knew from experience that the last day of the single-elimination Ryder Cup could be a hot one.
In 1997, the first match was won by Valderram, whose team, led by Sev Ballesteros, had a five-point advantage over the Americans, with a minimum margin of 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You always remember the big advantage in the Vaulderram: our advantage was when we lost in Brooklyn and won in Vaulderram, the surplus is gone", Björn said after watching the results of the 5:3 victory on Friday 2018 and the 10:6 of Golf National yesterday.
So history will show me and all of this team that this is not the end.
Tomorrow you will do even better than that.
Go out there and do everything right.
This is not over until you have all the points.
Our goal is to try to win and that's what all the attention is focused on.
I've been focused on the 12 games that we've played and I've said that we know that we have the best players in the world against us.
Of the way players always played on a hard golf course, Bjorn added with great joy: "I would never be ahead of my time.
Tomorrow, there will be a contest with another person.
Tomorrow will be separate races, which is another matter.
When the competition is good, it's nice to be with your partner, but when you're playing alone, you're testing your skills as a golfer.
We have to make the players understand that we have to put all our efforts into tomorrow's game.
Tomorrow we will forget about putting all our strength into the game and will have to put 100 percent into it.
His partner, Jim Furik, is more likely to have his players perform better in singles than in doubles, with Jordan Spit and Justin Tomas, who both scored three-quarters of a point, not counting Bjorn.
On the final day, Furique himself was at the forefront of both of these changes; after he had performed the miracle of Medina in Brooklyn as a representative of the winning team and the European team of the losers.
When 1999 captain Ben Crenshaw assembled his team before the final race, he said: "I know every word that will be spoken", in response to a question.
Tomorrow is our 12th important game and you want to start as fast as Brooklyn and Medina.
This force is put under great pressure in the middle of a tournament when it is moving in one direction.
As you know, we tried to prepare the team in such a way that we could see the miracle tomorrow.
Thomas was given the lead in the attack and was given the ball in the match against Rory McIlroy, with Paul Casey, Dustin Rose, John Ram, Tom Fleetwood and Jan Poulter and other Europeans in the top half of the game.
After his own choice, Björn said: "The reason I go out in this manner with this group of guys is, I think, because they are so attractive to me", he said.
The new German warship was delayed again
According to local media reports, the new German Harbi-Sea Fleet frigate was supposed to be introduced in 2014 to replace the aging Cold War-era warships, but was delayed due to poor systems and rapidly rising costs.
According to the newspaper Die Zeif, the commissioning of the new frigate, which, according to the military industry, will be the same as the Baaden-Württemberg, will be postponed until the first half of 2019.
The ship was supposed to be delivered to the Navy in 2014, but problems with the supply of the products produced hampered the ambitious project.
The four ships of the Baden-Württemberg class, ordered by the Navy in 2007, will replace the older Bremen frigates.
They are reportedly equipped with powerful gun, zeniit and anti-ship missile systems, as well as low radiolocation, optical and infrared surveillance technologies.
Other important features of the new frigates included the need to be sent two years further away from their bases in port for even longer maintenance periods.
However, as Die Zelt points out, the continuing delays indicate that these advanced warships will not only prove powerful among other nations, but will also prove to be outdated by the time of the use of armed force.
Last year, the German Navy officially rejected the commissioning of the defective F125 frigate and returned it to the shipyard of the shipbuilding and repair company Blohm & Voss in Hamburg, the newspapers reported.
This was the first time that the Navy had returned a ship to a shipbuilder.
The reasons for the return of the vessel were not stated, but the German mass media relied on the fact that the ships were useless in the performance of their military duties, pointing out the "defects in the program and the apparatus".
The lack of a supply program was especially important, as the ships of the Baaden-Vюртемberg were to be manned by approximately 120 sailors, only half the number of the personnel on the former Bremen-class frigates.
It was also found that the ship was overweight, which reduced its performance and thus delayed the Navy's future modernization of these ships.
The 7000-tonne "Reinland-Pfalz" ships were twice as heavy as the German ships of the same class used in World War II.
In addition to the lack of equipment, the high cost of the project, including the training of the crew, was a problem.
The price is remarkably high: the initial price of 2.2 billion euros has been increased to 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars).
The problems associated with the new frigates are particularly acute because of recent warnings about the decline of the German naval fleet.
Earlier this year, the parliamentary commissioner for military affairs, Hans-Peters-Bartels, admitted that the Navy had actually run out of ships in reserve for deployment.
The official said that the problem had become more acute over time, as there were no replacements for the old vessels that had gone out of service.
He was disappointed that not a single frigate of the Baaden-Württemberg class had been accepted into the fleet.
National Fund is studying the secret life of the sea cucumbers
The search of the Scottish Highlands for lodges was aimed at finding out how the larks have used the ladshaft in their hunting.
We hope that the data obtained will contribute to the study of the habitats of rare flightless mammals and help nature conservation activities.
The study, conducted by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland, will include the great hornet-eel, the small hornet, the long-eared gray heron, and the devil butterfly, Dabonton, which is found in Interview Gardens in the Wester-Ross district.
Special registrars will be installed in key locations around the hotel to monitor the coastal beavers' behavior throughout the season.
The staff and volunteers of the MSF will also conduct mobile research using portable detectors.
The recording of sounds and analysis of the sounds will help to identify the frequencies and types of the earrings.
A map and report will be made, marking the places of residence, and a survey of the landscape will be made, to create a picture of their life.
Rob Dwyer, a conservation advisor for the SMPF, explains the nature of the study, which is in which area, and how each area is used to its own advantage.
This information will help in managing habitats, processing peat and how the fronds relate to forest conservation and other species.
In Scotland and Great Britain, the population of the frilled rat declined over the last 100 years.
Construction and technological activities threatened them, as they hindered their adaptation to living conditions.
Wind and lighting equipment, such as fly-sticking tape, are hazardous, as are chemically processed building materials and domestic cats.
The larvae are not actually blind.
However, due to their nocturnal hunting habits, the ears are more useful than the eyes when catching prey.
To avoid obstacles on their flight paths, they use sophisticated technical echolocation.
The country is responsible for 270 historic houses, 38 significant gardens and 76000 hectares of land.
Ten trained specialists regularly inspect and monitor the beds.
The organisation has even created the only specialist shore-whale sanctuary in Scotland, with 8 of the 10 species living on the David Topson Estate in the district of Trev.
According to the estate's director, David Thompson, the property is a good place for the sea otters.
"This place, Trev, is good for frogs", he said.
"There are many old houses, many perennial trees, and good living facilities", he said.
However, there are many unknown facts about the lizards, so we must understand what is needed for populations here and elsewhere.
He emphasized the importance of checking the presence of the lizards before serving on the property, as the destruction of a single nest could kill 400 females and young lizards, and the entire local population could be wiped out.
The hills are protected by law, and any damage, destruction, or murder of them is investigated.
The Foundation's activist in Scotland, Elizabeth Ferrell, has called for help to protect the leaf monkeys.
Her words: "We know nothing about the frogs and their life-time population".
Ronaldo denies rape and his lawyers are seeking to sue the German magazine
Kriştianu called the accusation of rape against Ronaldo a "fake news" and said that people were going to become famous because of his name.
His lawyers were going to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel for publishing these false claims.
The Portugal and Juventus forward was accused of raping an American woman named Catherine Majorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
Ronaldo reportedly paid $375,000 to the letter in 2010 to keep him from talking about the incident.
Hours after the publication of the claim, 33-year-old Ronaldu called it "fake news" in an Instagram live in front of 142 million followers.
No, no, no. It was not a good idea.
What they are saying today is false news", said the five-time Golden Ball winner to the camera.
They want to be famous because of me.
This is not unusual.
This is part of my job.
I am happy and I am doing well.
Reuters news agency reported that Ronaldo's lawyers were planning to sue Der Spiegel magazine for making unreliable reports about his personal life.
According to lawyer Christian Schertz, the footballer is seeking compensation for the alleged violation of his personal rights, which is probably the most serious violation of his rights in recent years.
The alleged incident is believed to have occurred in June 2009 at the Palms Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldu and Majorga reportedly returned to his room and filed a lawsuit in the Clark County Courthouse in Nevada, alleging that he had raped Majorga.
According to the girl, after the rape, Ronaldo knelt down in front of her and said: "I'm a 99% nice guy, but I was cheated by 1%".
According to the documents, they had slept together, but it was consensual, Ronaldu claimed.
According to Majorga, she had contacted the police and photographed her injuries in the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement for fear of being publicly humiliated.
The 34-year-old said she now wants to cancel the deal because she is still reeling from the trauma.
After the attack, Ronaldo was one step away from Manchester United to Real Madrid, and this summer he moved to Italian club Juventus for €100 million.
Brexit: Britain will have a lot of regrets over car production
The UK will be "forever sorry" if it loses its global leadership status in car manufacturing, said Gretchen Clark, the post-Brexit minister for business and entrepreneurship.
A BBC report claimed that Toyota's official leadership, which he said would stop at Bernaston, near Derby, if Britain left the EU without a deal, had left the minister baffled.
"We need a deal", said Mr. Clark.
A Japanese car manufacturer has said that a no-deal Brexit would result in job losses due to delays in the negotiations.
The Bernaston plant, which produced about 150,000 cars, exported 90% of the brands Toyota and Avensis to the rest of the European Union over the past year.
"If the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, our factory will cease production", said Martin Cook, the director of Toyota in Bernaston.
British car manufacturers such as Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover have expressed concern about leaving the EU unless they agree on how the car industry should operate.
For example, BMW announced that it would close its mini-factory in Oxford for a month.
The biggest risk facing most car manufacturers is the UK's withdrawal from the EU without an agreement.
The Toyota production line operates at the same time as the spare parts for cars made to order, and the spare parts come from the same European Union every 37 minutes from UK manufacturers.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement by 29 March, there could be border disruptions, which industry officials fear could lead to delays and a shortage of parts.
The company said it would not be able to keep spare parts at the plant for more than a day, so production would be halted.
"The 'Chess plan' drawn up by Theresa May is designed to ensure that future relations with the EU are not subject to such deliberations at the pre-planned borders", Mr. Clark said.
"We want a deal", said Mr. Clark, "a good deal, a deal that is satisfying today, a deal that is beyond the possibilities of the future", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"Not only Toyota, but other manufacturers have also said that we need to continue to work as hard as possible.
He warned that he could not say how long the production would be stopped, but that in the long term, the additional losses would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately lead to the loss of jobs.
Peter Cuvallaris, head of the Unite trade union, had worked at the Bernaston plant for 24 years, and his staff were deeply saddened: "I can tell you from experience that if the jobs were cut, there would be no more jobs".
The government spokesman said that "We have a clear and solid plan for our future relations with the European Union".
The White House believes that the meeting between Trump and Rosenstein may be postponed
The White House's meeting with Donald Trump's deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein, on Sunday may be "postponed for another week" as the fight for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues.
Rosenstein, Robert Müller's special counsel, was leading the investigation into Russian interference in the election; contacts between Trump and Russian aides were related to the president's potential conflict with the justice system.
Rumors circulated for months that Trump would remove the Deputy Attorney General and thereby jeopardize Mueller's independence, and he was in Washington.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had been recording conversations with Trump and discussing the possibilities of the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
On Monday, he traveled to the White House to announce his resignation.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was in New York on Thursday at the UN, was announced.
Trump preferred not to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed to avoid a vote due to Senate Judiciary Committee hearings, in which Brettt Kavanaugh and Christine Blaisi Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual harassment, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into Kavanaugh, so the Senate vote was delayed for yet another extended period.
On Monday, Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, was interviewed by Fox News.
"The date of the meeting with Rosenstein has not been set yet, but it could be this week, and I think that the Supreme Court may postpone it for another week because of other things that are going on", he said.
"Look, I like to keep the press informed".
Some reporters have disputed this claim: Sanders has not held a White House briefing for reporters since September 10.
The host, Chris Wallace, asked why the show had been canceled.
Sanders: "I would not call the lack of briefings a 'snapshot' of the tele reporters' attempts to show themselves, but I don't deny the fact that they did show themselves", Sanders said.
Trump also did not rule out the possibility of more face-to-face meetings between him and the press.
"The president has more question-and-answer sessions than any other president", he said, without saying anything to prove it: "We've looked at those numbers".
Sanders said the briefing would be held as usual, but that if mambo had the will to ask the U.S. president a direct question, it would be better than talking to me.
We're trying to do it, you've seen how we've done it a lot in the past week, and talking to the president of the United States is replacing the press briefing.
Trump has always responded to questions in public meetings, not just at the White House, but also in press conferences in front of high-ranking guests.
There are few solo press conferences.
She explained that she had been very open and unusual in her appearance to reporters in New York this week.
Scottish Health Minister writes to EU staff, Scottish NHS staff about Brexit worries
The Scottish Minister for Health expressed the country's and Scotland's gratitude to EU staff, Scottish health officials and urged them to continue their work after Brexit.
Jean Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent the letter six months before the UK's withdrawal from the EU.
The Scottish Government has undertaken to assume the costs of applying for the status of EU migrant for citizens working in the autonomous public service.
In her letter, Mrs. Friedman wrote: "The UK has been negotiating with the EU for the whole summer and the decision we have been waiting for has been made this autumn.
But the UK has also accelerated work on the possibility of a no-deal exit.
I know this is a very traumatic time for all of us.
That is why I wanted to say that every worker, regardless of his nationality, is a worthy person for us.
Those who work in the EU and beyond have a wealth of experience, improving the work of healthcare workers and providing much-needed support to the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland  is your home and we definitely want you to stay with us.
Christian Abercrombie had to undergo emergency surgery after sustaining a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers football team midfielder Christian Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury during Saturday's game against the Vanderbilt Commodores, ending with a loss of his team's game with a score of 31:27, reported Mike Organ, a sports journalist from Tennessee.
Tennessee's head coach, Staith Rod Reed, said the injury was sustained before the break.
When we came to the coast of Linnea, we were shipwrecked.
Coaches and doctors gave him oxygen before putting him on a stretcher and taking him away for examination.
Tennessee State representative Chris Harris told WSMV that he was released from surgery at the Abercrombie Vanderbilt Medical Center.
"There is no information yet on the nature/size of the injury", added Harris, who said Tennessee is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
A second-year student, Aberkrombi spent his first season in Tennessee after moving from Illinois.
On Saturday, he attempted to catch the ball five times before the game was stopped, resulting in 18 such attempts during the season.
New coat of arms tax on foreign buyers of real estate in the UK
Foreign buyers will be exempt from the additional stamp duty when buying real estate in the UK; according to the new plans of the Tory political party, these funds will go to the homelessness programme.
The move was intended to thwart Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters.
The surcharge will be levied on those who do not pay tax in the UK.
The UK Ministry of Finance expects that it will raise £120 million a year for the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be charged a surcharge on the purchase of real estate in the UK - the money will go to a programme to help the homeless, Theresa May announced today.
This move was seen as a downplaying of Jeremy Corbyn's achievements by promising young voters cheap accommodation and relying on high-income people.
The stamp duty would be collected from individuals and firms in the UK who did not pay the tax, and the surplus money would be used by the government to create a programme of affordable housing products for the homeless.
Additionally, the new heritage tax on the purchase and lease of second homes introduced two years ago is only 3%.
The British Treasury hoped to collect £120 million a year in taxes.
It is estimated that 13% of London's new homes are bought by UK expatriates, and rising prices are preventing others from buying.
Many of the country's wealthier areas, especially the capital, were called "centre-cities" because of their foreign buyers, who spent much of their time outside the country.
The new policy came a week after Boris Johnson called for a new stamp duty to help many young people buy their own homes.
In an attempt to redress the "British property scandal", Mrs May was urged to abandon the quota of cheap property and was accused of buying up land by large construction firms, but not using it, and thus not paying off the royalties.
Mr. Corbin's new housing reforms included paying rent and removing the innocent from housing.
His wish was to empower local self-government bodies to build new houses.
Mrs May: "I said yesterday that I would dedicate my premiership to rebuilding the British dream, to improving the living conditions of the next generation".
This is called housing market development.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, this does not apply to British expatriates who do not live in Britain but have purchased and worked in Britain.
The dream of creating their own home is far from reality for many people, and the problem of sleeping in the open air remains a reality.
"My ultimate goal is to rule Scotland", Jack Ross said.
Jack Ross, the manager of the Sunderland football club, has a lofty goal of one day governing Scotland.
The 42-year-old Scot, who finished third in the Premier League with a three-point gap, was delighted to be working on the rebuilding of the North-East club.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this year after returning to the Scottish Premiership with St Mirren last season.
The following is a list of the current broadcasters for BBC Radio Scotland's Sportsound programme:
"I wanted to play for my country", he said.
As a child, my father and I would always watch Scotland games at Hampden stadium and he always had a crush on me.
But this opportunity will only come if I make great progress in the management of the club.
The managers of Sunderland before Ross included Dick Advocat, David Moyes, Sam Ellardaius, Martin O'Neill, Roy Kean, Gustavo Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
"I've never been afraid to come to a big Scottish football club as a manager after rejecting previous offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town and having such influential people in my life", said future Scottish football manager Alloa Athletic Ross.
Can I get this club back to the Premier League?
"It has a place in the Premier League, with its infrastructure and its possibilities", he said.
"It's a tough task to achieve, but I'll only consider myself a success if I can get the club back there".
Ross spent 15 months as assistant manager at Dumbarton and only 3 years as a coach at the Hearts headquarters during his tenure.
He then helped Alloa to rise from relegation to the third tier and lifted Sent-Mirren from the verge of relegation to the title champion the following season.
"I feel more comfortable than I did during the climb to the top of Klaid, Hartlpu, Folkerk, Sent-Mirren and Gamilton Academical", said Ross.
"It was probably a very trying moment", he recalled, "taking responsibility for the All-Arab.
I was convinced that I was more interested in management than in playing.
It sounds strange, because I was doing all right, doing all right, and I was forgiven.
But the gameplay is complicated.
You have to go through a lot every day.
I still go through stress and pressure, but management makes me feel good.
I always wanted to rule, and now I feel comfortable in my life.
The full version of Jack Ross's speech can be heard on Sunday 30 September from 12 to 13 hours on BBC Scotland's Sportsound show.
The best time to drink beer according to the survey is Saturday at 17:30
The financial difficulties of the British pubs led to a rise in their revenues, but the pressure on the restaurant chains was also strong.
Statistics show that sales in pubs and bars increased by 2.7% in July, while sales in restaurants decreased by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, head of the CGA sales company, said: "The long-term participation of England in the World Cup and the prolonged hot days have led to a pattern of July-June: with a 2.8% increase in discounts in pubs, restaurants suffered the most.
The decline in sales volume of 1.8% in June was only intensified in July.
Other pubs have similar inequities in their revenues to restaurants in their losses.
Food and pubs were also affected by the sun, but not as much as restaurants.
The people wanted only water to drink.
Sales of liquor in pubs and bars increased by 6.6% per month, while food sales increased by only 3%.
Paul Newman, an analyst at the cultural-resort and hotel company RSM, said: "This is a trend that we have seen since April.
When it comes to the external market, weather, social and sporting news are the main conditions.
Despite the difficulty of a 4.8% decrease in sales compared to the previous year, most restaurants have not given up and continue to struggle along with the reduction of expenses.
The long, hot summer was a difficult time for food companies, and time will show that the average weather we experienced in August was breathtaking.
The increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, along with new establishments, amounted to 2.7% in July and showed a gradual market launch of brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker control is a British example of a group of 47 workers collecting and analysing £9 billion in revenues for pubs, bars and restaurants.
One in five children has a secret account on social networks that hides from parents
According to the survey, one in five children, some as young as 11, have accounts on social networks that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 middle school students showed a rise in fake pages on Instagram.
This new development has shown the danger of a proliferation of sexual content.
20% of students were able to show their full accounts to their parents.
One in five children, some as young as 11, has a social media account that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed an increase in fake Instagram pages.
This new development has shown the danger of a proliferation of sexual content.
20% of students were able to show their main accounts to parents, with censorship, a less meaningful and more private account.
A mother read on her 13-year-old daughter's mysterious website that she was calling on others to "rape" her.
According to a survey conducted by the Digital Awareness Research Center and the Private Schools Directors Conference, 40% of students aged 11 to 18 reported having two accounts and half reported having a private account.
Mike Bьюкенen, head of the KD private school, said: "A lot of teenagers are taking up online space and parents and teachers can't find them".
Eilid Doyle will be the voice of the athletes at the Scottish athletics meeting
British athlete, Eilidh Doyle, was elected as an independent director of the Scottish Athletics Council at the annual meeting of the governing body.
The move by Doyle, Scotland's most senior athlete, is an opportunity for sports administrators to use the athlete's experience over the past decade, according to the head of the governing body, Ian Beattie.
"Eilid is highly respected in the athletics organisations in Scotland, Britain and all countries, and we believe that if he is included in the directors' organisation of Scottish athletics, he will be a great asset", said Bittie.
"I want to be the voice of athletes and help lead Scottish sport and contribute", Doyle said.
Her fellow American, four-time Olympic Games champion runner and 1996 Atlanta Games winner in the 200 and 400 meters, was unable to walk after a micro-stroke, and is now a permanent specialist in the Bi-bi-si.
"I had a stroke a month ago", he tweeted.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that time would tell if I would recover or not.
It was a difficult task, but she recovered completely, learned to walk again, and is now able to do physical exercises!
Thank you very much for your words of encouragement.
Facebook voiced ads comparing mammals to cows
The company that manufactures milking equipment also agreed with the public opinion to compare nursing mothers with dairy cows in advertisements.
The technology consumer company Elvie has released a hilarious video called "The World's First Silent Dream", which aims to make life easier for mothers who breastfeed.
In the cow-sheltered barn, four mothers dance to the tune of a song, which has the words: "Yes, I am my own, but you cannot see my cow-shelter", and "If you cannot see it, it is not the cow-snake, but my snake".
He continued: "I'll feed the children, I'll feed the children, I'll take care of my wives".
However, the ad, which was published on the company's Facebook page, caused controversy on the network.
The video, which has garnered over 77000 views and hundreds of comments, has sparked a sense of disunity among viewers, many of whom have expressed disapproval of the dairy industry's "horrors".
It's a very unfortunate situation for a user to advertise in this manual".
 They need to get pregnant and give birth to have milk like us, only the difference is that they are stolen after they give birth.
The name Elvie/Mother, which means "Mother", was inscribed on the bustgaalter to make the milk sucker unrecognizable.
Another said: 'It is obvious that this is a wound for both mother and child.'
 Well, what's wrong with using them in advertising?
Another added: "It's an advertisement that's far from the truth".
Others supported the advertisement, but one woman - a singer - seemed happy for it.
I think it's a great idea.
If I were rich, I would buy such a vacuum cleaner.
Milking made me feel like a cow.
The ad was a bit fanciful, but I took it as it was.
"This is a brilliant king", one wrote.
Second comment: This is a joke about mothers who breastfeed in the bathroom or at work and feel they are safe.
This is not an advertisement that praises or denounces the dairy industry .
At the end of the song, the women dance with milk-popping in their folded drawer-bustlers.
The campaign's concept is based on the fact that most women feel like cows because of their breasts.
However, the Elvie device is silent, wireless and tubeless, inserted into the breast-feeding breast-galleries invisibly and allows the woman to go out while she is carrying the babies.
Director and partner of the advertising agency Mother, Anaerin Bala, said: "Elvie is a revolutionary product, and it is bold and tempting.

Hundreds of migrant children quietly settled in tent camps on the border with Tehran
The number of migrant children detained has increased sharply, but the number of border crossings has not changed in a month, due to the Trump administration's announcement and measures to ensure that adopters can take the children back with difficulty.
Most adoptees are former illegal immigrants themselves, so those who claim rights to children put themselves at risk of not staying in the country.
The federal authorities threatened to take fingerprints of potential sponsors and other family members in June, when it was announced that they would be sent to immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Alben, a high-ranking immigration and customs official, arrested people who petitioned the agency before Congress to take custody of children who were not eligible for the agency's care.
The agency later found that 70% of those arrested had not been convicted.
Up to 80% of people, including the sponsor and the sponsor's family, are living in the country illegally and most are foreign nationals.
That's why we are persecuting these people", said Mr. Albenz.
In order to process the children faster, the authorities introduced new rules, some of which, according to the workers of the shelter, require the child to appear in court not 60 days, but within one month after the arrest.
The immigration court may not be able to defend their legal status in person, but rather via videoconference.
Those who refused to help would be immediately expelled from the country.
According to the staff of the asylum, the prolonged detention of children who arrived in the last month of the year increased the risk of children becoming restless, absentminded, and violent.
The lawyers said that this danger was more common in large institutions such as Tornilio, because the large area of the camp was a concern for children.
If you move children without their emotional preparation, you will harm their psyche, especially if you do not say goodbye to their friends", they added.
Syria calls for immediate withdrawal of US, French and Turkish forces
Despite eight years of war in the country, the UN General Assembly's foreign minister Walid al-Mughallim urged Syrian refugees to return home.
Deputy Prime Minister Mougallim said that foreign troops illegally in Syria under the pretext of fighting terrorism will be dealt with.
"They must leave the country without any conditions", he told the assembly.
The Syrian civil war, which killed 360,000 people and forced millions from their homes in 2011, is over, he said.
He, Damascus, continues this holy war, liberating the territory of Syria from the terrorists and illegal aliens, - said Mughallim.
The United States also maintains, trains, and advises some 2,000 Syrian armed forces; in general, the U.S. has been pushing both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs against President Bashar al-Assad.
The armed forces of the war-torn country, numbering over 1,000, were subjugated by France.
"The conditions are good for refugees to return", Mugalim said, accusing "some Western countries" of spreading "irrational fear" that encourages refugees to stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to help facilitate their return", he said.
"They are politicizing what should have been a humanitarian issue".
The United States and the European Union have warned that "no support for Syria's reconstruction will be provided without a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war".
United Nations diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the creation of a buffer zone in the latest Idlib uprising has created an opportunity for political negotiations to resume.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale Russian-backed Syrian offensive against the province, which had a population of three million.
However, Mugalim noted that the terms of the agreement were clear; he hoped that the fighting would be stopped by the jihadists, including the Nusra Front, which was allied with al-Qaeda.
United Nations representative Staffan de Mistura hoped to draft a post-war Syrian constitution soon and to organize the first meetings of a new committee of government and opposition representatives that would pave the way for elections.
Mougallim stated that the work of the committee should be limited to the provisions of the current constitutional articles, and added to the appendix the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to this logic, Trump would win the 2020 presidential re-election, unless impeachment or a scandal prematurely ends his term, as most liberal viewers had hoped.
It was without a doubt the most dramatic presidential final in history!

Since 2014, prime-time ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million viewers on CNN, and tripled to 1.6 million viewers on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News had 1.7 million viewers four years ago, and now has 2.4 million viewers during prime-time. MSNBC's evening news show, The Rachel Maddow Show, is the No. 1 cable channel with 3.5 million viewers.
"These people are a fire, we don't understand it", said Neil Baer, showrunner of ABC's "The Last Candidate", a drama about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after the Capitol is attacked.

He recalled a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver informed him that he had chosen Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
"Because it is interesting", replied the driver, as Mrs. Showell had said.

Foreign currency enters the most intense midterm election contest
Pennsylvania's 17th district saw a surge in funding due to the grouping of congressional districts and therefore two presidents competing for the same seat.
The newly redesigned suburb of Pittsburgh is home to Democrat Rep. Conor Lamb, who won the seat in last spring's election.
Currently, Lamb is running against the representative of the old District 12, similar to the new District 17 of Pennsylvania, another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfuss.
The maps were removed in January after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that the old regions had been unconstitutionally changed in favor of the Republicans.
The contest for the new 17th district involved a funding battle between the main financial parties, the Congressional Democratic Election Committee and the National Republican Election Committee.
Lamb's name became well known after winning a special election for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district in March.
The seat has been held by a Republican for more than a decade, with President Donald Trump winning the region by 20 points.
Political experts have given preference to the Democrats.
The U.S. fined El Salvador for helping China, but later withdrew
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama recognized Beijing, while Washington resisted.
In June 2017, Trump met with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela and stayed at a Panama hotel for a short time before the partners transferred Trump's organization to his leadership.
"In response to the recent decision not to recognize Taiwan, State Department officials have decided to recall representatives of American diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama", Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said earlier this month.
Perhaps the fines were at the expense of El Salvador: El Salvador received about $140 million in American aid in 2017, including for drug testing, development and economic assistance.
The proposed penalties, which included a reduction in financial support and a targeted visa restriction, would be too severe for Central America and its very high unemployment and murder rates.
During the internal meetings, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level meeting dedicated to security and economic growth to continue the previous year's meeting that discussed the possibility of reducing the number of migrants coming to the United States.
However, in mid-September, officials of the top administration indicated their willingness to continue the conference, thus ending the investigation into the imposition of fines for Salvador.
Diplomats said Vice President Mike Pence was reluctant to speak at the mid-October conference to show the administration's importance.
Three American delegates then left for El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic, without any bad news from Washington and without being punished for their actions.
A White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to provide further details of the debate, while three American officials, including two diplomats, agreed to discuss the internal debate anonymously.
Their statements were corroborated by an analyst close to the administration who remained anonymous.
Reading of history
Another possible subterfuge is the report of lawyer Robert Mueller on Mr. Trump's obstruction of justice, for which there is now ample evidence in the Society's documents.
Müller is also reportedly investigating whether the Trump campaign is allied with Russia in attacking our elections.
If Congress changes its mind, Trump will be held accountable in that body, as if he were preparing to meet with voters, and eventually before a jury of his peers.
I'm not saying that Mr. Trump's defeat will be inevitable, and that his European counterparts will be defeated.
We are going to have to make choices that will affect the timing of the battle on both sides of the Atlantic.
In 1938, German officers were ready to overthrow him if the West supported the Czechoslovaks by resisting Hitler.
We lost and missed the opportunity to avoid the terrible massacre that followed for years.
History repeats the same pattern: The endless march of democracy is accelerating or slowing.
Americans today are facing such turbulence.
What will we do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the head of the Mueller investigation?
The newspaper reported that Rozenštejn had trouble with himself after he offered to secretly record the president last year and suggested that he was unfit for office.
The Times report is wrong", said Rozenstein.
"If the Brett Kavanaugh investigation requested by the new Federal Bureau of Investigation is incomplete or flawed, or if it is upheld by the Supreme Court despite rape and perjury, how do we respond?
And first of all, in the midterm elections, are we voting for a Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we fail this test, democracy will have a long winter.
But I believe that we will win, because I learned the lesson of Prague.
My mother, a Jewish woman from Czechoslovakia, was deported to Auschwitz by the Nazi regime that had conquered my ancestral home.
She survived, moved to America, and 60 years later on Shabbat, she sent me to light a candle on a table with a symbol of the swastika.
With such a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrance of the Rangers is looking forward to a match against the Viennese Rapids
Earlier this month, the Rangers had finished with a goalless draw against Villarreal in Spain, and now, as they prepare to face the Vienna Rapids on Thursday, their chances of getting into Group G of the Europa League are very high if they beat the Austrians.
Midfielder Graham Dorrans was prevented from making his first appearance by a knee injury, so we only saw him in a 2-2 draw against Villarreal, but he is confident that the Raidgens will take advantage of that success to achieve even greater success.
"It's a good result for us, because Villarreal is a strong team", said the 31-year-old.
"We started the game with the idea of creating something, and we came out with a point.
We could probably create a multiple, but the last limit is the base and the result might be fair.
They were stronger in the first half, and we showed ourselves better in the second half.
April is another major European holiday.
I am sure that we will get three points, but it will be a very difficult game, because our opponents have won the last game, but I am sure that we will win with the people who support us.
When I think about my injuries and the changes that have happened at the club, the past year has been really difficult, but I feel good about where I am now.
The team is in good spirits, they play with heart, they train.
I hope we can continue with the success we had last season".
Women lose sleep over pension savings
Despite the fact that the respondents were aware of the care they received, few spoke about it with family members.
Half of the participants in the Nationwide scientific study said they had discussed the cost of long-term care with their spouse.
Only about 10 percent of children talk about it.
"People want to be seen by family members, but they don't do anything to talk about it", said Holly Snyder, vice president of the life insurance division of Nationwide.
So that's a good place to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to care for you without expressing your wishes.
Work to discuss with your counselor and family members where and how to get help, as this may be an important factor in determining the cost.
Call your financial advisor: Your advisor can help you find ways to pay for these expenses.
The options for long-term care financing include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid insurance policy to cover that cost, or a self-funded voluntary insurance policy (if you have the money).
Prepare legal documents; avoid court battles; and avoid getting into trouble with the authorities.
Get a health insurance policy so that you can identify a trusted health care provider who can meet your needs if you are unable to communicate.
Make sure that you have a trust agreement with the lender.
You will choose a trusted person to make financial arrangements for you and to pay your bills if you are incapacitated.
Don't forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent needs urgent medical attention and has to go to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medications and allergies?
Put these details into a written plan to be ready.
"It's not just about financials, it's about what doctors are like", Martin asked.
"What medications?
Who will look after the dog?
Make a plan to do so.
Man fired several shots from a pneumatic rifle in Ilfracombe
One man was shot several times with a pneumatic rifle as he walked home in the evening.
The 40-year-old victim, Ilfracomb, received a gunshot wound to the chest, abdomen and hand while in the vicinity of Oxford Grove, Devon.
Officers described the shooting, which occurred at approximately 02:30 BST, as "suspicious".
The victim did not see the shooter.
His injuries were not life-threatening, and police asked for help from witnesses.
Indonesian earthquakes and tsunami
At least 384 people were killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palou on Friday, officials said, and the death toll was expected to rise.
Due to the disruption, rescue workers were unable to obtain any information from the Donggala district, north of Pallu, the area closest to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated in Palu after the disaster.
Some key facts about Palou and Dongola, located in Sulawesi, are:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, located in a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi island, with a population of 379 800 as of 2017.
The city was hit by an earthquake and tsunami when it celebrated its 40th anniversary.
Dongala is a district stretching more than 300 km (180 mi) along the coast to the northwest of Sulawesi.
As of 2017, the administrative district, which is under the province of the same name, has a population of 299,200.
Fishing and agriculture are the mainstays of the economy of Central Sulawesi province, especially the coastal region of the Donegal.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but it is mainly concentrated in Morogalo, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
The Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency reports that the islands of Palou and Dongala have been hit by several tsunamis in the last 100 years.
The 1938 tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed more than 100 houses.
In 1996, a tsunami struck the western part of the Donggala, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the seismic Pacific Ring and earthquakes are frequent.
Strong earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A powerful earthquake on December 26 caused a tsunami along the western coast of Indonesia's Aceh province, north of Sumatra, killing 226,000 people in 14 countries along the Indian Ocean - more than half of them Aceh residents.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes occurred off the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck the southernmost island of Indonesia, Java, causing a tsunami that killed about 700 people on the southern coast.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake occurred near Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people lost their lives.
2010: An earthquake of magnitude 7.5 on the island of Mentawai near Sumatra caused a 10-meter-long tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and took about 300 people.
2016: A small earthquake in the Pididjaja district of Aceh caused devastation and panic as people remembered the terrible consequences of the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time, there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died in the destroyed buildings.
2018: A powerful earthquake hits the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists in difficulty.
Sarah Palin's eldest son is a prisoner for domestic violence
Trek Palin, the eldest son of Alaska Governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was the prisoner implicated in the attack.
According to a report by the Alaska State Police released Saturday, 29-year-old Palin of Wasilla, Alaska, is suspected of domestic violence, obstruction of a report of domestic violence, and resisting arrest.
According to a police report, when the woman tried to call the police about the crimes, he confiscated her phone.
Peylin was holding $500 in unclaimed bond at the Mat-Su detention center, reported KTUU.
He appeared in court on Saturday, and when asked to confess to the charges, he said "I'm not guilty".
Payn is facing three Class A misdemeanors, which means he could face up to one year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He was also convicted of a Class B felony, punishable by one day in jail and a fine of $2,000.
This was not the first time that a criminal case was brought against Peylin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported the attack.
The case is currently pending before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with assault on a family, obstruction of a domestic violence report, and possession of a rifle while intoxicated.
His girlfriend said that he had punched her in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by a veteran group for linking her son's post-traumatic stress disorder to his aggressive behavior due to service in Iraq.
Hundreds of dead from earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in an earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The magnitude 7.5 earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed more than a thousand homes.
Electricity and communication networks are down, and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck near Central Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
Videos showing the impact of the season are circulating on social networks.
When the tsunami hit, hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palú.
Federal prosecutors seek the death penalty for suspected New York terrorist
The New York federal prosecutor's office is seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Sayipov, a suspect in the murder of eight people in New York City - a rare punishment that has not been used in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, used a Home Depot-leased car to attack a bicycle path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, hitting pedestrians and a cyclist.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov "knew" killed eight victims and "knew" caused significant bodily harm, according to the intent to seek the death penalty issued in the Southern District of New York.
According to the court document, the death penalty is possible in both of these points.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Saipova on 22 counts, including eight counts of murder, assault, and destruction of a vehicle in aid of a racketeer, which is typically used by the prosecutor in a federal organized crime case.
The prosecutor's office said the attack required "excessive planning and lack of willpower". Saipov called it "a brutal, brutal and immoral act".
"Saifullo Habibullayevich Saipov suffered injuries, damage and damage to Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Clivus, Ann-Lor Decade, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlidge, Ernan Ferrucci, Ernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian, who were injured in the attack".
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
Ten years have passed since the last execution in New York's South District.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was charged with the murder of two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last execution in a federal New York case was in 1953 for the family of Julius and Ethel Rosenbergs; they had been executed two years earlier during the Cold War on charges of spying for the Soviet Union.
Both Rosenbergs were executed by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Uzbek-born Saipov showed no remorse in the days and months following the attack.
Police said he told investigators he felt good about what he had done.
In the indictment, Saipov told the leaders that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
Police said he also asked to have the ISIS flag hoisted in his hospital room.
He pleaded not guilty to the 22 counts.
Saipov's defender, David Patton, one of the federal public defenders, said he "clearly lost hope" with the prosecutor's decision.
"We think that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of a life sentence without the possibility of parole will be very difficult for the participants in these events", said Patton.
The defense team of Saipov asked the prosecutor's office not to request the death penalty.
Tory MP believes that Brexit talks should be left to Najdel Faraj
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the people's army" during a protest at the Tory conference today.
The former Ukip leader said politicians should "feel the heat" from Eurosceptics - because one of Theresa May's MPs has suggested she talk to the European Union.
Conservative MP Peter Bon said in a march in Birmingham that Britain would stay out of the Brexit if Mr. Faraj was Brexit Secretary.
But the problem of reconciling Mrs May's deeply divided Tory supporters has been compounded by a separate anti-Brexit protest in the city.
The Prime Minister has been fighting for the implementation of the Chequers compromise plan amidst attacks from pro-Brexit, anti-Brexit and EU supporters.
The Allies said that despite the rejection, he would try to negotiate a deal with Brussels, forcing the Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between his package and "chaos".
Mr. Boun said in Solihull that "Leaving means leaving", and told the participants of the rally that he wanted to "leave Czechoslovakia".
He said that it was necessary to equalize the Farage and to negotiate with Brussels.
"If he was responsible, we would have gone", he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: "I will support Brexit, but we need to get rid of Chequers".
Expressing his opposition to the EU, he said: "We have not fought the world wars for submission.
We want to make our own laws in our country. "
Bown rejected suggestions that public opinion had changed after the 2016 vote: "It is not true that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay.
Tory Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkins also told reporters at the march: "I'll say this: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The Chechens are not popular with the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for them, they are not popular with our party and activists, they are really roaming the streets and seeking our election first.
Please, drop the Chechers and start listening.
In his address to May, he added: "The prime ministers continue to work on the fulfilment of their promises".
According to Faraj, if the protesting politicians want to betray the decision of the 2016 referendum, they should work to "feel good".
"Now we are talking about trust between the people and our political classes", he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and today we're going to tell them, 'We're not going to let you do that.'"
Addressing the enthusiastic public, he added: "I want you to feel the warmth of our political class, who are about to betray Brexit.
"We are mobilizing the people's army of this country that won Brexit, and we will not rest until we have an independent, sovereign and proud Britain".
Meanwhile, the opposition parties passed through Birmingham, after which they held a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A small group of activists seized the "Tory anti-Brexit" banners as soon as the group began operating this week.
Labour's Lord Adonis ridiculed the Conservatives for the security problems they faced with the party's annex at the opening of the conference.
"These people tell us about the deployment of IT systems, that the technology in Canada can be for unlimited, free trade, that the rest of the technology in Ireland can be for unlimited, free trade", he added.
This is just a farce.
There is no good Brexit", he added.
Warrens to consider presidential candidacy
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said after the November election that she was "considering her candidacy for president".
The Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke on Saturday about his future as mayor of West Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November in Massachusetts against Republican Rep. Jeff Deal, who is chairing Trump's 2016 campaign.
He was at the center of rumors that he could fight Trump in 2020.
Trump met with city voters for the 36th time since he entered the city hall on Saturday afternoon.
The participant asked him if he was considering running for president.
Warren replied, "It's time for women in Washington to fix our broken government, including the women upstairs".
Sims's killer is caught
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, reported that a suspect in the murder of Louisiana State University basketball player Wade Sims was arrested on Saturday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dayton Simpson at a press conference held at 11 a.m.
On Friday, they posted a video of the shooting, asking for help identifying the person in the video.
Simms, 20, was shot Friday morning outside the campus of Southern University.
"Wade Sims was shot in the head and eventually died", police chief Murphy J. Paul told reporters Saturday.
When Wade left to protect his friend, Simpson shot him.
Simpson was questioned, and admitted that he had a gun and shot W. Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and detained by the East Baton Rouge Police Department.
The 198-inch-tall junior, who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games last season, starting 10, and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds.
Russian Grand Prix: Team division helps L. Hamilton win the world title by defeating Sebastian Fettel
When Mercedes team boss Valtteri Bottas was ordered to move Lewis Hamilton forward in Saturday's race, he revealed that such a split would play a big role in the race.
Bottas made a good start from the pole and defended his position in the first two turns and, seeing his teammate's support, attacked Fettel to keep Hamilton off the field.
Fettle had entered the boxing ring, and Hamilton would have been in the tail of the stream, and that would have been the decisive moment.
Mercedes passed the first lap and Fettel came out behind, but Hamilton, after a little wheel to wheel, came out ahead: thus the Ferrari driver, with double speed, was able to get out of the way without risking to defend himself in the third lap.
Max Ferstpen finished seventh at the end of the first round, starting from the last row of the grid on his 21st birthday.
He then quickly reached the finish and held the tyres for most of the race to take fourth place from Kimi Raikkonen.
He finally got into the box on lap 44, but was unable to increase his speed for the remaining eight laps as Raykkonen finished fourth.
It was a difficult day, because Valtteri had done a fantastic job over the weekend and helped me to turn ahead like a true gentleman.
The team did a great job to get first and second place, said Hamilton.
That was really bad body language .
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Дайэнн Файнстайн at a rally on Saturday after she asked him not to leave a letter from Christine Blaysey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of rape.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly appeal to Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead explained that what had happened in the Senate was "evil, vicious, and deceitful" by the people.
"The only thing that could happen and the remarkable thing that has happened in the Senate in recent days is that people have shown themselves to be evil, vicious and deceitful", he said.
Judging by the releases and the leaked information, they say, "Oh, I didn't do it".
I didn't do that.
Do You Recall?
Daienne Feinstein, have you been distributed?
Remember the answer... Did you disclose the classified information? - YES, what?
I was like, "Oh, no.
I'm not.
You'll have to wait a while.
We were... No, we weren't", he added, as the senator noticed.
A letter detailing the charges against Ford Kavanaugh had been sent to Feinstein, and it was circulated in September, but Feinstein denied leaving his office.
"I did not disseminate the allegations of Dr. Ford", Feinstein told the committee, according to Z. Hill.
He asked me to keep it confidential and I did.
But the president didn't like her rejection, and he commented during a Saturday night rally: "I'll tell you what, that was really bad body language.
Maybe he wasn't, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen.
By continuing to support a Supreme Court nominee who had been accused of having affairs with three women, the president believed that Democrats had exploited these accusations to their advantage.
They need to restore power by various means.
You see, no matter how evil they are, how evil, who they hurt, who they hurt, they just need to get power and control".
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5: 3 Belfast Dжайants , which is the highest league in the English football league system
Patrick Duayer scored two goals in a match against Dundee.
The Dundee Stars recovered their defeat against the Belfast Giants in the Elite League on Friday with a 5-3 win in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants took the lead with two goals to spare thanks to Patrick Duayer and his shots.
Before Dwyer took the lead of the Giants, Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney were already in the home stretch.
Two goals from Lucas Lundvaald Nilsen ensured their victory, before Francois Bouchard evened the score in favour of Dandi.
Adam Keefe's men suffered three defeats in the Elite League before defeating Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
This was the fourth meeting of the teams this season, the Giants having won three times.
With a 3:35 pass from Kendal McFol, a goal from David Rutherford gave Duayer his first goal in the fourth minute, and two minutes later, Boiville doubled the lead.
During a strong opening, Sullivan entered the game at 13:10 with the home side, and passed to tie Matt Mark Cooney at 15:16.
The first break of the Jays was the first to be revealed when Duayer scored the second goal late in the first period.
The owners regrouped and Bushar tied the score at 27:37, again being the majority team.
In the second period, Cooney and Charles Corcoran teamed up to help Nielsen push Dundee to the lead, which led to a five-point win for his team in the final period.
The Giants, who had lost four of their last five games, played their next game on Friday at home against Milton Keynes.
Air traffic controller sacrificed himself to save more than 100 people
An Indonesian air traffic controller was given the title of hero for safely lifting an airplane with hundreds of people on board.
More than 800 people were killed and many were missing on the island of Sulawesi on Friday due to a tsunami triggered by an earthquake.
Strong aftershocks continued in the area, and many people were unable to escape the rubble in the city of Palou.
But despite saving the lives of his fellow officers, 21-year-old António Gunavan refused to leave the heavily guarded dispatcher's station at Agun Palu's Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport.
He was on the runway at the time and saw that Batik Air flight 6321 had made a safe flight.
He jumped from the dispatcher's window, sensing that it was breaking down.
He later died in hospital.
Indonesian Air Navigation spokesman Johannes Sirait said the move could save hundreds of lives, Australia's ABC News reported.
We had arranged a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Sadly, he died before the helicopter arrived in Palo this morning.
"We were heartbroken to hear about this", she added.
At the same time, the government fears that the death toll could reach thousands, as the country's disaster mitigation agency reported that access to the cities of Donga, Sigi and Butung was restricted.
"The number of deaths continues to rise, as most of the bodies remain under the rubble, many of them are inaccessible", said the agency's representative, Suoto Purvo Nugroho.
Waves of up to six meters have destroyed the Palou, which will be the site of a funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft brought relief supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Emergency services are bringing in bodies every minute.
There is a shortage of clean water.
Miniature markets are wrapped.
Djan Geльфанд, head of the Indonesian International Red Cross, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross has rushed to help the survivors, but we don't know what they will find there.
It's a tragedy, but it could be worse".
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palua on Sunday and told his military compatriots: "I ask you to work day and night to fulfill all the tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready? Reported by CNN
Earlier this year, an earthquake in Lombok, Indonesia, killed more than 550 people.
Micronesian air disaster: One person reported missing after plane crash in Laguna, according to Air Niugini
An airline on a flight that crashed in the Pacific Ocean lagoon in Micronesia said that one person had gone missing after 47 passengers and crew were reported to have been successfully evacuated from the plane, which had all sunk.
According to Air Niugini, the airline was unable to locate a male passenger on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with the local government, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to a request for more information about the age or nationality of the passenger.
After the plane landed in the water on the way to the airport on Truk Island, local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew.
Officials said that seven people were taken to hospital on Friday.
The airline said that six passengers remained in hospital on Saturday, and all were in stable condition.
The cause of the disaster and the true sequence of events remain unclear.
The airline and the US Navy said the plane had landed in a lagoon near the runway.
Some witnesses believe the plane had flown off the edge of the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes reported that the plane was too low.
"That's very good", said Jaines.
Jane's said that the water was waist-high, and he and others were able to get out to the emergency exits of the submerged plane.
She described the panic and screams of the flight crew and the slight head injury she suffered.
The U.S. Navy stated that the seamen working nearby for sea improvement also assisted in the rescue, to bring the people to shore before the aircraft sank at a depth of 30 meters (100 ft).
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in airline accidents recorded in the PNG in the past two decades, but none of them were connected to Air Niugini.
Analyst shows the chronology of the night the woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecutor's office based a retrial on a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as an expert witness in the intelligence analysis.
He told jurors how the 29-year-old suspect Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers used cell phone tapes to piece together their movements on the night of the murder.
Rowlett said that he had used several cell phones to confirm that Chambers had been with Tallis on the night of his death - a claim that contradicts his earlier claims, The Clarion Ledger reported.
The data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers, but a friend of Tellis' said it was with Michael Sanford; the police decided to speak with Sanford.
Sanford stated that he was out of town on Saturday, but that he had been scheduled to speak on Saturday.
When prosecutors asked whether Tallis was in Sanford's car, Sanford said, "He's lying, because my car was in Nashville that night".
Another discrepancy was that Tellis said she had known Chambers for about two weeks when he died.
Cell phone records show that they had known each other for only a week.
Rowlett said that some time after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted all of Chambers' messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He erased her from his life", said Hale.
The defense is scheduled to begin its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said that he expected the jury to sit the same day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
The hip-hop trio wanted to counter the negative attitude of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
Bristol's band The High Breed has said that hip-hop is moving away from the origin of political messages and listening to social problems.
They wanted to go back to basics and popularize conscious hip-hop.
Due to the presence of artists such as Akala and Loukie, artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently experienced a renaissance in the UK.
Another black man?!
New York babysitter sues family for taking her off work for writing racist text
A New York babysitter who had been fired for discrimination had accidentally received a text message from a family member, which read: "Another black person".
The family rejected the racist position, comparing the trial to a "sweeping".
When mother of two, Lynsey Placo-Flaxman, discovered that her new babysitter, Jizeel Morris, was black, she was devastated when she arrived at her first day of work in 2016.
"I'm going to be a black man tomorrow", wrote Linsey to her husband, Placo Flaxman.
But instead of sending the text to her husband, she sent it to Morris twice.
Realizing his indifference, "uncomfortable" Placo-Flaxman fired Morris because their departed African-American worker had done poorly and instead they waited for their Filipino wife, according to the New York Post.
Morris was paid for one day's work and sent home with Uber.
Morris is now suing his family for firing him and, although he is without a contract, is seeking $350 a day in compensation for the six months he was originally hired to live.
"I'm going to tell them that it doesn't work like that", he told the Post on Friday, adding, "It's discrimination".
The family responded that they were racist, that it was the right thing to fire Morris, because they feared that they would not be able to trust him after hurting him.
My wife sent him something he didn't want to tell him.
He is not a racist.
We are not racists, "her husband, Joel, told Post.
Would you give your child to such a person, even if you were the only one?
A newborn child?
You see?"
Comparing the trial to "a trial", Placo said that his wife was only two months pregnant and was "in a very difficult situation".
Would you follow such a man?
It's not a good thing to do", the investment banker added.
The case is still ongoing, with the public court quickly condemning the couple via social media, criticizing them for their behavior and logic.
Paddington publishers say they will not accept the new letter readers have discussed
Karen Jankel, a Bond girl born after the book's acceptance, wrote: "It is difficult to put yourself in the shoes of someone reading this book for the first time before it is published.
It's interesting to hear about the great success of Paddington now".
She worked as a BBC operator before her father's little teddy bear inspired her to write a children's book, and was optimistic about her job being rejected, saying it was "a sad day" that the book had been published 60 years ago, as she had sent her father on his last journey last year.
She called Paddington "a very important member of our family", and her father added that he was quietly proud of his success.
"He was a very quiet man, he was not a boastful man", he said.
Maybe Paddington was real to him, like a successful child: you're proud, but you're not part of it.
I think that's how he felt about Paddington's success.
Although it was his creation and his dream, he gave Paddington his due".
My daughter was dying, and I was supposed to say goodbye over the phone.
After landing, her daughter was taken to the hospital where doctors tried desperately to save her life.
"Ned was getting calls saying that he was in a very bad way and they couldn't help him", said Ednan-Lapperuz.
"Then Ned called me, saying he was going to die in the next two minutes, and I was going to say goodbye to him.
And I said goodbye.
I said: Tashi, my daughter, I love you very much.
See you soon.
I will be with you.
The medication prescribed by doctors to keep the heart working gradually stopped and left the body.
He died soon after, and everything stopped.
I should have just sat and waited, knowing that this event was going to happen.
I could not cry, shout, or even yell, because I was surrounded by family and people.
I really shouldn't have been fucking.
At the last moment, Mrs. Ednan-Lapperuse, grieving for the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with all the passengers, forgetting the ordeals of the past.
"No one knows", he said.
I kept my head down, and tears came to my eyes.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight I felt compassion for Neddka.
She said that she needed my love and understanding.
I knew that he loved my daughter very much.
Posters for bereaved women in print to prevent suicide
Two women who lost loved ones to suicide try to help others avoid suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphries placed postcards with inspirational messages and phone numbers on the Welsh Bridge to call for help.
Davis' son Tyler suffered from depression at the age of 13 and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want my parents to feel like I do every day", she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, of Lidney, told me with a warm smile that her son was a hopeful cook.
Everyone knew her by her smile.
Everyone said that her smile lit up the room".
Yet, just before his death, he left his job, for he was "in a dark place, in the shadow of death".
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old brother was found dead after his brother committed suicide.
Davis says: "I cry every day that this will leave some strong impression".
Although Davis was friendly with people, he made postcards to make sure there were people he could talk to.
Don't just sit there and talk".
Mrs. Humphries, who had been friends with Davis for many years, lost her 15-year-old son, Mark, shortly after her mother's death.
He said he was mad at her and she didn't tell him she was dreaming.
A few days before the race, we saw how his attitude had changed.
He was like the most private Christmas present - he didn't even look them in the eye when he opened the children's presents".
His death was a great heartache for them, but they had to overcome it: "This family is a hole.
That's what separates us.
But we all have to keep going and fight".

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance, as the Federal Bureau of Investigation begins its work
"I thought that if we could get what he asked for - a limited, limited investigation - we could make some sort of connection", Flake said Saturday, as he expressed fears that the committee was "divorced" against the background of a entrenched partisan end.
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is due to time.
There are only five weeks left until the November 6 midterm elections - and if, as expected, Republicans behave badly, they will be weakened in their efforts to accept the candidate for the country's highest court.
Kavanaugh worked for George Bush in the White House and through Bush, met his current wife, Ashley, who was Bush's secretary. George Bush had her phone number at the time to call senators, pressing them to help Kavanaugh.
What happens after the FBI reports?
There are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats in the Senate.
It is not yet known whether Kavanaugh will be able to garner at least 50 votes in the Senate chamber, which would allow Vice President Mike Peska to stop the bid and confirm it in the Supreme Court.
North Korean refugees under Kim have increased
The South Korean deputy said that since Kim Jong-un came to power, the number of North Korean refugees arriving in South Korea has decreased.
Citing the data of the Ministry of Southern Integration, Park Byung-seok reported that there were only 1,127 refugees last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Pak said that the main factors were the tightening of border controls between North Korea and China and the rise in tariffs for smugglers.
Pyongyang did not give an explanation to the people.
Most of the North Koreans were eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have defected since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Many of them pass through China, the country with the longest border with North Korea, rather than the well-guarded demilitarized zone between the two Koreas.
China considers refugees to be illegal migrants rather than refugees, and often sends them back forcibly.
The North and South were still at war on one side, but their relations had improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the two leaders stopped in Pyongyang to meet for talks on denuclearization.
This followed a historic meeting between U.S. presidents Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June, during which they agreed to make the Korean Peninsula a nuclear-free zone.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the US sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"Without any trust in the United States, we will have no national security, and we cannot unilaterally disarm in these circumstances", Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Bret Kavanaugh a "hysteric" and declared him unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
House minority leader Nance Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and temperamentally unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't imagine they would have called her hysterical if she had behaved like that", said Pelosi, referring to her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee last Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations that he had raped Dr. Christine B. Ford in her youth.
In his opening speech, Kavano was very emotional, sometimes shouting and agonizing, about his family and school years.
He also repeatedly denounced the Democrats on the committee and called the accusations against him "a horrible and coordinated murder" - organized by liberals who, according to him, were not satisfied with Hillary Clinton's defeat in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi believed that Kavanaugh's testimony showed that he was anti-Democratic, and therefore could not serve on the Supreme Court.
"I think he's disqualified by the way he's targeting the Clintons and the Democrats with messages like that", he said.
He objected to the impeachment of Kavanaugh if Pelosi was confirmed, and when asked if the Democrats would win a majority of the House.
"I say this - if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he shouldn't be in the Supreme Court, not only in the Supreme Court, but in the court that exists now", said Pelosi.
Kavano is currently a judge on the District Court of Appeal for the District of Columbia.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about potential rulings by Kavanaugh against the Affordable Care Act or Roe Wade, as she was considered a conservative judge.
At the confirmation hearings, Kavano did not answer questions about whether he was going to overturn some of the Supreme Court's decisions.
"This is not the time for a hysterical, prejudiced person to go to court and say, 'What's good,'" Pelosi said.
Women and girls should have the same.
This is a fair diatribe, angry months and years, which he cannot take without crying.
"We cry when we are angry", Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I guess it's not that simple, is it?"
She continued: "One woman who worked as a supervisor helped me a lot, she also used to cry when she was angry, but when she got angry and started crying, she used a technique to tell this person, she said: "You might think that I'm also difficult when I cry.
I was angry.
Then he went on.
I think that's great.
As it is not understood, tears are allowed as a source of partial tears.
One of the most memorable memories of my male-dominated office work is that when I once cried with an inexpressible rage, an older woman caught me - a cold manager - I was always a bit nervous - and dragged me into the driveway.
He said to me, "Don't let anyone know that you're here".
They don't know that you're angry.
They will think you are sad and content because they were able to bring you down.
At the time, Democratic Congresswoman Patricia Schroeder of Colorado served with Gary Hart during his presidential campaign.
In 1987, after Mr. Hart had an extramarital affair in a so-called "Monkey Business" and withdrew from the race, Mrs. Schröder, feeling frustrated, decided that there was no reason why she should not run for president.
"I didn't think it through", he told me with a laugh 30 years later.
There were seven candidates in the race, and none were needed.
Some called it "Belosnechka and the Seven Gnomes".
As the campaign was late, she was behind in raising money, and so she vowed not to compete unless she raised $2 million.
It was a losing battle.
He found that some of his supporters who had given the men $1,000 had given him only $250.
"Do they expect to get a discount?" he wondered.
When he announced that he would not be participating in the official campaign, he was overcome by feelings of gratitude to those who had supported him, disillusionment with the system of raising money and attracting voter attention, not delegates, and anger at sexism.
"You'd think my nerves were broken", said Schröder of the press reaction to him.
"You can think of Kleenex as my corporate donation.
What do they plan to put in my grave?
What country?
How the US-China trade war could benefit Beijing
Experts believe that the first steps of the US-China trade war were sound, and although the war is not yet over, the opposition between the two countries may benefit Beijing in the long run.
US President Donald Trump first warned earlier this year of tariffs on China's main exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation came this week with new tariffs affecting $200 billion (150 billion euros) of goods, with half of all goods coming into the US from China effectively taxed.
Beijing has always responded in the same way: it recently increased tariffs by five to ten percent on goods worth $60 billion.
China has pledged to stay with the US, and the world's second largest economy is unlikely to disappear anytime soon.
Restricting Washington would mean giving in to demands, but it would be uncomfortable for Chinese President Xi Jinping to publicly worship the United States.
But if Beijing can play its cards right, the pressure of the U.S. trade war could provide China with a good long-term boost, which would reduce the interconnectedness of the two economies, experts say.
"The observers will be much more dangerous if a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can create economic conditions in different countries", said Abigail Grace, an Asia researcher at the Center for a New American Security, a think tank.
Syrian foreign minister says refugees are "ready" to return
Syria is reportedly ready for a free return of refugees and is seeking help in rebuilding the country, which has been devastated by more than seven years of war.
Foreign Minister Walid Al-Mughallim, speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, noted that conditions in the country had improved.
"Today, thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure", he said.
The authorities continued to rebuild the areas destroyed by the terrorists in order to restore normal life.
Due to the economic measures taken against terrorism and the daily life and way of life, all conditions are now created for the free return of refugees to their country.
The United Nations estimates that since the start of the war in 2011, more than 5.5 million people have fled Syria.
Six million more people in the country are in need of humanitarian aid.
Al-Muqallim said that the Syrian regime would support the media in the reconstruction of the country.
However, he made it clear that he would not accept conditional aid or support from countries that had supported the attackers.
Paris won the Ryder Cup in Europe
In 2018, the European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup in Paris, France, at Le Golf National, defeating the United States 16.5-10.5.
The United States lost six consecutive matches on European soil and had not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Danish captain Thomas Bjørn won the European crown after his team scored 14,5 points, the required score to beat the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who had been fighting most of the tournament, put the ball in the water on the 3rd hole of the 16th hole, thus winning the match for Franchesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has excelled in all of his tours, with the current tournament format being a 1-4 game with a 5-0-0 record since 1979.
The American Jordan Smith lost 5-4 to the lowest ranked player in the European team, Denmark's Torbjern Olesen.
The world's best player Dustin Johnson lost 2 to 1 against England's Ian Pulter, who last played in the Ryder Cup.
Eight Ryder Cup veterans, Spain's Sergio Garcia was the best winner of a European tournament with a career-best 25.5.
"I usually don't cry, but today I can't help myself.
It was a difficult year.
So I want to thank Thomas for choosing me and trusting me.
I'm very happy that the Cup is back, very happy.
It's about the team, and I'm happy to be able to help", Garcia said emotionally after the win in Europe.
He gave the torch to his compatriot John Ram, who beat American golf legend Tiger Woods 2 to 1 in a Sunday afternoon match.
"I'm proud of winning Tiger Woods, because I grew up watching this guy", said 23-year-old Rame.
Woods won all four matches in France and now has a 13-21-3 Ryder Cup record.
The 14 major titles won by Jack Nicklaus are a strange statistic for one of the greatest players of all time.
The U.S. team tried to find the fairways over the weekend, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finale, who played the highest level of golf in the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk said after the team's disappointing performance: "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
Today, Europe was a bit warmer in the morning.
We were given up.
I take off my hat in front of Thomas.
He is a great captain.
All 12 of his players played well.
We will unite, we will work with the American Ryder Cup committee, we will move forward.
I love these 12 guys and am proud to serve as captain.
You should take off your clothes.
We were defeated".
