The rapidly spread aggregate epidemic of the coronavirus (Kovid-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the UK, 1 January to 15 March 2020
The increasing spread of cases of the Crowd Virus (Cowid-19) shows a similar trend in the countries of the European Economic Area/EU and the UK confirms while in different countries, we are in a different phase of multiplication but the Crowd-19 pandemic is rapidly evolving in all countries.
According to Italian experience, other countries, hospitals and special care sectors should increase their preparation to increase the number of patients with Quid-19 who need health care and special care.
On December 31, 2019, a group of cases of unknown causes were in Wuhan, China's Hubei province.
On January 9, 2020, China's Center for Disease Control and Prevention this cause as a new type of coronavirus called acute respiratory coronavirus syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 infection has been called the coronavirus disease (Kovid-19) .
The evidence to date shows that about 80% of people with Quid-19 have a mild disease, which is a respiratory infection with or without the rhinitis, and most of these cases are healed.
In about 14 percent of cases, Covid-19 becomes a more severe disease that requires hospitalization, while the remaining 6 percent experience a serious condition that requires special care.
The mortality rate of patients in hospitals due to Quid-19 is about 4 percent.
In this study, we evaluate the increasing prevalence of the coronavirus in each of the countries of the European Union / European Economic Area (EU / EEA) and the UK (UK) and compare them with the Hubei Province, China.
We also compare the current number of cases of Covid-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK, with the number in Italy from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Covid-19 virus cases in the European Union/EEA and the UK
After China, Quoid-19 was spread in more geographical areas and the dynamics of this all-inclusive disease in other parts of the world is now followed by the country.
On March 11, 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that Quid-19 was a pandemic.
Spiteri and colleagues in the Eurosurveillance magazine on March 5, 2020 the first confirmed case of Covid-19 in Europe based on the definition of the World Health Organization.
In the European Union/EEA, three cases approved by France on 24 January 2020 were from people who had returned from the Houthi province of China.
On 15 March 2020, cases of Covid-19 were identified in all 30 European/EEA countries and the UK, according to which from 31 December 2019 to that day, 39,768 cases were confirmed and 1,727 deaths were, 17,750 were confirmed and 1,441 deaths were only from Italy.
Acquisition of the aggregate number and the aggregate spread of the cases of Quid-19
In the European Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), Quoid-19 cases in different countries around the world are only available from official sources such as the Ministry of Health, the National and Regional Health Organization and the World Health Organization, which are updated every day at 8:00 p.m.
These data were used to evaluate the Quid-19 trend in the European Union/EEA and the UK and compare it with the disease trend in Italy.
As an indicator for the spread of active Quid-19 cases, we calculated the cumulative spread of cut Quid-19 cases within 14 days, and as a result, the natural period of Quid-19 in the EU/EEA countries and the UK was considered for the period 1 January to 15 March 2020.
The aggregate number of cases announced from each country on 15 March 2020 at 8:00 p.m. was also compared to the cases announced in Italy from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
The Quid-19 trend in the European Union countries / EEA and the UK
The 14-day trend of the cumulative spread of Covid-19 in the EU/EEA countries and the UK is generally followed by the Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
In general, for the European Union/EEA and the UK, the cumulative spread of Quid-19 began to rise around 21 February and then increased dramatically around 28 February 2020 (supplementary demand).
This is mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of reports from Italy, but other EU/EEA countries and Britain showed a similar growth trend from the cumulative Quoid-19 spread (supplementary claim).
Figure 2 shows the aggregate number of cases of Covid-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK compared to cases in Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
This form indicates that on March 15, at 8 a.m., the total number of cases in 15 other countries in the European Union/EEA and the UK is comparable to the number of cases in Italy in three weeks before it or less.
Our results indicate that the number of cases diagnosed with Covid-19 is rapidly increasing in the European Union/EEA and the UK.
The trends observed in the Quid-19 cumulative epidemic show that the pandemic is currently progressing at almost the same speed in all countries.
While countries are in different stages of the disease, the reaction of public health organizations varies, and there are probably different definitions and protocols in countries to choose patients to be tested to confirm Quid-19, including increased test speed.
Earlier March 2020, doctors in the influenced areas of Italy described a situation in which about 10% of patients with Quid-19 needed special care, and media sources that hospitals and special care departments in these areas have reached their maximum capacity.
Information about the admission of Quid-19 cases at the hospital or special care department is currently available at the EU/EEA level, respectively, for only 6% and 1% of cases (data is not shown).
To complete the current surveillance data focusing on the number of cases and the number of deaths, this information must be collected systematically.
A study conducted over the years 11-2010 found that access to special care and middle care beds in Europe varies greatly, ranging from 29.2 beds per 100,000 in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100,000 in Portugal.
This means that countries may have less or more resources than Italy (12.5 beds of special care and middle care per 100,000 inhabitants in 11-2010)
The modeling scenarios related to the saturation capacity of health care, with estimates for the various countries of the European Union/EEA and the UK regarding the prevalence of cases of Quid-19 hospitalized in connection with occupation of more than 90% of the capacity of the beds of the special care sector, were presented in the sixth update of the Quick Risk Assessment of ECDC Quid-19.
Since cases of illness are categorized in specific regions of European/EEA countries and the UK, and hospitals and special care departments usually serve the population of a region, the information on cases of illness as well as special care beds should preferably be available in the list of territorial units for statistical level 2 (NUTS-2).
Italy’s experience and current trends in other countries show that Pandemic Quid-19 in the European Union/EEA and the UK is rapidly advancing.
Therefore, hospitals and special care departments should prepare themselves for a stable SARS-CoV-2 transfer scenario and increasing the number of covid-19 patients who need special care, such as the current situation in the affected areas of Italy.
As noted in the recent rapid ECDC risk assessment, a quick, preventive and comprehensive approach to delay SARS-COV-2 spread is necessary, with a rapid change from the inhibition to decrease approach, since predicting a rapid increase in the number of incidents if not done too soon may make the decision-making authorities and hospitals not have enough time to understand, accept and adapt their response based on this process.
Fast Risk Assessment lists general health measures to reduce the impact of this pandemic.
There is a short opportunity for countries to increase their control measures to reduce SARS-CoV-2 emissions and reduce pressure on the healthcare sector.
Failure to do this is likely that other EU/EEA health care systems will face a wave of patients who will need special care in the coming days or weeks.
The spread of the 2019 Crown Virus (QV-19) caused by the SARS-CoV-2 syndrome has so far led to more than 3,000 deaths and 80,000 infection in China and other parts of the world, which is a catastrophe for mankind.
SARS-CoV-2, like the same virus, which caused thousands of people in 2003, may have been transmitted from the spiders and may cause similar symptoms through the same mechanism.
However, Quid-19 has less severity and mortality than SARS, but it is more transmitted and affects older people more than young people and men more than women.
This article, in response to the numerous content published on this emerging disease, strives to provide a timely and comprehensive review of this rapidly expanding research topic.
We will cover the basic principles about epidemiology, causology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prediction and prevention of this disease.
Although many questions still need answers, we hope this review article will help understand and eradicate this devastating disease.
The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020 has become an unprecedented and unforgettable memory for all Chinese people who were forced to stay at home all holidays and several weeks later due to the new viral disease.
The virus is very similar to the coronavirus (CoV), which caused the spread of the acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; as a result, the virus was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020 and the related disease was also named CoV Disease-19 (CoV-19) .
The epidemic began in Wuhan China and rapidly spread across the country and around 50 other countries around the world.
By 2 March 2020, more than 80,000 confirmed Covid-19 cases were, of which more than 40,000 patients were released and more than 3,000 patients died.
The World Health Organization has warned that Kuwait-19 is “the number one enemy of the people” and potentially more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), since the first report on January 7, 2020 in less than two months, more than 200 articles on Quid-19 have been published including virology, epidemiology, causology, diagnosis and treatment that have identified the sequence of the virus that is separated from the body of several patients.
In this review article we are trying to aggregate the advances of research in this new and rapidly developing subject area.
If possible, we will try to compare Quid-19 with SARS and other infectious diseases caused by CoV, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS, found in 2012).
We will also discuss the issues we have learned about the prevention and treatment of this disease, as well as some other essential questions.
CoVs were traditionally considered non-death pathogens for humans, mostly leading to about 15 percent of normal colds.
But in this century, we have twice encountered highly malignant human CoVs, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused the disease to spread in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012 and quickly spread to many other countries with a terrible rate of spread and mortality.
So, the current Quid-19 is the third-largest CoV outbreak in the history of mankind.
As shown in Figure 1.1, a group of unknown origins of illusions were first to the Chinese National Health Commission on 31 December 2019.
Seven days later, the sequence of CoV was released.
On 15 January 2020, the first death of Wuhan was.
At the same time, the epidemic rapidly spread to cities, provinces and neighboring countries.
On January 20th, the medical staff of the healthcare department that the transmission of humans to humans was possible.
On January 23th, the inhabitants of the city of Wuhan were cartridges in the houses and public transport was stopped.
On 24 January, in the first clinical study on the disease, it was that of the 41 patients with confirmed cases, only 21 were in direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market, which was considered the starting point of infection from an unknown animal source.
On January 30th, the World Health Organization declared the epidemic a global health emergency.
Until the report was prepared, the disease has spread throughout China and 50 other countries around the world (Figure 2.2).
Since the situation is changing rapidly, the final scope and severity of the disease is still a matter to be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a study conducted in several centers on 8,866 patients including 4,021 confirmed Quid-19 shows an up-to-date picture of the epidemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
People with SARS-CoV-2 are different ages, but mostly 30 to 65 years old.
Nearly half of those affected (47.7 percent) were over 50 years old, very little, less than 20 years old, and only 14 were under 10 years old.
People with SARS-CoV-2 are more male (0.31/100,000) than female (0.27/100,000).
Quid-19 spread in various clusters mainly in Hobby and around it.
The starting period until quoid-19 diagnosis was an average of 5 days (2 to 9 days).
The average infection period was 4.8 days (3.0 to 7.2 days).
The start-to-death period was an average of 9.5 days (4.8 to 13 days).
The base slide number (R0) was equal to 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and the adjusted R0 was 2.23 to 4.82.
The number of people with exposure increased before 23 January 2020, matching the busy time of transportation, before the Spring Festival in China.
The patient mortality rate with confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and the regulated mortality rate of all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
Three main risk factors for Quid-19 included gender (man), age (over 60 years old) and severe inflammation.
CoVs are a subfamily of large and inflatable viruses that contain a single string of sensory RNAs.
These viruses can be divided into four layers of alpha, beta, gamma and delta, which are specific to the alpha and beta varieties of CoVs that can spread to humans.
Glycoprotein (S) is connected to the host cell angiotensin and causes the conversion of the enzyme 2 (ACE2) and peptide di peptide 4 (DPP4) respectively for SARS - CoV and MERS-CoV, and then the membrane collapse occurs.
The genome of the virus RNA is released in the cytoplasm; after the reproduction of the virus genome, the genome of the genome of the genome of the genome of the genome of the genome of the genome of the genome of the genome of the genome of the genome of the genome of the genome of the genome of the genome of the genome of the genome of the genome of the genome of the genome of the genome of the genome of the genome of the genome of the genome of the genome of the genome of the genome of the genome of the genome of the genome of the genome of the genome.
The first sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was on January 10, 2020.
With a genetic matching of more than 99/98 percent of 10 sequential samples collected from the main spot of the outbreak, the havanan seafood market in Wuhan, it was found that SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of beta-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically more similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
Through the examination with a transitional electron microscope, SARS-CoV-2 particles were found in the top thin part of the human airway cover tissue.
It was found that human ACE2 acts as a SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV recipient.
However, S protein from SARS-CoV-2 is weaker than SARS-CoV connected to human ACE2, which coincides with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less infection than SARS-CoV in patients.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein encoded by orf3b and a secret protein encoded by orf8.
orf3b in SARS-CoV-2 may play a role in the pathogenesis of the virus to prevent the occurrence of IFNβ. However, orf8 has no known application domain or motives.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou and colleagues of the crew EM structure a full-length human ACE2 with a 2.9 angster resolution in combination with the B0AT1 amino acid carrier.
They found that this compound, which had open and closed forms, was combined as a demer and the ACE2-B0AT1 compound could interconnect two S proteins that could be evidence for the identification of CoV and infection.
B0AT1 can become a therapeutic target for drug screening to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The source and host.
It has been revealed that the origin of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, both were from the puppets and were transmitted to humans by means of the siot cat and shark, respectively.
Through the philogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, it was revealed that spiders are an indigenous host of SARS-CoV-2 because the new virus is 96% identical to two semi-SARS CoVs, originating from the SL-CoVZX45 and the SL-CoVZX21.
However, the question of what medium host has helped the virus pass through the species barrier to infect humans remains unanswered and the path of transmission still requires more clarification.
J and colleagues believe that the serpents that contain a compound within protein S have acted as a carrier of the virus from spiders to humans.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou China on the basis of a 99% genetic coherent in the CoV found in pangolin and SARS-CoV-2, said that eating pangolin - a type of long-cranberry snorkeling that is often used in traditional Chinese medicine - served as a possible middle host of SARS-CoV-2.
However, the 1% difference that is in the two expanded genoms is still a great difference; so we are still waiting for definitive results for strong evidence (Figure 33).
The chemical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 are still largely unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV remain alive in dry environments for up to 48 hours and at a temperature of 20 degrees Celsius and a moisture of 40-50% to 5 days in laboratory conditions.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
SARS-CoV-2 has been to be sensitive to ultraviolet radiation and a temperature of 56 degrees Celsius for 30 minutes, ether, ethanol 75%, chlorine, prostate acid, chlorophorm and other fatty solvents other than chlorhexidine, and these cases can effectively disable the virus.
The human population generally has no immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore susceptible to this new virus.
No detailed study of the immunological response to SARS-CoV-2 has been.
Thus, we can only refer to previous studies on other CoVs, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. (Figure 4.4).
In general, after the virus attacks the host cell, the virus recognition is initially carried out by the host's intrinsic immune system through pattern detection receptors (PRRs) including type C semelectin receptors, semelectin receptors (TLRs), semelectin receptors NOD (NLRs), and semelectin receptors RIG-I (RLRs).
The virus through various pathways causes the appearance of inflammatory factors, the maturity of dental cells and the type of interferon synthesis (IFNs), which restricts the spread of the virus and accelerates the macrophage of fagocytosis in the antigen of the virus.
However, protein N in SARS-CoV can help the virus escape from the immune system.
The immune system adapts very quickly to the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in defense.
CD4+T cells stimulate B cells to produce specific viral patterns and CD8+T cells directly kill the cells infected with the virus.
T-help cells help to defend cells to produce pre-inflammatory cytocins.
However, CoV can inhibit the function of the T cell by triggering T cell apoptosis.
Homoral immunity includes supplements such as C3a and C5a and antibodies are also essential in the fight against viral infection.
For example, an antibody separated from the patient healed, causes MERS-CoV to be neutralized.
On the other hand, an excessive reaction of the immune system causes a large number of free radicals to be produced locally, which can cause severe inflammation in the lungs and other organs and, in the worst scenario, lead to the failure of several organs and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 which is characteristic of clustic appearance, mostly affects older people with background diseases and pregnant women.
The common thing is that people who are exposed to a large amount of the virus or their immune system’s function is poor are more likely to get infected than others.
According to a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan, the average SARS-CoV-2 infestation period was equal to 14-1 days, but in most cases it lasted 3 to 7 days.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the period of infertility is an average of 3 days and in the time range is from zero to 24 days.
A new study shows, as explained above, the infertility period is 4.8 days (3.0 to 7.2 days), which is based on statistics of 8,866 cases.
This is very important for health officials in order to be able to determine the effective cardinal time based on the most accurate period of infection, thereby preventing the transmission of the virus from infected people who have no symptoms of the disease to others.
One common method is that people exposed to the virus or infected with the virus usually need to be cartoon for 14 days.
Should the time of the cartoon be extended to 24 days?
Fever in most cases is the primary and primary sign of Quid-19, which can be associated without any sign or with other symptoms such as dry cough, breathing difficulty, muscle pain, swelling, headache, throat pain, nasal swelling, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients had difficulty breathing or reduced oxygen in the tissues a week after the disease began.
In severe cases, the disease progresses rapidly to develop acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidification and blood clot disorder.
Patients with fever or symptoms of severe respiratory and fever, even without renal abnormalities in radiological images, should be scaned for early diagnosis of the virus.
A population study in late December 2019 showed a percentage of symptoms as follows: 98 per cent of fever, 76 per cent of dry cough, 55 per cent of breathing difficulties and 3 per cent of diarrhea; 8 per cent of patients needed a ventilator.
Similar findings were in two recent studies of a family cluster and a cluster caused by transmission from a person without signs.
A 2012 population study found that MERS-CoV patients also found fever (98 percent), dry cough (47 percent) and breathing difficulty (55 percent) as the main symptoms.
However, 80% of them needed a ventilator, which is much more than Quid-19 patients, which indicates that MERS is more fatal than Quid-19.
Diarrhea (26%) and throat pain (21%) were also observed in MERS patients.
In patients with SARS, it has been shown that fever (99 to 100 percent), dry cough (29 to 75 percent), breathing difficulties (40 to 42 percent), diarrhea (20 to 25 percent) and throat pain (13 to 25 percent) were the main symptoms, and about 20% to 14 percent of patients needed a ventilator.
By February 14, when confirmed cases of infection worldwide reached 66.576 cases, the percentage of deaths from Covid-19 was about 2 percent.
In comparison, SARS deaths were approximately 10 percent of 8,096 confirmed by November 2002.
According to a population study in June 2012, the mortality rate for MERS was 37% of 2,494 confirmed cases.
One previous study showed that the R0 relating to SARS-CoV-2 reached 6.47 and its 95% reliability distance (CI) is around 5.71 to 7.23, while the R0 range for SARS-CoV is only from 2 to 4.
The SARS-CoV-2 comparison with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV in terms of symptoms, mortality rates and R0 is presented in Table 1.1.
The above images show that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher prevalence capacity than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but SARS-CoV-2 is less mortal than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
In this way, the control of SARS-CoV-2 allocation is much harder than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
The start of clusters often occurs in a family or from a place of gathering or a vehicle such as a cruise ship.
Patients often had a history of travel or residence in Wuhan or other infected areas or contact with infected persons or patients two weeks before the start of the disease.
However, it has been that people can be the virus carrier for more than two weeks without any symptoms, and healed and dismissed patients can also re-communicate the virus, which is a warning to increase the cartoon time.
In the early stages of the disease, the number of white blood cells (especially lymphocytes) in patients is normal or low.
For example, lympophenia with a number of white blood cells less than 4×109/L, including a number of lymphocytes less than 1×109/L, and an increased level of aspartate amino-transfase and the presence of a virus in the blood was observed in 1,099 patients with quoid-19.
The levels of liver and muscle enzymes and myoglobin in the blood of some patients were increased, and C reactive protein and red blood cells in the blood were often increased in most patients.
In patients with severe cases, the level of Demer D, which is the result of the destruction of the fibrin in the blood, increased and the number of lymphocytes gradually decreased.
A noticeable abnormality in the radiographical images of the chest is observed in most Covid-19 patients, and its characteristic is the shadows of two-sided pieces or dead glass codors in the lungs.
In most patients, an abnormal rhinitis, acute liver damage and acute respiratory disorder syndrome (ARDS) are caused.
When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation and advanced fibrosis seriously threaten an individual's air exchange.
Types I and II dysfunction in the pneumocytes decreases the level of surfacant and increases the surface stretch, thus the ability of the lungs to expand is reduced and the risk of lungs failure increases.
So the worse the radiographic findings of the chest, the greater the extent of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of Quid-19 showed that the skinage of the pneumocytes, the formation of the glass membrane and the penetration of the intravenous lymphocytes and cysical cells in the lungs of the disease that died due to the disease was compatible with the pathology of viral infection and ARDS and is similar to SARS and MERS patients.
SARS-CoV-2-related RNA diagnosis was used through the reverse polymerase-ronous chain reaction (RT-PCR) as the main Quid-19 diagnosis criterion.
However, due to the high false negative rate of this method, which could accelerate the epidemic, on February 13, 2020, the use of clinical symptoms (which no longer depended only on RT-PCR) began to diagnose the disease in China.
For the diagnosis of SARS, the same situation occurred.
Therefore, a combination of disease history, clinical symptoms, laboratory tests and radiological findings is effective, necessary and mandatory for a diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, the Feng Shui Protocol Group proposed using CRISPR-based Sherlock methods to identify SARS-CoV-2, which allows the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2-related combined RNA parts at 20 × 10-18 mol/L to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10 to 100 copies per microliter of input cases), which is done using a bar in less than an hour without the need for accurate expensive tools.
There is hope that if the new method is approved in clinical samples, it can dramatically increase the accuracy and convenience of the test.
Due to the lack of experience with this new type of CoV, doctors can mainly provide supporting care to CoV-19 patients, while various treatments that are used to improve other CoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other viral diseases are recommended (Table 2).
These treatments include current and potential treatments with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressant drugs, steroids, plasma received from improved patients, Chinese medicine and psychological support.
Even plasma received from improved patients was recommended for use in treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are competing for the production of bacteria and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 mainly attacks the lungs at the beginning and is likely to have weaker attacks on other organs containing ACE2, such as the digestive system and the kidneys.
However, dysfunction and disfunction of the respiratory system are the most important risk in patients and the main cause of death.
Thus, respiratory support is vital to relieve the symptoms of the disease and saves a person's life, which depending on the severity of the disease can include general oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen, non-aggressive ventilator and aggressive mechanical ventilator.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should be supported by External membrane oxygenation (ECMO), this method is a modified bacterial bacterial technique that is used to treat heart failure or respiratory failure.
In addition, the maintenance of the electrolyte balance, the prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shocks and the protection of the function of the critical organs are also essential in patients with SARS-CoV-2.
It has been found that the cytoquin storm is resulted from an excessive immune system reaction in patients with SARS and MERS.
The cytocine storm is a type of systemic inflammatory response, characterized by the release of a series of cytocine including TNFα,IL-1β,IL-2,IL-6,IFNα,IFNβ,IFNγ and MCP-1.
This cytokin causes the immune cells to release a large number of free radicals, which is the main cause of ARDS and multi-organ failure.
Depression of the immune system is essential in the treatment of cytokin storms, especially in patients with severe condition.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, which is an anti-IL6 monoclonal anti-ventilator, are used to treat cytokin storms.
Other treatments for suppressing the immune system in order to prevent the cytocin storm include immunity response modulation guided by T cells; IFN-γ, IL-1 and TNF blockade; JAK inhibitor; Blinatomeb; Symptoms transmission inhibitors of cytocin 4 and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids were widely used as immunosuppressant drugs in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, the use of steroids in high doses in cases of severe liver damage was not beneficial in patients with SARS and quoid-19.
Instead, it can cause severe side effects, especially avascular osteochondrosis and have a dramatic negative effect on the healing of the disease.
However, short periods of use of corticosteroids in low to medium doses are recommended to be used with caution for patients with Quid-19 who are in a critical condition.
At the time of writing this article, no effective antiviral treatment for this disease has been confirmed.
However, it was found that intravenous intervention with remdesivir, which is a nucleotidic analogue, was found in an American patient with Quid-19 effective.
Remdesivir is a new antiviral drug that was originally produced by Gilead to treat diseases caused by Ebola and Marlburg viruses.
Later, the potential inhibition of other single-chain RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS viruses, was shown by remdesivir.
Based on this, Gilead sent the compound to China to conduct a series of tests on people infected with SARS-CoV-2 and the results were very hopeful.
In addition, baricitinb, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin are recommended as a potential treatment for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other side effects can occur after combined treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir.
Interaction of this treatment with other medications used in patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma received from patients healed and antibodies produced
It has a long history of getting blood from patients who have been healed from a transmitting disease to help treat other patients suffering from the same disease or protect healthy people from the disease.
In fact, healed patients often have a relatively large amount of antibodies in their blood to cope with the pathogen.
Antibodies are immunoglobulin (Ig) that are produced by lymphocytes B to fight pathogens and other external objects and detect unique molecules in pathogens and directly neutralize them.
Based on this, plasma was received from the blood of a group of patients who had recovered from Quid-19 and was injected to 10 malignant patients.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, which was accompanied by reduced inflammation and viral load and improved oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, before specific treatments are presented, the use of this method on a large scale requires confirmation and clarification.
In addition, considering the therapeutic effects, some disadvantages related to plasma should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can exaggerate immunity response and create cytokin release syndrome, which is potentially a life-threatening poison.
The concentration in the blood is usually low and the demand for plasma for the treatment of patients is very high.
It is difficult to prepare and produce rapidly a special patch that is sufficient to fight the global epidemic.
Thus, the separation of B cells from improved patients and the identification of genetic codes that codify the bacteria or scraps the bacteria effective against the main viral proteins, is more important and more useful.
In this way, we can rapidly increase the production of paddles.
TCM has been used for thousands of years to treat various diseases in China.
However, its effects are largely dependent on the combination of different components in the formula that vary each other depending on the diagnosis of the disease based on TCM theories.
Most of its active components are still unknown or obscure, as it is difficult to extract and verify these components or their optimal combination.
Currently, due to the lack of effective and specific treatment for Quid-19, TCM has become one of the important treatments for patients with mild symptoms or patients with medium symptoms or those who have improved from severe stages.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules were diagnosed to be effective in the Quid-19 treatment.
The highest treatment rate in Quid-19 patients was observed in several provinces in China where 87 percent of patients used TCM, including in Gansu (63.7 percent), Ningxia (50 percent) and Hunan (50 percent). in the Hubei province where only 30 percent of Quid-19 patients used TCM, the lowest treatment rate (13 percent) was observed.
However, this comparison is not completely correct, as many factors such as the number and severity of patients should be taken into account in the assessment.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and colleagues published a study to compare Western Therapy (WM) alone and combined therapy WM and TCM.
They found that the time needed to recover body temperature, symptoms disappeared, and hospitalization in the group treated with WM+TCM was significantly shorter than the group treated with WM only.
More surprisingly, the rate of exacerbation of symptoms (from mild to severe) in the WM+TCM group was less than in the WM group (7.4% against 46.2%), and the rate of death in the WM+TCM group was less than in the WM group (8.8% against 39%).
However, the effectiveness and safety of TCM is still waiting for better controlled tests on larger scales and more centers.
Also determining the mechanism of action and identifying the effective components of the TCM treatment method or their compounds if possible, is a topic that has raised the curiosity of scientists.
Suspicious patients or certified Covid-19 patients often have a lot of fear of this very contagious and even fatal disease, and carcinated people also experience discomfort, loneliness, and anger.
In addition, the symptoms of this infection such as fever, hypoxia (a lack of oxygen in body tissues), cough and side effects of treatment such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids can lead to increased mental anxiety and anxiety.
In the first stage of SARS, various psychiatric complications have been including severe depression, anxiety, nervous attacks, psycho-moving emotions, psycho-symptoms, discomfort and even suicide.
Compulsory and coronary contact tracking, as part of the public health system’s approach to coping with the spread of Covid-19 virus, can cause people to worry and blame about the effects of spread, coronation and malignity among their family and friends.
Therefore, psychotherapeutic care should be provided for Covid-19 patients, suspects, people in contact with them, as well as the public in need.
Psychological support should include the creation of mental health teams from different disciplines, transparent communications with regular and accurate updates on SARS-CoV-2 spread and therapeutic plans and the use of professional electronic devices and applications to prevent close contact with each other.
Effective vaccines are necessary to cut off the transmission chain from the populations of livestock and infected people to vulnerable hosts and are often used as a supplementary method for antiviral treatment in controlling infectious diseases caused by emerging viruses.
There have been efforts to produce S-protein-based vaccines for the production of strong, durable neutralizing or protective immunosuppressants against SARS-CoV.
Living weakened vaccines have been evaluated in animal models for SARS.
However, the effect of these vaccines on elderly people and harsh devastating patterns and their protection against common viral infections between humans and animals should be determined before the start of the clinical study.
This is probably because the SARS was destroyed 17 years ago and since then no new case has been.
On the contrary, MERS dispersed cases and clusters are still seen in the Middle East and spread to other areas due to the presence of transmission sources from animal to human in indigenous areas.
Vaccination strategies for MERS are presented using inactive viruses, DNA plasmids, viral carriers, nanocoters, semi-viral particles and neutro-combined protein subunits, and some of them are evaluated in animal models.
The production of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 is an essential and vital task for controlling the epidemic.
However, overcoming this problem is difficult because of the long time it takes to produce the vaccine (in an average of 18 months) and the dynamic changes of the various CoV species.
Quid-19 as a new disease, has shown a complete clinical period among thousands of new patients.
In most cases, patients improve gradually and without complications.
However, like SARS and MERS, the Quid-19 virus is also associated with high complications and mortality in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, creating a predictive pattern for the flow of diseases is essential for health and health organizations to prioritize their services, especially in areas with limited facilities.
According to clinical studies that have been so far, the following factors can affect the prognosis of the flow of Quid-19 patients (Table 33):
Age: Age was the most important forecast factor for SARS flow, which is also true for Quid-19.
Quoid-19 occurs mainly between the ages of 30 and 65; a study of 8,866 cases found that 47.4% of patients were over the age of 50.
Patients who needed special care had more background complications and disorders, and their age was higher than those who did not need special care (the average age of the first group was 66 and the average age of the second group was 51 years).
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 affects most men than women (0.31/100,000 vs. 0.27/100,000), as described above.
Previous diseases and complications: Patients with Quid-19 who need special care were more likely to have severe heart injuries and arthritis.
Heart attacks were also the main cause of death of SARS patients.
It has been that SARS-CoV-2 can also be connected to ACE2-positive colangeocytes and lead to liver disorder in Quid-19 patients.
It is important to note that age and background diseases are strongly connected to each other and may interfere with each other.
Unusual laboratory findings: the level of reactive C protein in the blood indicates the severity of inflammation or tissue damage and is suggested to be a potential factor for disease, response to treatment and final recovery.
It is also proposed to match the level of CRP with the severity and forecast of the flow of Quid-19 disease.
In addition to this, increased levels of Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH), Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST), Alanin Aminotransferase (ALT) and Creatine Kinase (CK) can also help forecast results.
These enzymes appear widely in several organs, especially in their heart and liver, and are released as a result of tissue damage.
Therefore, as traditional signs, they are heart or liver disorders.
Main clinical symptoms: To predict the results and complications of Quid-19, breast radiography and timely progression of clinical symptoms should be considered along with other issues.
Steroid use: As mentioned above, steroids are immune system suppressors that are commonly used as a treatment for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Since high doses of corticosteroids were widely used in patients with SARS, many healed people suffer from vascular osteoporosis with lifelong disability and decreased quality of life.
So, if necessary, steroid should be used in low doses and for a short period of time in patients with Quid-19.
Psychic stress: As explained above, many patients have suffered from extreme stress since the Quid-19 epidemic, because they often have been carnival for a long time and have experienced severe uncertainty and have witnessed the death of close family members and patients in their room.
Providing psychological advice and long-term support is essential to help heal these patients and get rid of stress and return to normal life.
According to demographic studies that have been conducted so far, the epidemiological characteristics of Quid-19 appear to be different from SARS.
SARS-CoV-2 in addition to reproduction in the lower respiratory system can effectively be reproduced in the upper respiratory system and in the first stage of infection, symptoms are mild or subtle and similar to other CoVs that cause normal colds.
Therefore, patients with the first stage or period of infestation can produce a lot of viruses during daily activities, which can make it difficult to control the epidemic.
However, the transmission of SARS-CoV occurred when patients were seriously ill and the transmission did not occur in the early stages of the disease.
Therefore, the Quid-19 epidemic is much more severe than the SARS epidemic and it is more difficult to control.
Currently, many efforts are ongoing in China, including the ban on leaving houses in the city of Wuhan and surrounding cities and the continuous coronation of the entire population hoping to break the SARS-CoV-2 transmission chain.
Although these measures have seriously damaged the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new patients is decreasing and this indicates a slowdown in the course of the disease.
The most optimistic estimate is that the spread of the disease will end by March and the phase of the decay of the virus will continue for three to four months.
However, some other experts are not very optimistic.
Paul Hunter and colleagues have estimated that the Quid-19, which seems basically more tolerant than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini and colleagues set up a model to predict the outcome of the epidemic and believe that SARS-CoV-2 can infect two-thirds of the world’s population.
A Canadian group that SARS-CoV-2 can be diagnosed in the mid nose cornea and neck cornea of patients who left the hospital two weeks ago and were healed, which indicates that a newly identified virus can turn into a cycle-like flu disease.
However, there are hopeful signs in China based on a decrease in the number of new cases that indicate that current strategies may be effective.
It was initially predicted that Ebola would cause a million people and half a million deaths.
However, through cartilage and severe separation, the disease was eventually controlled.
It is possible that, like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 will become weaker in pathogenic terms and eventually disappear or become a low pathogenic virus that lives alongside humans.
The comparison of Quid-19 totalization with SARS and MERS is shown below (Figure 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmitted through cough or sweat and is likely to be transmitted through direct contact with the infected substance to the virus.
The virus is also found in the eruption, which allows the transmission from the eruption to the mouth.
In a new study, 138 cases were that 41 percent of cases were caused by hospital infection, including 17 patients with previous diseases and 40 of the medical staff.
Therefore, the protection of humans, especially the staff of medical care, social aid workers, family members, colleagues and even passengers who are in contact with patients or persons with this disease, should be paid very carefully.
The first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is the face mask, which can be both through the use of surgical masks and respiratory masks N95 (Series 1860), which helps to control the spread of viruses.
The surgical mask prevents the passing of the fluid drops spread by potentially affected people through the air or adhesive to the level of the material where they can be transmitted to others.
However, only N95 masks (1860 series) can protect a person from the inhalation of viral particles of 10 to 80 nanometers, and only 5 percent of viral particles can fully pass through it; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in size, and both are about 85 nanometers.
Since the particles can go through even among the five surgical masks that are placed together, health care staff that are in direct contact with patients should use the N95 (Series 1860) mask, not the surgical mask.
In addition to the mask, the health care board should cover isolation plants to further reduce contact with viruses.
Viruses can also infect a person through the eyes.
On 22 January 2020, a doctor was infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, although he had a N95 mask; the virus could have entered his body through his inflamed eyes.
Therefore, the healthcare staff should also use transparent shells and glasses when working with patients.
For the general population in contaminated or potentially contaminated areas, it is highly recommended that people wash their hands too often with anti-infectious soap and try to stay at home and limit contact with potentially infected people.
The distance of three feet (one meter) is considered as an appropriate distance for people who stay away from the patient.
These are effective ways to reduce the risk of infection and also prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 entered the human world as a new virus, its large association with SARS-CoV, which was on January 7, 2020, based on deep memories of the 2003 SARS epidemic, had an important warning for China.
However, by January 19, 2020, the Director of the Wuhan Disease Control Center, saying that the new virus is low and its transmission from humans to humans is limited, and that there is no problem to prevent and prevent the disease.
This message significantly reduced the awareness of the risk among the public, especially when the whole country was preparing for the Spring Festival and a vital time for the prevention of the disease at a minimum scale was lost in the Wuhan.
Disease control agencies in China may have learned hard from this and will make fundamental improvements in the future.
For example, these organizations should (i) be more cautious, considering that any word said by health organizations is important to citizens and can change people’s attitudes and decisions; (ii) rather than waiting for official reports from doctors and authorities, be much more sensitive and responding to the unusual information received from clinics; (iii) rather than trying to encourage people, take more restrictive measures to prevent a potential epidemic in its early stages; and (iii) to increase public awareness of all-inclusive diseases and to test and improve the system of public response periodically, make objective and effective instructions.
The spread of Quoid-19 was started by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus in late December 2019.
In less than two months and the time of writing this article, the virus has spread across China and 50 other countries worldwide.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and there are similar symptoms between Quid-19 and SARS, Quid-19 spread has created a sense of return to SARS.
However, there are significant differences between Quid-19 and SARS that knowing them is essential to inhibit this epidemic and treat patients.
Quoid-19 affects older people more than young people and men more than women, and its severity and mortality rates are also higher in older people than young people.
SARS mortality was higher than Quid-19 (10.91% against 1.44%).
Covid-19 patients transmitted the virus even when there were no symptoms, while SARS patients transmitted the virus when they were severely sick, which made the inhibition of Covid-19 more difficult than SARS.
This point somehow explains why SARS-CoV-2 spread more and wider than SARS-CoV.
The normal RNA test in SARS-CoV-2 may be negative in some patients with Quid-19.
On the other hand, treated patients may be infected again with the virus and their test results are positive.
These findings dramatically increase the risk of viral spread.
Due to such rapid progress in the research on Quid-19, several important issues are still unresolved, which are as follows:
Where does SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-CoV such as pineapple there is about 96% genetic similarity, we can still not find out that SARS-CoV-2 is pineapple.
Which animal, as a mediator, transmitted the virus from the primary host, for example, spiders, to humans?
Without knowing the answers to questions 1 and 2, we cannot effectively stop the transmission and the spread of the disease can repeat at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical measurements have determined that SARS-CoV-2 is connected to ACE2, how does the virus enter the respiratory cells and cause further disease-dependent changes?
Is this virus connected to the cells containing ACE2 in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we can’t get a quick, accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will it continue?
When the virus is transmitted between humans, how is it genetically transformed?
Will this illness become a universal illness around the world, as SARS gradually disappears or returns periodically as flu?
Answers to the above questions are essential, but it may take a while to answer the above questions and many other questions.
However, at any cost it may be necessary, we have no choice but to stop this allocation as soon as possible and return our lives to normal.
Animal origin of human coronavirus.
For thousands of years, adaptation and adaptation has led to the simultaneous development of the coronavirus (CoVs) and their host including humans.
Before 2003, two human CoVs (HCoVs) were known to cause mild diseases such as colds.
The emergence of acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), it showed on the coin how devastating and dangerous HCoV infection could be.
The appearance of SARS-CoV-2 in the center of China at the end of 2019, brought CoVs back to the center of attention and surprised us with its high prevalence, but the symptoms of the disease were less compared to its sister SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is a common type of disease between humans and animals, and recognizing the animal origin of HCoVs helps us well.
The source of most HCoVs are pimples that do not cause disease in their bodies.
Hosts that act as the middle tank of some HCoVs are also known.
The identification of animal hosts has a direct effect on the prevention of disease in humans.
The study of CoV host interactions in animals can also gain an important insight into the pathogenesis of CoV in humans.
In this review, we provide an overview of the knowledge available about seven HCoVs, focusing on the history of their discovery as well as the animal origin and interspesial transmission.
The important topic that we address is the comparison of different HCoVs from the point of view of viral evolution and genetic neutralization.
The current pollution of the coronavirus 2019 (Kawid-19) is discussed in this field.
Additionally, the need to successfully change the host and the evolution of the virus for the severity of the disease is examined in this article.
The corona viruses (CoVs) belong to the Coronaviridae family, which consists of a group of lymphatic viruses, with a positive plarity and a single-strate RNA.
These viruses, which have the largest genome of 26 to 32 kilobis among the RNA viruses, were called "CoV", which is under an electron microscope due to their crown morphology.
Structually, CoVs have an integrated genome that has a common similar structure.
Nearly two-thirds of the genome contains two large-scale readings frameworks (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are converted into pp1a and pp1ab reproductive polyprotein.
Polyprotein is more processed and causes the production of 16 non-structured proteins, named nsp1 to 16.
The remaining part of the genome includes ORFs that are used for structural proteins such as spike (S), leaf (E), membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
A number of side proteins that are specific to ancestors have been encoded by different CoV ancestors.
Based on differences in protein sequences, CoVs are classified into four genes (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV), among which the beta-CoV genes include more HCoVs and are divided into four races (A, B, C and D).
Philogenetic evidence has shown that puppets and puppets act as a source of alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, while birds are the main tank of gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs.
For thousands of years, CoVs have continually passed through species barriers, and some of them have emerged as important pathogenic factors for humans.
So far, seven human CoVs (HCoVs) are known.
Among them are HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63r type alpha-CoV.
Five other beta-CoVs include HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-OC43, acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL6 usually cause mild symptoms such as colds or diarrhea.
On the contrary, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are severe pathogens that cause infection in the lower respiratory system in most patients and are more likely to cause acute respiratory disorder syndrome (ARDS) and the appearance of symptoms outside the lungs.
The first HCoV-229E breed, called B814, was separated from the nasal emissions of common cold patients in the mid-1960s.
Since then, through extensive studies on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of them create their own limited symptoms, our knowledge has increased.
In fact, this concept was widely accepted that HCoVs were generally harmless until SARS was spread.
The SARS epidemic occurred in 2003, one of the most damaging epidemics at present time, affected more than 8,000 people, and its crude deaths were about 10 percent.
Ten years later, the spread of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) caused the spread of a widespread disease in the Saudi Peninsula, which was widespread in other parts of the world.
In 2019, the new HCoV (2019-nCoV), which was subsequently renamed SARS-CoV-2, became the generator of the chronic disease in 2019, killing more than 3,120 people by March 3, 2020 and infected more than 91,000 people.
The alarm is playing and the world has to prepare for SARS-CoV-2 disease.
Each of the seven HCoVs has animal origin that includes spiders, mice or pets.
There are numerous evidence that the evolutionary origin of all HCoVs is known from spiders, in these creatures the viruses are well adapted and present without any signs of disease and show a lot of genetic diversity.
The Quid-19 integration has created enormous medical, scientific, social and ethical challenges for China and the world.
Tracking the animal origin of the disease provides a framework for understanding the natural history, stimulating and restricting mutations of species.
It may also facilitate searching for tanks, middle hosts and animal hosts for SARS-CoV-2 booster and have significant consequences in preventing future multiplication.
In this review, we will review the animal origin, interspiracy and pathogenic HCoVs.
In particular, we highlight and discuss this common issue in which HCoV parental viruses in their natural biosphere are not typically pathogenic, but become pathogenic after transmitting between the species to the new host.
We also examine the development process of HCoV, where an increase in the spread of the virus is often accompanied by a decrease in malignity.
The effects of the current SARS-CoV-2 spread have also been discussed in this area.
Animal CoVs have been known to us since the late 1930s.
Before the initial separation of HCoV-229E Sweat B814, from the nasal emissions of patients with common colds, different CoVs were separated in different species of animals including chickens, mice, cows, pigs, cats and dogs.
Over the past decades, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A brief summary of the date of the discovery of HCoV in time order (Table 1) can be educational and contain good information.
In 1966, the first sequence of the HCoV-229E virus was sampled from the respiratory system of patients with upper respiratory infection and then adapted to growth in the WI-38 lung cell cultivation.
Patients with HCoV-229E had normal cold symptoms, including headache, swelling, weakness and throat pain, and fever and cough was observed in 10 to 20 percent of them.
Later in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was separated from the laboratory organ cultivation and gradually entered the brain of small mice.
The clinical characteristics of HCoV-OC43 infection appear to be similar to the characteristics created by HCoV-229 E, which are undiagnosed in terms of symptoms of other respiratory infections such as flu A and renovirus.
HCoV - 229 and HCoV - OC43 are both spread globally and are mainly transmitted during the winter in a moderate climate.
In general, the time of infection of these two viruses is less than a week, and after that, the disease lasts about 2 weeks.
According to studies conducted on human volunteers, healthy people infected with HCoV-229E experienced mild colds.
Only in a few patients with an immune deficiency, severe infection of the lower respiratory system was observed.
SARS, also known as the "Future Peak Self" disease, is the first universal disease in human history to be caused by SARS-CoV and the third HCoV to be discovered.
The first SARS case could be traced in late 2002 in Guangdong, China.
The SARS spread caused 8,096 people, 774 killed and spread in many countries and continents.
Apart from the emergency conditions of spread, it is estimated that each infection can affect almost two other cases, a period of infection of 4 to 7 days and the peak of viral load appears on the 10th day of the disease.
Patients with SARS-CoV initially experienced muscle pain, headache, fever, weakness and trembling, and then breathing difficulties, cough and respiratory distress appeared as subsequent signs.
Lymphopenia, hepatic dysfunction test and increased seratine kinase, are common laboratory disorders of SARS.
Large alveol destruction, epithelial cells reproduction and increased macrophages have also been observed in SARS patients.
After that, about 20 to 30 percent of patients needed special care and a mechanical ventilator.
In addition to the lower respiratory system, several organs, including the digestive system, the liver and the kidneys, were affected in severe cases which were usually accompanied by a sitokin storm that could be deadly in patients with immune deficiencies.
The virus was taken for the first time during an open liver tissue operation by a relative of the indicator patient who had traveled from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, a lot of efforts have been made for research on HCoV.
HCoV - NL63 was separated in late 2004 from a 7-month-old child from the Netherlands.
Initially it was found that this disease is common in young children, elderly patients and people with immune deficiency with respiratory diseases.
Scam, conjunctive inflammation, fever and bronchitis are common in the disease caused by HCoV - NL63.
In another independent study, the separation of the same virus from the nose sample of a 8-month-old boy suffering from the rhinitis in the Netherlands was described.
Although the virus was identified in the Netherlands, it was actually spread worldwide.
It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 is a factor of about 4.7 percent of chronic respiratory diseases, and its peak occur in the early summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with inhibitory throat inflammation, also known as crop.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was separated from a 71-year-old man who was hospitalized in Hong Kong due to bronchitis.
In addition to inflammation and bronchitis, it has been that HCoV-HKU1 is associated with the exacerbation of the asthma of the acute type.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-229E, the HCoV-HKU1 virus is found worldwide and causes mild respiratory diseases.
These four families transmitted through society are well adapted to humans and are generally less susceptible to severe diseases, although cases occur from unknown reasons, for example, in a rare case recently, the malignant type HCoV-NL63 has caused low respiratory infection in China.
In general, when these HCoVs gain the ability to effectively transmit and maintain their continuity in humans, the severity of virulence or infection decreases.
MERS - CoV was separated in 2012 from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient with acute rhinitis and kidney failure in Saudi Arabia.
While most confirmed laboratory cases of the virus originate from the Middle East, import cases have been with secondary spread due to close contacts in different European countries and Tunisia.
Another second epidemic in South Korea was confirmed in 2015 with 186 cases.
The clinical appearance of MERS is similar to SARS, which is known for its acute advanced rhinitis nature.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also suffered from acute kidney failure, which is among the diseases caused by the MERS HCoV.
More than 30 percent of patients had digestive symptoms such as diarrhoea and vomiting.
By 14 February 2020, more than 2,500 certified laboratory cases were with high deaths of 34.4 percent, making MERS-CoV one of the most dangerous viruses known for humans.
From the middle to the late December 2019, groups of patients with SARS-CoV-2-related infectious diseases were identified in Wuhan, Hubei province of China.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has announced the start of the spread of infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 as a global public health emergency and called the disease quoid-19.
By March 3, 2020, the number of confirmed cases worldwide reached 90.053 and the percentage of crude deaths reached 3.4%.
It is noted that the deaths in Hobby China were 4.2 percent, while outside it were 1.2 percent.
SARS-CoV-2 such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV causes severe respiratory infections that are seen in the form of fever, cough and breathing difficulties.
Diarrhea is also seen in some patients.
It is one of the most severe symptoms and can quickly become an acute respiratory disorder syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar, due to the 82% high homogenity of the nucleotid sequence, they are classified into different branches in the phylogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 appears to have less pathogenic compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, but it is more transmitted.
Some people with SARS-CoV-2 had no symptoms that could help rapidly spread around the world.
Comparing and comparing SARS-CoV-2 with six other HCoV shows significant similarities and differences.
The first case is that the period of infection and the duration of the period of HCoV disease are very similar.
In this context, SARS-CoV-2 follows the overall trend of six other HCoVs.
Second, the severity of the quoid-19 symptoms is the middle limit of SARS-CoV and four HCoV transmitted from the community (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection shows characteristics that are commonly seen in HCoV infections that are transmitted from the community, including non-specific, mild or even in some cases without any symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subset of severe cases of Covid-19 can also be seen in SARS-Cov infection, although its ratio is slightly lower.
Third, the SARS-CoV-2 transmission shows interesting patterns of HCoVs and SARS-CoVs transmitted from the community.
On the one hand, the transmission capacity of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as large as HCoVs transmitted from the community.
On the other hand, it is necessary to verify whether the transmission capacity of SARS-CoV-2 like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV is reduced after several transmissions between humans.
Finally, like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be diagnosed in erectile samples.
The fact that SARS-CoV-2 transmission through the outer or urine like SARS-CoV plays an important role in the transmission at least in some circumstances, should be clarified by future studies.
It is also interesting to see if SARS-CoV-2 like HCoVs transmitted from the community can be seasonal or good.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 include transmission, pathogenicity and stable spread after transmission from one person to another will affect the final fate of the current Quid-19 spread.
All four HCoVs transmitted from the community that cause mild symptoms of the disease are well adapted to humans.
From another perspective, it may be true that humans are well adapted to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both can be the survivors of ancient HCoV allocation.
HCoVs that caused severe diseases in humans and people with severe HCoV diseases have now disappeared.
For this purpose, HCoVs should be reproduced enough in humans to allow the accumulation of adaptative mutations that neutralize host restrictive factors.
In this case, the more the SARS-CoV-2 spread continues and more people are affected, the greater chances of the virus to be fully adapted to humans will be.
If the virus is well adapted, it will become difficult to prevent its transmission to humans by cartridges or other measures of infection control.
For several years, four CoV acquisitions have circulated in human communities and have caused normal colds in people with a healthy immune system.
These viruses do not need an animal source.
On the contrary, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are not adapted to humans and their transmission between humans cannot be stable.
These viruses need to be preserved and spread in their animal warehouses and are looking for an opportunity to touch human objectives, which is likely to be done through one or more middle hosts and enhancers.
SARS-CoV-2 has characteristics that are similar to SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV and four HCoV obtained from the community.
This virus, like HCoVs transmitted from the community, has a high transmission capacity at least for the present time.
However, its pathogenicity is less than HCoVs transmitted from the community and more than SARS - CoV or MERS - CoV.
It should be waiting and to see if this virus is fully compatible with humans and is transmitted between humans without a reservation (store) intermediate or animal host.
Before discussing the animal origin of HCoVs, it will be useful to review the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary, natural, tank hosts, intermediate hosts and HCoV reproductors.
If the shelter animal is a viral nearby cousin with a high cousin at the Nucleotide sequence level, the animal acts as the evolutionary host of HCoV.
The ancestral virus is usually well adapted in the host and is not pathogenic for it.
Similarly, a tank host continuously and for a long time shelters to HCoV.
In both cases, the host is naturally infected and is the natural host of HCoV or her parent virus.
On the contrary, if HCoV had a mediator before infection, or approximately at the same time, it is not well adapted to the new host and is often pathogenic.
This mediator host can act as an animal tank of human infection, and in the role of reproducer host by providing the possibility of temporary reproduction of the virus and then transferring it to humans, increasing the level of infection in humans.
HCoV if it can’t keep its transmission stable in the middle host, it can cause fatal infections.
On the contrary, HCoVs can adapt to the middle host and even be present in the host group for a long time.
In this case, the middle host acts as a natural tank host.
Epidemiological data show that the first person affected by SARS had contact with hunting animals.
The subsequent screening of serum epidemic shows that the level of immunoglobin G antivirus in animal products sellers is higher than in ordinary people.
For the first time, a number of Paguma larvata and a rockon dog were diagnosed in the live animal market carrying SARS-CoV viruses, which were almost one with SARS-CoV.
A 29-nocleotide removal characteristic for SARS-CoV was found in races taken at the beginning of human epidemic.
Meanwhile, it has been that cranberries in forest or farms that were not supplied in the live animal market were mainly negative in terms of the presence of the SARS-CoV virus. This shows that cranberries are probably only the host of the mediator and reproducer, not the natural SARS-CoV tank.
It should be noted that 80% of different animals in the Guangzhou markets have an anti-SARS-CoV patterns, so the possibility that many species of small mammals may also act as medium booster hosts for SARS-CoV cannot be overlooked.
All of these are apparently the final hosts of SARS-CoV.
In the subsequent search for the natural animal host SARS - CoV, a type of corona virus that had a great proximity to CoV and was called the corona virus HKU3 related to SARS, the horse horse (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3) that lived in the Chinese horse horse.
These spots are positive in terms of anti-SARS-CoV and SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 gene sequence.
This virus and other inflamed CoVs are 88 to 92 percent similar to the Nucleotide sequence of SARS-CoV.
These studies have become the foundation for a new theory that says the puppy is the host of new viruses that cause human disease.
Several crowns (SL-CoVs) were also identified in the shell, but none of them except WIV1 could be separated as a living virus.
Human Angiotensin Converter Enzyme 2 (ACE2) was identified as the SARS-CoV receptor.
WIV1, which was obtained from the scraper, showed that the ACE2 scraper, siot and humans are used as a receptor for entering the cell.
Interestingly, the serum of healed SARS patients had the ability to neutralize WIV1.
So far, WIV1 with a 95 percent likeness of the Nucleonide sequence, was the nearest SARS-CoV ancestor in the spine.
Although there are many associations between these two types of viruses, it is generally believed that the WIV1 virus is not the host of the SARS-CoV parent and the puppets, the host of the SARS-CoV tank.
Filogenetic analysis classifies MERS-CoV with similar groups like the CoV-HKU4 bat and the CoV-HKU5 bat.
Bat CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV use a similar host receptor called dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) to enter the virus.
MERS-CoV-related RNA-dependent polymerase RNA sequences are more phylogenically close to beta-CoVs identified from Europe and Africa.
So far, no living MERS-CoV has been found in wild spiders.
The MERS-CoV virus and its closest relative, CoV-HKU25, are only 87 percent similar in the sequence of nucleotid.
Therefore, the cranberries cannot be the host of the MERS-CoV cranberries.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that a mountain shark is positive in terms of the MERS-CoV special neutralizer, which also applies to the Middle East shark that live in African countries.
The live MERS-CoV, similar to the virus found in humans, was sampled from a mountain shark’s nose and showed that sharks are the real host of the MERS-CoV tank.
It is worth noting that the symptoms are generally mild and very high removal of the virus was observed in worms that were experimentally infected with MERS-CoV.
It is remarkable that infected worms spread the virus not only through the respiratory system, but through the outer - oral, which is also the main method of removing the virus in the foam.
However, one of the questions that has remained unanswered since then is that in many confirmed MERS cases there has been no history of contact with worms before the occurrence of symptoms, which is likely attributed to human transmission to humans or unknown transmission routes that include unknown species of animals.
SARS-CoV-2 has about 96.2 percent similarity of the sequence of the niclotide to the RaTG13 co-virus that is separated from the narcissus.
As in cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence transition between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is great to determine the parent relationship.
In other words, the puppy cannot host the SARS-CoV-2 tuberculosis tank unless the puppy coVs are almost identical in the future.
Probably, SARS-CoV-2 intermediate animal hosts, in which many primary cases of Quid-19 were seen, should be among wild animals sold and killed in the marine food market, which indicates the potential transmission of the virus from animal to human.
Recent studies based on metagenomic sequence show that a group of small-risked mammals known as pangolin (Manis javanica) can also be a refuge for ancestral beta-CoVs associated with SARS-CoV-2.
This new genetic species of the CoV pangoline virus is about 85 to 92 percent similar to the sequence of the niclotide to the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
However, these viruses are associated with approximately 90% similarity of the niclotide sequence as much as RaTG13.
These viruses are classified into two sub-bands of SARS-CoV-2 viruses in the phylogenetic tree, one of which has the same receptor connection range as SARS-CoV-2 and has a 97.4% amino acid sequence.
In contrast, the SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 RBDs have greater differences, of course with a higher degree of sequential similarity throughout the genome.
In a previous study conducted on the patient’s pinguins, it was that from liver samples, pieces of viral DNA were separated that were associated with SARS-CoV-2.
The study used various methods of obtaining sequence and manual correction to create a part of the genome sequence, which accounted for about 86.3% of the length of the virus genome.
We can’t deny the possibility that pinguin is one of the hosts of an animal mediator SARS-CoV-2.
However, at the moment there is no evidence that the origins of SARS-CoV-2 may be found in pangolin because there is a transition between the sequence of SARS-CoV-2 and the beta-CoV associated with SARS-CoV-2 pangolin.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even shorter than the distance between SARS-CoV- and SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoV associated with SARS-CoV-2 pangolin.
The evolutionary path of SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been achieved in pearls, pinguins and other mammals.
While the most sequential equations in RBDs are seen between SARS-CoV-2 and Pangolin, beta-CoVs associated with beta-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 have the highest genetic sequential equations.
It is assumed that the high degree of similarity that exists between the beta-CoV RBDs associated with SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 is caused by the evolution of a combination with a selective mediator.
Different suggestion is to support the re-combination of beta-CoVs associated with SARS-CoV-2 pangolin and RaTG13 in the third wild animal species.
Nitrocombination as a stimulating force in evolution, is common among beta-CoVs.
The judgment on animal origin SARS-CoV-2 has not been completed.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoVs, the animal origin of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 is still under study.
Phylogenetic evidence shows that both HCoV - NL63 and HCoV - 229 may be derived from spinal CoVs, while parental viruses HCoV-OC43 and HCoV - HKU1 are found in bacteria.
It is that the .ARCoV2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV), which is seen in the North American three-colored coat, has a close relationship with HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV - 229 E is genetically related to another coV infusion called Hipposideros / GhanaKwam / 19 / 2008 that was discovered in Ghana, while complomids are also suspected as the middle host of the virus.
To clarify the article, the existing knowledge about the animal origin of HCoVs known in Figure 1 and Table 2 is summarized.
Phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence of transition between species of HCoVs in history.
In 1890, when HCoV-OC43 was transmitted between different species of animals to infect humans through spiders, a pandemic caused a respiratory infection.
The history of transmission between species HCoV-229E is not very clear.
Alpha-CoVs that are closely related to HCoV-229E have been found.
Among them there is an alpha-CoV.
A number of evidence supports the direct transmission of the virus by spiders to humans.
First of all, humans and not alpacas can communicate with spiders in a common ecological environment.
Instead, humans have a close connection with alpha.
Secondly, alpha-CoVs associated with HCoV-229E are diverse and non-sick in spiders, while alpha-CoVs causing the spread of respiratory diseases in animals.
Ultimately, alpha-CoV is not found in wild animals.
Therefore, the possibility that alpacas have received alpha-CoVs associated with HCoV-229E from humans cannot be eliminated.
In fact, worms are a direct source of pathogenic viruses in humans, including the Harry virus, Ebola virus, Nipa virus, and the Hendra virus.
Therefore, it is not surprising that pimples directly transmit HCoV-229E to humans.
On the other hand, while alpha-CoVs operate as the HCoV-229E gene treasury, alpaca and a mountain shark may act as intermediate hosts that transmit viruses to humans, exactly as seen in MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is a great example of the transition between a species of spiders to a mountain shark and from shark to humans.
The source of MERS-CoV's evolutionary origin was evident from the very beginning of the virus's identification, and the subsequent findings strengthened the theory.
It is clear that spiders provide a rich warehouse of viral species to exchange genetic parts between species and translate between species.
Long lifetime, busy colonies, close social interaction and strong ability to fly are all the perfect conditions for the puppy that turns him into an ideal virus player.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been in the shark of a mountain for several decades.
The virus is well adapted to these shark and the shark has turned from a middle host to a stable and natural host.
MERS-CoV causes a very mild disease, and in these animals, the rate of mutations is relatively low.
The transition of this virus to humans is a random event, and humans are the host of the MERS-CoV block because its transition cannot be stable.
Compared to the role of cows in the MERS-CoV transmission, the role of pinguin, of course, if it plays a role in the SARS-CoV-2 transmission is different.
Especially that pangolin beta-CoV is very pathogenic.
These animals may host beta-CoVs associated with SARS-CoV-2, similar to siots in the case of SARS-CoV.
There are several possibilities of transmitting SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans, which should be accepted or rejected in future studies.
First of all, the puppy can host the SARS-CoV-2-related virus, almost similar to the SARS-CoV-2.
Humans may have a common ecological position with the puppy through crossing or coal extraction.
Secondly, pinguin can be one of the middle booster hosts where a SARS-CoV-2-related virus has recently entered.
The human being is infected with this virus through the cattle and the consumption of meat.
It is possible that many mammals, including pets, are exposed to SARS-CoV-2.
Examination of wild and wild animals is essential.
Thirdly, as mentioned above, the neutralization and compatibility of SARS-CoV-2 may have occurred in a third species that has been in contact with both puppets and pinguins.
The search for animal origin SARS-CoV-2 is still ongoing.
In addition to the different types of animal hosts, three other factors from the viral side are also important to facilitate the passage of the existing barriers.
First of all, the relatively high rate of mutations in their RNA reproduction.
The estimated mutation rate in the CoV virus, with an average replacement rate, is equivalent to approximately 10-4 replacement per year per site 2, depending on the stage of CoV compatibility with the new host, which, compared to other single-chain RNA viruses, can be considered “mediate” to “more”.
CoVs have an exoribonoclease error correction that can lead to very high mutations, myria or even a failure to survive.
Interestingly, the Nucleotide Analog Remdesivir through the inhibition of this exoribonoclease and RNA-dependent polymerases prevents the reproduction of CoV.
Remdesivir is one of the promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 factors that should be tested in clinical trials.
However, the mutation rate of CoVs is about a million times higher than their hosts.
In addition, the mutation rate is high when the CoVs are not well adapted to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV with a high mutation rate, the SARS-CoV-2 mutation rate is apparently lower, which indicates a higher level of human compatibility.
Probably, the virus is now adapted to another host that is close to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this applies to MERS-CoV which is well-compatible with a mountain shell.
In theory, it is unlikely that genetic modification could quickly disable vaccines and antivirus against SARS-CoV-2.
Secondly, the big RNA genome in the CoVs, increases the flexibility in the modification of the genome for genetic and neutro-combined mutations, thereby increasing the possibility of mutation between species, which contributes to the emergence of new CoVs in appropriate conditions.
This is supported by a large amount of unique open reading frameworks and protein functions that are encoded to the end of the 3' genome.
Thirdly, CoVs randomly and repeatedly change the templates during the time of RNA reproduction through the unique "copy-selection" mechanism.
In a host that acts as a mixing tank, string replacement occurs frequently at the time of CoV RNA rewrite.
Subgenomic RNAs, completely equal to long length, can be remixed together to produce new CoVs.
In both HCoV - HKU1 and HCoV - OC43, as well as animal CoVs such as bat - CoV and batCoV - HKU9, philogenetic evidence for natural nitrogenation has been found.
Viral interaction - hosts in relation to transmission
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, the interaction of the virus with the host recipient is another key factor affecting the transition between the species.
Here, the SARS-CoV neutrocombination is considered as a common example, which shows evidence of positive choice during the interspesial transfer event.
Based on comparative analysis between human separated samples and SARS-CoVs, it is believed that SARS-CoV in different hosts has a rapid adaptation, especially with mutations in RBD protein S.
Generally, the RBD in the protein S of the CoV virus interact with the cell receptor and triggers a strong host anti-wind reaction.
In the SARS-CoV virus, it is found in the amino acid 318 to 510 and on the S1 segment, which is connected to the human ACE2 and the common receivers of the virus.
RBD virus SARS - CoV is able to detect the ACE2 receptors of various animals including puppets, siots, rats and rockon dogs, which enables interspesial transmission to the virus.
In fact, it was observed that only the remaining 6 amino acids differ from the virus samples taken from humans and siots in RBD, and four of them are in the connector-receptor motif to interact with the ACE2 receiver.
SARS - CoV Seat has mutations of K479N and S487T in its RBD which may increase the desire for molecular protein interaction with the human ACE2 receiver.
In other words, these two amino acid successors may be vital for viral adaptation to humans.
It should be noted that SARS-CoV-2 has a cell receptor similar to SARS-CoV.
The 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in S1 protein unit shows that the tendency to connect S protein with human ACE2 may have changed.
In fact, a cryo-EM study shows that there is a tendency of 10 to 20 equals for this link between human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S protein.
It will also be interesting to determine whether or not another common recipient is needed to transfer SARS-CoV-2.
Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 is also connected to ACE2, but with another part of S.
There are many HCoV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E, and 9-O-acetylated sialic acid for HCoV - OC43.
These receptors may also explain the successful compatibility of these CoVs in humans after transmitting between species of animal hosts.
In addition to cellular receptors, the result of transition between species of HCoVs is also controlled by other host-related and restrictive factors.
The fluctuation of host proteins between humans and natural hosts of HCoVs such as pearls, single mountains and cattle can cause obstacles to the transition between species.
For a successful transition between species, HCoV must control host-related factors and eliminate host-restrictive factors.
In this context, molecular determining factors in this important field of viral-host interaction should be identified and identified.
Completely impartial screening in the gene limit of host dependency and restrictive factors for SARS-CoV-2 using advanced CRISPR technology can be fruitful.
The Birth of New HCoVs: From the Beginning
CoV diversity has provided plenty of opportunities for the emergence of new HCoVs.
In this case, spinal CoVs act as the HCoVs gene tank.
In addition, rapid and genetic mutations also promote the evolutionary course of HCoV and act as two important stages in this process.
For example, obtaining or losing new proteine coding genes has the potential to alter severe phenotypes of the virus.
Among the side proteins of SARS-CoV, it is believed that ORF8 protein plays an important role in human compatibility, since after separating the SARS-CoV-related spinal virus, it was revealed that this virus codes different ORF8 proteins.
The elimination feature of the Nucleotide-29 SARS-CoV virus was observed in separated spots at the beginning of the human epidemic.
This removal divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is thought to be a comparative mutation that helps change the host.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a potential neutrocombination history with the ancestors of Alpha and Gama CoVs, where a large number of smaller neutrocombination fields in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase were identified.
Neutrocombined locations were identified in nsp9, the major part of nsp10 and parts of nsp14.
It has also been shown that the MERS-CoV virus has experienced non-combined events between various ancestors that occurred in the Saudi monogamous shark.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, a non-combinative event has also been observed in other HCoVs where HCoVs are combined with other animal CoVs in their non-structured genes.
It should also be warned that artificial choice can contribute to unwanted changes in the viral genome, which is most likely caused by the release of viruses from the optional pressure applied, for example by the host immune system.
An example of these effects is the loss of ORF4 with full length in the primary sample race HCoV-229E due to the elimination of two nucleotids.
Despite the fact that untouched and complete ORF4 can be observed in HCoV-229 E-related viruses, alpha-CoV Alpacca with an extra single-nucleotide leads to a framework change.
The last point, of course, is that the evolution of new HCoVs is also guided by optional pressure in their tank hosts.
The absence of mild symptoms or symptoms was diagnosed when the puppies were infected with CoVs, which indicates the mutual compatibility between CoV and the puppies.
It seems that the spots are anatomically and physiologically well adapted to the CoVs.
For example, a defect in activating the pre-inflammatory reaction in the pimples effectively reduces the damage caused by CoVs.
In addition, the activity of the natural killer cell in the spots is suppressed due to the re-configuration of the NKG2/CD94 killer cell receptor and the low level of tissue compatibility of large complex molecules of class I.
In addition, a high level of roctive oxygen species (ROS), which is caused by the metabolic activity of the upper spiders, can both suppress the reproduction of CoV and affect the recurrence of the effect of exuribonoclease, thereby providing optional pressure for the production of highly pathogenic viral species when it comes to a new host.
CoV races that are most pathogens may lead to the acquisition of new protein or protein properties for host adaptability with nitrogenation.
So, it’s no coincidence that three new HCoVs have emerged over the past two decades.
CoVs are not pathogenic or cause mild symptoms in tank hosts such as pimples and sharks.
These viruses reproduce severely without facing a strong host immunity response.
Here is a mystery of why pregnant women are seen without any symptoms of the disease and what causes severe diseases in humans.
The severe symptoms are mainly due to the intense activity of the immune system and the cytocin storm, where the stronger the reaction of the immune system, the more severe liver damage will be.
In contrast, in carriers without any symptoms of the disease, the immune response is separated from the reproduction of CoV.
The strategy of separating the immunity reaction can have beneficial effects in treatment with an anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug.
Interferon responses in the spots are strong.
Therefore, management of type I interferon, at least in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans should be useful.
In addition, the activation of NLRP3 inflamase is defective.
With this argument, the inhibition of NLRP3 inflamase along with MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of Quid-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the overall content of the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV event.
While the beta-CoV is synergistic with SARS-CoV, there is also a beta-CoV synergistic with 96% synergistic with SARS-CoV-2.
While identified siots and other shelter market animals were SARS-CoV-like viruses, SARS-CoV-2 intermediate hosts have not yet been identified.
Pagoline beta-CoVs that are very similar to SARS-CoV-2 have been found and indicate that pagoline can act as one of the intermediate hosts or pagoline beta-CoVs can help to get genes in the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
There is still no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was created by humans deliberately or randomly.
CoVs have returned to the center of attention due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
The study of CoVs in puppets and other animals has strongly changed our understanding of the importance of HCoV animal origin and warehouses in transmission to humans.
Comprehensive evidence has shown that the origin of MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are spiders and are transmitted through intermediate hosts to humans.
Since the SARS-CoV infection arises from contact between humans and siots in the markets, the closure of the marine market and the killing of siots managed to effectively end the disease.
With the same argument, pinguins should be removed from the marine market to prevent the transmission of animals to humans, which is due to the discovery of several cases of beta-CoV ancestors of pinguins that are closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, clarification of how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted from pinguin and other mammals to humans still requires future research.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been present for a long time in the shadows of a mountain.
These worms are considered as an important means of transport as well as the main source of meat, milk, leather and peanut products for local people.
These sharks are widely spread in the Middle East and Africa.
So it is unlikely that, like what was done in the wildlife market in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, to control MERS, to sacrifice all the cows.
To prevent the repeated MERS spread, a comprehensive method should be adopted to produce anti-MERS-CoV vaccines for worms along with other pollution control criteria.
Because we are unable to remove these viruses, new genotypes may appear and cause the spread of the disease.
Species of common CoVs between humans and animals are circulating in wildlife.
Specifically, coVs with the potential for transmission from animal to human are very diverse.
There are many opportunities that these common CoVs between humans and animals grow and re-combine, leading to the emergence of new CoVs that are highly transmitted and devastating.
The culture of eating wild animals in some areas of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary connections between humans and animals.
With the hard test that SARS, MERS and Quid-19 had for us, we need to have a better plan for preparation and reaction.
In fact, many viruses have been on this planet for a long time.
They stay in their natural warehouses until there is a chance to get rid of them.
Although pimples have many features that help spread viruses, if people are trained to avoid them, the possibility of human contact with pimples and other wildlife species can be minimized.
Continuous surveillance of mammals is essential to better understand the ecology of CoVs and their natural hosts and will be useful in preventing the animal from spreading to humans and its spread.
As a result, the most effective way to prevent common viruses between humans and animals is to keep humans away from the ecological reservoirs of natural common viruses between humans and animals.
Several puzzles of animal origin SARS-CoV-2 have not yet been found.
First of all, if the puppy has transmitted an ancestral SARS-CoV-2 virus to the pinguin, it will be interesting to see under what conditions the puppy and the pinguin were able to be together in a common ecological position.
Second, if the spiders play a direct role in transmitting to humans, how humans contacted the spiders.
Third, if a third-party mammal has acted as a real intermediate host, how it interact with different species including humans, puppets and pinguins.
And finally, since many mammals, including pets, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both care and experimental transmission should be done.
Whether the animal is a puppy, pinguin or any other mammal, SARS-CoV-2 or her parents’ viruses that are almost the same are expected to be identified in their natural hosts in the future.
Continued research in this field will clarify the evolutionary path of SARS-CoV-2 in animals and will have significant consequences on the prevention and control of Quid-19 in humans.
A update of the Quid-19 diagnostic criteria is required for "such resources" and "approved resources"
On 6 February 2020, our team published a Fast Guide to the Diagnosis and Treatment of the 2019 Crohn Virus (2019-nCoV), which is a provider of our experience and a good reference to the fight against this all-inclusive disease worldwide.
However, the 2019 Crohn's disease is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge are gradually increasing based on advanced research findings and clinical experience; therefore, diagnosis and treatment strategies are constantly updated.
In this article, we presented an overview of our guidelines and provided the latest diagnostic criteria for "such resources" and "approved resources" based on the latest diagnosis and treatment guidelines for Quid-19 (seventh version) issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) caused the spread of the disease, which is now officially referred to as the 2019 coronavirus disease (Kawid-19) and is also referred to as acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) introduced the Quoid-19 as a pandemic.
Our team has created a quick guide to fight SARS-CoV-2 disease and published it online in the Journal of Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
This guide has attracted a lot of attention since its release.
Please note that Quid-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge is gradually increasing based on advanced research findings and clinical experience; therefore, diagnosis and treatment strategies are constantly updated.
For example, the Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines for Quid-19 issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, have been published a total of seven times, some of which have been modified.
Now Joe and colleagues have presented a view on our guide that includes a simple rating proposal based on their clinical experience.
Their articles added new evidence to our guide and also presented a valuable reference to this pandemic worldwide.
We confirm their outstanding work and declare their appreciation.
However, their articles should be updated in accordance with the latest diagnosis and treatment guidelines for Quid-19 (Seventh Edition) and recent studies.
According to the 7th edition (3 March 2020), in order to confirm suspicious cases, one of the characteristics of the history of allocated diseases should be combined with two cases of obvious clinical symptoms to provide a comprehensive analysis, or if there is no history of allocated diseases, three cases of obvious clinical symptoms should be met:
General history: (1) history of travel or residence in the city of Wuhan and surrounding areas, or other communities in which Covid-19 cases have been within 14 days prior to symptoms; (2) history of contact with patients with SARS-CoV-2 (with a positive nucleic acid test); (3) history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory disease from the city of Wuhan and surrounding areas, or other communities in which Covid-19 cases have been within 14 days prior to symptoms; (4) history of contact with certified clusters (more than 2 cases of fever or respiratory symptoms during 2 weeks in small areas such as home, office, school, etc.).
Clinical symptoms: (i)tuberculosis or respiratory symptoms; (ii)image characteristics of Quid-19 infection; (iii) the total number of white blood cells that indicate the normal number, increased reduced lymphocytes in the early stage of the disease.
The diagnosis of confirmed cases should be based on suspicious cases along with one of the pathogenic cases or serum evidence as follows: 1) PCR bladering test for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2; 2) the total genome sequence of the virus that shows a high homogeneity with the new coronavirus; 3) positive in terms of specific IgM antibodies and IgG antibodies SARS-CoV-2 serum test; or change specific IgG antibodies SARS-CoV-2 from negative to positive, or increase more than 4 times the titer in the recovery phase compared to the acute phase.
We can see that the PCR bladering test for nucleic acid in the respiratory system or blood samples has been added to the second edition (18 January 2020) and the third edition (22 January 2020).
The pathogenic diagnosis was added to the fourth edition (27 January 2020) and the fifth (February 8, 2020) and then the serum evidence was added to the seventh edition.
These changes were based on the continued work of researchers who were looking for an optimum nucleic acid diagnostics kit for quick diagnosis and also based on the sampling of the respiratory system included blood sampling that allowed more access to different samples and supported the positive antibodies of specific antibodies in approved standards.
In addition, there are more evidence that warns us to deal with unusual symptoms and patients without symptoms with caution.
Therefore, the joe chart and colleagues should be updated, because in this fluchart the person who has no clinical symptoms is classified as "low risk".
The rating system should also be confirmed in practice and with more clinical studies.
For the collection, we hope more evidence and evidence will be presented and we ask readers to present their opinions.
For the diagnosis of "such resources" and "approved resources", we recommend that doctors follow and follow the latest guidelines of their countries.
Our team will also regularly provide guidance to provide up-to-date help.
Bangladesh has five new deaths due to Kuwait-19, the highest daily figure ever.
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths due to the Quid-19 on this day.
This is the highest number of deaths per day due to the virus.
The Bangalore Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) that recorded cases of infection, including 114 active and 33 recovered cases, were resting at home.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, Director of the IEDCR, said in an online press conference the number of deaths was four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases were over 60 years old, two between 50 and 60 years old and one between 41 and 50 years old.
He also added that two of the victims were from Dakar.
On March 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the pandemic quoid-19.
One staff of the hospital told Anadolu news agency, a local news agency, that one of the dead, Jalal Sifur Rahman, was one of the directors of the Bangalore Anti-Corruption Commission who was carried out at the Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, Obaidul Quader, Bangladesh’s road transport and bridges minister, announced in an online video announcement that public transport will be closed until next Saturday, more than it was initially planned.
Public transport shutdown began on March 26 and was planned to end on Saturday, April 4.
Transport of basic goods - medical goods, fuel and food - continued.
The first case of Quid-19 recorded in Bangladesh on March 8 was two passengers returning from Italy as well as the wife of one of them.
On March 19, these three people healed.
SARS-CoV-2 has affected more than a million people worldwide.
The data from the Johns Hopkins University show that on Thursday, the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 in the world exceeded one million.
At least 52,000 deaths are attributed to Covid-19, a disease caused by the coronavirus.
With the confirmation of the first case of the Crown virus in Malawi and the first deaths related to the Crown virus in Zambia, this day became a turning point.
On Thursday, North Korea claimed that it is one of the few countries free from the coronavirus.
The World Health Organization 1,051,635 confirmed cases until yesterday, of which 79,332 were related to twenty-four hours before the 10th morning in Central European time (0800 UTC) on April 4.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of coronavirus have been registered, leading to at least 5,900 deaths.
CBS News, based on data from the Johns Hopkins University, that on Wednesday more than 1,000 deaths were recorded in the United States due to the coronavirus.
Several countries around the world have taken more rigorous measures to prevent the spread of this disease.
Moscow mayor Sergei Sobyanin on Thursday extended the city vacation to 1.
President Vladimir Putin has announced that Russian people’s wages will be paid without having to go to work by April 30.
The Portuguese parliament voted to extend the state of emergency for another 15 days; the law was passed with 215 votes for, ten votes for, and one against.
Saudi Arabia has extended the frequency limit in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina to all hours of the day; before, the frequency limit was applied only between 3 pm and 6 pm.
Thailand has planned to implement a frequency limit between 10 p.m. and 4 p.m.
Mike DeWine, Governor of Ohio, announced that the state has extended domestic charter rules to 1.
Australian stores have reduced the share of shopping towels for every purchase time.
The Woolworths and Coles chain stores in Australia, on Saturday and Sunday afternoon, reduced the restriction on the purchase of toilet towels in all country-level stores, respectively, to two and one packages for each purchase.
The ALDI store also announced on Monday the limitation of the purchase of a package.
These restrictions are announced in the form of messages on the boxes and on the Facebook page of these chain stores.
According to reports, buyers are scared of the need for a personal cartridge because of the Quid-19 outbreak to start buying and storing.
Also on Wednesday, Woolworths limited the purchase of toilet towels for home delivery to one package for each order.
These changes continued to apply to the limit of the previous four packages for each purchase which was announced by Woolworths and Coles on 4 and 5 March, respectively.
In a press release on March 8, the Coles store announced that, despite the four-pack purchase restrictions, "the existence of many stores will end within an hour" and called this demand "unprecedented", the ALDI store also described it on Tuesday on its Facebook page as "unpredictable".
According to Woolworths' spokesman, sales rates experienced a "strict increase" last week.
The Costco store in Canberra also limited the amount of licensed purchases to two packages last week.
To reduce this deficiency, Coles has ordered larger packages to suppliers and increased the frequencies of delivery of goods to stores, Woolworths has ordered more stock. ALDI has made stock related to one of the special sales plans available earlier on Wednesday.
Russell Zimmerman, Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Retail Association, announced that retailers are trying to increase their stock, but local council restrictions on the timing of goods delivery trucks have made it difficult.
He said he expects the production costs to increase because suppliers are trying to respond to demand and special sales are reduced.
On Tuesday, the ALDI store announced that some stores are unable to hold special sales on Wednesday due to early stock supply.
Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail expert from Queensland University of Technology, said in a report on News.com.au that stores fill their warehouses every night.
He added that the size of the toilet towels leads to a small stock of stores, and when the product is finished, it leaves a lot of space in the shelves and causes a feeling of lack.
Russell Zimmerman told ABC News that Coles and Woolworths believe that if there are a lot of products in the box, if there are products such as toilet towels and anti-infectants in a high number and there is the possibility of buying them, your fear and fear will probably be minimized.
The company Who Gives a Crap, the manufacturer of recycled toilet towels last Wednesday announced that their warehouses were finished.
According to News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, which manufactures Kleenex toilet towels, and Solaris Paper, which manufactures Sorbent toilet towels, emphasized that they operate 24/7 to meet the existing demand.
Domain.com, one of the real estate sites, that when less auctions were held due to the buyers' holidays on the long weekends of the Workers' Day, some real estate sellers donated free toilet towels to the first auction offerers in Melbourne.
The Thursday version of NT News, which is one of the Darwin newspapers, had a special eight-borge letter to be cut and used as a toilet towel.
According to ABC Australia’s March 3 report, these stores were in principle unwilling to impose restrictions and announced that they had no plans to impose restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman added that there is a lot of demand for other goods, including masks, anti-infectants, dry goods, liquid and toilet soap and flour.
Outside Australia also similarly, the English online supermarket Ocado, on Sunday afternoon witnessed the application of restrictions on the purchase of Andres toilet towels in the amount of two packages of 12 rounds.
The World Health Organization has declared quo-19 a pandemic.
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced a pandemic of the quoid-19 disease - which is caused by the corona virus SARS-CoV-2.
Although the word “pandemy” only refers to the extent of a disease’s spread, not to the extent of its hazardousness, the WHO has emphasized the need to push governments to take countermeasures:
All countries can still change the duration of this pandemic.
Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO’s chief executive, said if countries put their people diagnosed, tested, treated, cartridges and tracked and prepared for them.
We are deeply concerned, both about the level of warning of the disease’s spread and severity, and about the level of warning of inappropriate action.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former head of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is "unprecedented".
In a statement released in February by CNN, he said, “Out of the flu, no other respiratory virus has been traced, from its birth to its continued global spread.
Ghebreyesus also said in the same statement: "We have never seen a pandemic created by a corona virus before."
He continued, “And before we had never seen a pandemic that was yet controllable.”
The new state as a pandemic was announced after the WHO’s decision in January to declare the spread of the disease as a public health emergency with international concern.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said about the spread of the disease: "The front line situation is getting worse."
Associated Press that until Thursday, there were at least 126,000 cases of Quid-19 worldwide, leading to more than 4,600 deaths.
The 20-2019 coronavirus pandemic is a progressive pandemic of the 2019 coronavirus disease (Kawid-19) which is caused by acute respiratory coronavirus 2 syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
This epidemic was identified in December 2019 in Wuhan China and was declared as a public health emergency on January 30, 2020 with international concern and was recognized as a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
By April 10, 2020, about 1.61 million cases of Quid-19 were in 210 countries and territories, leading to about 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people have been healed.
Death rates in China are estimated to be about 4%, while worldwide varied from 0.08% in New Zealand to 13.04% in Algeria.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and breathing difficulty.
Their complications may include the nature of the rhinitis and acute respiratory disorder syndrome.
The period from the virus entering the body to the beginning of the symptoms is usually about five days, but it can vary between two to fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or special treatment for it.
Primary treatment is symptom treatment and support treatment. Recommended preventive measures include washing the hands, covering the mouth during cough, getting away from other people and monitoring and personal carnival for people who are suspicious of infection.
Authorities in different countries of the world have reacted to the virus by applying travel restrictions, cartoon, military government, risk control at work and closing different places.
This pandemic has led to severe economic and social disorders, the delay or cancellation of sports, religious, political and cultural events and the widespread lack of resources that is aggravated by nerve purchases.
Schools and universities in 193 countries have been closed either nationally or locally, affecting 99.4 percent of students and students worldwide.
False information about the virus has spread online and cases of foreign fear and discrimination against the Chinese people and other people with the race and appearance of Eastern and Southeast Asia as well as other people from areas with widespread viral spread have occurred.
Due to travel restrictions and heavy industries shut down, air pollution and carbon emissions have decreased.
Health officials in Wuhan, China (the capital of the Hubei province) a group of cases of unknown cause in December 31, 2019 and early January 2020, the investigation in the field began.
These cases were mainly linked to the air marine wholesale market and that’s why it is believed that the virus was of animal origin.
The virus that caused the spread of the disease, known as SARS-CoV-2, is a newly discovered virus that is closely linked to the corona of the puppy virus, the corona of the pangoline virus and the SARS-CoV. It was later revealed that the first known person with symptoms was sick on 1 December 2019 and that person had no noticeable connection with the next group related to the seafood market.
It was revealed that of the initial cases in December 2019, two-thirds of them were related to the market.
On March 13, 2020, an unconfirmed report from the South China Morning Post claimed that one infection was traced on November 17, 2019, a 55-year-old man from the Hubei province who could be the first infection. on February 26, 2020, the WHO that despite the decline in cases in China according to reports, there was a sudden increase in cases in Italy, Iran and South Korea, and for the first time the number of new cases outside of China has exceeded the number of new cases within China.
The number of cases may be significantly less than the fact, especially among people with milder symptoms.
Until February 26, a relatively small number of cases of infection was among young people, and people aged 19 and less accounted for only 2.4% of the cases worldwide. Patrick Vallance, senior scientific adviser in the UK, estimated that about 60% of the British population should be infected in order to effectively collective immunity.
It means the number of people who tested for Quid-19 and their test was announced on the basis of official positive protocols.
Until March 23, no country has tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland, have adopted a formal policy to not test people with only mild symptoms.
A study published on March 16 found that by January 23 about 86% of cases of Quid-19 were not identified, and these were not registered, the source of 79% of cases registered.
A statistical analysis published on March 30 estimated that the number of cases in Italy was significantly higher than.
The initial estimates of the Basic Surface Number (R0) for Quid-19 were between 1.4 and 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Center for Disease Prevention and Control concluded that this number could be 5.7.
Most people with Quid-19 get healed.
For those who don’t get healed, the period of symptoms start to death was between 6 to 41 days, and the most common period was 14 days.
By April 10, 2020, 97,000 deaths were attributed to the Quid-19.
In China, by February 5, about 80% of deaths were in people over the age of 60 and 70% of them were affected by underlying diseases including cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. Official statistics of the number of deaths and deaths caused by Pandemic Quid-19 generally indicate the deaths whose tests for Quid, based on official protocols, were positive.
The actual number of deaths and deaths caused by Quid-19 can be much higher, as these figures may not include people who have died without testing – for example at home, in nursing centers, etc.
Inadequate data from Italy showed that the number of untested deaths during the pandemic was about 5-4 times more than the official death toll of Quevid.
A spokesman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said "We know that [death ratio announced] is less than the actual rate," which coincides with informal reports of less impacting statistics in the U.S. Such actions often occur in pandemies, including in the multiplication of H1N1 swine flu in 2009. the first confirmed death occurred on January 9, 2020 in Wuhan.
The first death occurred outside China on 1 February in the Philippines and the first death occurred outside Asia on 14 February in France.
By February 28, outside the main territory of China, more than a dozen deaths were recorded in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
Until March 13, deaths were in more than 40 countries and governmental territories on all continents except the South Pole.
These numbers vary depending on the region and over time and are influenced by the rate of tests, the quality of the health system, the treatment options, the time spent from the initial outbreak and the population characteristics such as age, gender and general health status. the mortality rate is obtained by dividing the number of deaths on the total cases diagnosed within a time period.
According to the statistics of the University of Johns Hopkins, the global mortality rate by 10 April 2020 is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204).
This number is different in each area.
In China, the estimated mortality rate decreased from 17.3% (for people whose symptoms began from 10-1 January 2020) to 0.7% (for those whose symptoms began after 1 February 2020).Other measurements include the case death rate (CFR) that indicates the percentage of identified people who die from a disease and the disease death rate (IFR) that indicates the percentage of identified and unidentified people who die from a disease.
These statistics have no time limit and a specific population follows from infection to file resolution.
A number of academics have tried to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The evidence-based University of Oxford Medical Center estimates that the death rate for this pandemic is generally between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The maximum estimate of this range is compatible with the results obtained from the first random Quid-19 test in Germany, as well as the statistical study that analyzes the impact of the test on the CFR estimate.
The WHO says this pandemic is controllable.
About the peak and the final duration of this outbreak, it cannot be definitely commented and may vary depending on the location.
Maciej Boni, from Penn State University, said: “Common infectious diseases usually become stable if no measures are taken to control them and begin to decrease when the disease gets out of the hosts available.
But at the moment, it is impossible to provide any reasonable prediction about when this will happen.
Zhong Nanshan, senior medical consultant of the Chinese government, argued that if all countries were mobilized to follow the World Health Organization’s recommendations on measures to counter the viral spread, “this disease could end by June.”
Adam Kucharski of the London School of Tropical Health and Medicine on March 17 announced that SARS-CoV-2 "probably will be in circulation for one or two years."
According to the research conducted by Neil Ferguson at the Royal College, physical removal and other measures will be necessary "until a vaccine is made (probably lasts 18 months or more)"
William Schaffner from Vanderbilt University said, "I think the chance that the corona virus will completely disappear is low - because it is easily transmitted" and "it can become a seasonal disease that returns every year."
The intensity of this return will depend on the collective immunity and the intensity of the mutation.
The symptoms of Quid-19 may be relatively non-specific, and people with Quid-19 may be without any symptoms.
Two of the most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Symptoms that have less prevalence include fatigue, breast confusion, loss of smell, breathing difficulty, muscle and joint pain, throat pain, headache, trembling, vomiting, high blood, diarrhea and cyanosis. World Health Organization that about one in six people gets severe illness and breathing difficulties.
The U.S. Center for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) has published a list of emergency symptoms: difficulty in breathing, feeling pain or constant pressure in the chest, sudden discomfort, difficulty awakening, swelling in the face and lips; if these symptoms occur, it is recommended to take immediate medical treatment. More progress of this disease can lead to severe inflammation, severe respiratory disorder syndrome, septic shock, and even death.
Some people may be without symptoms, have no clinical symptoms but the test results confirm their disease, so researchers have recommended that people who have had close contact with people with the disease should be carefully monitored and tested to prevent their contamination.
The estimates made by China varied from the rate of people with symptoms from very low amounts to 44%.
The usual infection period (the time between the person's infection to the appearance of symptoms) varies from one to 14 days; in the most common case, this period is five days. As an example of uncertainty, the statistics of some people with Quid-19 who lose their smell sensation were at first 30% but later decreased to 15%.
Some details about how the disease spreads are still being revealed.
It is believed that the disease spreads mainly through a close connection and through small particles produced by cough, sweat or speaking; and a close connection means a distance between 1 and 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Research has shown that coughing without covering can spread small particles between 4.5 meters (15 ft) and 8.2 meters (27 ft).
Some studies have suggested that the virus can also be transmitted by small particles that are produced by speaking and remain in the air for longer periods. although the virus is not generally aerobic, but small respiratory particles can be produced by breathing, including speaking.
These small particles can land in the mouth or nose of neighbors or be transmitted through breath to their lungs.
Some medical actions such as respiratory pipeing and renal cardiovascular resuscitation (CPR) can lead to the spread of respiratory emissions in the air and consequently the epidemic of the disease.
This disease is also transmitted when a person touches an infected surface including the skin and then touches his eyes, nose or mouth.
Although there are concerns about the possibility of the disease to be transmitted through the eruption, it is believed that the risk is low.
The Chinese government has denied the possibility of the SARS-CoV-2 endocrine transmission.While there is also the possibility of the transmission of the disease before the symptoms appear and the subsequent stages of the disease, the highest prevalence of the virus is in the first three days of the symptoms appear.
People whose test results were positive for the disease up to three days before the symptoms appear, show that the transmission of the disease is possible before the symptoms appear significantly.
There are few reports of signs-free cases confirmed by the laboratory, but signs-free transmission has been identified by some countries during communication tracking research.
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) said that although the rapid spread of the disease is not completely clear, one person can usually infect two or three other people.
Specifically, it has been identified that the virus will survive up to three days on plastic levels (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel, up to one day on the coat and up to four hours on the copper.
However, these amounts can change depending on moisture and temperature. so far cases of positivity have occurred as a result of the animal and other animals test for Quid-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, however, British officials recommend that people wash their hands after contact with animals, just as they are in contact with other levels that infected people may have touched.
Early respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus that was first identified by three people with an arthritis who were in contact with a group of people with a severe respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All the characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus, in the corona of related viruses occur in nature. outside the human body, this virus is killed by the domestic soap that removes its protective cover. SARS-CoV-2 has a close connection with the original SARS-CoV.
It is believed that the virus is of animal origin.
Genetic analysis has shown that the corona virus is genetically a subtype of the baccarat virus (Generation B) along with two genes derived from the baccarat.
At the general genome level, the virus is 96 in line with other coronavirus (BatCov RaTG13) samples.
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there was only one amino acid in certain parts of their genome sequence between the pandolines and humans.
The complete genome comparison has come to the conclusion that up to 92% of the genetic material is common between the corona of the pandoline virus and the SARS-CoV-2, which is not enough to prove that the pandolines are the intermediate host.
Infection by the virus, can temporarily be diagnosed through symptoms, however, the final confirmation is done through the reverse polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of infected emissions or CT imaging.
Research that compares PCR to CT in Wuhan has suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR and is at the same time less specific as many CT imaging properties are associated with other inflammatory liver diseases and disease processes.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that "CT should not be used as a screening or initial test for the diagnosis of Quid-19."
The World Health Organization has published several RNA test protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was published on January 17.
This test uses the momentary reverse polymerase reverse reaction (rRT-PCR).
This test can be done on respiratory and blood samples.
The results of this test are usually determined between several hours to a few days.
Usually this test is performed with a Nazovarenx slurry, however, the throat slurry can also be used. a number of laboratories and companies are working on serological tests that detect antibodies.
Until April 6, 2020, none of these methods were accurate enough to be approved for widespread use.
In the United States, a serological test invented by Cellex for emergency use is only certified by some trusted laboratories.
Characteristics of imaging in computer radiography and tomography (CT) people with symptoms include incomparable surrounding large-screen screens and absence of side disturbances.
The Association of Radiology Italy is collecting an international online database of imaging findings of confirmed cases of the disease.
Imaging without PCR confirmation, due to its compatibility with other infections, such as adenovirus, is not specifically used to identify Quid-19.
A large study in China compared the CT results of the chest with the PCR and showed that although less specific imaging is used to diagnose the disease, it is faster and more sensitive and suggested to be used as a screening tool in areas with allocation.
Complex nerve networks based on artificial intelligence have been developed to detect the imaging properties of the virus by both radiography and CT.
Some methods to prevent the transmission of this disease include adjusting personal health, washing hands, hand-to-eye eyes, nose or mouth by sitting hands and taking towels when cough or swallow and throwing towels directly into the waste container.
Those who have previously suffered from this disease are advised to wear a surgical mask in public environments.
It is also recommended to comply with physical distances to prevent the transmission of the disease. Many governments do not prohibit or recommend unnecessary travel to countries or regions where the disease is common.
However, the virus has reached a phase of spread in many parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within communities and some people don’t know where or how they’ve been infected. People who provide health care for potential patients are advised to follow standard precautions, contact-related precautions and use eye protection. Tracking calls is one of the important practices for health officials to identify the source of contamination and prevent more transmission.
The use of mobile location information by governments for this purpose has raised concerns regarding privacy and Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement to limit this type of surveillance.
Various mobile apps are created or proposed to be used voluntarily, and by April 7, 2020, more than a dozen groups of experts are trying to find solutions that do not violate privacy, such as using Bluetooth to record the user’s approach to other mobile phones.
Then, users receive a message if they are in close contact with a person with Quid-19.Some misconceptions about how to prevent the disease are spreading; for example, washing the nose or swelling with mouth washing are not effective ways.
Although many organizations are trying to make a vaccine, there is still no vaccine for Quid-19.
To prevent the spread of the disease, hand washing is recommended.
CDC recommends that people regularly wash their hands with water and soap for at least twenty seconds, especially after bathing or when the hands are clearly dirty; before eating; after emptying the nose, cough or swelling.
This is because the virus is killed outside the human body with domestic soap, which is destroyed by a protective bubble.
CDC also recommends when water and soap are not easily available, use alcohol-based disinfectants with a minimum of 60% alcohol volume.
The World Health Organization advises people to avoid touching their eyes, nose and mouth with sitting hands.
Removing contamination from levels is possible in various ways (one minute exposure to anti-inflammatory substances for the level of stainless steel), including 71-62% ethanol, 100-50% isoprophanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide and 7.5-0.2% betadine.
Other methods, including benzalconium chloride and gluconate chlorhexidine, are less effective.
CDC recommends that if there is a suspected or confirmed case of quoid in a building such as the office or daily care center, all sections such as offices, health services, common areas, common electronic devices such as tablets, touchpages, keyboards, remote controls and automatic payments used by patients should be anti-infectious.
Health organizations have advised people to cover their mouth and nose with their armbands or towels when cough or sweat, and to throw the towels away immediately.
For people who are likely to be infected, surgical masks are recommended because wearing a mask can reduce the volume and distance of throwing of particles that spread when speaking, sweat or cough.
The World Health Organization has issued guidelines on the time and how to use the mask.
According to Stephen Griffin, Leeds University virologist, "wear a mask can reduce people's desire to touch their faces, which is one of the major sources of infection if they do not adhere to proper hand health."The use of the mask is also recommended for those who take care of suspicious people of the disease.
The World Health Organization recommends wearing a mask by healthy people only if they are at high risk, such as those who take care of people with Quid-19, however, they also confirm that wearing a mask helps people avoid losing their face.
Many countries have begun to encourage people to wear masks.
In the United States, the CDC recommends using non-medical masks made of fabric. China specifically recommended the use of single-use medical masks by healthy people in the community, especially when they have close contact with other people (1 meter (3 ft) or less).
Hong Kong has recommended use of surgical masks when using public transportation or stopping in busy places.
Thai health officials encourage people to make a mask at home using clothes and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned people from going out and attending the community without wearing a mask or covering their mouth and nose.
On March 16, Vietnam asked all people to wear masks when they went to public places, to protect themselves and others.
The Australian government has forced to wear a mask for those visiting food stores.
Israel has urged all its inhabitants to make masks when they attend the meeting.
Taiwan, which has produced ten million masks per day since the middle of March, has forced passengers of inter-city trains and buses to wear masks since April 1.
Panama has forced to wear a mask when going out and has advised those who can’t buy a mask to make a home mask themselves.
Masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) includes pollution control measures aimed at slowing the spread of the disease by minimizing the close connection between individuals.
These practices include cartoon; travel restrictions; shops and workplaces, stadiums, theatres and shopping centers.
People can do these practices by staying at home, limiting travel, refusing to be in busy areas, greeting and asking without contact and physically distant from others.
Currently, many governments in areas where the disease is spread have forced or recommended social distraction.
The maximum recommended number of people gathered by U.S. government agencies and health agencies, rapidly decreased from 250 people (if there was no spread of Quid-19 disease in the area) to 50 people and later to 10 people.
On March 22, 2020, Germany banned the gathering of more than two people. Elderly people and those with background diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory diseases, blood pressure and immune system defects are at greater risk of severe complications and the CDC has recommended this category of people to stay at home as far as possible in areas where the disease has spread in society. At the end of March 2020, the World Health Organization and other health institutions began to replace the use of the word "social distancing" with "physical distancing", to clearly show that the goal of this work is to reduce physical communication and whileining social relationships, whether virtually and remotely.
The use of the word "social separation" instead of encouraging people to maintain communication using alternative methods, indicated that people should enter complete social isolation. Some officials issued guidelines on sexual health, for use during this pandemic.
These guidelines included recommendations about having sex only with the person you live with, a person who is not viral or has no symptoms of the virus.
For people who have been diagnosed with Quid-19 and those who are suspicious of being infected, a personal cornea is recommended at home.
Health organizations have specified small guidelines for the right personal carnival. Many governments have forced or recommended the personal carnival for all people living in areas affected by the virus.
The most strict personal cardinal instructions are issued for those who are in high-risk groups.
Those who may have been in contact with people with Quid-19 and those who have recently travelled to the country or region where the disease has spread widely, are advised to follow the personal carnival for 14 days from the date of the last contact.
Control strategies of a disease's spread include inhibition, oppression and reduction.
The prevention is carried out in the early stages of the spread and with the aim of tracking and separating the affected people as well as introducing other measures to control the disease and vaccination to stop the spread to the rest of the population.
When preventing the spread of the disease is no longer possible, efforts are shifted towards a reduction strategy: measures are taken to reduce the spread rate and reduce its effects on the health system and society.
A combination of removal and reduction measures can be implemented simultaneously.
Repression requires more intense measures to reverse pandemic by reducing the base spread number to less than 1.The part of managing the spread of a infectious disease is an attempt to reduce the peak of spread which is known as the spread curved.
This reduces the risk of excessive pressure on health services and provides more time for the production and development of vaccines and treatments.
Non-medicinal interventions that can help manage the spread of this disease include personal preventive measures including the observance of hand health, wearing a mask, personal cartridges; social measures aimed at physical distraction including the shutdown of schools and the cancellation of events in which there is a large assembly of people; social participation to encourage the acceptance and observance of these interventions; as well as environmental measures such as cleaning levels.
Other countries also implemented a series of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea has conducted a local group and cardinal inspection and issued warnings on the movement of people affected.
Singapore considered financial support for those who suffer from carnation and imposed heavy fines for those who did not do so.
The simulations made for the UK and the United States show that the reduction strategy (cutting down the spread and not stopping it) and the oppression (reversing the growth of the spread) are facing major challenges.
Optimal reduction policies can reduce the peak of health demand to 2/3 and the mortality rate to half, but still lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths and excessive pressure on the health system.
Repression can be a better strategy, but it should beined as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or as long as the vaccine is prepared, if this happens earlier), because if the measures are abandoned, the prevalence rate will quickly return to the previous amount.
Long-term intervention to suppress this pandemic leads to social and economic costs.
There is no certified antiviral drug for Quid-19, however, efforts to build it are underway, including testing available medications.
Using medications without the need for a rescue of the cold, drinking liquids and rest can help reduce the symptoms.
Depending on the severity, it may require oxygen therapy, venous fluid injection and respiratory aid devices.
Using steroids can worsen the conditions.
Several compounds that have been previously certified for the treatment of other viral diseases are being examined to be used if useful for the treatment of Quid-19.
The World Health Organization has also announced "a number of traditional and domestic drugs" that can help relieve SARS-CoV-19 symptoms.
The World Health Organization has described increased capacity and adaptation of the health system to the needs of Quid-19 patients as one of the key measures to cope with the spread of the disease.
ECDC and the European Regional Office of the World Health Organization have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary health care services to transfer resources to different levels, including the focus of laboratory services on the Quid-19 test, removing unnecessary surgical operations if possible, separating and isolating patients with Quid-19 and increasing the capacity of special care by training staff and increasing the number of ventilators and beds available.
There are different opinions about where the origin of the first case (the so-called zero patient) was.
The first case of the new corona virus may return to 1 December 2019 in Wuhan, Hobby, China.
Over the course of a month, the number of cases of the corona virus in Hobby gradually increased.
Most of these people were linked to the wholesale market of havana seafood, which also sold living animals, and one of the theories is that the origin of the virus was a species of these animals; in other words, the virus has an animal origin. A group of people with an unknown cause was observed on December 26 and was treated by Dr. Zhang Jixian at the Hubei Provincial Hospital, which on December 27 informed the issue to Wuhan Jianghan CDC.
On December 30, a group of doctors at the Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues about a "sars-like coronavirus".

Further official data show that 6,174 people had symptoms by January 20, 2020. by March 26, the United States had the highest confirmed number of cases of infection in the world, ahead of China and Italy. by April 9, 2020, more than 1.31 million cases were worldwide; more than 97,000 people died and 364,000 people recovered.
About 200 countries and governmental territories have had at least one cases of infection.
Due to this pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Shenzhen region have restricted free movement and started border controls.
National reactions included measures to prevent the spread of the disease including cartridges (which is known as the order of stay at home, the order of shelter or the cartridges at home) and the military government. By April 2, in the United States about 300 million people or about 90% of the population were under a kind of cartridges at home, in the Philippines, more than 50 million people, in South Korea about 59 million people and in India 1.3 billion people were placed in cartridges at home.

Some Chinese officials, including Zhao Lijian, rejected their previous confirmation of the start of the coronavirus spread from Wuhan and raised a conspiracy theory on whether the origins of Quid-19 were from the United States or Italy.
Donald Trump’s administration named the corona virus as “Chinese virus” or “Wuhan virus” and announced that “Chinese sensors have intensified the virus and transformed it into a global pandemic,” these statements, in turn, were criticized by some critics, as racism and “a step to distract the public mind from the failure of his government to combat the disease.”
Daily Beast reached some U.S. government information that described a media trick whose origin was clearly the National Security Council and called the strategy "All is related to China."
We were told to try and use all possible tools, including press conference and television presence, to transmit this message."Media including Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg have claimed that China's efforts to send aid to countries where the virus has spread are part of the advertising pressure for global influence.
Josep Borrell, the EU’s foreign policy chief warned that “there is a geopolitical component that includes an effort to influence through news and policy of generosity.”
Borrell also said that "China wants to communicate this message with a great excitement that, unlike the United States, is a responsible and reliable partner."
China also, as it reports, has sent aid to the countries of Venezuela and Iran, asked the United States to repeal its sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran.
On April 3, U.S. sanctions prevented the reach of 100,000 Jack Ma donation masks to Cuba.
U.S. officials have also been accused of transferring aid to other countries to their own country.
There were also disputes on the mask between different countries such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland; and the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey has captured hundreds of ventilator machines that were moving to Spain.
In early March, the Italian government criticized the European Union’s unity with Italy, which had suffered a lot of negative effects from the corona virus.
Maurizio Massari, Italy’s ambassador to the European Union, said that “only China responded.
This is not a good sign for Europe’s unity.”
On March 22, Russian President Vladimir Putin, after a telephone call with Italian Prime Minister Joseph Conte, ordered the Russian army to send military drugs, special disinfectants and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa on the promise of an unknown "high-level political source" that 80 percent of Russian aid was "unconsumable or low-use" for Italy.
The source accused Russia of starting a "geopolitical and diplomatic" appearance.
Attilio Fontana, President of Lombardy and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio, rejected the media report and expressed appreciation for the aid.
Russia also sent a cargo aircraft containing medical assistance to the United States.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said "Putin, when sending assistance to American partners, believes that when American manufacturers of medical equipment are strengthened and moving, they will be able to repay this action if necessary."
NATO’s “Defender 2020” military exercise will be held in Germany, Poland and the Baltic countries, which is the largest NATO military exercise since the end of the Cold War, on a more limited scale.
Kate Hudson, Secretary-General of the Nuclear Disarmament Campaign, criticized the Defender 2020 exercise and said, “In the current public health crisis, this exercise not only threatens the lives of U.S. soldiers and many participating European countries, but also threatens the lives of the inhabitants of the countries where the exercise is held.”
Iran's President Hassan Rouhani on March 14, 2020 wrote a public letter to the world's leaders, saying that his country is trying to fight the spread of the disease because of the lack of access to the global markets as a result of the U.S. sanctions against Iran. The spread of the disease has led to submitting requests to the U.S. to adopt common social policies in other wealthy countries, some of these policies include universal health care, universal child care, family leave with rights and higher levels of budget for public health.
Political analysts have predicted that the disease could have a negative impact on the chance of re-election of Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election.
After Japan announced that any person coming from South Korea to Japan will be cartridges for two weeks in the locations specified by the government, South Korea criticized "the Japan's obscure and negative attempts on the cartridges."
The South Korean community was initially bipolar about President Moon Jae-in’s response to the crisis.
Many Korean people signed lawsuits for Moon's withdrawal for what they called badly managing the government, and others admired his reaction that allowed countries to adopt emergency laws in response to it.
Some analysts have expressed their concerns that the disease could allow governments to gain more power.
The Hungarian parliament allowed Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to personally draft law, suspend parliament and elections for unlimited time, and punish those who seem to have spread misinformation about the virus and how the government manages the crisis.
The coronavirus spread is the main factor in several cases of lack of resources due to increased use of equipment to cope with the spread of the disease, nerve purchases and disorders in logistics operations and factories.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings about the lack of medications and medical equipment due to increased consumer demand and disturbance in suppliers.
Several locations have also seen a nerve shopping that has led to the emptiness of the shelves of essential items such as food, toilet towels and mineral water, causing a sense of lack of resources.
In particular, the technology industry has warned about delays in the transport of electronic goods.
According to Tedros Adhanom, Director-General of the World Health Organization, the demand for personal protection equipment has been 100 times greater.
This demand has led to prices rising to twenty times the normal price, causing a delay in the supply of medical goods for four to six months.
It has also led to a lack of personal protection equipment worldwide, and the World Health Organization has warned that this will threaten health workers.
In Australia, this pandemic provides a new opportunity for daigou buyers to sell Australian products to China.
This activity caused the lack of dry milk in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian government. Despite the high prevalence of Quid-19 cases in northern Italy and the Wuhan region and its subsequent high demand for food, both regions have been abandoned from severe food deficiency.
The actions taken by China and Italy have succeeded in fighting the illegal consumption and purchase and sale of raw materials and have helped prevent the severe food deficiency that was predicted in Europe and North America.
Northern Italy has not experienced a severe deficit with considerable agricultural products, but according to industry representatives, prices may rise.
Even in the city of Wuhan, it was only occasionally seen that food boxes were empty and Chinese government officials supplied pig meat stocks to the market to ensure people had proper nutrition.
There are similar laws in Italy that require food producers to have warehouses for such emergencies.
The damage to the global economy in China has been felt: According to a media report on March 16, China's economy in the early two months of 2020, due to the government's measures to reduce the viral spread and a severe decrease in retail to 20.5%, had a very heavy blow.
Since China's main land is one of the world's main economies and production poles, the spread of this virus is considered a major destabilizing threat to the global economy.
Agathe Demarais of the Economist’s data unit has predicted that markets will remain unstable until a clearer picture of the potential consequences of the current situation is clear.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the negative economic consequences of the epidemic on global growth could be more than the consequences of SARS in 2004-2002.
An estimate of one of the Washington University experts in St. Louis shows a negative impact of more than $300 billion on the global supply chain that can last up to two years.
According to reports, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is "touching" after the sharp fall in oil prices due to the decline in demand from China.
The global exchange markets fell on February 24 due to a significant increase in the number of Quid-19 cases outside the main territory of China.
On February 27, due to increased concerns about the coronavirus spread, various U.S. stock exchanges, including NASDAQ-100, S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average, experienced their strongest fall since 2008, with the Dow index falling to 1191 units, the highest falling rate in a day since the economic crisis of 08-2007.
All three indicators ended the week with a decrease of more than 10%.
On February 28, Scope Ratings GmbH confirmed China's high credit rating but retained its negative view.
The stock markets again collapsed due to the fear of the corona virus and the highest decline occurred on March 16.
Many believe the economic crisis is likely.
Mohamed El-Erian, an economic expert, appreciated the emergency and timely action of central banks and governments.
Central banks are reacting faster than the 2008 financial crisis.
Because of travel ban, public places shut down, including tourist attractions, and government recommendations to refuse any travel around the world, tourism is one of the areas that has suffered the most damage.
As a result, many airlines including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas have canceled their flights due to a decrease in demand and the British regional airline Flybe was closed.
The negative effects of the virus on the cruise industry have been unprecedented so far.
Several train stations and ports were also closed.
This all-time coincided with Chunyun, which is one of the main seasons of travel and related to Chinese New Year's Holidays.
A number of events, including New Year's Festivals, in which a large population attended, were cancelled by national or regional governments, and private companies including Disneyland Hong Kong and Disneyland Shanghai also independently closed their stores and tourist attractions.
Many New Year’s Eve events and tourist attractions, including the Forbidden City in Beijing and the traditional temple exhibitions, were closed to prevent mass gathering.
In 24 cases from 31 provinces, municipalities and regions of China, officials extended the New Year's holidays to 10 February and ordered most workplaces not to reopen that date.
These regions accounted for 80% of GDP and 90% of exports of the country.
Hong Kong has raised the level of fighting against infectious diseases to its highest levels and declared a state of emergency, closed schools until March and canceled the New Year's Celebrations.
Visits to retail stores in Europe and Latin America decreased to 40%.
North American and Middle East retail stores saw a 60-50% drop in reviews.
The spread of the disease also led to a 43-33% decrease in pedestrian traffic to shopping centers in March compared to February.
Operators of major shopping centers around the world have taken other measures including increasing health, installing temperature scanners to check the body temperature of buyers and canceling events. According to estimates of the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the recession caused by this pandemic could cause between 14 and 22 million people in Latin America to serious poverty that without this pandemic, this situation would not be created for them.
In January and February 2020, at the peak of the pandemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
A large portion of the population of about 300 million rural immigrant workers, in domestic provinces, were stuck in their homes or in the Hubei province. in March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and requested government aid.
According to the predictions of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, the coronavirus spread could hurt 47 million jobs in the United States and unemployment rate could rise to 32%. holidays in India have caused tens of millions of Indian immigrant workers (who were paying daily) unemployment. A survey conducted by Angus Reid found that 44% of Canadian households have experienced some kind of unemployment. In Spain since the business closed in the middle of March 2020, about 900,000 workers have lost their jobs.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers submitted an application for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers submitted an application for a comprehensive credit plan. Nearly half a million companies in Germany sent their workers to short-term work plans with government grants known as Kurzarbeit.
The German short-term work compensation plan was also implemented by France and the UK.
The departments of the art and cultural heritage have also been deeply damaged by this pandemic, both the operations and human resources of the relevant organizations – both working and independent – have been damaged worldwide.
Organizations active in the field of culture and art have sought to continue to carry out their mission (which is often covered by government budgets) in the field of ensuring the access of the community to cultural heritage, preserving the safety of their employees and supporting the artists if possible.
By March 2020, museums, libraries, exhibition halls and other cultural institutions around the world and at different degrees were closed for an indefinite period and their exhibitions, events and exhibitions were cancelled or delayed.
Instead, a lot of efforts were made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another consequence of this recently rapidly accelerating disease is the cancellation of religious ceremonies, important sports events and other social events such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences and fashion exhibitions.
The Vatican announced that the ceremony of the Holy Week in Rome, which is held during the last week of the post and Christianity's treachment season, was canceled.
Many bishops have advised elderly Christians to stay at home instead of attending the Sunday Easter; some churches have made the church services available via radio, live streaming or television, and others have provided the possibility of attending the worship ceremony by car.
The Roman Catholic Bishops have closed their churches and prayer and St. Peter's Square has been empty from Christian visitors, other religious institutions have also canceled their services and restricted public assemblies in churches, mosques, churches, temples and tours.
The Ministry of Health of Iran announced the cancellation of Friday prayer in areas affected by the disease and the villages were later closed, while Saudi Arabia banned foreign visitors and residents from entering holy places in Mecca and Medina.
This pandemic has caused the most disturbance in the sports calendar worldwide since World War II.
Most important sports events including the 20-2019 European Champions League, the 20-2019 Top League, the Euro 2020, the 20-2019 NBA season and the 20-2019 NHL season have either been cancelled or postponed.
The spread of this disease caused the 2020 Summer Olympics program to start at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that the event "will be scheduled again for a date beyond 2020, maximum for the summer of 2021".Casinos and other gaming centers around the world have been closed and live poker competitions have either been cancelled or delayed.
This has caused many gamblers to come to online sites, many gambling sites have a significant increase in their registrations. the entertainment industry has also been damaged and many music groups have suspended or cancelled their concert tours.
Many major theaters, including Broadway, have also suspended all the shows.
Some artists have discovered ways to continue producing and sharing artwork through the Internet as a substitute for traditional live performances, including live streaming concerts or creating web-based “festivals” for artists to be able to perform, distribute and promote their works.
In the online space, many internet mammals are spread with the corona virus content so many of them are divided among the uncertainty available, to humor and issues.
Since the Quoid-19 outbreak, increased discrimination, foreign fear and racism has been observed against the Chinese people and the East Asian race as well as people who are in the heart of the disease in Europe, the United States and other countries.
In many countries, especially in Europe, Eastern Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region, cases of fear, suspicion and hostile behavior have been observed.
The reports from February (when most cases were still limited to China) indicate the rise of racist emotions in different groups around the world about whether Chinese people deserve the virus or experience reasonable torture.
Some countries in Africa also saw an increase in anti-China emotions.
Many inhabitants of Wuhan and Hobby have discrimination based on their regional background.
Supports from the Chinese people, both online and offline, are made from those in areas affected by the virus.
Following the spread of the disease to other countries, the people of Italy, the first European country to experience the severe Covid-19 outbreak, were also exposed to doubt and foreign fear. Citizens of countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea, trying to stop the outbreak of the disease, initially signed a bulletin to ban Chinese entrance to their country.
In Japan, the hashtag ChineseDontComeToJapan# became more popular on Twitter.
Chinese citizens, as well as other Asian citizens in the UK and the United States, increased rates of racist offenses and attacks against themselves.
U.S. President Donald Trump was criticized for naming the corona virus as a "Chinese virus", the word was racist and anti-Chinese criticism.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses carrying Ukrainian and foreign citizens who were evacuated from the Wuhan and were moving to Novi Sanzhary.
According to the reports, students from northeastern India, which had a joint border with China and were studying in main Indian cities, experienced harassment related to the coronavirus spread.
Dilip Ghosh, the head of the state department of the Bharatiya Janata Party in West Bengal, announced that the Chinese have destroyed nature and "this is why God has wasted them."
These statements were later condemned by the Chinese Consulate in Kalkutta and called “fake.”In China, this pandemic, a strange horror and racism against non-China inhabitants burned up, and foreigners were called “foreign occupations” and targeted “to throw out.”
Many newspapers with cash subscriptions have removed the subscription fee for the whole or part of the corona virus coverage.
Many scientific publishers have made scientific articles related to the spread of the disease available freely.
Some scientists quickly shared their results on pre-publishing servers such as bioRxiv.

The test for the coronavirus virus 2019 (Kovid-19) and the related SARS-CoV-2 virus, includes methods for diagnosing the presence of the virus and patterns produced in response to this infection.
The presence of the virus in the samples is confirmed by RT-PCR that identifies the corona virus.
This is a special test and only the RNA detects the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
This test is used to confirm very new or active infections.
The diagnosis (serology) can be used both for the diagnosis and monitoring of the population.
The test shows how many people have been affected by the disease, taking into account people who have had very mild symptoms and have not or have had no symptoms at all.
Using the results of this test, the exact mortality rate of the disease and the massive level of immunity in the population can be identified.
Due to limited tests, by March 2020, no country has reliable data about the prevalence of the disease in its population.
Until March 23, no country has tested more than 3% of its population and there are great differences in the number of tests carried out between countries.
This difference will likely affect the significant reported case mortality rate, which is likely to be exaggerated in some countries.
This test, which uses the instant reverse polymerase reverse (rRT-PCR) chain reaction, can be done on respiratory samples that are mixed in different ways, including Nazopharnex slurry or samples.
The results of this test are usually determined between a few hours and two days.
The RT-PCR test, which is performed with throat swelling, provides reliable results only in the first week of the disease.
After that, the virus can disappear from the throat, while it is reproducing in the lungs.
For infected people who are tested in the second week, alternative samples can be taken by a section catcher from the depth of the respiratory tract, or there is also the possibility of using substances resulting from coughing (mixture).
One of the first samples of the PCR test was invented in January 2020 at Charité in Berlin using the instant reverse polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) and formed the basis of the 250,000 test kit distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The UK also invented a test method until January 23, 2020.Kogenebiotech from South Korea on January 28, 2020 invented a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 (PowerChek Coronavirus) clinical diagnostic kit.
The kit follows the "E" gene that is common in all beta-corona viruses and the RdRp gene that is SARS-CoV-2.In China, the BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive emergency use certification of the SARS-CoV-2 PCR-based diagnostic kit from China's National Organization of Medical Products.In the United States, the Prevention and Disease Control Centers (CDC) are distributing the RT-PCR instant diagnostic panel for the new corona virus-2019 (2019-nCoV) among public health laboratories through the International Reagent Resource.
One of the three genetic tests in the previous versions of the test kit due to the defective IDs and the limitation of the test at the CDC in Atlanta resulted in unfinished results; this resulted in an average of less than 100 samples per day successfully processed throughout February.
By February 28, 2020, the test using two components was not reliable and it was after state and local laboratories were allowed to test.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration, under a license for emergency use. U.S. commercial laboratories began to perform the test in early March 2020.
From March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced that the Quid-19 RT-PCR-based test will be available throughout the country.
Quest Diagnostics also made the Quid-19 test available across the country from March 9, 2020.
No limit for the number of tests was announced; sampling and processing must be done according to the CDC requirements.
In Russia, the production and development of the Quid-19 test kit was carried out by the VECTOR National Center for Virology and Biotechnology Research.
On 11 February 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Health Surveillance Service Center. on 12 March 2020, it was that the Mayo Clinic invented a test for Quid-19 disease. on 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for a test that could be performed within 3.5 hours in high volume, allowing a device to perform about 4,128 tests over a 24-hour period.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA granted the Emergency Use License (EUA) for the m2000 system to Abbott Laboratories; the FDA had previously issued similar licenses for Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also received the EEA license for a 45-minute test from the FDA.
The FDA has confirmed a experiment that uses the Nucleic acid isothermal enhancement instead of PCR.
Since this does not require a series of varied temperature cycles, this method can provide a positive result within only five minutes and a negative result within 13 minutes.
Currently, about 18,000 cases of these devices are available in the United States and Abbott expects to be able to deliver 50,000 tests a day by increasing production. A test that uses a monoclonal patch that is specifically connected to the new corona protein (protein N) virus, is being developed in Taiwan and hopes to be able to deliver results within 15 to 20 minutes, just like a fast flu test.
A review of the research conducted in March 2020 can come to the conclusion that "radio images of the chest have little diagnostic value in the early stages, while CT findings [computer tomography] can be identified even before the symptoms appear."
The common features in CT include the double-double-double-double-double-double-double-double-double-double-double-double-double-double-double-double-double-double.
With the progression of the disease, subsequent overcoming, defective coverage and rigidity occurs.
A study that compares PCR to CT in Wuhan, which is the current pandemic origin, has suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR and at the same time less specific as many CT imaging properties are associated with other inflammatory liver diseases and disease processes.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that "CT should not be used as a screening or primary test for the diagnosis of Quid-19."After March 2020, CDC proposes the PCR method for primary screening.
Part of the immune system’s response to this infection is the production of patterns including IgM and IgG.
These patterns can be used to diagnose infection in people after 7 days or more of symptoms, immunity diagnosis and population monitoring.This test can be done in Central Laboratories (CLT) or through a patient clinic (PoCT) test.
High-capacity automatic systems in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform these tests, but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
For CLT, one sample of surrounding blood is usually used, although there is a possibility of using several consecutive samples to track the immunity response.
For PoCT, a sample of blood is usually taken by holeing the skin.
In contrast to the PCR methods, the extraction phase is not required before the test. on March 26, 2020, the FDA published a list of 29 institutions who, as requested, had informed the organization and so now were able to distribute their test.
From April 7, 2020, only one test was approved by the FDA under emergency use license. at the end of March 2020, the Euroimmun and Epitope Diagnostics Medical Diagnostic Laboratory obtained European certification for their test kit. These kits could identify IgG and IgA patterns that were released against the virus and were present in the blood sample.
The test capacity is several hundred samples within a few hours and therefore is much faster than the standard PCR test to identify the virus’s RNA.
These patches are usually diagnosed 14 days after the start of the disease. In early April, the UK realized that none of the patches it purchased were not used adequately.
Hong Kong implemented a plan according to which suspicious patients can stay at home, "the emergency section will give a sample tube to the patient", the patient throws his mouth sputum into it and returns it, and a while later receives the test result. NHS Britain has announced that it is conducting a experimental plan to get a test of suspicious cases at home that eliminates the risk of infection of others if the patient visits the hospital as well as if the ambulance is used and it is necessary to disinfect it. In the centers where it is possible to enter with the car for the test of suspicious cases to Quid-19, a health care specialist with appropriate precaution measures takes an example.
Vehicle testing centers have enabled South Korea to operate one of the fastest and most widespread testing methods compared to other countries. in Germany, the National Association of Compulsory Health Insurance Doctors on March 2 announced that it has a capacity of 12,000 tests per day mobile and the previous week, from 10,700 people tested.
If the test is given by a doctor, the costs are paid by the health insurance.
According to the head of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity to perform 160,000 tests per week.
Since March 19, the possibility of car testing has been provided in several major cities.
By March 26, 2020, the total number of tests carried out in Germany was not clear because only positive results were.
A laboratory questionnaire showed that by the calendar week 12/2020 a total of at least 483,295 samples were tested by the end of the week 12/2020 and the result of 33,491 samples (6.9%) was positive for SARS-CoV-2.In Israel, researchers at the Technion and Rambam Hospital have developed and tested a method for testing samples of 64 patients at the same time, they did this by combining samples and then performing more tests only if the result of the combined samples was positive.In Wuhan, on February 5, 2020, a temporary emergency diagnostics laboratory to the area of 2000 square meters named "Huo-Yan" (China: 眼 眼 眼 眼 眼 眼 眼 眼 眼 眼 眼 眼 眼 眼 眼 眼 眼 眼 眼 眼 眼 眼 眼 眼 眼 眼 眼 眼 眼 眼 眼 眼 眼 眼
The construction of the laboratory took 5 days and its construction was supervised by the founder of BGI, Wang Jian, modeling showed that if this test capacity was not exploited, the number of cases in Wuhan would be 47% greater and the cost related to the cartridge would be doubled.
Similar samples of the Huo-Yan laboratory were immediately launched in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities across China.
By March 4, 2020, the total daily capacity reached 500,000 trials per day. Open and mixed text designs published by the origami trials can test 1,122 patients' samples only using 93 Quid-19 test kits. These balanced designs are implementable in small laboratories and without the need for a fluid robotic examiner.
Until March, deficiencies and the lack of sufficient quantity of identification material had become obstacles to mass testing in Europe, Britain and the United States.
This has led some authors to review sampling preparation protocols, which includes heating samples to 98 degrees Celsius (208 degrees Fahrenheit) for 5 minutes, to release the RNA genome for more tests. on March 31 it was announced that the United Arab Emirates is now testing a large number of its country’s population for the coronavirus, its per capita ratio is higher than any other country, and in this regard it is successfully achieving the test for a large part of its country’s population.
This was possible due to the ability to test with cars and the purchase of a large laboratory on the country’s overall population scale from Group 42 and BGI (based on the “Huo-Yan” emergency diagnostics laboratories in China).
The laboratory, built over 14 days, is able to perform tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests a day and is the first laboratory with this scale to operate outside China.
Different prescriptions of the test that target different sections of the genetic specification of the coronavirus were prepared in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization has used German guidelines to prepare and send kites to low-income countries that do not have the resources needed to produce domestic kites.
The German test kit guidelines were published on January 17, 2020. Since the protocol prepared by the U.S. Disease Control Centers was not available until January 28, it caused delays in the start of the tests in the U.S. China and the U.S. had trouble in terms of the level of reliability of the test kit at the beginning of the outbreak, and these countries, along with Australia, were unable to provide sufficient kites to respond to the demand and cases recommended by health professionals for the test.
On the contrary, experts say the broad availability of tests in South Korea has helped reduce the release of the new coronavirus.
The capacity for testing, mainly in private sector laboratories, has been built over the years by the South Korean government.
On March 16, the World Health Organization called for strengthening the testing programmes as the best way to slow down the progression of pandemic quoid-19. High demand for testing due to the widespread viral spread caused hundreds of thousands of tests in private laboratories in the United States to be delayed and a rare stock of fluid and chemical identification.
In March 2020, China problems with the accuracy of its test kit.
In the United States, the test kit produced by the CDC had a "defect."The government then removed the bureaucratic obstacles from conducting private tests. Spain bought the test kit from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the test results were not correct.
The company explained that the wrong results may be the result of a problem in collecting samples or the misuse of the kit.
The Spanish minister said he would not use the kits that presented the wrong results and replace them with the different test kits produced by Shenzhen Bioeasy.80% of the test kits that the Czech Republic had purchased from China got the wrong results. Slovakia bought 1.2 million test kits from China that made the wrong results.
Atheş Kara from the Turkish Ministry of Health said that the experimental kit purchased by Turkey from China had a "high error rate" and were "not used".The British government purchased 3.5 million experimental kit from China but in early April 2020 announced that the kit was unusable.
The test and the follow-up of the test carcination of people whose test results were positive and the tracking of those who were associated with people with a positive result of the SARS-CoV-2 virus had positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian town of Vou, where the first death of Quoid-19 occurred in Italy, conducted two rounds of tests in a 10-day interval on the total population of about 3,400 people.
Nearly half of the people who had the positive test had no symptoms and all the positive cases were coronated.
By limiting travel to public centers, new infections completely disappeared.
With serious tracking of people who have contacted, limitation, testing and carnival of entrance passengers, the 2020 Cronavirus pandemic in Singapore was much slower than other developed countries, of course without severe restrictions such as forced vacation of restaurants and retail centers.
Many events have been cancelled and Singapore recommended residents to stay at home on March 28, but schools after holidays were reopened on March 23 and at their scheduled time.
Several other countries, including Iceland and South Korea, also managed the pandemic with serious tracking of the people who contacted, limiting, testing and cartooning entrance passengers, of course with less holidays.
A statistical study has shown that countries that have done more tests compared to the number of foties have much lower mortality rates, probably because these countries are better able to identify those who only have mild symptoms or have no symptoms.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that countries with no test capacity and national labs with limited experience in the field of Quid-19 send their first five positive and first ten negative examples to one of the 16 World Health Organization reference labs for verification.
Of these 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following chart, the "% positive compared to the total test" column is affected by the test policy of each country.
If all the other conditions are the same, "% positive compared to the total tests" will be higher in a country where only hospitalized persons are tested than in a country where all citizens are tested, whether they have symptoms or not.
Hand washing, also referred to as hand hygiene, is a hand cleaning process to eliminate soil, fat, microorganisms or other unwanted substances.
Washing hands with soap continuously in “sensitive places” throughout the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhoea and epilepsy that are transmitted through the bladder.
For example, if people do not touch their hands before they touch their eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. the mucous membranes), they may have respiratory diseases such as flu or colds.
Five important situations during the day when washing your hands with soap is important include: before and after going to the toilet, after cleaning the child or replacing his clothes, before giving food to the child, before eating and before and after preparing food or touching raw meat, fish or chicken.
If water and soap are not available, your hands can be cleaned with dust. The World Health Organization recommends handwashing in the following cases:
Before, during and after eating.
Before and after the treatment of the patient.
After replacing the coat or cleaning the baby after using the toilet.
After swallowing, swallowing or swelling.
After touching animals, curious animals or feeding animals.
Health stops from medical sight, refers to health measures related to medical procedures.
Washing your hands before giving medication or medical care can prevent or minimize the disease.
The main objective is to wash hands from a medical point of view, to cleanse hands from pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other pathogenic microorganisms) and chemicals that can cause risk or disease.
This is especially important for people who deal with food or work in medical-related professions, but it is also important for the general public.
Washing hands has many health benefits, including minimizing the spread of flu, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing the infectious factors of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
and the death rate of infants during childbirth at home.
A 2013 study found that improving hand washing practices could lead to a slight improvement in the height growth of children under the age of five.
In developing countries, the rate of deaths caused by respiratory diseases and children’s diarrhea can be reduced by promoting simple behavioral changes such as handwashing with soap.
This simple action can reduce the mortality rate caused by these diseases by 50%.
Measures that promote handwashing can reduce the cases of diarrhoea to about a third, comparable to the supply of clean water in low-income areas.
Washing hands with soap as an automatic behavior that has become a habit in homes, schools and communities around the world is the only, most effective and cheapest way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (ARI).
The rhinitis, which is one of the major acute respiratory infections, is one of the causes of deaths of children under the age of 5 years, causing the deaths of around 1.8 million children each year.
Diarrhea and inflammation together cause approximately 3.5 million children’s deaths per year.
According to UNICEF, changing handwashing with soap before meals and after using the toilet into a strong habit can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, half the diarrhea death rate, and reduce a quarter of the deaths caused by acute respiratory infections.
Handwashing is usually integrated with other health interventions as part of the Water, Health and Cleaning Programs (WASH).
Hand washing also protects against the inflammation that is transmitted through direct contact with the body.
One of the harmful but small effects of hand washing is that frequent hand washing can lead to skin drying and consequent damage to the skin.
A study in Denmark in 2012 found that excessive washing of hands could lead to skin swelling, which is also referred to as eczema or hand dermatitis, which is common among health care workers.
Excessive and frequent handwashing is also referred to as one of the symptoms of obsessive disorder (OCD).
Five important times during the day when washing your hands with soap is important to reduce the transition of the urinary disease include: after going to the bathroom (sugar, urinary), after cleaning the child (sugar replacement), before giving food to the child, before eating and before and after preparing food or touching meat, fish, or raw chicken.
Other cases in which the right hand washing method should be taken into consideration in order to prevent the transmission of the disease include before and after the treatment of cuts or wounds, after sweat, cough or finishing; after touching animal curiosities or touching animals; and after contact with waste.
In many countries, the rate of hand washing with soap is very low.
In 2015, a study on handwashing in 54 countries found that an average in 38.7 percent of households handwashing with soap has become a habit. One study in 2014 found that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate of handwashing with soap, which is 97 percent; the United States is in the middle rank with 77 percent and China is in the lowest rank with 23 percent. Now there are several ways to change behavior to increase the rate of handwashing with soap at important times. group handwashing for school children at certain hours of the day is one of the options in developing countries to teach children handwashing.
The Basic Health Care Program, implemented by the Ministry of Education in the Philippines, is an example of extensive measures to improve the level of health and education in children.
Two times a year departicularity along with daily hand washing with soap, daily tooth washing with fluoride, is the main focus of this national program.
The program has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
Adding soap or laundry to water is effective in eliminating microorganisms from the skin.
The main function of soap and laundry is to reduce solubility barriers and increase solubility.
Water alone is an ineffective cleanser for the skin because fats and proteins that are part of organic soil are not easily dissolved in water.
However, the flow of enough water helps to clean up.
Solid soap, due to its re-use nature, may keep bacteria from previous banks in itself.
Few studies that have transferred bacteria from contaminated solid soap have concluded that the transfer of bacteria by this way seems unlikely because bacteria are washed with the floor.
The Center for Disease Control and Prevention still believes that "the liquid soap that is accessible without direct contact of the hand is better."
Antibacterial soap is highly promoted for people who care about health.
Until today, there is no evidence of the effectiveness of anti-infectious substances or garlic in the destruction of antibiotic-resistant organisms in nature.
However, antibacterial soap contains common antibacterial substances such as triclosan, which a wide variety of organisms are resistant to.
So even if antibiotic-resistant species were not intended to be destroyed with antibacterial soap, these soap may not be as effective as they are advertised on the market.
Advanced formulations in addition to surfacantate and skin protective substance may contain acid (asic acid, scorpion acid, lactic acid) as a pH regulator, anti-microbial active benzoic acid and other skin softeners (aloe vera, vitamins, methyl, plant extract). The comprehensive analysis of the Faculty of Public Health of the University of Oregon showed that ordinary soap is as effective as the ordinary antibacterial soap that contains triclosan in the prevention of disease and elimination of hand bacteria.
The hot water used to wash hands is not hot enough to eradicate bacteria.
Bacteria grow at a body temperature (37 degrees Celsius) much faster.
However, hot water accompanied by soap is more effective in eliminating natural oils that contain soil and bacteria than cold water accompanied by soap.
However, and contrary to the general imagination, scientific studies have shown that the use of hot water has no effect on reducing the microbial load on the hands.
The anti-infectious substance is a non-blue health substance.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, non-water-based alcoholic health products (alcohol-based disinfectants or hand-based anti-infectants) gained popularity.
Most of these are made from alcoholic isopropyl or ethanol along with a concentrating substance such as carboomer (acrylic acid polymer) and in the form of gel, or for the ease of use and reduction of the alcohol dryer effect, they are used by a lubricant such as glycerin and are made in the form of a liquid or floor.
Adding diluted hydrogen peroxide increases more anti-microbial activity. anti-infectants containing at least 60 to 95 percent of alcohol are microbially effective deadly agents.
Alcohol-containing anti-infectants cause the destruction of bacteria, multi-drug-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis and some viruses (including HIV, tuberculosis, RSV virus, renovirus, cattle, flu and hepatitis) and fungi.
The anti-infectants containing 70% of all, 30 seconds after use, cause the destruction of 99.97% (3.5 weight reduction equivalent to 35 dB) of hand bacteria and 1 minute after use, cause the destruction of 99.99% to 99.999% (4.5 weight reduction) of hand bacteria.
Alcohol-based hand-based anti-infectants are almost ineffective against neurovirus (or Norwalk) viruses, which are the most common cause of gastrointestinal disease. sufficient amount of hand-based anti-infectants or alcohol-containing gel should be used so that both hands are completely wet or covered.
The back and on both hands and between and the end of all fingers should be diluted for approximately 30 seconds until the liquid, fume or gel is dry.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends washing hands more than using an anti-infectant hand, especially when the hands are completely dirty.
The increasing use of these materials is due to their ease of use and their ability to quickly eradicate microorganisms; however, they should not be used as a substitute for proper hand washing unless soap and water are available.
Repeated use of alcohol-based hand-based anti-infectants can cause skin drying unless softers or skin moisturizers are added to their formulation.
Adding glycerin or other softers to their preparation formula can reduce or eliminate the drying effect of alcohol.
In clinical trials, anti-infectants containing alcohol and softwares produced much less burning and dry skin than sabons or anti-microbial washers.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact ginger syndrome or allergy to alcohol or additives found in hand-containing anti-infectors, occurs rarely.
Less chances of developing contact dermatitis compared to handwashing with water and soap made them attractive.
Despite their effectiveness, non-water-based substances do not clean the hands of organic substances, but anti-infect them.
That’s why hand anti-infectants as much as soap and water are not effective in preventing the spread of many diseases, as pathogens still remain on the hands.
The anti-infectant effect of non-alcoholic hands is severely dependent on the ingredients and their formulation and has historically had less effect than alcohol-containing anti-infectants.
Recently it has been shown that formulations that use benzalconium chloride after use have more accumulative and continuous antimicrobial activity, unlike alcohol that after repeated use, possibly due to negative skin reactions, decreases its effectiveness.
Many people in low-income societies can’t make soap and instead use dust or soil.
Soil or soil may be more effective than water alone, but may have less effect than soap.
One concern is that if soil or dust is infected with microorganisms, it may, instead of reducing the spread of the disease, increase its spread.
The dust is also like the soap, an anti-infectious substance, as it forms an alkaline solution in contact with water.
In the absence of soap, the World Health Organization recommends dust or sand as a substitute for soap.
The correct handwashing method recommended by the U.S. Disease Control Centers to prevent the transmission of the disease includes the following steps:
Wash your hands with hot or cold water.
Current water is recommended because the rocky water may be contaminated, while the water temperature does not seem to make any changes.
Hide your hands with enough soap, including the back of your hands, between your fingers and under your nails.
Soap removes microbes on the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when they use soap than when they use only water.
Wash your hands for at least 20 seconds.
Melting the hands causes scratch and helps to remove microbes from the skin, and melting the hands for longer, eliminates more microbes.
Drink your hands with good water.
Washing in rocked water can reinfect the hand.
Dry with a clean towel or let it dry in the air.
Moist and moist hands can easily be infected. Most of the parts of the hand that remains sitting include the fingers, arms, areas between the fingers of the hand and under the nails.
Artificial nails and cut nail locks may be hidden microorganisms.
Moisturizer is often recommended to prevent hand drying. skin drying leads to skin damage and can increase the risk of infection transfer.
There are various low-cost options to facilitate handwashing in developing countries where pipeline or soap water is not available. for example, throwing water from a gallon or hole container hanged or, if necessary, using dust. where water resources are limited (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions to save water consumption, such as "type pipes or small water leaves" and other low-cost options.
Type-Tip is a simple technology made of a container hanged by a wire and a foot-controllable throw to throw a small amount of water on the hands and a soap shape.
Effective hand drying is an important part of the hand hygiene process, but there are discussions about the most effective form of hand drying in public toilets.
The increasing volume of research shows that paper towels are much healthier than electric dryers that are found in many toilets.
In 2008, a paper towels industry-backed study, European Textile Symposium, was conducted by the University of West Minster in London to compare the level of health of paper towels, hot air dryers and more modern jet air dryers.
After washing and drying hands with a hot-air dryer, the total number of bacteria in the fingertips increased by an average of 194% and bacteria in the hand floor increased by 254%.
The drying of the hands with the jet air dryer led to an average increase in the total number of bacteria in the fingers to 42% and in the hand floor to 15%.
After washing and drying hands with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria fell on average at the ends of the fingers by 76% and at the bottom of the hands by 77%.Scientists also conducted tests to determine whether there is a possibility of mutual transmission of contamination from other users from the toilet and the washing environment due to the use of different methods of hand drying.
The jet air dryer, which, according to the allegations, throws the air out at a speed of 180 meters per second (650 km or 400 miles per hour), is able to throw microorganisms from the hands and the machine and potentially can contaminate others who use the toilet as well as the toilet environment up to a distance of 2 meters.
Using a hot air dryer, it can spread microorganisms up to a distance of 0.25 meters from the dryer.
Paper towels did not cause substantial emissions of microorganisms; in 2005, a study by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt examined various methods of hand drying.
The following changes were observed in a number of bacteria after hand drying:
There are a large number of hand dryer manufacturers and hand dryer machines are compared with hand dryer with paper towels.
In the absence of soap and water while traveling, hand washing with hand deodorant towels can be used as an alternative method.
An alcohol-based hand-based anti-infectant should contain at least 60% alcohol.
Long after the Hungarian doctor, Ignaz Semmelweis, diagnosed the effectiveness of handwashing (in 1846) in the prevention of disease in the hospital environment, medical handwashing became compulsory.
There are electronic devices that can remind them if the hospital staff have forgotten to wash their hands.
A study found that the rate of infection was reduced by using them.
The time required for the medical hand washing is at least 15 seconds, which is done using sufficient amounts of soap and water or gel and dilating all parts of the hand.
My hands have to be melted and my fingers fall together.
If there is a scratch under the nails, a brush can be used to remove it.
Since microbes may remain in the water on the hands, it is very important that the hands are well drawn and dry with a clean towel.
After drying the hand, the paper towel should be used to close the water milk (and, if necessary, to open the output door).
This prevents reinfection of the hands as a result of contact with those levels.
The aim is to wash the hands in the therapeutic centers, to eliminate pathogenic microorganisms ("microbials") and prevent their transfer.
The New England Medical Journal reports that the lack of hand washing is unacceptable in most hospital environments, so many doctors and nurses usually forget to wash their hands before contacting patients and thus cause the transmission of microorganisms.
One study found that proper handwashing and other simple procedures can reduce up to 66 percent of the amount of blood flow pollution that catter plays.The World Health Organization has published a paper that shows the standard method of handwashing and handwashing together in health care sectors.
The hand health guide draft prepared by this organization is also accessible to the public on its website.
A review related to the topic was done by Whitby and colleagues.
If it is necessary to prove compliance with the established regulations, commercial devices can measure and verify the level of hand health.
The World Health Organization has defined the "Five Times" for handwashing:
After exposure to blood/body emissions.
before performing the activities related to the disinfection, and
After taking care of the patient, adding anti-infectious chemicals to the soap (sapons "medicine" or "anti-microbial") enhances the fatality of the hand washing agent.
Such measures may be considered before surgery or in an environment where antibiotic-resistant organisms are very prevalent. to wash your hands before surgery it is necessary to have the following: water milk that can be opened and closed without direct contact, some chlorhexidine or iodine washers, sterilized towels for drying your hands after washing them and sterilized brushes for special washing and other sterilized devices for cleaning under your nails.
All of the jewelry must be taken out.
In this procedure it is necessary to wash the hand and help to the arm for usually 2-6 minutes.
It does not require long washing (10 minutes).
When the water is dropped, the water should be prevented from returning to the hand.
After the hand washing is completed, the hands are dried with a sterile fabric and the surgical clothes are covered.
To reduce the emission of microbes, it is better to wash your hands or use an anti-infectant before and after taking care of the patient.
To control staphylococcus infections in hospitals, it has been shown that the greatest benefit of hand cleaning is from the first 20% of washing, and when the hand cleaning cycle reaches more than 35%, it has very little additional benefits.
Handwashing with an antibacterial soap compared to an antibacterial soap is three times more likely to transmit bacterial infectious diseases to food. Handwashing with an all-based solution compared with handwashing with an antibacterial soap for 30 seconds showed that handwashing with all reduces the bacterial contamination rate compared to an antibacterial soap by 26%.
But the use of soap and water compared to handwashing with alcohol-based substances is more effective in reducing the H1N1 type A influenza virus and cholesterol diphysis from hands. The necessary measures to improve hand health at health centers can include training staff for handwashing, increasing access to alcohol-based washers and written and oral reminders to employees.
More research is needed to determine which of these measures is more effective in different health care environments.
In developing countries, handwashing with soap is referred to as an affordable and basic tool for achieving good health and even proper nutrition.
However, the lack of reliable water, soap or handwashing in homes, schools and workplaces challenges achieving the necessary behaviors for handwashing globally.
For example, in most rural areas in Africa, water lions are rare to wash hands near private or public toilets, although there are cheaper options to build hand wash stations.
However, the low rate of handwashing, more not because of the lack of soap or water, but can be the result of our bad habits.
Promoting handwashing with soap can affect elective policies, raise awareness of the benefits of handwashing and lead to a long-term behavior change at the community level.
Monitoring and evaluation is necessary to ensure that this work is effective.
A systematic review of 70 studies showed that community-based approaches are effective in increasing the rate of handwashing in low-income and medium-sized countries, while social advertising campaigns are less effective. One example of promoting handwashing in schools is the "three-star approach" by UNICEF that encourages schools to make simple and cheap steps to ensure that students wash their hands with soap by complying with other health requirements.
With respect for the minimum standards, schools can eventually be upgraded from one star to three stars.
The construction of hand washing stations can be part of the hand washing campaigns that are carried out to reduce diseases and deaths in children.
World Handwashing Day is another example of awareness programmes aimed at making changes in people’s behavior. as a result of the 20-2019 Cronavirus pandemic, UNICEF promoted the use of handwashing emojis.
A small number of studies, in general, rejected the more affordable handwashing in developing countries in relation to the number of years lost due to disability.
However, one review shows that promoting handwashing with soap compared to other measures is economically significantly more affordable.
For the first time, the importance of handwashing for human health - especially for people who are in vulnerable conditions such as newborn mothers or wounded soldiers at the hospital - was marked in the middle of the nineteenth century by two hand health pioneers: the Hungarian doctor, Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale English who was "the founder of modern nursing".
At that time, most people believed that infections were caused by an unpleasant smell called miasma.
In the 1980s, the spread of food-related diseases and healthcare-related infections led to the U.S. disease control and prevention centers to promote hand health more widely as an important way to prevent the spread of infection.
The 2009 swine flu spread and Pandemic Quid-19 in 2020 led to increased awareness in many countries about the importance of handwashing with soap to protect itself from infectious diseases.
For example, paintings entitled “Right handwashing methods” were installed next to hand toilets in the public toilets and toilets of the office buildings and airports in Germany.
The term "washing someone out of something" means declaring that a person is not willing to accept responsibility for a matter or participate in it.
This term is borrowed from the Bible of Matthew, where Pontius Pilate was removed from the decision to crucify Christ, but this term is now used in some English communities with a much wider use.
In McCarthy Shakespeare, Mrs. McCarthy forced to wash her hands in an attempt to cleanse a fictional spike, which demonstrates her guilty conscience of the crimes she had committed and encouraged her wife to do so.
It is also noted that people, after remembering or considering unethical actions, tend to wash their hands more than others, and tend to use hand washing equipment more.
In addition, people who allow to wash their hands after such a deepening are less likely to take part in other “cleaning” compensatory actions, such as voluntary work.
Religions recommend handwashing for health and symbolic purposes. Symbolic handwashing and the use of water and not soap for handwashing are part of the handwashing ritual that has been shown in many religions including Bahá’u’lláh, Hinduism, Tula and Memorial Results in Judaism, the basin in Christianity and the basin in Islam. Religions also recommend handwashing after specific works.
Hinduism, Judaism, and Islam command to wash hands after using the toilet.
And Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam recommend handwashing before and after each meal.
Risk control related to Quid-19 at work.
Risk control related to Covid-19 at work means using secure health methods to control risks in order to prevent the 2019 (Covid-19) disease.
The proper risk control in the work environment depends on the place of work and the type of work and should be done on the basis of the assessment of the risk sources, the severity of the disease in the community and the risk factors for employees who may be exposed to the vulnerability to Quid-19.
According to the U.S. Department of Occupational Safety and Health (OSHA), jobs that are less at risk, have less employment contacts with ordinary people and other colleagues and are recommended basic measures to prevent infection, including washing hands, encouraging workers to stay at home if they are sick, respecting respiratory habits andining daily cleaning and anti-infection work environment.
Occupations with an average risk include jobs where employees need frequent contact or close contact with people who have not been infected or are not suspicious of being infected, but may be infected due to the continuous spread of the virus in the community or due to international travel.
This includes those who are in contact with the public, for example in schools, working environments with a large population density, and in some retail stores with a large number of people.
Risk control for this group, in addition to basic measures for the prevention of infection, includes air-conditioning through high-performance air filters, swelling protection and having personal protection equipment in case of contact with a person with Quid-19.
The U.S. Department of Occupational Safety and Health (OSHA) recognizes health care staff who are exposed to persons with or suspects of Quid-19, including those who are at high risk. If employees do things that lead to the production of suspended particles in the air or collect, move or treat samples of persons with or suspects of Quid-19, they are at very high risk.
The right way to control the risk for these people includes engineering controls such as creating negative pressure aircondition rooms and using personal protection equipment suitable for the job task.
The Quoid-19 epidemic can have various effects on the work environment.
Employees may not be present at work because of getting sick, need to take care of others or fear of potential encounters.
Commercial patterns may change, both in terms of what goods are needed and in terms of how to get these goods (such as shopping in unemployed hours or shopping through home delivery services or shopping with car).
In the end, the transport of items from geographical areas that are severely affected by Quid-19 can be stopped. necessary preparations and programs that can be used to respond to infectious diseases can be used to guide protective measures.
These programs examine and deal with the risk levels associated with different workplaces and job tasks including sources of exposure to disease, risk factors caused by the home and community environment and individual risk factors for employees such as aging or chronic diseases.
It also describes the necessary control measures to eliminate those risks as well as possible plans to cope with situations that may arise as a result of the spread.
The necessary preparation and programs prepared to respond to infectious diseases may be subject to national or local recommendations.
The responses to the spread of the disease include reducing the transmission of the disease among employees, protecting people who are more exposed to health side effects,ining business activities and minimizing the negative effects on other institutions in their supply chain.
The severity of the disease in the areas where commercial activities are carried out affects the decisions taken.
The Risk Control System includes a framework that is widely used in occupational safety and health so that risk controls can be categorized according to their effectiveness.
In cases where there is no possibility of removing the dangers of Quid-19, the most effective methods of control, engineering controls and followed by administrative controls and, in the end, personal protection equipment.
The method of engineering control requires keeping employees away from work-related risks without relying on employees’ behavior and can be the most affordable solution that can be implemented.
Administrative control methods include changes in the policy or work method that is implemented by the employee or employer.
Personal protection equipment (PPE) is less efficient than engineering and administrative control methods, but can somehow prevent exposure to the virus.
All types of PPEs must be selected, properly installed (for example, the respiratory system), constantly and properly covered, regularly inspected, stored and replaced, properly removed, cleaned and properly stored or removed to prevent pollution.
According to the U.S. Department of Occupational Safety and Health (OSHA), jobs that are less at risk have less employment contacts with ordinary people and other partners.
Basic measures that are recommended to prevent infection in all work environments include washing hands, encouraging workers to stay at home if they are sick, respecting respiratory habits including covering the mouth and nose during cough and sweat, making paper towels and waste containers, preparing for work on a distance or on interchangeable shifts if necessary, encouraging employees to not use the tools and equipment of others and clean and regularly anti-infecting work environments.
Fast identification and separation of people who are potentially infected is an important step in protecting employees, customers, visitors and other people at work.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees with symptoms of severe respiratory diseases stay at home for as long as they are free from fever, fever symptoms and other symptoms, without the use of fever reducers or other symptom-changing drugs, for at least 24 hours, and that vacation policies should be flexible, allow employees to stay at home for the care of the patient family members, and that employees are aware of these policies.
According to the Department of Occupational Safety and Health (OSHA), middle-risk occupations include occupations where employees need frequent contact or close contact at a distance of less than six feet (1.8 meters) with people who are not infected with or are not suspicious of infection, but may be infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to the continuous spread of the virus in the community or due to international travel in areas where the virus is widely spread.
This includes employees who are in contact with the public, for example in places such as schools, work environments with high density of population and some busy retail stores. Engineering control method for these and higher-risk groups can include installation of high-power air filters, increased air conditioning levels, installation of physical barriers such as plastic protectors for sweat and installation of vehicle service windows to customers. Administrative controls for these and groups that are at higher risk include: encouraging patients to stay at home, replacing facing sessions with virtual communications, creating variable shifts, non-dangerous travel to places that are exposed to high-power, increased air conditioning levels, installing physical barriers such as plastic protectors for sweat and installing car service windows to customers. Administrative controls for these and groups that are at higher risk include: encouraging patients to stay at home, replacing the facts of work,
Workers who are in this risk group rarely need to use the respiratory system.
If a person in the aircraft becomes sick, appropriate ways to protect the staff and other passengers may include separating the patient from others at a distance of 6 feet, allocating only one of the crew to serve the patient and providing a face mask to the patient, or asking the patient to cover his mouth and nose when he is hungry or swallowed.
The crew must use one-time medical gloves when caring for the patient passenger or when contacting the body’s fluids or levels, and if the patient has a fever, constant cough or breathing problem, use more personal protection equipment.
Handbags and other single-use equipment must be thrown into the bio-risk bag and the contaminated levels must then be clean and anti-infected. for commercial transport, including cruise vessels and other passenger vessels, risk control includes delaying travel during illness, individual cartridges and in case of fever or other symptoms during travel, immediate notification to the medical center inside the vessel.
For schools and child care centers, if the infected person has entered the school building regardless of the spread of the disease in the community, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends closing the place for a short period of time in order to clean or prevent infection.
If the transmission of the disease in the community is low or medium, the following measures can be taken in the direction of social distancing: cancellation of academic tours, meetings and other large meetings such as physical training classes or cravings or eating at the Tree Cafe, increased distance between tables, distancing between entrance and expulsion times, limiting unnecessary visitors and separate use of health care sites for children with flu symptoms.
When the possibility of the transmission of disease in society is at a significant level, in addition to the methods of social distancing, long-term school shutdown should be considered. for law enforcement staff who perform their daily activities, the disease control and prevention centers (CDCs) reduce their immediate health risk.
The law enforcement officers who need to be in contact with persons with or suspected of Covid-19 are advised to follow the guidelines that medical emergency technicians follow, including using appropriate personal protection equipment.
In case of close contact during the arrest of persons, employees must clean and disinfect their belt and their equipment before re-use using home cleansing spray or towels, while at the same time following the standard methods for the use and removal of used personal protection equipment (PPE) and the washing of clothes.
The U.S. Department of Occupational Safety and Health (OSHA) recognizes health care workers including those at high risk.
Occupations at a high level of risk include staff in medical services, support, laboratory and medical transport that are exposed to people with or suspects of HIV/AIDS.
Employees whose work leads to the production of suspended particles in the air or collect, move or treat samples of people with or suspected of Quid-19 are at very high risk.
The things that lead to the production of suspended particles in the air include piping, causing cough, bronchoscopy and some dental operations and examinations or aggressive sampling of the patient.
Occupations that are at very high risk include employees who are working to prepare the bodies of people who were suffering from or suspected of a quoid-19 at the time of their death. If the quoid is performed, the risk level is very high. Additional methods of engineering control for this group include creating separate rooms for patients who are suffering or suspected of a quoid-19, including when doing the work that leads to the production of particles suspended in the air.
Negative pressure air conditioning may be suitable for some health and medical centers.
Patient samples should be treated by taking into account biological precautions of level 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that new patients who are suspicious of Quid-19 be kept in a specific and separate waiting room. In addition to the use of other personal protection tools, the Office of Occupational Safety and Health (OSHA) recommends the use of the respiratory system for those who work within the range of 6 feet of patients with or suspicious of Quid-19 as well as for those who do things that lead to the production of suspended particles in the air.
In the United States, the N95 respiratory filter is certified by NIOSH and is used in accordance with the provisions of a comprehensive and written respiratory protection program that includes appropriate tests, training and medical examinations.
Other types of respiratory devices can be more protected and easier to use for employees. The World Health Organization does not recommend using the whole body cover because Quid-19 is a respiratory disease and is not transmitted through body fluids.
The World Health Organization only recommends the use of a surgical mask to scan people at the entrance points.
The World Health Organization recommends for people who collect the patient's respiratory system samples, or care for or carry Covid-19 patients and do not do anything that leads to the production of suspended particles in the air, use a surgical mask, glasses or protective face, gloves and gloves.
If the work is done during which suspended particles are produced in the air, the surgical mask is replaced with the respiratory system N95 or FFP2.
Given the fact that the global supply of personal protection equipment is not sufficient, the World Health Organization recommends the following to minimize the need for personal protection equipment: carry out medical examinations in a non-present manner, creating physical obstacles such as the installation of transparent windows, allowing entrance to the room only to people who are directly involved in the care of the Quid-19 patient, using personal protection equipment only to perform specific tasks, using a respiratory mask when taking care of multiple patients who are all affected by a disease, monitoring and coordinating the supply chain of personal protection equipment and not using the mask for people who have no symptoms of the disease.

This month we see ourselves in considerable circumstances.
Quid-19 disease is something that clearly clarifies the global consistency of humans and our responsibilities towards each other.
Its challenges are unprecedented to us, but we know that our best response depends on compassion, cooperation and socialization that is at the heart of the organization.
The accompaniment and level of care that we have seen among our colleagues through emails, calls and chats is a sign of the incredible people we have the chance and the pride to work alongside them.
I am very grateful and proud to have you all alongside me as a partner.
Last week, someone was grateful for what we did.
They reminded me how awful it is that the world can now visit Wikipedia and how powerful it is a sign that this important source can be online and accessible to everyone.
Your work makes it possible, whether you keep the sites up to date or our colleagues receive money or our communities are safe.
The world, now more than ever, needs the information that Wikipedia provides.
This is the moment when not only what we do, but our way of work will have a meaningful impact on the world.
Due to the importance of this mission and your role in it, we will make significant changes to how we work together from the beginning of next week.
Amendments to our work and plans.
As Robin mentioned earlier, team-c met last night to discuss our approach and plans for the coming days and months.
During that conversation, we made a decision that we thought was the right answer to what we’re facing and the best way to keep the organization stable during this time.
We wanted to eliminate stress and support our long-term mission.
If you need to reduce, there is no problem.
to all employees, contractors and contractual employees:
To secondary information, we expect 4 hours of work per day or 20 hours of work per week.
We don’t announce holidays – if you can work more regular hours, you’ll benefit from this mission.
However, the world is now unpredictable and no matter whether you take care of your loved ones, buy food, or go to a doctor, your health is a priority for us.
We will not track your time.
If you’re sick, don’t work.
It should go without saying, but we say it.
There is no need to take a medical leave or a personal leave - just tell your manager and help your group review calendar and schedules and make sure someone has covered key tasks.
(If your Quid-19 test results are positive, please inform Bryan of the T&C section so that T&C can help you and make sure your situation is properly managed).
The wages of employees who work an hour are fully paid.
As we have said before, we are committed to our commitments to contractors and colleagues who work timely.
All wages are paid on the basis of normal working hours in normal conditions.
This includes you even if you are sick and you are unable to work.
If you want to work, we will support you.
Many people use work as a way to release their stress to the world around us.
What we do, especially in such occasions, can be very valuable.
I emphasize again, this is about your own care.
We ask you to contact your manager so that we know what to expect and we can plan accordingly.
Some things are considered necessary.
There are things we have to do.
SRE, HR Ops, trust and security and capture of capital (and some other) teams do basic and important tasks that may need more support.
We will start a process with other departments to evaluate current objectives and focus on supporting the elements necessary for our mission.
For all of us there is a lot of work, we will all focus on the most basic projects.
If we slow down the process now, we will not see any damage later.
We do not have a plan to work twice as soon as the pandemic is over and to deal with things.
You are not expected to work extra hours to meet the deadlines that are now impossible.
We acknowledge that the conditions have changed and we will try to set new goals and timetables if necessary.
How does the APP (Annual Planning) work?
In order to comply with the new facts and expectations of daily working hours, we intend to modify our annual 2021-2020 delivery schedule.
Our goal is to propose an extension of the 2020-2019 programme that gives us more time to budget and allows employees to prioritize vital tasks, take care of themselves and take care of their loved ones, while allowing those who need or wish to work less hours over the next few weeks to do so.
This time extension significantly reduces the level of pressure on current work plans throughout the organization.
We will submit our proposal to the Board next week and, as soon as it is approved, inform the representatives and teams in the next steps.
Thanks to the annual planning team for the leadership of this work.
Office status, exposure to illness and cleaning
Last week we were informed that one of SF-based colleagues may have been exposed to the Quid-19 virus.
However, for more caution, we hired an antivirus cleaning team to disinfect all levels at the office of San Francisco.
They used an antivirus solution of a hospital grade to disinfect all levels as well as to the side of the lobby and elevator that goes to our floor.
This building uses its care protocol and uses products that are beneficial for the health of its inhabitants.
We are sure that when we decide to return, the office will be well prepared.
Our Washington office is located in a WeWork and they have shared their Quid-19 protocol with us and all of our employees based in the DC.
According to the instructions of the state of San Francisco, since last week, our Washington DC office has become a completely remote set.
As some of our New York-based colleagues know, we’ve also talked about renting a place in Brooklyn.
The discussions will continue but may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues work on a distance for the first time.
Old colleagues who work with us from a distance know that this can be a condition and want to have advice to you:
Limit the duration of sessions to a maximum of one or two hours.
If you need longer sessions, check out how they can be held within a few days.
Specificate the session clearly, have a schedule and submit the necessary material to study in advance.
Configure the video by default using tools such as Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate collaboration and live communication.
Identify someone responsible for meeting leadership, someone responsible for monitoring chat to track questions and list speakers and someone to note (or share note).
If you need a comfortable headset, send an email to the technical support group.
Use your health aid for the promise.
Join the #remoties channel in Slack to talk about the shared work with your colleagues.
The human resource operating team to support increased work distributed throughout the foundation, is looking for webinar-based ergonomic guidance.
Last week we asked all fund-level receivers, such as editathon, to cancel public events held with the Wikipedia budget, until the World Health Organization announced the end of the pandemic.
We inform them that we know that our request for cancellation of programs and other restrictions may make it impossible to carry out agreed activities related to receiving financial benefits and no one will be punished for delay or amendment of their goals.
Next week we will provide more guidelines on Wikimania and other topical and regional social conferences.
It seems that the public feeling throughout the global community, both discomfort due to these disorders and at the same time feeling relieved due to their transparency and ability to focus on the activities of their own communities, Wikipedia, etc.
As we move forward, CRT is trying to create a page on Meta-Wiki to provide a space for the community to monitor the impact and maintain our communication with them.
Relating to the issues related to Quad-19
For the next Thursday, at 14:00 UTC time with 07:00 PT time, we will send a meeting invitation for special staff to your calendar.
We will use this time and provide you with more and more new information, answer your questions and spend some time communicating with each other.
We are all together in this matter and we are here to help you in every way possible.
In addition, you can find the relevant information through this email and other information related to Quid-19 in Office Wiki.
CRT updates these pages and keeps all the information in one place.
We also strive to establish regular contacts with those of our employees who live in countries that are now significantly affected.
If you have any questions about travel, events, main workflow or news covering challenges, or anything else you may need help, please do not hesitate to inform and collaborate with CRT.
We are here to help and support you if necessary.
If you want to talk about a secret or sensitive topic, please email to Bryan Judan - International Human Resource Operations Manager.
None of these changes should be considered as leaving our work and commitments.
Instead, it shows that at this moment our work and commitments are likely to need to be adapted to the way we did not have in the past.
These are the steps that we believe are necessary to support each other in order to continue our work and support our movement and provide the services that the world’s people rely on.
The things we have planned will be waiting for us when it comes.
It’s time to support each other and create space for important tasks that are scheduled to be done in the weeks and the months to come.
We all need you to do this, so we ask you to take care of yourself and your families so that you can be in your best condition when the need increases.
Now, please wash your clothes and don’t touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S) and the rest of the lead team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
B'Enzyme Converter Angiotensin 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme that adheses to the external surface (cellular membrane) of the lungs, cavities, heart, kidneys and intestines.
ACE2 disrupts the activity of the associated enzyme angiotensin converter (ACE) by reducing the levels of angiotensin-II and increasing (Ang(1-7 which has transformed its same capacity into a hopeful drug target for the treatment of cardiovascular disease. ACE2 also acts as a cell entry point for some coronavirus.
The human version of this enzyme is often called hACE2.
Angiotensin Converter Enzyme 2 is a type of metaloenzyme containing zinc that is located on the surface of endothelial cells and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains a range of N-terminal peptideaz M2 and a range of carrier of kidney amino acid C-terminal colectin.
ACE2 is a single-transitional type I membrane protein whose active enzyme range is located near the level of lungs and other tissues.
The outcellular range of ACE2 is separated with another enzyme called thyroidase from the thyroid range, and the resulting soluble protein after entering the blood flow is eventually eliminated by urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 adheses to the cell membranes of type II vaginal cells mainly the liver, small intestinal enterocytes, endothelial cells of scratch and scratch, and more flat muscle cells of organs.
Symptoms of ACE2 mRNA are seen in the cortex of the brain, the square body, the hypothalamus and the brain shooting.
The main function of ACE2 is to act as an ACE neutralizer.
ACE converts the hormone angiotensin I into angiotensin that narrows the vein II.
ACE2 in turn separates the carboxyl-terminal amino acid from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyzes to angiotensin vessels (1-7) (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can break down a number of other peptides such as [des-Arg9]-Brady Kane, Apoline, Norotensin, Dinorphine A and Green.
ACE2 also regulates the mucous fluid carrier of the neutral amino acid SLC6A19 and plays a role in the development of the disease of Hartnap.
ACE2, as a trigeminal protein, plays the main point of entrance to the cell for some coronavirus such as HCoV-NL63, SARS-CoV (Sars agent virus) and SARS-CoV-2 (Quid agent virus 19).
More importantly, the adhesion of the S1 spike protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 viruses to the ACE2 enzymatic range at the cell level leads to the intrusion and movement of viruses and enzymes in the endosomes inside the cells.
This entry process requires the preparation of S protein by TMPRSS2 host serum protein, whose inhibition is examined in the course of current research as a possible treatment. This assumption is assumed that a reduction in the levels of ACE2 in cells may help cope with infection.
However, many professional communities and regulatory bodies have suggested that treatment with standard ACE and ARB inhibitors continues.
A standard and analytical review published on July 11, 2012 found that “the use of ACE inhibitors is associated with a dramatic 34-percent reduction in the probability of pollution compared to controls.”
In addition, “the probability of stroke was reduced in patients treated with ACE inhibitors who had a higher risk of stroke, especially those who had a stroke and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a decrease in the deaths caused by the rhinitis, although the results were lower than the overall results of the rhinitis.”
It is believed that humane recycled ACE (rhACE2) is a new treatment for acute liver damage and apparently improved respiratory hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in pigs with acute respiratory disorder syndrome caused by lipopoly sacharide.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is about 10 hours and the start of the operation is 30 minutes plus the effect period (duration) is 24 hours.
Some findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a medication for people with a sensitivity to systemic and classic renin-angiotensin inhibitors (RSA inhibitors) or diseases that enhance the circulation of angiotensin II. The effect of rhACE2 injection in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory disorder syndrome has been evaluated.
b'Quid-19 programs are mobile software programs that are used to track contacts during the chronic pandemic period 20-2019, which is the process of identifying people (communications) who are likely to have been in contact with an infected person.
Several programs have been developed or proposed, which in some territories and regions are supported by government officials.
Several frameworks have been developed for the preparation of contact tracking programs.
Privacy issues have been raised, especially in systems based on the geographical location tracking of the application users.
Less interferential solutions can be referred to using Bluetooth signals to record the user’s proximity to other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they will include support for Bluetooth-oriented applications directly on Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, in cooperation with Alipay, has developed a program that allows citizens to find out whether or not they have contacted people with Kuwait-19.
This program has been applied in more than 200 Chinese cities. in Singapore, a program called TraceTogether is used.
The program has been developed by the local IT community, it has been published in an open source and will be handed over to the government. North Macedonia has published a Bluetooth-centric program called "StopKorona!" to track potential contacts with infected people and provide immediate response to medical institutions.
This program has been developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
By April 14, 2020, the app was waiting for Google Play Store and Apple App Store approval.
On April 12, the government announced that the call tracking program is in an advanced stage of development and will be prepared for implementation within a few weeks. the similar program ("StopCovid") will be implemented in Ireland and France.
Both Australia and Zelandno are considering programs based on the TraceTogether program and the BlueTrace protocol. Russia intends to introduce a geographical limitation program for patients with Quid-19 and residents of Moscow, to prevent these people from leaving their homes.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at Cambridge University, has pointed to a number of applied problems related to program-oriented systems, including false positive results and potential inefficiency if the program is used in small population samples.
By investigating the problems related to the spread of misleading or harmful Crownavirus programs, Apple has imposed restrictions on the type of organizations that are permitted to add Crownavirus programs to the App Store and only allows “official” or credible organizations to do so.
Google and Amazon have applied similar restrictions.
Privacy Defenders have expressed concern about the consequences of public surveillance using the coronavirus programs and have announced that it is unclear whether the surveillance infrastructure created for the coronavirus pandemic will be deleted after the threat is removed.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for the limitation of this type of surveillance.
These organizations have listed eight conditions for government plans:
The supervision must be “legal, necessary and proportionate”;
The tracking and monitoring attachments must have parts with the possibility of automatic cancellation;
The use of data should be limited to the issues related to Quid-19;
Data security and anonymity must be guaranteed and protected on the basis of evidence.
Digital surveillance should not be a groundwork for increasing discrimination and isolation;
Data transfer to third parties must be within the framework of the law;
Guarantees should be considered to prevent abuse and the right of citizens to complain about abuse;
The targeting participation of all “related stakeholders” including public health experts and marginal groups is essential. Chaos Computer Club (CCC) Germany and Reporters Without Borders (RSF) have also published lists.
The proposed Google/Apple program is provided to address the problem of continuous monitoring by removing the tracking mechanism from their device operating systems, after the need is corrected.
In some countries, the network-oriented localization process has been used instead of the program, and therefore the need to download the program and the ability to escape the tracking has disappeared.
In Israel, the network-center tracking has been approved.
Network-centered solutions that have access to raw location data may violate privacy.
However, not all systems with a central server require access to personal location data; a number of privacy guards systems use central servers only for internal communications (see section below).
In South Korea, an unprogrammed system was used to track calls.
The system, instead of using a specialized program, collected tracking information from various sources, including mobile tracking data and card transactions data, and used to communicate text to persons likely to be infected.
In addition to the use of this information to communicate to potential audiences, the government makes local information available to the public. This type of information disclosure is permitted due to widespread changes in data protection laws, due to the MERS spread in the country.
This information is available to the public through a number of applications and websites. Some countries, such as Germany, have considered the use of centralized systems and privacy guards.
By April 6, 2020, these details have not yet been revealed.
To 7 April 2020, dozens of undergraduate groups worked on privacy solutions, such as using “Bluetooth Low Energy” (BLE), to record the user’s proximity to other mobile phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordinated effort that covers centralized and non-centralized approaches and the protocol is not independent. from non-centralized protocols, it can be referred to as “near-centralized management with privacy protection” (DP-PPT/DP-3T), “temporary call numbers” (TCN, known as call event numbers, CEN), “privacy-sensitive protocols” and “mobile call tracking associations” (PACT).
In these protocols, personal identity data is never out of the device, and all matching cases occur inside the device.
The Privacy Group at the MIT Media Laboratory has been developing SafePaths, a platform to use privacy practices in the process of collecting and using location and routing data, to track the Quid-19 outbreak.
The platform is developed on the basis of the results of the research included in the official report “Advertising Programs: Protecting Personal Privacy in the Period of Integration” published in March 2020. Another similar initiative is the Enigma MPC SafeTrace Platform. The company is committed to developing privacy technologies formed in the “MIT Media Laboratory”.
SafeTrace, with secure hardware technologies, allows users to provide sensitive local and health data, without violating data privacy, to other users and officials.
On April 5, 2020, the TCN Global Coalition was formed by a number of groups that gathered at the center of what was essentially similar and mainly covered by protocols, with the aim of reducing dispersion and providing a framework for global cooperation in the field of tracking and warning programs, from the key aspects of achieving broad acceptance.
On 9 April 2020, the government of Singapore announced that it has made the BlueTrace Protocol available to the public, which was applied to its government’s official program.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, controllers of Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced a call tracking initiative that they claimed to preserve privacy, which is based on the combination of “Bluetooth Low Energy” technology and privacy encryption.
They have also published the main technologies used in this system.
According to Apple and Google, the system will be launched in three stages:
Introduction of tools to empower governments to create coronavirus tracking programs with the ability to preserve privacy
Google and Apple intend to fix the problem of continuous acceptance and monitoring by distributing this system through an operating system update and then removing it in the same way after the threat has been removed.
Substitution of the drug (known as changing use, changing profile, changing function or moving therapy of the drug) is referred to as changing use of the approved drug for the treatment of a disease or physical problem different from what the drug was originally developed for it.
This is a path of scientific research that is carried out for the development of safe and effective cuid-19 treatments.
Other research objectives include the development of the Quid-19 vaccine and improved plasma transmission. SARS-CoV-2 contains approximately 66 medicinal proteins, each of which has several ligand connection locations.
The analysis of these connectivity sites provides a reasonable plan for developing an effective antiviral drug against Quid-19 proteins.
Among the most important target proteins SARS-CoV-2 can be referred to semi-papine protein, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, helicase, S protein and ADP ribofosfatase.
Hussein A and colleagues examined several proposed medicines that were then optimized for their skeletal similarity to the most approved medicines to accelerate the process of developing a powerful anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug in a pre-clinical study that was to be proposed in the design of a clinical study.
Chlorocine is a type of anti-malaria medicine that is also used to treat some autoimmune diseases.
On March 18, the WHO announced that chlorokin and hydroxy chlorokin are one of the four related drugs that were studied in the “unity” clinical trial.
Andrew Cuomo, New York Governor, announced that New York State tests on chlorokin and hydroxy chlorokin will begin on March 24. On March 28, the FDA announced the use of hydroxy chlorokin sulfate and chlorokin phosphate with "Emergency Consumption License" (EUA).
This treatment has not been approved in the FDA clinical trials process and its use is permitted according to EUA only for experimental treatment and emergency use in hospitalized patients who are unable to receive the drug in clinical trials.
The CDC stated that “the need to take, the amount or the duration of hydroxy chlorokin to prevent or treat SARS-CoV-2 infection” has not yet been determined.
Doctors have said they will take these medications if "there is no other option".
A research group in Istanbul, Turkey, is conducting a small research plan on the use of chlorokin along with iron, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Extensive studies are ongoing at Duke University and Oxford University.
The Langon NYU Medical School is conducting an experiment on the safety and effectiveness of preventive hydroxy chlorokin consumption.
Clinical trials in Wuhan and Shen Gen in China claimed that favipiravir was “completely effective”.
The test result in 35 patients was negative in an average of 4 days, while the duration of the disease in 45 diseases that they had not received was 11 days.
In a study conducted in Wuhan on 240 malignant patients, half of the patients were given favipiravir and the other half was given umifenovir.
The Italian Pharmaceutical Agency reminded people that the evidence available on the effectiveness of the drug is insufficient and preliminary.
On April 2, Germany announced that it will buy the drug for its storage from Japan and help the army to deliver the drug to educational hospitals where it will use the drug to treat patients with Quoid-19.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has proposed to the Trump administration to buy the drug, which may not be very effective in treating severe cases of the disease in which the virus has spread.
Use may not be safe for pregnant women or people who intend to get pregnant.
The study of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir antivirus, found that “no benefit was observed.”
These medications are designed to prevent the reproduction of HIV through adhesion to the protein.
A group of researchers at the University of Colorado are trying to modify these medications to find a compound that can adjust to the SARS-CoV-2 protein. in the scientific community, criticisms have been raised on the guidance of resources to change the use of medications designed for the treatment of HIV/AIDS.
The World Health Organization has included lopinavir/ritonavir in the “unity” international experiment.
Gilead Sciences had developed the drug Remdesivir as a treatment for Ebola viral disease and Marburg viral infections. Gilead Sciences later found that Remdesivir was active in a laboratory environment against the viruses of philo, penum, paramyxus and corona.
One of the problems of antiviral treatment is the creation of resistance through mutations that can lead to more severe diseases and transmission.
Some preliminary pre-examination studies suggest that Remdesivir may be an effective genetic obstacle to the formation of resistance. Several clinical trials, including two cases that Cleveland Educational Hospital is conducting, are ongoing. One includes people with a mild disease and the other includes people with a severe disease.
Three clinical trials were conducted on the impact of intravenous injection of vitamin C on hospitalized people with severe Quid-19 disease. Two of them are controlled by drug (China and Canada) and one is uncontrolled (Italy).
The state of New York began the test of azithromycin antibiotics on 24 March 2020.
The Japan National World Health and Medicine Center (NCGM) is planning to conduct a clinical trial for Alvesco Tygin (Cyclosoneid), a type of asthma inhaled corticosteroid, to treat patients with no symptoms and infected with the new coronavirus.
A type of Phase II examination on the Enzyme 2 Angiotensin Converter involves 200 patients in the course. 200 hospitalized and ill patients from Denmark, Germany and Austria are involved in the examination to determine the effectiveness of this treatment.
Researchers at the Montreal Canadian Heart Institute are exploring the role of chlorocine in reducing inflammation and respiratory consequences in patients with mild quoid-19 symptoms.
The study, called Colcronata, included 6,000 patients aged at least 40 who have been diagnosed with Quid-19 and have mild and unnecessary symptoms.
Pregnant or breastfeeding women or women who use effective methods of pregnancy prevention are not eligible to participate in this study.
Several blood clotting drugs are being tested in Italy.
Heparin with low molecular weight is widely used for the treatment of patients and this is why the Italian Medical Agency has been required to publish its instructions for use.
The news of a multi-centric study of 300 patients to examine the effect of taking anoxaparin sodium on preventive doses and treatment was announced on April 14 in Italy.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a type of virus, dramatic scientific attention is focused on changing the application of antiviral drugs that were produced for the treatment of previous infectious diseases such as MERS, SARS and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: Ribavirin was recommended according to China's 7 Editor's Guidelines for Quid-19 Treatment
Omi Fenoir: Omi Fenoir was proposed according to China's 7 Editor's Guidelines for the Treatment of Quid-19
Among the antibiotics listed as a possible alternative to Quid-19 treatments, the following can be mentioned:
Tocillizomab (Anti-IL-6 receptor): approved in China.
There are also experiments in Italy and China. and see Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
B'Vaccin Quid-19 is a presumed vaccine against the 2019 (Quid-19) coronavirus disease.
Although no vaccine has completed clinical trials, many efforts are ongoing to build this vaccine.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that it does not expect the SARS-CoV-2 virus to be available earlier than the next 18 months.
Five of the recommended vaccines were under stage I immunity studies in April.
Quid-19 was identified in December 2019.
The widespread global outbreak occurred in 2020 and led to impressive investment and research activities for the construction of the vaccine.
Many organizations use published genoms to produce a possible SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.
In April it was announced that the CEPI initiative requirements for the development of the vaccine include speed, production capacity, scale settlement and global access.
In April, CEP scientists announced that 10 different technology platforms will be reviewed and developed in early 2020 to produce an effective vaccine against Quoid-19.
The main objectives of the platform that have entered stage I immunity studies include:
Nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (Fase I developers and recommended vaccine: Modern, mRNA-1273)
Viral carrier (developer of phase I and recommended vaccine: CanSino Biologics, carrier of type 5 adenovirus)
According to the CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 proposed vaccines are in the early stages of development, 78 of which have been approved as an active project (79, according to the Milken Institute) and 37 have been published but few of them are not available to the public (assuming they are in the planning or design stage).
Phase I-II testing involves preliminary immunity and safety examination, usually random and controlled by the pharmacist, performs in different centers and determines more accurate and more effective doses.
Phase III trials usually involve more participants in a control group and, while examining the effectiveness of the vaccine for the prevention of the disease, track the adverse complications in the dose.
Of the proposed 79 vaccines in the active development stage (confirmed by early April 2020), 74 have not yet been tested on humans (they are still in the “pre-clinical” research stage).
About 24 January 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it is researching the ability of molecular block vaccination to genetically modify viral proteins and simulate immunity reactions.
About 24 January 2020 in Canada, the International Vaccination Center (VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Saskatchewan announced the start of research on a vaccine that is scheduled to start human testing in 2021.
The vaccine development plans were introduced at the "Center for Disease Control and Prevention of China" on 26 January 2020 and at the University of Hong Kong on 28 January.
Approximately January 29, 2020, Janssen pharmaceutical companies, under the management of Hanneke Schuitemaker, announced that they started the process of developing the vaccine.
Janssen, in collaboration with its biotech partner Vaxart, is developing an oral vaccine.
On March 18, 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a production cooperation with Vaxart for the development of the vaccine.
On February 8, 2020, the OncoGen Laboratory in Romania announced the publication of an article on the vaccine design with similar technology to the vaccine used for the treatment of neo antigen cancer.
On March 25, the head of the research institute announced that they have completed the work of making the vaccine and are at the beginning of the test phase.
On February 27, 2020, NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology, from Generex subsidiaries, announced that it started a plan for the production of the li-Key peptide vaccine against Quid-19.
They intended to produce a vaccine that could be tested on humans within 90 days.
On March 5, 2020, Washington University in St. Louis announced its plans for the development of the vaccine.
On March 5, 2020, the US Army’s Research and Medical Facilities at Fort Detrick, and the Walter Reed Military Research Institute at Silver Spring, both in West Maryland, announced that they were producing the vaccine.
On about 10 March 2020, Emergent Biosolutions will cooperate with Novavax.
The development and production of the vaccine.
The partners later announced that they are scheduled to conduct pre-clinical and phase I clinical trials by July 2020.
On March 12, 2020, the Ministry of Health of India announced that they are testing on 11 people in the cartilage and the development of the vaccine in the shortest condition, will take at least one and a half to two years.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, an active biotech company in the city of Quebec, the province of Quebec, announced the development of a coronavirus-like particle with the budget of the Canadian Institute of Health Research.
The recommended vaccine is in the laboratory research phase and its human tests are scheduled to be conducted in July or August 2020.
Earlier in the same week, the Guardian that U.S. President Donald Trump had proposed to CureVac “to provide exclusive access to the Quoid-19 vaccine in exchange for a large amount of money” which the German government has opposed.
On March 17, 2020, American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced cooperation with German company BioNTech for joint development of mRNA-based vaccine.
The proposed mRNA-based vaccine, called BNT162, is now in the pre-clinical test phase and its clinical trials are scheduled to begin in April 2020.
In Italy, on March 17, 2020, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotech company, announced that the results of their pre-clinical trials will be prepared in April 2020 and their proposed final vaccine may be tested on humans before autumn.
In France, on March 19, 2020, the CEPI announced a $4.9 million investment in a Quid-19 vaccine research consortium, including the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Win, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh.
Other CEPI investment partners in the field of development of the Curevac-19 vaccine include Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, Hong Kong University, Oxford University and Curezland University.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists have started testing six different recommended vaccines on animals.
Researchers at the Royal College of London on 20 March 2020 announced that they are developing a self-enforcing RNA vaccine to cope with Quoid-19.
The recommended vaccine was developed within 14 days of receiving sequential information from China.
In late March, the Canadian government announced that 275 million Canadian dollars were planned to fund 96 research projects in the field of anti-Qaeda-19 measures, including several proposed vaccines in Canadian companies and universities, such as Medicago and Saskatchewan University projects.
About the same time, the Canadian government announced that Canada’s $192 million is specifically intended for the development of the Quid-19 vaccine and plans to create a national vaccine bank consisting of several new vaccines, which can be used in case of other cases of coronavirus.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh Medical School the PittCoVacc test, the proposed Quid-19 vaccine, on mice and announced that “SARS-CoV-2 S1 sub-unity vaccines containing MNA eliminated strong antigen reactions [in mice] that were revealed 2 weeks after immunization.”
In Canada, on April 16, 2020, the Faculty of Pharmacy of the University of Waterloo announced the proposed DNA-based vaccine design, possibly in the form of a nasal disclosure.
Using bacterial factors, this DNA will be designed to reproduce within the human bacteria and produce harmless particles such as a virus. This process stimulates the immune system to produce a patch against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the government, the industry department and three U.S. universities integrated their resources for access to IBM supermarkets as well as cloud computing resources from Hewlett Packard, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have unparalleled birth effects or unparalleled effects.
That means they may have benefits beyond the prevention of the disease.
Another random trial in Australia is scheduled to register 4,170 healthcare professionals.
The vaccines at the production stage may not be safe or effective.
Primary research to evaluate the effectiveness of the vaccine using specific Quoid-19 animal patterns, such as ACE2 tragedic mice, other laboratory animals and non-human spiders, shows the need for levels 3 bioimmune pollution prevention measures to work with living viruses and international coordination to guarantee standard immune routines.
SARS and MERS vaccines have been tested in non-human animal patterns.
By 2020, there will be no vaccine for the treatment or prevention of SARS whose immunity and effectiveness has been proven in humans.
According to research articles published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and drugs for SARS treatment has been the priority of governments and public health institutions around the world.
During the MERS epidemic, it was thought that current research on MERS would likely provide a beneficial pattern for the development of vaccines and drugs against MERS-CoV infection.
By March 2020, there was a MERS vaccine (based on DNA) that had passed phase I clinical trials on humans, and there were three other vaccines that were all viral carriers. there were also two adenoid carriers vaccines (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and a MVA carriers vaccine (MVA-MERS-S).
The views published on social media have promoted a conspiracy theory about the recognition of the Quid-19 virus and the presence of a vaccine for it.
The inventions mentioned in various social media refer to previous inventions related to genetic sequences and vaccines related to other types of coronavirus such as coronavirus SARS.
B'Cronavirus 2019 (CoV-19) is a type of infectious disease known as acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) cause.
The general signs of it are fever, cough and breathing difficulty.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, throat pain, hearing loss and stomach pain.
The period of exposure to the pathogen to the occurrence of the symptoms is usually about five days but may vary from two to fourteen days.
Although most cases lead to mild symptoms, some cases lead to the viral nature and multi-organ defects.
By April 17, 2020, more than 2.24 million cases were worldwide from 210 countries and territories, 153,000 of which led to deaths.
More than 568,000 people have been healed. this virus is mainly transmitted through close contact, often through small drops caused by cough, sweat or speech.
Despite the discharge that leads to these drops, the drops usually fall on long distances on the ground or on the surfaces instead of transmitting.
People may be affected by touching the infected levels and then touching the eyes, nose and mouth.
The virus can remain alive for up to 72 hours.
The probability of spread in the first three days after the appearance of the symptoms is higher. of course, the possibility of the virus spread before the appearance of the symptoms and in the subsequent stages of the disease is also possible. the standard method of diagnosis is the momentum reverse polymerosis (rRT-PCR) chain reaction of the Nazofarenx sputum.
Use of the mask is recommended for people suspected of infection with the virus and their surroundings.
Recommendation to use the mask is different to the general public; some officials are opposed to the use of the mask and some agree with it and some consider it compulsory to wear the mask.
Currently, there is no specific vaccine or antivirus treatment for Quid-19.
The local transmission of the disease in most countries in every six regions is registered under the WHO coverage.
People with this virus may be symptomatic or have flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, and breathing difficulty.
Emergency symptoms may include difficulty breathing, pain or constant pressure in the area of the chest, swelling, difficulty walking and swelling of the face or lips. If these symptoms are not resolved, you should immediately consult a doctor.
Symptoms related to the upper respiratory tract, such as swelling, nasal swelling or throat pain, are also seen with less prevalence.
E-intestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea are observed in variable drops.
Some cases in China in the early stages only suffered from difficulty breathing and severe heartbeat.
In some others, the disease may continue until the phase of inflammation, multi-organ defect, and even death.
This period is called a period of time.
The quoid-19 period is usually five to six days, but it may vary from two to 14 days.
In 97.5% of people, the symptoms appear within 11.5 days of the moment of infection. reports show that not all people infected are necessarily symptoms.
The role of these signs-free carriers in the transfer process is not yet accurately clear. of course, preliminary evidence suggests that these people can be the cause of the disease's spread.
The Korean Disease Control and Prevention Center (KCDC) has announced that 20% of all confirmed cases remained without any symptoms during hospitalization.
The National Health Commission of China began to include non-symptomatic cases in its statistics since April 1, with 130 (78%) of the 166 infection cases on that day being non-symptomatic during the test.
Both mushrooms and mushrooms may be a carrier of the virus.
Speaking loudly spreads more particles than speaking slowly.
Singapore’s researchers have shown that not covering the mouth and nose during cough can lead to the release of small drops up to a distance of 4.5 meters (15 ft).
Although the virus is not typically aerobic, the National Academy of Sciences has announced that there is a possibility of transmission through the air and in the air collectors installed in the corridor outside the people's room, positive sample effects related to the virus's RNA have been seen.
Some medical routines such as tubing and cardiovascular resuscitation (CPR) may lead to the spread of respiratory emissions and the spread of the virus through the air.
Although there are concerns about the transmission of the virus through the eruption, this probability is slightly assumed. the probability of the transmission of the virus through people with symptoms is higher. the probability of the transmission of the virus before the symptoms appear is lower.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has announced that despite the uncertainty of the transmission mechanism, each person usually infects two to three people.
In particular, the virus survives on the shell for a day, on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304) for three days, and on 99% copper for a maximum of four hours.
Of course, this time depends on moisture and temperature.
The right use of the soap and washing machine is also effective. soap products eliminate the viral fat protective layer, disable it and throw it out of the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalconium chloride and chloroxydine gluconate (chirurgical glucose), have less effect. in a study conducted in Hong Kong, muscle samples were taken an average of two days after the start of hospitalization.
In five of the six patients, the first sample showed the highest viral load and in the sixth, the highest viral load was seen in the second day of the test.
SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of severe severe respiratory syndrome chronavirus that was initially taken from three people with an acute respiratory syndrome and associated with the group of cases of severe respiratory diseases in Wuhan.
All new SARS-CoV-2 viruses are seen in coronavirus related nature.
This virus is eliminated outside the human body with domestic soap. the protective bubble soap is eliminated. SARS-CoV-2 has a close connection with the primary SARS-CoV.
Quid-19 has the greatest effect on the lungs as the virus enters the host cell through the 2 angiotensin converter (ACE2) enzyme, which is abundant in the type II lungs vaginal cells.
The virus uses a specific surface glycoprotein called Spike (Prolomer) to connect to ACE2 and enter the host cell.
A severe heart attack was observed in 12% of people infected and hospitalized at the Wuhan Hospital, which is more common in severe cases of the disease.
The rate of cardiovascular symptoms due to the symptomatic inflammatory reaction and immunity disorders in the progression of the disease is high, but acute myocardial damage may also be related to the ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are abundant in the heart and contribute to the activity of the heart.
A high rate of thermobosis (31%) and thermobombolism of the veins (25%) has been observed in ICU patients with Quid-19 infection and may be associated with a diagnosis weakness. The cholesterol of people who have died from Quid-19 has indicated diffused vaginal damage (DAD) and inflammatory infiltration containing lymphocytes in the lungs.
Though SARS-COV-2 tends to cells containing ACE2 in the respiratory tract, symptoms of severe systemic inflammation have been observed in patients with quoid-19.
In particular, the association of pathogenic GM-CSF scorting T cells with the absorption of inflammatory IL-6 scorting monocytes and severe lung pathology has been proven in Quid-19 patients.
The influence of lymphocytes has also been in the corrosion.
The WHO has published several test protocols for this disease.
The standard method of diagnosis is the momentum reverse polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
This test is usually done on the respiratory samples obtained with the Nazofarenx slurry. of course, it also applies to the nasal slurry or mixed samples.
The results are usually prepared within a few hours to two days.
The blood test can also be used but it requires two blood samples with a time interval of two weeks.
Chinese scientists were able to separate a coronavirus species and release its genetic sequence, thus worldwide laboratories were able to conduct independent polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to diagnose viral infection.
Until April 4, 2020, the pattern tests (which have the ability to detect active infections and a person’s history of infection) were in the hands of the study, but were not much used yet.
The accuracy of this Chinese experience in the field of testing is only 60 to 70%.
The FDA in the U.S. approved the first care point test on 21 March 2020 for use at the end of that month. Diagnostic Guidelines of the Jung-Nan Hospital from the University of Wuhan proposed methods for diagnosing infection on the basis of clinical characteristics and the risk of allergy.
Multi-rubbular mort glass cordon is used with side, unparallel and back distribution to diagnose in the early stages of infection.
Subsequent overcoming, defective coverage (a thickness of the tube with volatile swelling) and rigidity may be a sign of the progression of the disease.
There is not much information about microscopic damage and quoid-19 pathophysiology.
The most important pathological findings in colobacterial dysfunction are:
Macroscopy: the essence of genus, pricard, heart rigidity and respiratory edema
Four levels of severity of the viral nature are visible:
Light rhinitis: respiratory edema, pneumocytes hyperplasia, anormal large pneumocytes, intestinal inflammation with lymphocytes and the formation of large multi-core cells
The heart of severe inflammation: dispersed inflammation (DAD) with dispersed inflammation.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory disorder syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.
The nature of the rhinitis is improving: the formation of secretions in the cavity holes and fibrosis of the respiratory gap
Blood: Distributed intravenous congestion (DIC); locorithroplastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the risk of infection can include staying at home, refusing to be in busy places, washing your hands with water and soap for at least 20 seconds, keeping your respiratory health and avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with paper towels during cough and sweat and using the inner part of the arm, if the towels are not provided.
It is recommended to take care of the hand after cough or sweat.
The CDC has proposed the use of fabric masks in public places to some extent, to prevent the spread of disease by non-symptomatic people. Social distancing strategies pursue the reduction of the contact of infected people with large groups of people by closing schools and workplaces, limiting travel and canceling large meetings.
Distance guidelines also include respecting a distance of at least 6 feet (1.8 meters) between persons.
Since the discovery of the vaccine is not expected at least until 2021, an important part of the Quid-19 management process is an attempt to reduce the peak of allocation, or the same “flating curve”.
CDC also suggests people to wash their hands regularly and for at least 20 seconds with water and soap. This washing is more necessary especially after leaving the toilet or apparent hand contamination, before eating food and after hiding, cough or swelling.
CDC also recommends the use of hand-alcohol disinfectants with alcohol content at least 60% in the absence of water and soap, for areas where ordinary hand washers are not available, the WHO has provided two formulas for local production.
In these formulas, an antimicrobial agent is obtained from ethanol or isoprophanol.
To remove microwaves alcohol is used hydrogen proxy; “This is not an active substance to disinfect hands.”
Glycerol is added as a moisturizer.
People are managed with support care that may include fluid-therapy, oxygen support and support of other critical organs damaged.
The CDC suggests that people who are suspicious of the disease use a simple mask.
External membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to deal with respiratory failure, but its benefits are still under investigation.
Respect for individual health and change of lifestyle and family diet is suggested to enhance immunity.
Supporting treatments may be beneficial for people with mild symptoms in the early stages of infection. WHO and China’s National Health Commission have presented suggestions to take care of people who are hospitalized due to quoid-19.
Special care specialists and lung specialists in the U.S. have collected various institutions’ therapeutic suggestions in the form of a free source called IBCC.
By April 2020, there is no specific treatment for Quid-19.
To remove the symptoms, some medical specialists have diagnosed the use of parastamol (staminophen) for first-line use better than ibuprofen.
To minimize the possibility of the transmission of the virus, it is necessary to take precautions, especially in the medical locations where the routines of the creation of suspended particles, such as piping or hand-airing, are carried out.
For therapists who take care of people with Quid-19, the CDC recommends a person’s holding in the “Air Infection Cardinal Room” (AIIR) and the use of standard precautions, contact prevention and air precautions. The CDC has published guidelines for the use of Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) during this pandemic.
Recommended items include: PPE gans, face masks or face masks, eye protectors and surgical gloves. if there is, use of respiratory masks (instead of face masks) is preferred.
The N95 respiratory mask has been approved for industrial environments, but the FDA has approved the use of the mask with "Emergency Consumption License" (EUA).
This mask is designed to protect against aerobic particles such as dust, but its efficiency against specific biological factors is not guaranteed for consumption outside the primary application.
If the mask is not available, the CDC recommends the use of the face protector or as the last solution, the handmade mask.
Most cases of Quid-19 are not so severe that it requires the use of mechanical warming or alternative methods, but a percentage of them requires these measures.
The type of respiratory support for people with respiratory failure caused by Quid-19 is examined for hospitalized people. Some evidence shows that with the flow-up canal of the nasal pathway or double-level positive pressure in the respiratory tract can be prevented from piping.
It is still unclear whether either of these two methods will lead to the achievement of similar benefits in patients.
Some doctors prefer to use, if there is, an aggressive mechanical warming because this method limits the rate of small particles spread compared to the flow-up nose canal. The prevalence of severe cases is higher in elderly people (persons over the age of 60, and especially people over the age of 80).
In many developed countries, hospital bed per person is not enough. as a result, the capacity of the health system to manage the sudden increase of cases of severe quoid-19 infection that require hospitalization is limited.
A study conducted in China found that 5% of the patients were hospitalized in the special care department, 2.3% needed mechanical care, and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of people who are hospitalized due to Quid-19 are eventually treated in the ICU.
Mechanical pollution becomes more complicated as the acute respiratory disorder syndrome (ARDS) increases in Quid-19 and the oxygen supply becomes much more difficult.
To maximize the amount of oxygen transmission and reduce the possibility of kidney damage associated with the cartridge and chest, the use of the cartridge with high pressure control modes and PPEP is essential.
Ancient hearing machines may not have a PEEP high.
Research on potential treatments began in January 2020 and several antiviral drugs are in the clinical trial stage.
Remdesivir is apparently the most hopeful among the drugs.
Although the development of new medicines will take time until 2021, several of the medicines being tested have already been approved for other banks or are in advanced testing phase.
Antiviral medication can be tested in people with severe illness.
The WHO has suggested that volunteers participate in tests relating to the effectiveness and safety of potential drugs. The FDA has issued temporary license for the use of defective plasma as a experimental treatment; of course, in cases where a person's life is seriously or completely at risk.
This drug has not passed the necessary clinical studies to prove the effectiveness and immunity related to the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to manage the disease spread process.
Users are asked to enter their name and identification number.
The app can identify the 'most close contact' with the help of monitoring data and identify the likelihood of the infection.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If the potential risk is identified, the program will report the matter to local health authorities, in addition to presenting a home-carnet proposal, using the macro-data analysis on mobile phones, facial detection technology, mobile tracking and artificial intelligence to track the infected and related people in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government provided the possibility of tracking the mobile data of suspects of Kuwait-19 to security agencies.
This measure was taken in order to carry out charter actions and protect people who were likely to have contacted with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom provided the accumulated telephone location data to the Robert Koch Institute, from the German federal government agencies, in order to provide research on the virus’s spread and prevention process.
Russia has used face recognition technology to identify persons who violate the coronation.
Giulio Gallera, Italian regional health officer, has been informed by mobile operators that “40% of people continue to move freely.”
The German government held a 48-hour hackathon weekend with more than 42,000 participants.
Also, Kersti Kaljulaid, the President of Estonia, called for to attract creative solutions to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
Carnival, travel limitation, side effects of treatment or fear of infection may stress people.
According to Rory O’Connor, “Great social isolation, loneliness, health concerns, mental pressure and economic problems can change people’s mental and physical health.”
This disease may be low-symptomatic or unsymptomatic in some stages, and complications like other common diseases affect the upper respiratory tract, such as colds, may occur.
Light cases usually improve within two weeks, but healing people with severe or acute diseases may take three to six weeks.
According to data related to other similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, pregnant women may be among the high-risk groups of COVID-19; of course there is little information about COVID-19.
In disadvantaged people, Quid-19 can quickly become acute respiratory disorder syndrome (ARDS) and cause respiratory failure, infection shock or multi-organ deficiency.
The consequences of Quid-19 can include infection, abnormal blood clotting, and heart, kidney and liver failure.
Blood consumption disorders, especially prolonged protrombin time, were observed in 6% of people who were hospitalized due to quoid-19. the prevalence of kidney failure among these people was 4%.
Approximately 20-30% of people with Quid-19 have signs of increased liver enzyme (transaminase) release.
According to the same report, the average time gap between the appearance of symptoms and death was ten days, five days of which are related to hospitalization.
Of course, in patients transferred to the ICU, the average time interval between hospitalization and death is seven days.
Recent cases survey shows that the average time interval between the occurrence of initial symptoms to death was 14 days, but the full range was from six to 41 days.
China’s National Health Commission (NHC) study found that the death rate of men was 2.8% and women 1.7%.
The tissue-patiological examinations of the lung samples of the dead people indicate the spread vaginal damage and cellular fibromioxide emissions in both the lungs.
Viral cytopathic changes are seen in the pneumocytes.
The image of the lungs is similar to the image of the lungs with acute respiratory disorder syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of deaths listed in the China National Health Commission report, increased levels of troponin or heart attack caused heart damage.
According to the U.S. March data, 89% of hospitalized people have previously suffered from the disease. accessibility of medical resources and the socio-economic situation of the region also affects the death rate.
The estimates of deaths caused by this disease vary due to regional differences as well as methodological difficulties.
A small number of mild cases may cause excessive estimates of death rates.
Of course, the fact that deaths were the result of previous infections may mean that the current mortality rate has been reduced.
Smokers, compared to non-smokers, are 1.4 times more likely to have severe Quid-19 symptoms and 2.4 times more likely to need special care or diet.
The Hong Kong Hospital Administration report indicates a 20% to 30% reduction in lungs capacity in some people recovered from the disease and the presence of symptoms of organ damage in the lungs scan.
This condition may lead to special post-care syndrome after healing.
By March 2020, it was not clear whether the history of infection would cause effective and long-term immunity in people healed from the disease.
The appearance of immunity is tolerable based on the behavior of other coronavirus, but in some cases the result of the test for coronavirus in people recovered from quoid-19 was also positive.
It is believed that these cases are caused by the exacerbation of the infection and not the reinfection.
It is believed that this virus is natural and animal origin, through a serum infection.
The real source is unknown, but until December 2019, the spread of the infection was almost completely based on human-to-human transmission.
With 41 first-confirmed Quid-19 cases reviewed, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, the first case from the date of its signs returns to 1 December 2019.
The official WHO publications have announced the date of the first cases of symptoms on December 8, 2019.
To measure death and death statistics, different criteria are usually used.
These figures change by region and over time and are influenced by the volume of tests, the quality of the health system, the treatment options, the time spent from the initial outbreak and the population characteristics such as age, gender and general health.
At the end of 2019, the WHO assigned emergency ICD-10 codes U07.1 for laboratory-approved SARS-CoV-2 infection-related deaths and U07.2 for clinical diagnosis or laboratory-approved non-SARS-CoV-2 infection-related deaths. Death rates are achieved by dividing the number of deaths on the number of cases diagnosed within a certain time period.
According to the John Hopkins University statistics, by April 17, 2020 the global death rate was 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191).
This figure differs in each area. from other measuring scales, the case mortality rate (CFR) can be referred to which determines the percentage of people diagnosed who die from the disease. Infectious mortality rate (IFR) is another criterion that determines the percentage of people infected (detected and undetected) who die from the disease.
These statistics are not limited to time and follow a specific population from the infection stage to the closure of the file.
Although not all infected persons necessarily produce infection, the presence of infection may provide information about the number of infected persons.
In the small village of 4,600 people in Castiglione d'Adda, the center of the virus in Italy, 80 people (1.7%) died.
In Gangelt, the disease spread as a result of the Carnival festivals. the infection of young people made the death rate relatively lower. however, some cases of deaths caused by Quid-19 have not been officially included in the category of deaths caused by the virus.
In addition, the German health system hasined its efficiency.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of people, based on the assessment of blood donors, may have produced paddenum.
69 cases (0.004% of the population) of confirmed deaths were recorded due to Covid-19.
The effects of this pandemic and its death rates are different between women and men.
In studies conducted in China and Italy, the mortality rate in men was higher.
The highest chance of infection is in men over the age of 50. This gap between women and men is eliminated at the age of 90.
In China, the death rate was 2.8 percent for men and 1.7 percent for women.
The reasons for this sex difference are unclear, but genetic and behavioral factors may affect it.
Gender-based immune differences, less prevalence of smoking among women, and more men with associated diseases such as high blood pressure, at a lower age than women may contribute to increased mortality rates in men.
In Europe, 57% of the people infected were male and 72% of those killed by Quid-19 were male.
By April 2020, the U.S. government has not taken any measures to track gender-related data on the Quid-19 infection.
Research has shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, flu and SARS have different effects on men and women.
A higher percentage of medical staff, especially nurses, are female and they are more likely to be exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization (WHO) announced on February 11, 2020 that the quoid-19 was selected as the official name of the disease.
Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Chairman of the WHO, announced that CO is named Crown, VI related to the virus, D illness and 19 related to the time it was first identified: December 31, 2019.
This name is chosen to prevent reference to specific geographical locations (such as China), species of animals or groups of people, on the basis of international nomination proposals and with the aim of preventing labeling. the quoid-19 agent virus, the coronavirus 2 is called severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
The WHO also uses the title “Quid-19” and “Quid-19 Operating Virus” in official communications.
This disease and its cause viruses are commonly called the coronavirus.
In the early stages of the disease's spread in Wuhan, China, the names "Cronavirus" and "Cronavirus Wuhan" were shared to the virus and disease.
In January 2020, the World Health Organization considered 2019-nCov and acute respiratory disease 2019-nCoV as the temporary names of the disease. These names were selected on the basis of the 2015 Guidelines on the avoidance of inserting the names of places for the name of the virus and disease.
The official names of Quid-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were released on February 11, 2020.
Due to the capacity limitations in standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers are taking action to produce health items such as nasal slurry and hearing machine parts.
For example, in one case, an Italian hospital had no need for a hoursan machine soup and the supplier could not supply it in time. as a result, a local start-up needed reverse engineering and production of 100 soup per night.
After the early stages of the Quid-19 outbreak, conspiracy theories, incorrect information and incomplete information about the origin, scale, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease were formed and quickly published online.
This virus is transmitted from humans to certain animals.
Studies related to finding evidence of the reproduction of the virus in pigs, cows and chickens did not get a result.
No medications or vaccines have been approved for the treatment of this disease.
International research on Quoid-19 vaccines and drugs is ongoing among government organizations, scientific groups and industrial researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization (WHO) conducted the “Unity Test” to evaluate the therapeutic effects of four existing antiviral compounds that have the most hopeful.
There is no vaccine yet, but various institutions are actively examining the recommended vaccines.
The results of previous SARS-CoV reviews are used as SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 both use the ACE2 receiver to enter human cells.
Three methods of vaccination are in the hands of research.
First, the researchers are looking for a complete viral vaccine.
The use of the virus, inactive or dead, is aimed at preventing the occurrence of an immune reaction in the human body against the new Quid-19 infection.
The second strategy is followed by sub-unity vaccines, with the aim of creating a vaccine that can make the immune system sensitive to some sub-units of the virus.
For SARS-CoV-2, this study is based on spike S protein that helps the virus enter the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third strategy is related to the Nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, the new method of vaccination).
Test vaccines of each of these strategies should be examined in terms of safety and effectiveness. on March 16, 2020, the first clinical vaccine trial began with the presence of four volunteers in Seattle.
This vaccine contains a harmless genetic code that is copied from the virus that causes the disease.Padden-based development has been raised as a potential challenge for the development of the vaccine for SARS-COV-2, but there is a place to discuss.
By April 2020, more than 300 active clinical trials have been underway.
Seven clinical trials evaluated treatments that were previously approved for malaria treatment, including four research projects on hydroxy chlorokin or chlorokin.
Anti-virus drugs are subject to majority of Chinese research, which is expected to announce the results of nine phase III trials on remdesivir in several countries by the end of April.
By April 2020, the dynamic clinical development of the Quid-19 vaccine and the recommended medications have been reviewed.A number of antiviral medications available for the Quid-19 treatment are under review, including remdesivir, chlorokin and hydroxy chlorokin, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir with beta interferon combination.
By March 2020 there were unfinished evidence of the effectiveness of remdesivir.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients who were treated with non-licensed remdesivir.
Phase III clinical trials are ongoing in the United States, China and Italy. Chlorokin, which was previously used for the treatment of malaria, was examined in February 2020 in China and its preliminary results were published.
Of course, the community of researchers has been invited to criticize these results.
Korean and Chinese health agencies have suggested the use of chlorokin.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, while suggesting a daily intake of one gram, has announced that the dosage is doubled is very dangerous and may be fatal.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency license for hydroxy chlorokin and chlorokin, with the approval of physicians treating people with Quid-19.In the Guidelines of China's 7 Editor, the name of Interferon, Ribavirin or Omi Fenoir for the treatment of Quid-19.
Initial data show that high-dose ribavirin is essential to prevent SARS-CoV-2 reproduction in the laboratory environment.
Nitazoxanide, after its low concentration effect on the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 reproduction was demonstrated, is recommended for research in the human body.Studies have shown that preparation of the primary spike protein with trans membrane serum protein 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
The study of chlorokin and hydroxy chlorokin with/without azithromycin has a major limitation that has prevented the medical community from receiving without examining these treatments. Oseltamivir in the laboratory environment does not prevent SARS-CoV-2 reproduction and its role in the treatment of Quid-19 has not been proven.
The cytokine storm may be of the complications of the subsequent stages of Quid-19.
Evidence shows that hydroxy chlorocine has anti-threatening properties of sitokin. China’s “National Health Commission” has incorporated Tocillizomab after a brief review in the guidelines for treatment.
After taking this drug in people with severe illness gave positive results, it was undergoing a non-accidental phase 2 national test in Italy.
With a combination of serum blood test, freetin is used to identify the cytocin storm, to cope with this development that is the cause of the death of some people affected.
The FDA confirmed the Interlucin-6 receptor antagonist on the basis of previous cases studies for the treatment of cytokin-resistant release syndrome that is created for another cause, cell therapy CAR T, in 2017.
Until today, there is no random and controlled evidence of the effectiveness of Tocillizomab for the treatment of CRS.
The transmission of pure and concentrated patterns produced in the immunity system of improved people from Quid-19 to those in need of it as a non-vaccination method with inactive immunization, is under investigation.
This strategy was tested for Sars and the results were not certain.
Viral neutralization is the possible mechanism of the operation on the basis of which the inactivate pathotherapy provides a background of defense against SARS-CoV-2.
Of course, other mechanisms, such as cell-dependent cytotoxicity and/or fagocytosis, may be effective.
Other types of inactive therapies, such as the use of artificial monoclonal therapies, are under investigation.
The production of decay serum, which includes the fluid part taken from the recovered people and contains specific bacteria of this virus, may increase for faster development.
Diseases caused by the coronavirus, a group of closely related syndrome
Li Wenliang, one of the doctors of the Wuhan Central Hospital, who later died from a quoid-19 infection and after public information about the spread of the virus.
