She put a lot of sugar in the coffee.
Didn't you know I used to teach French in Boston?
Tom was very surprised.
They were trying to buy time.
I already discussed this with Tom.
Jesus Christ, living among the people, spoke in the horrifying, from the Jewish point of view, Galilean dialect of Aramaic instead of Hebrew, thus showing the untenability of claims to the existence of any sacred language that is especially close to God in prayer.
Tom eventually changed his mind.
My opinion is slightly different from yours.
Tell her I don't want to go.

It's not a science.

Promise me you won't tell her.
Maybe you shouldn't tell her.

Get out of my office.
This car sells well.
I have to work this weekend.
You can't do this to us.
His words embarrassed me.
I know what happened.
When can we start?
I know what Tom should have done.
Say hi to her from me.
Was that a lie?
Tom's answer shocked everyone.
Tom looks good.
Did you kiss Tom in response?

I heard that phrase on the street about an hour ago.
He kissed her on the shoulder.
Don't you speak French?

I used this knife a lot.
How do you know what I had?
It'll only take you a minute.
I'd really like to change that.
We took care of everything.

There's no way out for her.
I'm sorry I did this without you.
You're bleeding from your nose.
Mary kissed you, didn't she?
I hope Tom is in a good mood.
Soon you will be rewarded for your efforts.
Tom wants the same thing you want.
We can't just ignore it.
Where did you meet Tom?
Where's the supermarket near here?
You have to trust me.
Tom didn't recognize Mary.
I don't think I like that.
Even if you're faking it, join us.
Tom wanted to apologize to Mary again.
Tom was thoughtful.
You're too young to go there alone.
Unlike my brother, I can't swim.
He never was.
I really want to go with you, but I can't.
I've never seen anything like this before.
I wasn't going to do that.
I can't believe you.

Let's hurry up or you'll be late for school.
Have you ever written a book?
Tom is not leaving.
Tom and Mary switched places.
How are they taking you out?
Where are you going to live?
I'm usually a peaceful person, but it's hard to imagine what I'm capable of when my family is at risk.
Mary made Alice a new dress.
It was a difficult decision to make.

Mary recovered from her illness.
I didn't know where you were.
Where did Tom get that?
Eating meat is bad for your health and the environment.
Are you telling me you don't know anything about this?
What are your plans, Tom?
Tom doesn't know how to enjoy life.
I want you to say a word for me.
No one loves me.
I wish I didn't know Tom's phone.
"Tom knows". "Yes? Did you tell him?" "No, he found out himself".
Your explanation was very clear.
I slept the rest of the day.
I understand French.
I'm just sure you've just been thinking about something.
The Sahara is the world's largest source of dust.
What do you like best about Boston?

Tom will pay.
You don't need to know why.
My favorite tree is the weeping willow.
I don't have that book.
I don't see any difference.
What are you studying?
You're hopeless.
The sun is at the center of the solar system.
Are you a cop?

You shouldn't have said what you said.
He'll be back in a few days.

Someone is missing.
I'll tell her myself.

You still want to go?
The teacher wrote a short commentary on each sheet.
It's hard to take you seriously.
The tribe settled along the river.
I'll fix this.
I said let them go.
When did it start?
No one cares what she thinks.
I don't think it's weird at all.
"Where did you get my phone?" "Tom gave it to me".
When will you be cleaning up the wheat?
Tom told Mary that he was willing to do that.
Does it make sense to fix it?
Why are you locking the door?
Tom said he tried to do it three times.
He thinks I'm in love with her.
The plane leaves at eight in the morning.
We can try.
Give it to her.
I want to live in Australia.
You can't write programs.
Change the subject.
I love to travel around the world.
Tom understands.
Tom is not tall, but strong.
It's cold this morning, isn't it?
It was a very romantic kiss.
She made dinner.
Please find Tom.
He'll give it to you.
This sentence is not clearly written.
What would you do?
He disappeared in the crowd.
Don't you understand what's going on?
I'm glad I found you.
Tom is an ambitious young man.
Do you think you're fat?

Where did you hide my cigarettes?
This is a never-ending lesson!
This box weighs a ton.
He gets it all because he's a jerk.
I'm sorry I didn't hear you.
He says he's never met her.
It looked like he was going to kiss me.
Don't bother me.
You having fun?
That's not likely to happen.
I'll order this later.
Didn't you know Tom was going to Boston?
This is our school.
I had all day off yesterday, and I'm working today.
Get your coat. It's cold today.
I really need a cell phone, I guess.
Don't lose your patience.
Why is Tom angry?
What a terrible man!
Cardboard is stronger than paper.
Don't be mad at him.
You've gone beyond your authority.
The curse was destroyed.

Can you tell me where the nearest church is?
Stay away from that place.
Tom and Mary are not afraid.
Can you come closer?
She's a little shy.
What actions do you expect from Tom?
She seemed perfectly calm.
Just press the button.
Tom went to the museum with Mary.
Tom was intrigued by what was happening.
Mary wore boots to her knees.
That's a lie.
I'll follow them.
She said she had a cold.
The road inspector was extremely rude.
Tom wants to follow in his father's footsteps.
I don't see any problem here.
I don't have to do this tomorrow.

It's so bitter.
Did Tom tell you where he was last night?
I can pick you up on the way to work.

Let me tell you what I want from you.
Are you going to stop me?
How do you like my story?

It's raining like a bucket.
The whole country is talking about it.
I can't wait to tell him.
You can't buy happiness.
Tom grew up in a children's home.
I don't want to watch this video.

We were just about to go into the room.
I feel flattered.

We'll do our best to help.
Would you buy one of these?
Tom is going to be late for the plane.
She always gets up early.
You want her to help you?
Do you eat rice every day?
We were sitting in the middle of the audience.
You'll make it.
What did she buy at that store?
When will we have a woman as president?

I would have bought it.

I want to go back to this house.
How many pens do you have?
The villa's roof was broken.
Why don't you go and kill yourself?
Tom spoke first.
Did you ask Fomo to stop?
You swore you loved me.
I don't want Tom to think he has to explain it to me.
I was very calm.
Everyone has something to hide.
We're having a few guests tonight.
Her voice still rings in my ears.
Tom wanted to ask you some questions.
Time heals all things.
Why do you always take his side?
We weren't cold.
I saw a cat on the roof.
All men are the same.
Are you hot?
His son is a genius.
Don't miss the chance.
Why don't we have dinner at the restaurant tonight?
Some birds didn't fly.
What else do you want from me?
What did Tom ask you about?
I told Tom you came to Australia.
You were looking for this?
Didn't you tell me you had a brother?
Where can I meet you?
I was really worried about you.
What'd you find?
Can you explain that to me?
We were caught up in a snowstorm.

What do we have to lose?
You'd better ask him first.
He was fired against his will.
Take them to the hospital.
Did Tom tell you where he bought his pipe?
She never answered his letter.
I hired someone today.
Stop being such a fool!
Tom would like us to stay.
I'm on the stairs.
It's the biggest car in the world.
Tom almost never asks why.
I have to get back to work.
Tom told me that's not how Mary does it.
Tom gave Mary all the money he had with him.
Where do you usually buy clothes?
I already did.
What's the weather like?
I texted her.
You owe me three hundred dollars.
I wanted to stop him.
I loved him so much.
Can you introduce me?
We can't tell her.
I want you to know that I will always love you.
She said she was ready to do it.
She was crying.
I told Tom that Mary had to do it.
You're both idiots.
Do you like living out of town?
How long did it take you to do that?
We finally have everything we need.
I wasn't busy last week.
I'm the manager of Tom.
Who do you plan to go to Australia with?
Someone was screaming.
Which one's better?
We appreciate your help.
Go to your room!
I didn't tell Tom to leave.

Let your uncle think about it.
I fired her.
We need to know what Tom looks like.
I've come up with a good plan.
I didn't know you had a cat.
I know you'd do the same for me.

I have two tickets to the concert.
I should have gone to Australia with you.

He dictated a few letters to his secretary.
Why do you want to come with me?
Why are you in your pajamas?
How much is it?

The network is huge.
You've got me!
I think we should pay more attention to the current state of affairs.
I know what you told her.
I didn't fall asleep until after two o'clock.
Mary was not thirsty.
Tom didn't have as much trouble falling as he thought.
I don't like that.
I tried to wake Tom up.
They say that movie is very interesting.
Do something about it, please.
As you know, we were late because of heavy rain.
She seems to be in good health.
Tom was wearing a straw hat.
You watch your sister.
Tom said he wasn't going to wait for permission.
It's time to finish.
Have you had dinner yet?
I like bitter pepper.
What time do you usually get up on Saturday?
I added milk to the coffee.
How can I change that?
Spain hosted the 1992 Olympics.

I could have gone to Boston with Tom, but I didn't want to.
Tom was reading an ancient manuscript.

The typhoon destroyed many homes.
This man was condemned to death.
Call me as soon as you see him.
Can anyone speak French here?
I think Tom still lives in Boston.

Besides, I can't dance.
I love you so much, and I can't wait to see you.
Why are you in my shoes?
Tom has the power.
I learned to practice and play like my Japanese friends.
What are you looking at me for?
No one's going to blame you.

Is it red or white?
We're not afraid of a fight.
A few days later Tom found another job.
Tom moved to Australia.
Let's go!
Do it before it gets dark.
I didn't expect to see you again.

Bring your wife.
Did the mustache suddenly go into fashion?

You're upset.
Our granddaughter was born yesterday.
Tom is wearing a pirate suit.
That's the truth!
Let's go get the tree.
What are these people doing?
I did everything I could.
Tom couldn't remember exactly what Mary said.
Work is my passion.
Why didn't you ask me?
Tom should be here in 15 minutes.
Tom hopes Mary knows she shouldn't do what John told her.
I don't drink wine anymore.
I'll get you out of here.
We're proud of what we've accomplished.
Tom should have invited Mary.
Tom should have been punished.
Are you ambitious?
Tom ate all the bread I bought yesterday.
She's his sister, not his girlfriend.
I'm not sure I understand you.
Schools and universities are closed.
I sweat every day.
She became a postman.
Don't leave me here alone.
I need to know everything.
We need a cab.
Stop beating the cat!
What were you gonna say?
I didn't attack them.
What crime did you commit?
How do we know this man is who he claims to be?
King Harald Gormsson, better known as Harald the Sinisebubby, introduced Christianity to Denmark.
There's nothing we can do for you.

Why don't you like him?

I wish Tom could stay longer.
Almost all of them were dead.
You have to get up early.
Nothing bad happened to me.
It's been a very hot day.
He was wearing a black coat.
I forgot to water the flowers.
I asked Tom to tell me what he wanted.
Tom never saw Mary after that.
You can't go in this room.
Did you have other plans?
Who can blame you?
Can we call him now?
Tom is very talented and talented.
I'd like to talk to her again.

Another day has passed.
You have to do it right now.
I have to go to the X-ray tomorrow.
His bag was badly damaged.
He got hurt when he fell.
We're not biased.

Tom, hurry up! We're going to be late!
I'm sure Tom doesn't think so.
I don't want to know who kissed you.
You're watching your weight?
Tom plays the trombone.
Are you from Tokyo?
I don't want her in my house.
You probably can't do that.
I'm sorry I doubted you.

Do you have any thoughts?
Do you like these perfumes?

Enjoy the cookie, Tom.

I have three French-English dictionaries.
Put it down, Sergeant.
No one can do that.
Tom promised to come to Boston with us.
To my surprise, he married a very beautiful actress.
How did you sleep?
I've got a few minutes left.
Tom wanted to surprise Mary.
They want the best.

It's going to be cold tonight.
She says she'll be waiting for us.
Why do so many people suffer from low self-esteem?
Was that too easy?
What Alice encountered while waiting for an answer was a sudden roar, a loud noise, so sharp as to break her drum strings, and so loud as to reach the heavens.
I lost him in the crowd.
We were talking about Jim when he came into the room.
We can't just sit here and do nothing.
I know you don't know who I am.
Tom decided to quit his job.
Tom can't go there.
Tom helped Mary take her stuff to the car.
You're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.
I know what I did was wrong.
There are many books published every year.
Tom reluctantly gave Mary the money she asked for.
Why do you hate her?
My washing machine broke down.
You're from Boston, right?
We need to hire him.
I tried in vain to solve the problem.
You had to do your homework.
I was on the phone.
I don't think Tom and Mary are married.
They're right behind you.
This rock was so heavy that I couldn't lift it.
Why isn't Tom sleeping?
The way it sounds, the way it reacts.
We rented a canoe.
Have you ever tried banana pie?
The girl who gave me the beautiful flowers is your sister.
Isn't Tom wonderful?
Is he your teacher?
The rich sometimes look down on the poor.

The language I'm learning is very complex.
Your child can walk.
Is that all Tom does?
I wish I hadn't married her.

I told you I'd be back.
Tom is my youngest.
Welcome to the real world!
We'd like to ask you a few questions.
I firmly believe in his innocence.
The president is in office for four years.
I'm glad you're happy.
I don't know if I'm ready for this.
What a long flight!
How much money do you have with you?
Could you solve this?
Tom and Mary are here.
Why would Tom do that?
It's a 20-story building.
If you don't go, I won't either.
Do you happen to know when Tom is coming back?
I don't have any pictures of Tom.
Can you hold on a second?
Are you going to give Tom something for Christmas?
She's not firing him.
I know you work with Tom.
They don't know I'm Canadian.
I'm going to be very busy next month.
Tom was trying to help Mary.
She likes this singer.
If he had followed my advice then, he would be a rich man now.
I made that decision myself.
Can you say that again?
I asked Tom to wait for us.
There was a strong wind.
Tom didn't have the courage to try to jump in a parachute.
How do you know all this?
He runs as fast as you.
We're not as young as Tom.
What time do you plan on being home tonight?
The bag is empty.
Are you feeling all right?
He's stubborn as an ass.
I think you're a good fit.
She knew she was wrong.
This is so cool!
Tom had a feeling that Mary would bring her new boyfriend to a party.
When I came home, he was watching TV.
Tom was talking in his sleep last night.
Tom is ready to defend himself.
You're never right.
Don't say that again!
I called him, but some girl answered the phone.
Where did you meet them?
Mary told me she was going to win.
We have to stick to the plan.
I'll tell Tom you called.
Tom is very strict with children.
How are the negotiations going?
He's prepared for the worst.
The beginning of the story was interesting.
I thought Tom would be interested.
I'm mixing mayonnaise with ketchup.
They complain all the time.
Tom has small incisors.
You understand what she said?
You're a little distracted.
Don't get mad at her.
I'd better stay.
Tom had a brilliant idea.
She's resting now.
I refuse to leave Boston.
Tom said he wouldn't help me.
How do you know so much about Boston?
Is this a safe place?
I didn't know why Tom was late.
He lost his job last month.
Who were you talking to?
I want to believe that everything is fine.
She always keeps her room clean and tidy.
I suspect Tom should go to Boston next week.
Don't walk in the land of others.
Tom watched in horror.
Tom's face was red.
Tom didn't know what I knew.
Where did you and Tom stay?
Don't you know Tom?
I believe in friendship.
We're already done with this.
How's your new class?
Fear your own shadow.
Tom was very pleased.
Hunger was an abstract concept to him; he always had enough to eat.
The hall needs a new curtain.
Can you stay with them?
Tom came early.
I didn't know it existed.
He's left-handed.
Someone poisoned me.
Unfortunately, it was raining yesterday.
Looks like he's asleep.
Are you sure you know what you're doing?
Are you afraid of rats?
What time do you want to leave?
She had foot pain.
It's a risk we can't afford.
I want to talk about something important for both of us.
We need to get you to the hospital.
What is the square root of two?
Tom leaned forward and kissed Mary.
Did Tom swim?
I'd say you're jealous.
I never called him an idiot.
Tom didn't do that often.
I hope we don't do that again.
How many times have you helped Tom do that?
If you were my friend, I'd be happy.
I almost believe you.
These gems are expensive.
I don't know how you do it.
I saw Tom dance with Mary.
By the time I get there, it'll be open.
I'm not sure what size she is.
He was also kind to animals.
Tom and I ate together.
You really don't want anything?
Tom turned on the light and went into the cave.
Who's your lawyer?
We'll go as soon as the rain stops.
Thomas walked away from the door.
We have to do this.
She couldn't help thinking about Tom.
Tom told everyone that Mary was adopted.
Who doesn't admire them?
He and I were crying.
You want to try it again?
Wait a minute.
Why are you so dressed?
Milk can be made into butter, cheese, and more.
You don't have the authority to do that.
I have a project for you.
Tom saved me.
Are you related to her?
When you drink water, don't forget the people who dug the well.
Did you know Tom had a son?
I didn't know her name.
Tom asked Mary when she was going to buy a new pair of shoes for her youngest daughter.
Behave yourself.
You like jazz, don't you?
You're drunk, you know.
I used to smoke.
Didn't you know that Tom and Mary were John's parents?
I wanted you to win.
I felt like an uninvited guest.
Are you popular?
The Russians won, as everyone expected.
He blinked in response.
Tom said Mary was happy.
I know you want to see them.
We're on the right floor.
You can do anything if you try.
Haven't you thought about asking Tom for help?
It's worth a shot.
Tom says I eat like a pig.
Could you say that in human language?
No one else was hungry except me.
Tom is very excited.
No snowflake in the snowflake feels guilty.
Who did you want to talk to?
They can understand everything she says.
I don't want Tom here.
Do you have a German-Russian dictionary?
I just want you to know that I forgive you.
Can you speak French like he does?
I'm solving this problem.
I told you Tom wouldn't want to go.
When's the store opening?
Don't worry, I'll be careful.
He opened his mouth wide.
This is a spit.
I really liked this book.
You're important to me.
When ice melts, it turns into water.
Jane asked Mary if she would stay overnight.
Tom didn't tell the police his real name.
I went to school there.
The fish is still raw.
Try to stay positive.
I was sick.
She strangled him with a pillow.
Look at him.
Will it hurt?
The girl had a big red hat on.
I don't think I can be happy here.
Tom was cheated.
I called you here to ask you a question.
Who is Tom to play with?
I need a light coat.
I've finished my assignment.
It's a cat.

I was listening to him.
Why aren't you sleeping?
He came to you with a guarantee?
Can you take a picture of us?
I heard you crying.
Show me how to do it!

I'm not like everyone else.
I managed to get two tickets to the concert.
He likes to brag about his father's successful automotive business.

There's nothing to tell.
I prefer to travel alone.
Ankara is the capital of Turkey.
I went to the bakery.
I prefer a simpler approach.
They're cool.
I spent the weekend with friends.
Jane's farewell speech was very sad.
I try not to read the news.
What am I supposed to tell him?
You look amazing.
I appreciate your help.
He couldn't help but smile.
Wait, did you say "girl" or "boy"?
I didn't try to kill them.

Take off your jacket if you're warm.
There's so many of them.
He couldn't compromise on principles.
Mary says she's lonely.
You'll probably be done by 3:00.
It was an easy decision.

Anyone can do that.
One language is never enough.
Mary told me she was Canadian.
You seem to be in pain.
Tom forgot to tell Mary about the party.
That's what people don't understand.

It's a truce.
Did you tell him I was here?
Tom goes in.
It's not cold today.
I accidentally put on Tom's shirt.
Looks like the bank robbery was planned to the smallest detail.
Tom didn't like it, but he bought it anyway.
Just stay a minute.
I want to talk to you about something.
The bank is empty.
Why didn't you show it to Tom?
Isn't the weather wonderful?
We'll be there in half an hour.
I was swimming in the river.
Tell them to take the phone off.
Can you tell us what that is?
Say no to racism.

Can I do it myself?
The whole people were touched by his speech.
Do you know how dangerous that is?
He's running.
He's sitting next to his brother.
I'd like to meet him.
How old is Tony?
Can I shower in the morning?
All right, everybody, please listen.
Is it made of wood or metal?
I'm sorry about that.
I consider Tom my friend.

I knew it was a lie.
Better to be alone than in bad company.
It's the wrong data.
There's a big difference between them.
I know some of you think Tom is lazy.
You have to tell Tom not to do that anymore.
Are you disappointed?
I'll stop you.
I think he's acting.
Come closer. I'll see you later.
We stayed at the Hilton.
Tom should tell Mary the truth.
I'll be alone after you leave.

Everybody, please!

Did you order this pizza?
I need you to help me with this.
Tom is my best friend.
Don't do two things at once.
You shouldn't have gone into the woods alone.
No one sees my tears.

She really likes you.
I'm glad you're still here.
These bottles are reusable.
Tom has never kissed anyone before.
I'll tell them you came in.
I'm listening to you.
I haven't been home since October.
I'm very pleased to meet you.
I almost forgot about the meeting.
They had a wedding last fall.
He's helping me.
Put your hands up!
Everyone knows we didn't do that.
I thought Tom had never been to Boston.
She learned to dive when she was five.

Ask Tom about it.
Grab the rope!
You've said it so often.

Documents on the table.
I'm sure Tom didn't know that.

I knew it was him.
Tom is working.
I'm not working today.

Why don't you just tell me?
What month is the thirteenth?
I don't know which book to pick.
Tom didn't understand anything at all.
Tom can't stay.
I panicked.
He's wearing a white cotton shirt.
It's the tower.

They decided to get married next month.
They slept in the car because they couldn't find a hotel.
She's not stronger than me.
You haven't told Tom yet, have you?
She's got double chin.
We can't force people to do this.
Let me take it.
I think it's Tom's fault.
I can't stand this color.
Are they sleeping together?
We're very grateful for that.
I can't believe he's still single.
I didn't even know you knew.
I won't let her in.
The neighbors complained about us.
I think Tom is lying.
Looking back, I think you were right.
I shot a bear.
I never spoke to Tom.
I'm just saying we can't trust Tom.
She has flaws.
I wonder why Tom needs this.
That seems suspicious to me.
I'm gonna pretend you didn't say that.
What are you doing on Friday night?
Tom isn't the only one from Boston here.
Will you support me?
What's wrong with this plan?

That's up to you.
You ready to have some fun?
Are you a friend or an enemy?
This picture reminds me of my childhood.
What happened last night?

What color is your childhood associated with?
I was in a hurry.
I work for the good of society.
There are people here who need your help.
You can do that.
I was a little scared.
Tom used a floor dresser.
I'd like to lie down.

Where are your umbrellas?
I can't let you risk your life.
You are photogenic.
Read this book!
It won't happen again.
Let's talk about basketball.
Tom came to see Mary, not me.
I don't think I can do that for you.
"Hello", Tom said bluntly.
Where are you going?
I almost died yesterday.
I'm in pain.
She didn't have any food.
I don't think Tom knows what time it is.
They're running.
The road is not in line with the number of cars passing through it.
I think you're afraid of my dog.
On the attack!
Look at the price tag.
You don't have to come to the meeting.
I was somewhere else.
Do you have any more questions?
A new sentence is like a message in a bottle: one day it will be translated.
You won't find a job here.
Can you listen to me for a minute?
Everybody loved you.
We are soul mates.
I have a granddaughter your age.
I'm sorry I ruined your party.
I don't need a doctor.
Is that a bear?
How did you meet him?
I've never worked with her.

Let us take care of this.
I assume you're sitting in my shoes.
I was planning on doing it yesterday.
It's a little early to drink, isn't it?
My parents don't like my way of dressing.
Anyone who wants to stay can stay.

The show should start when all the seasons are over!
Road accidents happen every day.
Where did you go skiing?
You were in the barber shop?
The prospect is depressing.
I thought you'd never ask.
Give me the ballpoint pen.
The only way to find out what happened is to ask Tom.
I haven't slept in two days.
She was afraid to travel alone.
You should find another way out of this situation.
Get out of here.
Are you sure you want to do this?

It keeps me up at night.
He's been transferred to another department.

Don't look at me!
I went to Boston last month.
Let go of the cat.

Tom thinks throwing food away is a sin.
Don't look at me like that.
The road here is curving to the right.

When did you see Tom?
Why haven't you talked to Tom about it yet?

I'm sure you will.
I'm glad you helped me.
I think your English has improved a lot.
Let's go to church.
Tom pulled out the whiskey.
Was it hard?

I need to see you right away.
I'm not hungry at all.
Show me your passport, please.

I didn't give it to them.
Tom and I went fishing.
He was just a shadow of himself.
How do we do that?
I can't believe Tom doesn't really want to come to Boston with us next week.
Let's not let them in.

What day is it?
Let's give Tom another chance.
I just want you to accept me for who I am.
I'm just a guy.
Wake me up before you wake up.

Tell me more about Tom.
He's right behind you.

Do you want to go to the movies tomorrow?
Thank you for your concern.
Tom's suitcase is empty.
Oh, my God, it's on fire!
I'm afraid you're going to get lost.
I like going to school.
I offered to help.
I'm going back to Canada tomorrow.
Thank your son for me.
I think her father is a lawyer.
I want to see the volcano.
I know the owner.
The dog is yours.
What do you mean, "I'm not a man"?
There's nothing you can do about it.
Tell Tom I'm going to his house this afternoon.
They need you.
It's an orange.
What else can I do to help you?
I'm trying to impress her.
Can't you see what happened?
I didn't want to disturb him.
The officer instilled courage in his men.
Tom will never find her.
Anyway, I'm thinking about trying something similar right now.
I'm not very good at hunting.
This is the first time I've ever cooked meat on a grill at home.
You're avoiding me.
Why did they do that?
Tom would have apologized to Mary if he thought it was important.
How many umbrellas do you have?
You are a gentleman.
Tom quickly became very famous.
Everybody knew that.
If you want to be free, destroy your TV.
You mustn't lie.
I know Tom is about to cry.
Mom, look what I found.
I wonder what Tom meant.
I already knew that.
I never met Tom.
Maybe she said that.
Who told you the story?
I don't want to argue with you.
I saw the way he looked at you.
Tom was skeptical.
Tom should be home.
She was the one I thought of.
Tom showed the police his driver's license.
I cut my hair every month.

Bring your best game.
We accept checks.
My bike is gone.
The stars were shining in the night sky.

What kind of music do you usually listen to?
Without bread, there is no food.

I didn't find them right away.
Hurry up, please! Tom is waiting.
Listen to what the teacher says.
She looks amazingly like Marilyn Monroe.
I know who we can turn to for help.
I'm stronger than you.
She felt deep regret as she looked back on her life.
I don't think Tom knows what he's doing.
I swear I haven't seen her.
I really loved him.
Tom and I nodded in agreement.
In politics, respect is hard to earn, but it's easy to lose.
Stop being a child!
Let's get out of here.
They start believing their own lies.
Don't lift him up.
Tom wants to dye his hair.

Are you sure Tom can do that?
F = ma  is a record of Newton's second law.
What do you have against her?
He likes to sing.
I need to clean up some tails.
Is Tom all right?
I said yes.
Fortunately, Tom is much better today than he was yesterday.
I don't know much more about Tom.
I can't pay him today.
Since I'm pressing every day, you can finally see the relief.
Tom wants to run away.
Tom was alone.

I'm going to tie my nostrils.
I did what I promised to do for them.
I'm the new teacher.
They're all children.
She was freaking out and screaming at me.
Did you take your medicine?
The rabbits are very cute.
She doesn't trust him.
Time is on our side.
You don't know him?
I'm still in shock.
Do you like bowling?
I don't want to hurt my son's feelings.
Is there something you wanted to tell me?
I doubt Tom is still angry.
You'll be better in the morning.
What do you want to tell them?
We're taking her home.
Do you smell the burning rubber?
That's not what happened here.
When's your dad coming home?
I know. I know.

I respect his views, though I disagree with many of them.
The skyscraper is in the center of the city.
Who sent you?
She tied him up with a sweater.
I don't think Tom will want to go to Boston with you.
Tom wanted Mary to know.
Is it cheaper to call after 9:00?
You don't have to go.
Put it on the floor.
If only I could go with her.
Tell her no.
He didn't say anything.
You're not using them, are you?
How much money do you owe us?
Don't be late for school.
We didn't have a chance of winning.
How long do you plan on staying?
We had a quick meal and left immediately.
There's a big garden behind the house.
You're stubborn.
Careful, don't throw anything on your feet.
Start each meal with soup.
I'm afraid to be alone.
What did she whisper to you?
We couldn't find anything.
Did you even call him?
He didn't stop the car.
He sat right in front of me.
The cell was open.
I brought wine.
I'm not popular.
It's his first day at school.
I want to meet you to death.
She's beautiful too.
He told me he wasn't sure.
Can I suggest another strategy?

He hates himself.
You're looking for this book, aren't you?
It had to be you.
Mary left a hat in my room.
Is that drinking water?
She doesn't think so.
You live there?
What would you eat?
You don't recognize her?
I didn't ask if Tom planned to do that or not.
I'm going down.
I wasn't able to come to his birthday.
I thought Tom would be disappointed in me.
Tom wears new shoes.
She learned to ride a bike last year.
Help us out.
You don't have to thank me.
Because it was winter, he didn't go out.
I was walking down the street and I saw my friend.

You still have a problem with that?
I never asked her.
Nothing is more relaxing than a hot bath.
I really don't have much time.
How can I cancel my wedding?
