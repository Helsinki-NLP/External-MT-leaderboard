Parliament has not ratified the amendment to the release of Tymosenko
The Ukrainian Parliament rejected, in the context of an amendment to the Criminal Law, the proposal to annul the paragraph on the indictment of the opposition leader Julia Tymosenko.
MEPs rejected the draft amendment to reduce the penalties for economic offences, which could have opened the door to freedom for the former Prime Minister currently imprisoned.
Tymosenko was sentenced in October to seven years in prison for concluding a disadvantageous deal with Russia for the purchase of natural gas.
The verdict is not final and the court is due to rule on the defendant's appeal in December.
Tymosenko called the verdict a political revenge of the regime and provoked a process of suspicion of court bias also in the West.
The draft to repeal paragraph 365 of the criminal law, on the basis of which the former Prime Minister was convicted, was signed by 147 Members.
It would have taken 226 votes to approve it.
The Libyan victory
The Libyan liberation or rebellion has already had its losers.
Muammar Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
It's up to the winners.
As is the custom in the region, the winners of the elections are the Islamists, but are they moderates or radicals?
The provisional National Council has decreed the usual law of Sharia and we already know what it is.
Libya is becoming a crime-free country because for a robbery, you cut off your hand.
Women can forget about emancipation, and those who fail to respect the faith are subject to the death penalty...
It is the Qur'an that will unite the society of opposing tribes instead of the dictator's personality.
In Libya there will be an order that we cannot imagine and would not like.
But our way of life is not unique, it is not objectively the best, and it probably would not be beneficial to Libyans.
It is especially surprising that the Islamist warriors accepted the help of the unfaithful dogs.
The only excuse is that it wasn't an American general who was leading the NATO strikes but rather Allah whose greatness they celebrated in each attack.
So when it comes to finding the winners in Libya, the West is not part of it.
We have participated in the shootings, served Islam and our politicians have turned away from the dictator as a political ally without any benefit.
After the recent bad experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq, we are not occupying Libya militarily.
So there's no problem for the locals getting rid of the cruise ship.
Without land occupancy, oil companies will have easy access to Libyan black gold.
Perhaps not so much and the West will eventually boast of unselfish protection of human rights.
I don't think we should be prevented from doing that by these Sharia people.
A new era of crisis is beginning.
France and the rest of Europe are in the spotlight.
A statistical tornado hit Europe on Tuesday.
Each of the States has published GDP information for the 3A.
The Czech economy has stagnated in the last quarter, while France and Germany are growing.
The bond market is breaking all records.
Investors are not only looking at Italy but also Spain, France, Austria and others.
The euro area statistical offices, Germany, the Czech Republic and other European countries have published their economic development forecasts for the third quarter earlier.
Germany's GDP is projected to grow by 0.5%, while France's is projected to grow by 0.4%.
Both countries have amended data for the second quarter, during which Germany performed better than expected (growth of 0.3% instead of 0.1%), however France reported a slight decrease of 0.1% (it was originally concerned with stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% in the third quarter.
But GDP has stagnated and according to the Czech Statistical Office it is confirmed that we are heading towards a gradual decline in economic growth.
The results are worse than analysts predicted.
The most important events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% in the third quarter but stagnated in the last quarter.
The German economy grew by 0.5% in the third quarter according to forecasted and periodically recalculated data.
The euro area and EU economies grew by 0.2% between July and September compared to the previous quarter, which corresponds to what analysts had predicted.
The Greek economy fell by 5.2%.
The yield on ten-year bonds is 28.45%
The yields of bonds in Spain and Italy are rising to critical limits.
The problems are beginning to be felt in Austria, France, Belgium, etc...
The yields on Czech bonds remain below 4% as the situation in the region deteriorates.
There are voices in Germany that the ECB should be the last resort .
The Czech Republic has qualified for the EURO.
They won Montenegro 1-0 and are celebrating the qualification for 200 million
The football team has accomplished its most difficult mission of the season!
In Montenegro, she also won thanks to super Cech and goalkeeper Petr Jiracek 1:0.
The Czech football team has also successfully defended its qualification in the second half and will not miss the European Championship.
IHNED.cz followed the qualifying match with a detailed report.
No particular excitement during the first part and a good deal of luck for the second.
The Czech team also won thanks to super Czech and hero Petr Jiracek with a 1-0 win over Montenegro and is celebrating its qualification for the European Championship.
The Montenegrin side were under pressure until the second half because of a precise Czech defense.
The game's losers were Damjanovic and Vucinic who missed two chances to score a goal.
And thanks to super Petr Cech, the Czech team will not be absent from next year's European Championship, plus a reward of 200 million crowns in the Czech football fund.
From the first few minutes, we played a warrior football.
Both teams had difficulty putting on a suit and the game was mainly centered around the center line.
The pressure from the national football team failed to break through the Czech defense, which responded precisely to the long shots even in the first half.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country's nuclear program.
They created a human shield
A few hundred high school students have created a human shield around a nuclear site in Iran.
They want to support their country's nuclear program in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
The students began to pray at noon outside the site and then wished for the death of the US and Israel.
A few hundred students at the universities of Isfahan created a human shield around the Isfahan nuclear technology center where uranium is processed on Tuesday.
They have thus openly stated that they would defend their country's nuclear program at the risk of their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) found in its latest information that Iran has not stopped strengthening its nuclear weapons.
There are reports in Israel of a possible attack by Iranian nuclear facilities.
The students began to pray at noon outside the site and then wished for the death of the US and Israel.
In the event of an attack, the aim of which is to destroy Iran's nuclear programme, targets would be not only Ispahan but also the Natanz uranium enrichment site.
The diet of an obese child: not eating breakfast and eating snacks for dinner
Over one third of children aged 9 to 13 are overweight, 9% of schoolchildren are overweight and 5% are obese.
As current research shows, obese children come from families with an unhealthy lifestyle.
This again shows the importance of the environment and the patterns that surround human life.
For example, on the tables of obese children, snacks are found 50% more often than in families with children of normal weight.
19% of obese people had fries at dinner according to the survey conducted with an awareness campaign "Obesity is not a coincidence"
In families of young adults, sports are also not a habit, as is now the case with most schoolchildren today - only 15% responded that at least once a week parents found time for active movement.
Survey of 900 children
The survey was conducted during the last school year and involved 900 pupils from primary schools in the Czech Republic.
This was the second edition of "Obesity is not a coincidence", a campaign supported by General Health Insurance and Unilever.
Since the beginning, more than 12,000 students from sixth to third grade have signed up for this project.
One of the key factors that causes a dramatic increase in the number of overweight or obese children is the lack of adequate nutrition and not enough exercise.
"Only half of the children surveyed say, for example, that they eat five times a day breakfast - lunch - snack - dinner, which is a basic principle of good nutrition", says one of the results of the survey.
No breakfast and no snacks at dinner
Experts point out that for healthy development, some basic details are needed, such as a family breakfast at the same time.
In the Czech Republic, only 23% of school families eat at the same time.
In most families, everyone eats breakfast alone.
And the worst thing that was found was that one tenth of the population doesn't eat breakfast at all.
Breakfast, however, is the basis of a good daily diet.
The questionnaire showed that in families with obese children, unhealthy fries are more commonly consumed.
Almost every student - not to mention the weight - drinks sugary drinks every day (70%).
More than 40% of the children surveyed do sport regularly but for parents, that's half, only 15%.
You cook your own food .
Another part of the survey allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to prepare their own meals using options offered according to their own taste and personal opinion.
"The preferences of Czech children aged 12 to 15 years are far from ideal in terms of healthy eating".
Their favorite dishes include lots of cakes, meats, and sweets.
"The most alarming factor is the high preference for sweet lemonades", the survey results indicate.
For lunch, the pasta took the first place right before the white meat.
The children did not want any starches at all and the preference for fish and vegetable meals was very low.
Health
The survey also showed that children are ready to change their habits from the moment they receive ad hoc information.
"A review of a group of survey participants who completed the questionnaire following the 'Obesity is not a coincidence' awareness-raising session showed a strong determination to move towards a healthy diet", the survey results indicate.
The most striking example was the sugary lemonade, as children began to prefer drinking water.
Children most often checked the white meat and fish as the main course on the questionnaire and would reduce the sugary dishes and the "knedliky" (Czech specialty of bread flour balls or potatoes).
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, say professionals
In an introductory article on how to learn for stylists, I got a little angry that there were so many from the beginning.
I didn't think about what would happen next.
The presentations of three specialists, the dress of the characters and a seminar on what is happening on the spot.
And it's going to get worse.
The closer we get to the final exams, the more practical exercises and information we expect.
And even when there's classes on Saturdays and Sundays, it's really "bored".
This time we have with Director Alenka (in which there are no boys) dealt with how to dress the woman who has no standard measurements.
And women like that are the majority.
One has a small neck, the other a boy's body, no particular curve, the other overweight.
The stylist must know how to visually move wide arms, extend a neck or add the necessary curves.
So we've come to beautifully highlight the character and also not to dress too prominently for the type of women like Jennifer Lopez with strong breasts and pronounced hips and a thin waist.
For example, if there is a difference between the height and the hips so that the skirts or pants do not slip at all, it is worth making it custom made.
And you won't regret it because flawlessly fitting clothes are invaluable.
You'll feel much better in a custom skirt than in one that slides around, rolls around and doesn't stick to the belt and so on.
For those who have a male appearance, Tucker-style clothing may have been affordable, with sewn pieces of fabric, or embroidery.
There are obviously many examples of different appearances and I'm glad I have all week to sort out all the information I receive.
But I'm also afraid that there's too much to do at home.
Each trainee was given a celebrity to dress for the day and evening.
We must consider the current appearance, the type of fashion and personality that is present.
I'm gonna have to dress Miranda Kerr, who you may know from the Victoria's Secret campaign.
Deep down, I'm happy about it, because it's better than dressing Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera who's gained almost a hundred pounds recently (don't take my statement, svp, completely seriously) or the young Selena Gomez.
We have to cut and sew from magazines or search the Internet, print and work on the graphics.
The Moodboard, as the end result is called, expresses our personal style as well as our relationship with graphic design.
It is also important to consider the graphic aspect of styling.
The designer not only dresses the body but also creates productive magazine pages (on products that are trendy for handbags, coats, etc.).
Mario Kamenik, a designer and graphic designer, told us about all this.
But that... until Sunday.
The stylist must have a general vision
Three special guest speakers gave a diverse look to the Saturday session filled with information about the different types of characters.
Honza Pokorny, stylist, Jakub Polanka, fashion designer and Ben Renc, fashion photographer.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should know how to use it.
And a talented stylist can work with one piece of clothing in a different way.
Variability is key to this example.
Like this trench coat that has to be worn classically with jeans and a t-shirt like a light coat but it can also dress the naked body with scarves and take pictures of it like a dress.
Or you just put your sleeves up or your collar up and get a new look right away.
"Play with it", he stressed.
But I particularly liked the advice: "You need to know the rules perfectly for work".
"You can then start to break it", said Jakub.
I finally understand why we strive to learn these rules, what to do with them, what to do, why, when in fashion magazines we sometimes see something else.
No announcements about the fashion shows.
I know again, thanks to fashion photographer Ben, that the stylist must have a lot more variations on clothing than the ones being photographed.
That is, for a fashion story that will have ten pages (so ten models) I must be willing to "retail" at least fifteen.
And also, a garment and its combination with other elements appear completely different from what they actually are.
We have to count on that when we create a model.
The fact that image and style sometimes make up half the success has been confirmed to us by Honza Pokorny.
Look at Madonna, who's not a superstar, but her image and marketing made her a global star.
In the Czech Republic, the approach to using stylists' services is still cool.
And the familiar faces sometimes see them as useless (just because I know something but what I look like falls into the second row).
And if someone gets a styling from us, then we have to rely on the fact that they are probably dictating to us a completely different size (smaller) than they actually have.
Then we just have to go google and make sure the news bulletin reports the celebrity in question, whether she's thin or fat, etc...
Honza and Mario put us on the heart of Sunday that it's not enough for a stylist to be fashion oriented and know how to assemble models.
He has to communicate with the people he wears, and so it's important to be a good psychologist.
Knowing how to guess people, not flatter yourself, keeping your opinion.
"When a manager asks you to sort her closet and fill it with new items you can't throw it all away and say, 'Oh my God, what a horror.'
"You will find some things that you will find beautiful and you will advise him on what to wear", says Mario.
This one showed us in concrete terms what everything must contain in what is called the "placovka" or stylist's bag.
It's the one you hang around your waist and have on you for everything you need.
In addition to clearly defined items such as scissors, hair rolls, or nut pins, there is also nylon wire (which the stylist uses to photograph products such as bags or hats), special clips with which a garment is closed behind if it is too large (the pin or other type of staple is not usable because it could damage the garment), or a sewing kit.
So that we could help people who not only listen but who have tried something practical they taught us how to look like shoes properly.
And during the photo shoot in the studio where the surface is even, the sole could break down, especially on the outside.
And so we stuck and stuck.
We were not allowed to touch the scissors so as not to hurt ourselves unintentionally.
So it really takes skills.
I was pleased when Mario complimented me on my creation.
The skill I'm reporting is not for my girlfriend.
This is just a brief summary of what we learned during the second weekend of class.
I'm starting to realize that making styling a profession is not a walk in a rose garden, that everyone can say what they want about it.
The need for speed in Le Run is being debated across America.
The Commission
Originally a smooth race turns into a series of stupid mistakes made by people who have nothing to do with a routine morning trip to work.
It fulfills everyone's ambition to some extent, but it's useless if no one wants to do more.
The new installment, subtitled The Run, generated high expectations before its release.
He promised to take a new direction with the already old Need for Speed racing series and to come up with a kind of game from playable parts that would not just count on points.
So we were curious how the extra passages would be where the main hero gets out of his car and does whatever he wants.
As is already the case in the NFS series, the result is quite different from what was expected.
These are potentially arcade racing games but the whole thing is down because of some unnecessary mistakes that have been around for years.
These are not really mistakes but rather the expression of incomprehensible laziness on the part of the developers.
The adventure starts off very well.
You're caught up in the adventure of a hero named Jack who has character problems and to solve them starts racing illegally across America.
You're sitting behind the wheel on the west coast in San Francisco and your mission is to be the first to get to New York.
The idea has interesting elements.
The route is divided into ten stages and then into more than 50 races.
As a result, each race is run on a different route and the stages are planned in different environments that are quite distinct from each other and are interesting.
The player doesn't feel for a moment that the game offers him something identical.
Some environments are quite beautiful, although the graphic technical level is the same as the previous series.
It's not the end of the world.
But driving through the desert, in autumn landscapes, or in high-snow mountains is a very pleasant sight.
The trials are also sometimes accompanied by an atypical element.
For example, you find yourself in a sandstorm in the desert that makes you less visible.
Then in the mountains you have to be careful not to get hit by an avalanche.
Besides, the various races are well arranged one after the other.
There are only a few of them, but that's enough.
There are moments when you try to outrun the required number of opponents (as in a classic race) and then you run against the clock (classic time-clock duel) and then you have another duel with an opponent ahead of you.
Sometimes you also have the police come in and try to make things difficult for you.
The new thing is the exit of the vehicle.
It's more of an interactive animation when most of the time Jack runs away from someone and you have to help him by pressing the right button at the right time.
It's not complicated.
What's surprising is that there are fewer moments like this than you'd expect (to be specific, there are only three).
The result is that this element is not likely to interfere and is, in the context described above, the element that makes the game enjoyable.
The pattern of behavior is in the tradition of previous games.
Which means that there is nothing extraordinary about it at the moment, but we can't say it's negative.
As for the realistic simulation, you'll have to go see somewhere else.
But while we can find better in the competition the driving model goes very well with the type of racing design.
So it's all right.
Problems start to appear after a while.
Unlike the driving pattern, the collision pattern is not yet developed.
We don't expect this game to be a complicated deformation and collision, but when you don't have any idea of how your car is behaving in a collision with any object, it's not completely good.
During tight overtaking you sometimes touch each other slightly but otherwise your car starts in crazy flares.
Or it'll be crushed to pieces.
Thanks to the restart system, that's not really a problem, but it really bothers you.
The restart is done so that when you break your face or you're out of the picture the game takes you back to the last point on the route.
But you only have five restarts.
Once you've used all five restarts you have to start the game again.
So it's more of a tool, in case something doesn't go right, than something you can really count on.
Sometimes restarting doesn't help and you have to find the solution by remembering the track piece in question.
The big catch with this game is that the same actions are in the same place.
For example, there are certain turns that you have to go through in a certain way or it doesn't go through.
Otherwise, you will encounter 'civil' vehicles in a given location, always in the same configuration as you arrived first, fifth, 5 seconds early or a minute late.
What makes you angry is the situations when you see the opponent easily pass between two cars coming in the opposite direction and when you arrive, you have to either stand aside and twist them or brake them.
It doesn't matter if you go in front of him because it's "calculated" in such a way that for a given situation it always comes right near your nose.
Opponents have other advantages.
During the whole game, you arrive at certain places again, without worrying about the weather, and you always have the same opponent ahead of you at the same place.
It's the most annoying thing at the end of the game when you're driving on a long bridge in the opposite direction.
The enemy must at all costs go ahead of you.
When it passes you, it hides the view of the other vehicles in the opposite direction and you collide a number of times.
You can understand the goal of this game is to do something captivating and adrenaline-filled, but it's clear you get bored quickly.
And that's a shame because through a simple driving pattern the game is interesting and places with so much action that you don't have time to keep track of everything that's going on.
And it doesn't matter if it's because of the concept of 50 unique routes, that the race order is such that there's no chance of getting bored or anything else.
The original idea was to change cars during races.
You have to be careful with the gas pumps on the routes because you can change cars there, but most of the time the one you have is enough.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are ideal for cities, large American cylinders for straight highways and super sports cars with exotic atolls on highly technical conduits such as on sloping roads in the mountains.
And the challenge mode, which is racing in particular places that you know of as adventure, goes really well with the main plot of the story.
Not only do you get medals, but you also get experience points that add to your profile that is common to challenges and adventure.
When you reach the highest driver level, different objects begin to unlock:
It connects online with the Autolog function which, among other things, compares your results with those of other players and provides you with other functions in the community.
One of the hardest things to understand is the situation at the last race of the adventure.
You get in your car into the subway tunnel (it looks) where you drive in the dark on the tracks (it looks).
Your speed indicator tells you between 150 and 200 km/h (a priori) and behind you comes a subway train that sends the car straight to the garbage dump.
At the time of writing we had a discussion for a few days about whether anyone really thought through the creation of this game or whether the authors really thought we were fools.
The technical part of the game is not unusual, but the visual part is generally pleasant and in some cases really great.
What's disturbing is that in more extreme situations, the imagery doesn't keep up, and in some cases tragically.
This is especially true in accidents with a large number of participants when fluid imaging is no longer useful.
The sound part is good and the track is up to you.
In order to please the largest number and especially the youngest audience a new soundtrack was created in the style of "I mix everything", but one can expect that no one will buy the game for the music.
So the general impression of Need for Speed: The Run is really confusing.
If the game didn't have these stupid mistakes we could safely say that this is the best NFS production in recent years.
But this game seems like it's not over.
The fun is really good, but prepare yourself for mistakes to strike you in the eye with the force of an airfield reflector.
The students of the Velvet Orchestra in concert with the choirs of Charles University
For the third time, the Festa Academica festival will be hosting festivities that link International Student Day with the anniversary of the Velvet Revolution with a musical part.
During the festival, 20 choirs from the secondary and secondary schools perform.
The festival's pinnacle consists of two concerts organized on 17 November.
"Charles University has a big part in this festival".
"The choir of the Faculty of Education and Humanities is among the choirs, and the festival committee is chaired by the rector Vaclav Hampl", says the head of the organizing team, Jakub Calou.
The highlight of the festival is the high school and secondary school choir concert, which will be held with free admission on 17 November from 2pm on the space in front of the National Technical Library in Dejvice.
The programme features the composition of the well-known Czech jazzman Karel Ruzicka, Celebration Jazz Mass.
The evening is marked by the "Students of Velvet" concert in the grounds of the National House in Vinohrady, where the choirs of the upper schools and Charles University perform.
The aim of Festa Academica is not only to celebrate International Students' Day with dignity and commemorate the 22nd anniversary of the Velvet Revolution, but also to present the public with the highest level of choral music and develop creative cooperation among young people.
The main organiser is the Czech Choir Union in cooperation with Jan Kepler High School.
The whole action is being put under the aegis of Bohuslav Svoboda, Mayor of Prague and Vaclav Hampl, Rector of Charles University.
The festival takes place from 16 to 20 November in Prague and Pardubice.
The programme also offers high-level concerts, musical meetings, student events and other activities.
All information will be found on the festival website www.festaacademica.cz.
Vicenova, Ambassador to the European Union:
The Czech Republic is a negative and eurosceptic country
'The Treaty of Lisbon has radically removed the balance between the institutions'
"I didn't expect such a hard war".
"It will take 5.6 years before the situation is calm and all players get used to their new role", Miléna Vicenova began her lecture at the Faculty of Law as the Czech Ambassador to the European Union.
When she was able to describe the different EU bodies and their relations so clearly and clearly that a large number of lecturers at the Faculty of Law at Charles University might envy her, she showed how seriously she takes her motto 'comprehensible and open about Europe'.
Mrs Vicenova paid tribute to the work of Herman Van Rompuye, the new permanent President of the European Council.
"From the beginning, there was a lot of criticism that he was a dull man, that he was a little bit of a jerk, that he couldn't do any job, and I have to say he took everybody's breath away because he's playing his part perfectly".
"He is a man who can listen to 27 Member States, communicate well with them and has a clear vision of the direction Europe is going".
She explained the new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Defence Policy in response to the question 'Who is who in the European Union?' 'What phone number should I call?' as an important step towards uniformity and greater readability of the Union's policy towards states such as China or India.
Nobody wants to ban us from our syrecky.
Mrs Vicenova also mentioned the agenda that the European Council has lived, lives and will live in the near future.
She called the Czech presidency two years ago a success.
The Czechs have either solved the rising financial crisis, the gas crisis or organized a Summit for an Eastern Partnership.
She called the fall of the government a very negative one and damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU is very busy at the moment.
In the words of the Ambassador, 'the activity has been at its peak' not only for the Presidency but also for the financial crisis which is still being resolved.
The new EU budget for seven months must also be approved, which is becoming very complicated due to the current economic situation.
As it seems that the budget will be thin and for economies, which sector will be the priority, which countries will be the most or least helped, everything is to be resolved in the context of future negotiations.
The Ambassador recalled her slogans when she arrived in Brussels: "For a Europe that is understandable".
"I really don't like abbreviations, foreign words, jargon that nobody understands.
As the citizen must understand, it is true that in Brussels nobody makes round or twisted cornishes, bananas of different sizes or that nobody has forbidden us to make syrecky.'
It wants to make better use of the EU environment and see more Czechs in the European institutions.
A Europe of several speeds awaits us
According to the Ambassador, the Czechs have a reputation for being eurosceptics and people who only see things in their negative rather than positive aspects.
It also regrets the small Czech representation in the European institutions.
The Commission has already decided to take a decision on the basis of the information provided by the Czech authorities.
In addition to a successful Czech presidency, she also stressed the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group.
"Believe me, when the Poles, Magyars, Slovaks come to me, this Frenchman says to me, 'Hey, what are you doing there, what is this group in Visegrad still doing?' and he's not happy at all".
Mrs Vicenova said that in the near future, new hard fiscal policy rules await the Member States.
It is the concept of a two-speed, if not a multi-speed Europe, which prevails rather than a 'new European Federation'.
"We have countries in the euro area and others outside the euro area".
"We have the Schengen area, we also have the enhanced cooperation institute".
First, it was said that countries who wanted to cooperate with each other and those who did not want to stay in their own corner".
'There will be many such institutes and there will be a truly two-speed Europe,' Mrs Vicenova expects.
In this regard, she also appreciated the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuye's mission to establish the basis for all issues having an impact on the EU to be discussed among all EU members and not just euro area members.
History of a brand:
IBM innovator begins the second century of its existence
If someone were to look for the word that best expresses IBM's strategy, the closest would be "long term".
For a broad audience IBM is the symbol of the technological revolution, a firm felt as very current and yet it has been a hundred years since its inception.
The foundation for this long-term strategy was laid by the firm's first CEO, the visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He left behind the slogan that a lot of world problems can be solved in the short time people are willing to think.
His slogan "PENSE'!" became the imprint around which the life of a future giant would develop (and also the title of the internal magazine that IBM began publishing in 1935).
It was the basis of the care company culture developed by Watson.
For us, IBM means a long-term thinking of continuous movements towards the future.
IBM survived a hundred years because it still remained true to its core values and yet was not afraid to change everyone else around it.
This has enabled us in our first century to transform technology, business and society.
We hope that in the second century we will achieve even more", said the firm's current CEO Samuel J. Palmisano.
A Well-prepared System
Watson, in the 1930s, began taking care of his employees like Bata in the Czech Republic - IBM's people were among the first American employees to have paid vacations, employer-paid insurance plus a stylish employee uniform and a well-crafted reward system for inventors and merchants.
Similarly, IBM has a well-developed customer relationship system.
The company was originally great at discovering talent - as one of the first firms to have abolished all forms of discrimination and thus had the choice.
The current plan is completely in the spirit of the anti-discrimination strategy since it will be a woman - Virginia Rometty - who should replace Palmisano at the head of IBM.
She has been with IBM for thirty years and is currently Head of Sales, Marketing and Strategy.
IBM has in recent years been doing what's called jamy, online brain-storming, which has spawned many future strategies and innovations.
No wonder he has a lot of ideas - there are almost 500,000 people working at the firm.
An Institution With a Good Name
The company's internal and external image ensures a secure position in the business field.
"From the beginning IBM had a concept of an institution rather than a technology firm", said Rosabeth Moss Kanter, Professor of Economics at Harvard Business School and author of the book on IBM.
"IBM is not a technology firm but a firm that helps solve business problems using its technology", added Geogre Colony of Consulting Forrester Research.
As the firm itself says, there is a difference between entering the market and creating that market.
IBM - or the "Great Blue", as it is known in the United States for its slogan - has grown over the past hundred years to become one of the world's largest companies.
It is obviously the most versatile technology firm - it develops software, hardware, infrastructure, hosting, consulting services from server products to nanotechnology.
She holds numerous patents from all American technology firms and five of her employees have won a Nobel Prize.
Among his discoveries were the banknote dealer, the payment card, the financial swap, the barcode, or the disk.
IBM was the second largest tech firm by market capitalization this year with $220 billion (the first being Apple), when it first surpassed Microsoft in 1996.
A Preview of the Year
Not all innovations and manufactures were the preference of the customer and the time - IBM, for example, failed to bet on a proprietary OS/2 operating system, the online Prodige service or the IBM PCjr computer:
"From the moment your business is built on moving forward you cannot emotionally stay stuck in the past", observes Samuel J. Palmisano.
So IBM has no problem building its base on many platforms and when they don't work it goes away.
Unlike, for example, Microsoft, which is based on and remains under the Windows operating system.
A Technology Viewpoint
In IBM's revenue, services, which are accounted for by a fifth of the software and hardware, are the dominant sector.
However, in 1990 it was with the highest participation rate representative of hardware.
Starting in 2000, IBM sold low-yield assets for $15 billion, and in the same period it invested $58 billion in prospective technology.
It 's been investing continuously since 2008 , when it first overcame the new financial crisis .
IBM is trading on the advice of its first CEO Thomas J. Watson, who also increased its investment volume during the Great Depression.
Does it now seem that IBM is going through the current crisis without worrying?
IBM's share price has been steadily rising since 2008 to 120 percent, and the firm's net profit continues to grow.
The IBM logo is to change everything but its values.
We can expect this flexible giant to handle other crises.
IBM history: from slices of cheese to spaceflights.
IBM (International Business Machines) was born in New York City a hundred years ago; it was originally called the complicated Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
It was renamed IBM in 1924 - originally a trademark used by a branch of a firm in Canada and South America.
The basis for the future IBM was the merger of four firms whose history dates back to the 1980s.
They had technology such as the old "pointers", the pendulums that recorded the arrival and departure of employees.
The architect of the new company was Charles Ranlett Flint who until 1930 was chairman of the company's Supervisory Board.
Flint hired the head of a competing firm, Thomas J. Watson, to help him run the company.
The leader then cast a shadow over the firm's founder - Watson's ideas are the basis of the company's identity and culture to this day.
Watson ran the firm until 1952.
IBM, as the name suggests, started with the production of all the machines for business and commerce - from cheese and meat cutters to registers.
During the first four years of Watson's tenure, sales increased to $9 million and the company began expanding to all parts of the world.
Watson was so irreplaceable to the firm that after 40 years of management his son, Thomas Watson Junior, took over as managing director.
Under his leadership IBM began the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, IBM's people and computers helped NASA guide flights into space - to Mercury, Saturn, and in 1969 to the Moon.
Meanwhile in 1964 IBM developed the first family of computers - the IBM System/360.
The classic PC that defined the computer standard of the time as the IBM 5150 came on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later IBM sold its computer factory to the Chinese company Lenovo, but bought the consulting company Pricewaterhouse Coopers and began to deal with high value-added consulting and services.
The strategy that IBM has been successful with over the last three years - is the concept of Smarter Planet "a smarter planet".
The aim is to use technology intelligently in areas not yet developed, such as transport and urban management.
In the field of commerce, IBM has recently developed a 'Smart Commerce' platform which helps merchants manage the entire business cycle.
IBM has a strong history in our territory too.
It established its branch in Czechoslovakia in 1932, then the first Central and Eastern European country.
Today, in addition to IBM RT, there is also the Brno Strategic Outsourcing Centre.
The Central and Eastern Europe Centre is based in Prague and there is also the world-class research and development team that deals with speech recognition.
Rychtarova about her unfaithful husband:
Ivette, you can keep that donkey. I don't want any more!
Darina Rychtarova (53) said it was over!
After her husband Joseph Rychtar (53) became bodyguard and lover of Dveta Bartosova (45), Darina still hoped Joseph would wake up from his pink dream and come home.
But she couldn't wait and set clear rules for the future.
"Pepa can come home, but not as my partner", Rychtarova explained.
When Darina Rychtarova gave Bartosova summer shelter in her home, she didn't know her couple would not last.
When Iveta insisted after 30 days to move from Ricany, Pepa did not push the singer away.
And he publicly admitted he loved her.
In time, Darina resigned, accepted her husband's engagement, and finally said goodbye to him forever.
Rychtirova is not interested in who her husband is sleeping with.
If Rychtar and Bartosova split up, there will be no wife to welcome her to the doorstep of the house.
"He's the biological father of my sons, and if he wants to spend his life in our common home, no one will put him out".
"He will no longer be my beloved and lost old ass, but a man with whom I have a special relationship", Rychtarova let filter by showing that she has separated from her husband but they remain only in a decent relationship.
The fact that Darina closed the door on him is no problem for Joseph.
"I respect my wife's decision".
"I'll stay with Iveta and not change".
"My wife has a paper wedding and I respect it".
"The company goes on, I deal with repairs, gardening, real estate, I buy".
"I'm talking to Darina in a completely normal way but we don't sleep together", Rychtar told Blesk.
If Rychtarova finds a new love, he won't stop her.
"We don't sleep together and I don't care where she goes, who she's with, or if she's having an affair.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and I take full responsibility", concluded Joseph.
The worst vices of women: Does this concern you too?
If you ask men to determine the typical vices of women, they can all, both of them, get them out of their "hands".
My dear ladies, you will learn in the following lines of the female vices that manage to pump blood from the veins of men.
The Purchases
Does your partner tell you that you're addicted to shopping?
Do you have to buy at least one dress a week?
Are you happy to buy and pack at auction?
In your case, we can call shopping a vice.
Some women feel that they should limit their desire to shop.
But you say, who would resist the window sill of clothing stores, find herself some pretty clothes and then try them all in the cabin (the ideal of different colors)?
And while for most women shopping is a hobby, it can become a hell for men.
Just remember how many times you told your spouse he was waiting at the door...
Constant dissatisfaction
"I'm not too fat"?
"I need to lose at least five pounds - should I start exercising?"
"Do you like me?"
Do these sentences not remind you of something?
- You did?
So you're one of those women who's obsessed with their looks.
It's not that you should stop caring about yourself, but a lot of men are allergic to the fact that their partner is always complaining about their appearance.
The stronger sex is not hesitant to say that the more frequent these complaints are, the more women become poisonous.
The smell and cleanliness of life
It's like an endless ride.
Wash the windows, put the vacuum cleaner on, clean the floors, dust, unseat the bathroom - and do that twice a week.
Do you notice your partner walking on dirty feet on clean ground, children getting dirty in the sink, smashing the living room window, and that this gives you a lot of work?
If you are suffering from this obsession, try to remember that nothing is to be exaggerated and that order and cleanliness should not come first in the family.
However, this harmless desire for cleanliness can ruin your relationships and even the peace of the family.
The work of the underdog
"Put this worn out outfit in the trash".
"Are you gonna wear those old socks again tomorrow?"
"A wet towel has nothing to do with the floor".
If you do this kind of undermining work on your partner several times a day, you're really going to break it down.
Obviously, you don't think badly. You want everything to be impeccable.
Maybe if men knew, women wouldn't have to do so much work undermining...
The defamation and the perfume
Slander, perfume, and insult are also common among some women.
Women are particularly concerned with relationships and are therefore content to deal with subjects such as who, where, with whom, how and why.
Maybe each of us misses a little harmless perfume here and there.
Hand on heart is a woman's thing.
But worse are those who give advice, fail, even despise others and are especially dangerous to those around them - especially in a women's collective.
Jagr and Voracek helped by participating in the Philadelphia victory
Hockey forward Jagr twice participated in Philadelphia's victory during Monday's NHL game on the ice of Carolina and is again leading the Czech players productive for the competition.
From the standpoint of the 39-year-old star Claude Giroux, who made another pass and was named the best player of the game, he scored in both cases.
Jakub Voracek, who plays with Jagr, also scored two goals during the match.
Jagr told reporters overseas after the game that he had warned Giroux it would be a big night.
"I told him before the game that he'd give his hat trick".
"I felt it".
"Sometimes that feeling falls on you", Jagr explained after his Giroux action scored a goal in the Flyers' first shot.
A moment later there was a second assault by the Czech team.
Voracek fought behind Hurricanes goals for the pallet and presented it to scorer Maxime Talbot.
A second before the first break, local player Patrick Dwyer made a comeback, but the start of the second half was for the Flyers.
Specifically, Giroux.
In cooperation with Jagr, he scored three goals, then Wayne Simmonds turned a fourth.
"I love playing with him".
"I don't mean to say he's the best player in the league but he's really one of the top three", Jagr said of his center.
"I never thought I'd end up playing with a hockey player like him".
"I'm really happy about that".
"I want to play on him".
"All these years in the NHL the other players on the team have tried to play me, now it's my turn", Jagr added.
Caroline made a drama of this game because with a goal from Tuom Ruutu and again from Dwyer on a penalty shoot-out she ends with a difference of one goal.
Matt Read didn't rule out other complications that ended in a two-on-one.
"Pronger has made excellent attacks in our area".
"He tapped the pallet, I took the pace and (Read) headed to the farthest corner of the cage.
"I tried to hit him and I got it", Voracek describes the final goal of the match from his point of view.
Philadelphia came in with this victory leading the Eastern Conference.
Czech defender Jaroslav Spacek of Montreal did not finish the game with Buffalo he came out in the second third due to an upper body injury.
The Candians couldn't face an experienced defender. Their two-point lead lost after a 2-3 penalty shoot-out.
Tomas Plekanec did not alter any of their attacks.
It was the fact that the back line was sick that bothered the local coach most of all rather than points lost because they played the game with only 5 defenders.
"It sucks".
"We only played the game with an experienced player, the rest were young people".
"But there's nothing to do, it's like this", says Jacques Martin.
"Replacement on replacement that wasn't enough and we couldn't resist".
"We just had to simplify the game, push the palette out of our zone".
We had limits to this", added one of the defenders, P. K. Subban.
Ondrej Pavelec, Czech defender who took part in the 30th attack on Winnipeg and the victory over Tampou Bay.
Five different shooters took part in the Jets' five-game losing streak.
How Travel Prices Have Changed Since 1989
Until 1989 there were only 5 state travel agencies in Czechoslovakia: Cedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autotourist.
Travel agencies at the time offered travel to the countries of the Socialist bloc, as travel to the west was very limited.
Czech tourists were on holiday to East Germany, the Soviet Union (Sotchi, Crimea and the Black Sea), Bulgaria, Romania (both in the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
A major exception was the period from 1962 to 1972 when travel to Yugoslavia was allowed and then the regime began to take a westward turn and travel to Yugoslavia was very limited for Czech tourists.
The great paradox of the socialist era was that it was not allowed for citizens of the socialist bloc (and also Czechoslovaks) to travel individually even within the framework of socialist countries.
In the event that the Czechoslovak citizen wanted to travel individually, for example to Poland or the Soviet Union, he needed an invitation letter or else the individual travel was not allowed.
Travel agencies at the time also offered travel to the West, but you had to stand in line all night with a sleeping bag or have a "good acquaintance" within the travel agency.
And even after that, it still wasn't won.
The agreement for currencies that was a condition for traveling to the west was denied to "politically incorrect" people who could not travel at all.
However, the Czechoslovak currency was not exchangeable and it was not possible to obtain financial means without the agreement of currency (Western currency) for travel to the west.
The Czechs spent their holidays mostly in the country where there were many country houses and cottages that the Czechs bought themselves and this custom continues to this day.
The Czech travels have been a major revolution since 1989.
Although holidays in East Germany and Bulgaria were at their peak until 1989, the Czechs spent 4 million holidays abroad in countries around the world last year.
The great paradox that we are not aware of today is that the most popular country is Croatia where it was not possible to go freely until 1989 because it was part of Yugoslavia at the time.
The abolition of visas in the 1990s in neighbouring Western countries led to a huge wave of short-term visits, especially in Austria, Vienna and Germany.
For a long time, Czechoslovaks could not fly westward, which everyone wanted to see for at least a moment.
For example, in Paris travel agencies made Czechs sleep in tents in parks because our income did not allow us to pay for the hotel or boarding house.
The typical feature of a Czech trip back then was to bring your own canned food, sausage, etc... to save money.
Another important moment was the interchangeability of the Czech crown, which finally allowed our tourists, after decades of free Western currency purchasing.
Our standard of living and average wages increased, which led to another important moment around 1997.
As a result of increasing demand for travel, travel agencies have since 1997 started to prepare tours with air charter routes which, through contracts, have greatly reduced costs compared to what was available before.
In the late 1990s, the Czechs had visa-free connections with virtually all developed countries around the world except the US, which later made travel easier.
Another interesting moment in the history of tourism after the revolution, when the first charter flight to an exotic country, Thailand, was prepared from the Czech Republic.
Since this year, as every year, direct charter air travel has taken Czech tourists to the remote warm countries.
More than 100,000 Czechs visit these exotic countries every year!
Another interesting moment in this period that symbolizes our post-revolutionary development happened in 2008.
On 17 November 2008 the EU removed Czech tourist visas and allowed our country to fully fit into the developed countries group.
In 2008 also for the first time in history Czechs spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50.3%) and for the first time ever in history spent more than 15 000 crowns per person for holidays abroad including the additional charges.
The General Assembly must find its President but this may end in a situation of no solution.
The Czech football has been without a president for almost five months and it is likely that the successor of Ivan Hasek, the head of the Czech Football Association, will not be known after a general meeting in Nymburk on Thursday.
However, there is still no agreement on which voting rules to follow.
Without this agreement it is not possible to start voting for one of the three candidates.
Jindrich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomas Paclik are interested in the management of Czech football.
Hasek resigned in June and during his departure called on his colleagues to unite and find a strong personality who will lead football in the future.
Only during the era after Hasek football has returned to divergences between the Association chambers which cannot agree on a common candidate.
This was fully demonstrated on 16 September when a new president was to be elected.
The delegates of the General Assembly met in the National House in Prague unnecessarily because the negotiations were blocked and there was not even a discussion on how to elect.
There was no agreement on who had the right to vote in the General Assembly - only, it seems, the statutory representatives or even the officials with full powers.
In this single point there has been a partial agreement since then, with the assistance of the Office for State and Law, that representation on the basis of full powers is not possible.
Disagreements continue on the election rules.
It is too obvious that the Executive Committee, which in its planned or extraordinary negotiations, has also contributed nothing to the situation.
Opinions on the possibility of voting have changed several times but the key point remains the same.
The question is, how do you proceed for the third round so you don't fall into bed?
"The apple of discord lies in the fact that either proceed according to the statutes or find another model", said one of the three vice-presidents of the Czech Football Association Dusan Svoboda, which represents professional football within the association.
The third round will be won by the candidate who has received the most votes in the Chamber for which he is a candidate.
Moravia is ready to withdraw according to the wording so that the candidate who receives the highest percentage of votes in both houses wins.
And the Czech party is studying the condition that the winner should have at least two thirds of the votes cast.
"Only this would then lose the idea of two previous rounds and it would completely reject the bicameral concept", admits Svoboda, who understands the objections of the moral party and believes that it would be best not to change the regulations and vote according to the current statutes.
It is surprising that Tomas Paclik also agrees even though he believes that the electoral rules established according to the statutes are the most advantageous of all candidates.
"I wish to see as many votes as possible in accordance with the statutes of the association".
"So that there are no more absurd ideas conceived by a representative as in previous General Assemblies", said the first-time candidate, Victoria Plzen, who in his speeches has been mainly against Pelta.
Pelta is still optimistic.
He said there will be a new President in Nymburk and believes the candidates will cooperate in the future together and constructively.
"The qualification for the European Championship today should calm everyone down".
"Football will be on a wave of happiness again and there will be more incentive for cooperation", adds the Jablonec official who among the three has the greatest experience in managing football at both professional and regional level.
Rajchl is more pessimistic.
"I believe in this agreement, but unfortunately the situation is very tense".
"This is not a problem between the Czechs and the Moravians, but there are tendencies to want to change the drawing regulations".
"It may cause a blockade of the General Assembly again".
"I hope common sense wins anyway", said Rajchl.
There is not much time left for a common agreement between all parties.
Some meetings should take place directly in Montenegro but who can say whether the entire football management will be complete for the match.
The specially chartered flight to Podgorice, which included Vice Presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, was not taken off for technical reasons and a variant was being sought to take part of the executive committee into the retaliatory field.
Finally, the ministerial meeting, which could take place on Wednesday, should be decisive.
Minister of Youth Education and Sports Joseph Dobes would be very happy to welcome the torn pieces into the country's strongest sports association and bring them to an agreement.
There is a lot at stake: a state endowment, the credibility of football and also the General Assembly of the Czech Sports Union which must determine the direction of Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclik is going to the presidential race because he doesn't see any right candidates.
If Plzen's head of football Tomas Paclik had seen before the General Assembly whose profile would have answered all his demands for a new President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FRAC) he would not have been running for this high office.
"If such a candidate exists I support him, I fight for him and I do not run for office".
"But in the current situation it has not been possible to find such a candidate", Paclik told the Czech Press Agency (CTK).
Paclik's motivation is to compete with Miroslav Pelta and Jindrich Rajchl to try to prevent Pelta from becoming the leader of the AFRT who would be given the preferred vote in this election.
Paclik also stresses that if he wins the election he will hold the post of President only until 2013 when a General Assembly is scheduled.
He would see the position as a senior manager with experience but no connection to the football world.
"I've been talking to people who would have the profile", he said.
"For me it was terrible when some people told me they didn't want to be identified with Czech football right now".
"I'd like to change that picture", he added.
What is said to be most troubling to Paclik is the relationship between Pelta and the President of the Plzen Regional Football Union, Roman Berbr, a man of distorted reputation known behind the scenes as a lobbyist capable of influencing the vote of delegates to the General Assembly.
Paclik does not believe that Pelta should be the president.
"If he won, the current state would remain and there would be nothing new in football".
"And with the support of Berbr, who is a high-flying businessman, it would be even less favourable to football", proclaimed Paclik.
What is even more shocking is the fact that the name Pelta was pronounced a few years ago during hearings in the course of an investigation into a corruption case, for which Pelta got away with no penalty.
"I don't know what prestige Pelta would bring to football".
"And how would we be seen by UEFA and FIFA", said Paclik, who said some time ago, "if Pelta becomes President, I will sell the Plzen club".
In the event Paclik wins the vote on Thursday, he should prove he can cooperate with Felta.
Rajchl, another candidate who had Paclik's backing before the September General Assembly, which ended in a fiasco, thinks the same thing.
"He (Pelta) would be the first one I'd go with".
"He has great ability"
"He would be able to run for the head of the representation".
"But as the manager of the Association he would not be able to".
"I don't put my nose into what I don't know", says Paclik, who in September attracted a lot of attention when he voted for the cancellation of the Arbitrators' Commission with Ludek Macela replaced by Dagmar Damkova.
Paclik says he's up to the task of running the Association.
He is also the manager of the Plzen club, which last May celebrated its first division victory with his support.
"I have the strength to make a difference in the world of sports and to bring a certain culture to it".
"I would curb the influence of certain interested groups which, for example, tend to influence the Disciplinary and Appeal Commission, leading to bad taste situations", added Paclik, who does not show any dislike for the Spartan leader Daniel Kretinsky.
It would also consider harmonizing relations with the Czech Olympic Committee whose lobbying power with high-level policies would enable more money to be raised for sport from the tax on the games.
"This is one of the key points the new president should be dealing with".
"If it is the gambling tax as the political parties claim, I understand their arguments but they should also say where the money goes", he said.
Paclik does not take his current relationship with the Plzen club as something negative even though he himself claims that the AFRT president should be "above the parties".
Pelta is again linked with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla of Prague.
"It's not ideal".
I see no reason to pass on my shares of the Plzen club to anyone if I have to come back a year and a half later", Paclik said.
Pelta has promised new statutes for the AFRT that should end the pat situation.
Two days before the Football Association General Assembly one of the candidates for President Miroslav Pelta promised that if elected, the AFRT would have new statutes that should end future disputes over the election regulations.
The Jablonec official is very optimistic before Thursday's meeting in Nymburk and believes that the success of the football representation today should calm this war before the vote.
Pelta, who did not run for office in September, promised to devote himself to national representation and to obtaining financial resources if elected.
He decided to run at the last minute just before the General Assembly last year and this two-month delay could well allow him to defend his vision of the management of football and present it in a broad context.
"People at all levels have been playing football for a long time and waiting for a president to be elected on Thursday".
"They feel that this is the best time for someone to take over the management of the Association", he added, but he is primarily linked to the Jablonec club, having worked for many years at Sparta and the Union Executive Committee.
That is also why he has enough experience to manage Czech football.
He is convinced that behind the current electoral problems lies a euphoria that prevailed in the days of Ivan Hasek.
"Unfortunately, at the June General Assembly, statutes were approved which were not perfect as everyone realized".
"If it hadn't been for all these different interpretations we would have had a President since September", Pelta said.
It was precisely the revision of the most important document of the civil society that caught the attention of the delegates.
"If I become President, I take it as a personal mission and am prepared to take full responsibility in case it doesn't work".
"It is a principle without which we cannot exist", Pelta added.
Then he tries not to confront his opponents.
He has previously stated that he can cooperate with Jindrich Rajchl whom he recognizes as having his legal background and that he is aware that his opponent-candidate would be his first Vice President.
He has also not attacked Tonas Paclik for a long time, who on the contrary is constantly criticizing Pelta.
"He's been in football for a year and he's had some successes".
"His attacks were not the most honorable and surprised many during the campaign".
"This is also why some now have doubts about his character", Pelta said to his opponent but remains, he said, faithful to the proclamations he made in September.
His strongest weapon, he says, is his knowledge of football from the lowest level of competition to national representation.
It should be a football showcase.
"And I would also endeavour to end all cases that begin with the Bohemians or the corruption scandal".
"I would immediately enter into negotiations with the public and private sectors so that we can get enough money for all football", the 46th candidate told the Czech news agency CTK two months ago.
He also added that his appointment as head of football would not bring about any change in people.
"I should get to know all the employees", he told Strahov where there is understandable nervousness since there is no management.
Although there are disastrous scenarios planned with the General Assembly, he believes the delegates will not go to Nymburk for nothing.
"If there is one point of disagreement about how to vote in the third round we will get over it".
"Football needs credibility and it will only get it when there is a new leader at its head", Pelta optimistically says two days before the day likely to be crucial for his public servant career.
Rajchl promises that under his leadership the AFRT will start working hard
"If the current Vice-President Jindrich Rajchl is elected as the new President of the Czech Football Association at the General Assembly on Thursday, it would not appeal to many people", he said.
Rajchl, however, promises that if he is elected we will start working hard.
He wants systemic changes and the members of the Executive Committee to be responsible for the different areas of football.
He also promised to settle the Bohemians affair, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money to football and continue the work started by his predecessor Ivan Hasek.
"As president, I want to take care of football as a whole".
"International contacts with UEFA and FIFA through national representation, professional football and youth football".
"But I'm not saying I'll do all this alone", Rajchl said in an interview with CTK.
"I am a team player and I want to distribute the competencies within the Executive Committee so that each member deals with a particular area".
"And I'll distribute tough assignments so that football can take a big step forward".
"Many people will not be happy because it will be about starting to work hard rather than criticizing others", he added.
He reportedly stated that he would not stand as a candidate due to a critical atmosphere.
"As for me, we all know I work 20 hours a day".
"but I need to know if it's worth it and if I'll have people behind me who will keep putting sticks in my wheels and casting doubt on every single one of my actions", explaining why he was hesitant.
"A lot of people have told me I shouldn't give up because they would too".
"It's a confidence I can't betray", he said.
What is also said to motivate him is to continue the work started with Hasek.
"For the last two years there has been a great deal of work done and I don't want to let it go".
"There are processes that have been launched that will have consequences in a few years and I would not like anyone to stop them", he said, fearing that in the case of the election of Miroslav Pelta the situation within the Union would return to the way it was before Hasek.
"I believe in systematic work and that's something Mirek Pelta doesn't know how to do".
"Behind him are people who would play football in such a way that it would only be for those who have been chosen".
"I can be blamed for a number of things, but I'm sure I can't stand any of them".
"I try to be objective".
"I want to play football for everyone because everyone will be happy not only those who have been chosen
And he confirms again that he would only be a president for the Czech Republic.
"And if anyone says otherwise, I'm willing to do everything for Moravia".
"For example, it is time to consider the division being divided into two parts, one Czech and the other Moravian, with the winners going to the first division".
"There would be no situation like this with only three teams in the division because the problem is finding young players.
Since Tomas Paclik, president of the Plzen Club, entered the competition for the presidency, Rajchl cannot assess his own chances of winning.
"I feel the support of the Czech House that has elected me its Vice President and knows that with me there will be successes", said Rajchl, who plans to save tens of millions of crowns on disadvantageous contracts, TV contract negotiations and the gambling law.
He says that the fact that the Association is not united is a common mistake.
While he says of Pelta "that he is disqualified because with him Czech football would lose its credibility", he thinks that second opponent Paclik is a strong candidate who has something to offer football.
"No one can doubt Plzen's great work this year".
"If elected he would certainly continue in what Hasek started and would not make any noticeable change among the people in the Commissions".
"He wouldn't want to ruin his successes", said Rajchl, who was evaluating his rivals.
The most beautiful swimming pools in Europe
A leap into the blue
By Julia Stanek
Overnight paddles, beautiful swimming pools in Budapest: Those who travel through Europe can experience their blue miracle - and after walking around the city or taking a long walk - can rest their tired legs in gas bath.
A book shows which swimming pool is the most comfortable.
When Iris Meder went on a research trip for the past 18 months, there was one thing that should not be missing in her luggage: her swimsuit.
Stretching her back into the water, she observed the artistically arranged domes, and swam against the Putten marbles that waited for her on the other side of the pool and did not fail to admire the meticulously restored Art Nouveau of these converted pools.
If she liked an indoor pool, she would immediately write down in her book every interesting detail about the type of building and the history of the building.
More than 200 pools were surveyed in this way by architectural historian Meder and presented in her already published book, "Badefreuden (Bad Jewelry).
She has taken her "travel to the most outstanding baths in Central Europe" in 13 countries, including Germany, Austria and Switzerland, and visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland and one city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old German is a true fan of the bath culture.
Meder explains that she has little interest in sports but feels drawn to water in a completely different way.
It is irritating that swimmers have to look at blue tiles and settle for the smell of Javel water while joggers breathe the spellbinding fragrance of the epicene forests or can hear the joyful birdsongs of the park.
"I once wondered why pools must actually always be so ugly", said the Viennese.
"So I was starting a collection of beautiful baths".
The surface of the water doubles the architecture
A swimming pool dive and volatile sauna oils - wellness factors in swimming rooms - are huge because all the senses are aroused, according to Meder.
And if the builders had worked a little harder, the swimming rooms might be a real treat to the eyes: "Instead of a floor there is a water surface in the bathrooms".
"It is transparent on one side, but on the other side it reflects the beauty of the whole building".
All surfaces are visually presented in two ways: high vaults, multi-colored tiles, tremplins.
The small-format image volume "Badefreuden" is an interesting 190-page report on the history of architecture and culture on the oasis of historical well-being - it certainly makes you want to jump into the blue.
The collector Meder discovered remarkable specimens during her research in Hungary.
Next to splendid wellness baths such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi Bath in Budapest, she found nitrate-containing waters in a natural cave in the karst (a cave bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) as well as a thermal bath whose pools are filled with water containing alkali and water (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény) and located in a bottle-shaped building.
The heated outdoor pools of Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views, while the entire city can be seen from the roof of the Zurich bath, the snow-covered Arlberg can be seen from an outdoor pool in St. Anton: The Turkish bath has a window from which you can watch the animation on the ski slope.
Perhaps the most extraordinary swimming pool design awaits swimmers in Längenfeld: The Aqua Dome Ötztal looks like a UFO that just landed on the Alps.
In winter, steam rises from the three open plateaus, while the mountains of the Ötztal rise to the sky in the background.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
The smell of Javel water doesn't come from all the pools in the Meder collection.
Many thermal baths give off a smell of sulfur, the Árpád-spa in the Hungarian Bekescsaba gives off a strong smell of oil, which is hard to believe, to be found in a health spa.
The smell comes from therapeutic alkaline water containing carbon dioxide that is almost black and its dirt sticks to your skin as soon as you are dragged into the pool - a special spa experience.
While searching for beautiful pools, Iris Meder also suffered disappointments: When she wanted to visit Bad Luhatschowitz, a free outdoor pool in Czechoslovakia, she found herself in front of a barricaded terrain.
The bath designed by architect Dušan Jurkovic in 1902 was closed in the meantime.
Looking out the red-and-white-yellow window of the Art Nouveau building, she observed the weeds blossoming between the tiles.
She observed a contrary effect in a charming pool in the Black Forest: the Bad Wildbad Thermal Palace.
This building has survived three stages; not only can you find neo-Romanesque elements from its design in 1844, but also a Moorish hall in the style of the Alhambra that was added to it in 1900.
Since its careful modernization in 1995, the spa palace has been the favorite bath of swimming pool expert Iris Meder - and not just because she is from the Schwarzwald.
"It's already a beautiful performance to merge such different building styles into such a wonderful unit", says Meder.
With such a palace, diving in the spa pool is apparently only a minor matter.
Agricultural speculation
The German bank examines in detail the speculation on raw materials
By Christian Teevs
Does the German bank abandon its speculation on raw materials?
According to reports from SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a task force to investigate the consequences of speculation on the world's poor.
In January, the group's leader then wants to draw conclusions.
The Commission shall adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 21 of this Regulation.
For the citizens of the Federal Republic, the thing is clear: According to one study, 84 percent of Germans find it unacceptable that banks speculate on raw materials such as corn and wheat.
Two thirds of those polled even demand that the German bank and other credit institutions stop doing business because it increases the problems of the world's poorest.
This is the result of a Forsa survey of the order of the Foodwatch consumer organization.
The study is based on a report by Foodwatch in mid-October.
In this article, author Harald Schumann points out that the stock market's speculation on global commodities is driving up prices and that banks are complicit in global famine.
The consumer protection campaign is in direct line with Deutsche-Bank's head Josef Ackermann, even though big banks like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are doing the same.
Speculation on raw materials was initially introduced to protect traders from price fluctuations.
But the majority of experts agree that bettors have moved away from supply and demand - and are taking advantage of the very poor.
Ackermann responded to the criticism differently from US competitors: he promised to investigate the allegations and said, "no case is worth putting Deutsche Bank's good reputation at risk".
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE reports, an international working group is currently investigating the allegations made by Foodwatch-Report.
The review should be completed by the end of the year, after which the results of the Deutsche Bank Board of Directors should be presented - usually with a recommendation.
At the end of January, the head of the Bank will indicate the consequences.
This could lead to a reduction in the market for raw materials or even a complete abandonment.
Ackermann builds his image
Foodwatch chief Thilo Bode welcomed the news but at the same time confirmed his criticism of the financial sector: "Speculation about rising food prices is a particularly draconian indication of how badly banks are damaging the public interest".
Ackermann is the first bank lobby to be particularly obliged today.
"Deutsche Bank must remove all investments from its portfolio, for which money has been invested in food speculation", said Bode.
"It is not important to Mr Ackermann whether it is the hungry people or whether the reputation of Deutsche Bank is at stake".
Ackermann's realization may seem surprising at first glance, but it's clear that the group's CEO wants to present a perfect picture a few months before he leaves office.
Deutsche Bank announced on Monday that the Chairman of the Board of Directors will not change anything in the plans for the Board.
It could improve its brand image by abandoning controversial agricultural speculation.
And about any loss, he has little to worry about - his successor will worry about it.
One in two would withdraw investments in raw materials.
Foodwatch is trying to keep a strong grip on the Manager.
So far, more than 30,000 Internet users have already taken part in the organisation's campaign.
Bode published the survey on Tuesday, with which the Forsa Institute conducted questionnaires on 7 and 8 November of 1001 people.
Only 11 percent found it legitimate that Deutsche Bank offered investments for which bets were made on food prices.
Many bank customers would also have personal consequences if they learned that their bank was involved in such transactions: one in two would, following the survey, discontinue all investments for which money is injected into commodity speculation.
43 percent would discourage such a bank from their neighbors, 49 percent said they would consider terminating their account to change bank.
21st house in Vienna
The Pavilion That Moved
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
An architectural history with highs, lows and happy ends: the Austrian pavilion for the 1958 Brussels World's Fair won awards, was a museum in Vienna, was empty and then fell into ruin.
It is now open again and is used as an exhibition hall.
If one is enthusiastic about postwar modern architecture, for its clear shapes, glass hangars, bright and bold looks, and new building materials that are typical of the belief in technical progress, then the pavilion of the Austrian architect Karl Schwanzer for the 1958 Brussels World's Fair is a good and famous example.
The Schwanzer Pavilion was once awarded the "Grand Prix d'Architecture" for its lightweight, suspended steel and glass construction.
The construction is still considered an important step in modern architecture.
He made the architects so famous that he also built the Pavilion for the next Austrian World Exhibition.
With its legendary BMW four-cylinder house and adjacent bowl-shaped building in Munich, it finally became internationally famous in 1973.
Its pavilion design as a temporary building had been exhibited after the Universal Exhibition in the Swiss Garden at the southern Vienna railway station, was transformed, and in 1962 a 20th-century museum opened -
But the building was neither physically nor technically fit for a museum - no walls to hang the artwork, so not a good environment.
However, it was used for so long, until contemporary art received a new building in Vienna.
Since 2001, the building has been empty and has been falling into disrepair.
Now the Pavilion has been transformed by architect Adolf Krischanitz, it is now called "House of the 21st Century" and will be used as a museum for contemporary art in the future.
Tuesday night the Belvedere Museum opened, which owns the house, the first exhibition - a lucky shot in every way.
The new start was carried out by Agnès Husslein-Arco, who became the new director in 2007 of the Belvedere Gallery in Austria.
Husslein-Arco, promoted as an art historian to a considerable career in art as a young figure skater, later at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and as the founding director of the Salzburg Museum of Modern Art, particularly successful in transforming politicians and protecting monuments, obtained public funds and private sponsorship and established the exploitation of these.
Except for contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba, whose foundation bears the same name, have been exhibited, a café and a bookstore are located there, and an office is to be built there.
Strict supervision, small budget
Krischanitz was therefore the ideal interpreter for the production.
Not only because he had sensibly transformed and expanded the secession of Joseph Olbracht and won the competition, but because he had studied at the Technical University of Vienna and for him the pavilion was "an extremely important place" where he had seen "virtually every weekend" exhibitions.
He knew the original design, and he knew the problems of the building, which lost in generosity and lightness following his move to Vienna and by its change of use.
The current transformations have presented major problems: the building was "an energy chasm", says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glass facades were changed, insulating glass reinforced with fiberglass was laid and the roof replaced with a special safety glass.
The beams of the thermal bridges were reinforced or replaced, and the asbestos-filled coatings were repaired.
Two basements have made room for the new farm, a lighting panel sewn between the house and the road provides lighting, a bridge leading to the entrance - it's almost a new building, but still the lightweight Schwanzer Pavilion.
The original exterior doors remain, the house is painted in a reddish-brown shade to protect against rust.
And the theater is even exactly the same as it was before.
And all this under close supervision of the competent authorities for monuments and with a small budget.
"Often good and cheap materials were found, and they are also pleasing to the monuments protection office", says Krischanitz and he draws attention to a raw ground in the basement.
Despite all the constraints, problems and changes, the building remained flexible and light.
It would have been difficult with the Pavilion, "which came from Brussels", Krischanitz said recently, a typical story of "Drop-in-the-City".
Such an architecture is "always in the wrong place" and yet it wants to "awaken a good conscience".
But in this case the 21st Century House is not in the wrong place, because if it is an urban construction accident, it is around the Swiss Garden that the newly planned "central station district" stands, with offices and apartments.
And another lucky break may come: the 21st Century House could benefit from the reinforcement of another Krischanitz building, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg bought the temporary Berlin art center, and as they say, she's already negotiating with the city to get a site in the vicinity of the Swiss Garden.
Bahn is planning a multi-million dollar winter crisis package.
The railway company has developed a crisis plan to prevent train accidents in winter.
The number of employees should double.
It costs millions.
In the fight against winter-related train accidents and delays, Deutsche Bahn will spend more than 70 million this year.
The daily Bild-Zeitung previously reported, citing an internal crisis plan for the group, that investments totalling around EUR 300 million would be planned until 2015.
This should allow for better availability of vehicles and the railway network also in the event of extreme weather.
The number of internal and external employees for de-snowing railway installations and docks is expected to double to 16,000.
The aim is to get rid of the snow and ice docks until the start of the service phase and 90% of the necessary track equipment for service within four to five hours.
Two months ago, the stationmaster Rüdiger Grube warned the government and industry at a summit conference on train accidents that also happened this winter.
The railway industry had a lot of problems with passenger transport last winter, due to a lack of stocks in case of severe weather.
Many new regional trains have been waiting for the approval of the Ministry of Railways for years.
In addition, there is a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The railway company has been busy for years, as it has to have the axles of ICE trains checked much more often in the workshop after an ICE axle break occurred at the Cologne Central Station.
The German Deutsche Bank pays millions of fines to the US.
After the case of Chief Josef Ackermann, there is something new in the USA: the German bank Deutsche Bank has to pay a fine of millions.
As if Deutsche Bank's problems weren't enough already, the industry's past is even more reminiscent of the United States: the Frankfurt Institute pays a comparison of 145 million dollars (106 million euros) to settle a dispute over the bankruptcy of five major cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
It's the sale of mortgage papers.
The NCUA's financial market regulator has charged the big banks with a series of charges, including inciting cooperative banks to make false promises about buying financial products, which would have minimized the risks.
These documents have lost enormous value during the financial crisis and have dragged banks down.
"We are satisfied that we have been able to find a solution to this without the parties initiating proceedings in court", said a Deutsche Bank interlocutor in New York.
The Bank has not admitted any wrongdoing in the comparison.
This also applies to Citigroup, which has committed to a payment of $20.5 million.
NCUA President Debbie Matz welcomed the concessions from both banks.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for the US co-operative banks and it intervenes in bankruptcy cases to protect customer deposits.
The NCUA is trying to repair the damage of billions of dollars.
The comparisons now made are the first of their kind.
The regulator also took other major banks to court and in the summer he brought before the Court JP Morgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
The Commission has also taken the view that the Commission should be able to take into account the fact that the Commission has not yet adopted the draft budget.
Credit unions are the basis.
When the US real estate bubble burst in 2007, this was fatal for a large number of banking companies.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the investment bank of the USA Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Even though the events are a few years old, now the banks of the United States are in a storm.
Investors and supervisory authorities have brought numerous actions to obtain compensation or to punish shortcomings.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has triggered the largest wave of complaints.
It blames 18 major international banks, the two US state-owned real estate financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac for taking advantage of their own nature in mortgage transactions worth some $200 billion.
Deutsche Bank must also lodge an appeal with the FHFA, which concerns several transactions totalling $14.2 billion for the years 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authorities demand that Frankfurter be liable for 'substantial losses' but without specifying a specific amount.
Deutsche Bank rejected the claims as unjustified and declares that it intends to defend itself.
Warren Buffett is up 10 billion at IBM
Buffett, the finance guru, is investing huge sums in IBM's IT company.
Since March, he's bought more than $10 billion worth of stock.
Until then, the big American investor Warren Buffett has been constantly explaining that he should not invest in IT companies, since the long-term evolution of companies only shows poor forecasts.
However, he read IBM reports and changed his mind about investing in this sector.
He had to realize much earlier that IBM primarily provides services and IT systems for other companies' IT sectors.
A Warren Buffett investment is considered a knight's attack in the financial world.
The IT business of IBM is therefore entitled to be called 'Mr IBM'.
Because Buffett revealed today on CNBC's economic show that he's bought IBM stock since March worth $10.7 billion.
His investment holding company Berkshire Hathaway became a major shareholder in IBM with a 5.5 percent stake.
Buffett said IBM never knew about this commitment until now.
He commended the management, which even during the economic crisis had provided reasonable profits.
"You did a great job", Buffett said strategically.
IBM has been focusing on profitable IT services as an accounting centre operator for some time.
The pioneer of computer science, over 100 years old, offers both software and consulting as well as highly performing enterprise calculators.
Buffett had, until now, avoided tech companies.
He says he only invests in companies that he understands the business.
But Buffett is instead targeting rail freight, lubricants, and machine makers.
Its holding company Berkshire Hathaway has nearly 80 subsidiaries and shares in a number of major companies such as Coca-Cola and Munich Re, the former Munich Rück.
The 81-year-old took over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and made it one of the most prestigious worldwide companies thanks to smart investments.
However, his lifestyle is modest.
That is why he is a cult figure for many investors around the world.
His almost unerring sense of making money earned him the nickname "Omaha Oracle".
After Buffett's investment was announced, IBM stock rose 1 percent on the stock exchange.
"Big Blue", as IBM is also known, has a total market value of over $220 billion and is ranked with Apple and Microsoft among the most valuable technology companies in the world.
At Microsoft, Buffett says, he doesn't want to be a part of it.
The founder Bill Gates would be a very good friend.
The Threat Is Figured
After the discovery of the "Zwickauer cell", Turkish media have doubted the rule of law in Germany.
One newspaper even speaks of a "bloody ideology" that would be reborn now.
The murders of eight Turkish nationals and a small Greek business in the years 2000 to 2006 had an extremist context.
Turkey and the German-Turkish population reacted with fear and anxiety.
For many German-Turks the specter that had long been believed dead is reappearing: since the arson attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and Solingen in May 1993, there has been no violence comparable to this right-wing extremist context against the Turks.
There is no question that xenophobia exists in Germany.
The right-wing extremist network detected, however, reveals proportions whose size is far from predictable.
"Is this a return to bloody ideology", was the title of the online publication of the Turkish daily Haberturk.
The newspaper Sabah, however, points out that one of the perpetrators was a v-man of the Constitution Protection, and is concerned that the German authorities may be involved in the mud of the far right.
The Turkish community in Germany has reacted in a reasoned manner by calling for a silent commemoration of the victims of racial violence outside the Brandenburg Gate this weekend.
It was only two weeks ago that the Turkish community in Berlin and German and Turkish politicians had thought of a ceremony to mark the 50th anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement.
It was in the cheerful colors that cohabitation was staged, symbolizing a success story.
Some Turkish media reports are striking: "Germany's 50th anniversary gift" is the title of an article in the Turkish platform - "Haber X", which refers to the context of the murder series.
The German publication of the Hürriyet also makes clear that there are clear conditions.
"It starts to puer", is the title of Ahmet Külahci's column.
He points out that people were murdered, paid taxes and made a significant contribution to the rebuilding of Germany.
The police's action was widely criticized in the German-Turkish forums and they later debated the success of their research.
Why did German authorities not think of investigating some of the suspected right-wing circles much earlier, the authors wonder.
More than one is ready for at least rhetorical or even drastic means: "If the case continues to be unresolved, the migrants will have nothing left but self-defense and arms".
"that would be the best self-defense".
"The internal peace in Germany depends heavily on the quality of information and the appropriateness of the punishment of the entire network", writes Selen.
What this means if the internal peace in Germany is in danger was well explained by the attacks in Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s.
The image of the ruins after the Solingen fire is deeply rooted in German and Turkish memory.
Because no other event has shown more clearly to the Turks living here that there is a tangible threat, and to the Germans, what suspicion and distance through acts of violence could lead to.
The attacks, however, have sharpened our feelings in the Turkish community.
Never repeat the mistakes of the past
In the past, this was mainly the failure of German politics after the attacks, which the Turkish press complained about: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the Solingen fire he sent a telegram of condolences to the Turkish head of state, was represented at the funeral in Cologne by his foreign minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel counted in his speech at the time how much taxes the local Turkish population produced.
Like a man's worth can be measured by the amount of his tax burden.
The current Turkish media report shows once again how deeply mistrustful many German-Turks have been of the local rule of law since that date.
In addition to the efforts to make clearer and reassess the far-right terrorism in Germany, a clear message is needed this time.
The scandal at Lake Zurich
The most adventurous bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
UBS almost went bankrupt in the financial crisis and has been in the middle of one crisis after another.
It's a German who has to lead now.
This is certainly not what Axel Weber imagined.
After his spectacular departure as head of the Bundesbank, it was reported in July that he would hold in 2013 a position almost as spectacular: Chairman of the Board of the large Swiss bank UBS - a big step towards an unexpected and lucrative career.
Axel Weber publicly cheered, welcomed, Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its recently achieved strength and made kind remarks on future colleagues.
"UBS has passed the Turnaround".
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel".
And yet, by September it was clear that everything was going to change.
A London UBS securities dealer had hijacked all the security systems of the Bank and had spent about 1.7 billion euros.
The head of the UBS board, Oswald Grübel, a well-known banker not only in Switzerland, had to leave.
The chairman of the board of directors of UBS has been considered suffering since then - and everyone is asking: When will Axel Weber finally return?
We've already learned that Weber can be advised by the bank from February 2012.
And he will take over as chairman of the board in May - not in 2013, as the bank said on Tuesday.
For Axel Weber, this is getting difficult.
He's not a banker, he's a much more economics professor and bank president, and he certainly would have needed a period of adjustment.
He then suddenly assumed responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which has just proved once again that it has long earned the title of "Europe's biggest scandal bank".
Indeed, UBS is huge on one side - until recently, it was the world's largest asset manager, and on the other, it has been skating for years from one scandal to another.
Nothing seems to spare the proud Swiss bank.
It started during the financial crisis.
Until 2007, UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of the silent and solid Swiss asset manager, but also cunning, was combined with ambitious goals: it also wanted to become a very large investment bank.
So UBS was running on one side in 2007 with $1.6 billion more money coming from a wealthy clientele than any other bank in the world.
On the other hand, it had advanced as an investment bank in the league of the world's largest banks.
That was impressive.
Former banker Hans Geiger, who later taught banking for many years in Zurich, says: "I always took UBS as a model for good banking in front of my students".
"In the current perspective, we ask ourselves, how could I have simply been so wrong?"
He was deeply wrong.
In 2007, it became apparent that for the first time, something was not going right at UBS.
In the middle of the year President Peter Wuffli stepped down surprisingly, who until then was considered a high-level intellectual as well as a brilliant banker.
A few months later, we got a sense of why he left.
The bank's division burst with sub-prime paperwork and had to make a billion dollar cross.
To support this, UBS announced a capital increase of 13 billion francs and made a cross on it.
It did find investors, but they would have frowned on it shortly before: an opaque Asian background from Singapore and an Arab background that was kept secret, to the point that its name was never even known.
But that was only the first time.
In April 2008, this situation worsened.
The bank was to report billions in losses again, and the chairman of the board, Marcel Ospel, who was still in 2006 the second highest paid board in Switzerland, resigned.
In October 2008, the disaster followed: UBS was in the financial crisis before bankruptcy, given its investment mistakes, and had to be rescued by the state.
The national bank bought tens of billions of problem bonds from UBS, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for bonds convertible into shares, for which it could become co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was shaken - because it noted how dramatic it can be for a small country to have such big banks.
Finally, the total balance sheet of UBS 2007 was more than five times the economic performance of Switzerland (see chart).
"We couldn't save the UBS once again", says bank researcher Geiger.
After the first disaster, the second followed.
A few months earlier, UBS had capitulated over a tax dispute with America and declared itself ready to release data on wealthy customers who may have cheated on the tax with the help of the Bank.
It also agreed to pay $780 million in compensation for unjustified profits from these transactions with an increased fine.
So UBS has more or less published that it helped with tax fraud.
At the same time, she lost something that has always been her capital in competition with wealthy clients: the prestige of discretion.
After the scandal, Swiss bank secrecy was no longer the same.
The Chairman of the Board and the Chairman of the Board of Directors were removed.
And the exodus of the customers' money.
The bank thus lost its credibility in the two main business sectors within a few months: investment banking due to bad speculation and asset management due to aid for tax fraud.
And as there was some sort of a return to calm, and as we thought, that UBS would get out of it, this unfortunate story of stock traders followed: a single stock trader burns 1.7 billion euros, before the bank realized that something was wrong.
And it says, with investment bank risk management, it still doesn't seem to work.
"The Adoboli case showed that risk management has changed too little", says Martin Janssen, economist and professor of finance at the Institute of Banking at the University of Zurich.
The chief financial officer of a major German bank is also convinced: "The problem with UBS is that it has no control over the risks".
But this was exactly the idea of caution, with which the Swiss bankers had long taken their job, of becoming the custodians of the world's great wealth: not too great risks, but security for money - and the world could well collapse beyond the Alpine republic.
The treasures of Swiss banks had become a symbol of unshakable reliability, as Lindt and Sprüngli are for a particularly noble chocolate.
The headquarters of UBS in Zurich still goes hand in hand with the strong image of the Swiss private bank - it is only slightly larger.
The situation is already classic.
The Bank is headquartered at Zurich Central Station, which leads directly from the Central Station to Lake Zurich, which itself is surrounded by the snowy peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are prestigious, and the rents of shops are among the highest in Europe.
Jewelers like Tiffany's are found here among the traditional Swiss shops as well as those at Sprüngli's confectionery.
For centuries, Swiss bankers have resided here, from the national bank to the Swiss Credit Palace to elite private banks like Julius Bär.
We're going into the lobby of the UBS through a heavy door.
Inside, the walls are covered with marble, in front are thick leather chairs, and next to the bank logo is a large "safe" label.
UBS knows what the client is looking for here: security.
This idea of the Swiss bank has one day drifted off the market - or betrayed the two major Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, as the head of a small private Swiss bank finds.
He'd rather not read his name in the paper, after all, like all Swiss bankers, he's doing business with the two big banks too.
He finds that UBS would have become far too big - especially in investment banking, where Anglo-Saxons would have spread further.
The Swiss wouldn't have anything to say.
"And yet they have long since adapted to Anglo-Saxon customs".
It was indeed the Anglo-Saxon investment bank that changed UBS, made high profits and then the debacle: no European financial institution has lost as much money in the subprime jungle as the big Swiss bank.
The disaster became apparent on October 15, 2008.
"This Wednesday the governmental coalition of the small country of seven million people undertook the largest rescue operation in the history of their nation", writes author Lukas Hässig in his book "The UBS Crash".
With a total of some 68 billion francs, or 45 billion euros, politicians agreed to save the big bank from bankruptcy.
How could this happen?
If you talk to Swiss bankers, they see the problem especially in the size of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three largest banks in Switzerland joined a huge group.
A bank was set up, which was already too big for the small Switzerland - and it was growing steadily.
What helped was that the two different banks that preceded UBS were complementary: a rich but sluggish bank with strong asset management in Zurich and a poorer but already more internationalised bank.
Suddenly, international investment banks had a favorable access to a lot of money, with which they could turn a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with the rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007 Head of the UBS Group, and Marcel Ospel, former Chairman of the Board.
"I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team", says bank researcher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the great modest intellectual, who is very good at models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive, who has made his way to the top with bank learning".
But Ospel would have trusted Wuffli to the end.
And wuffli would have probably made a decisive mistake in the end: "He thought his models were reality", Geiger says.
"It's a tragic fall".
Tragic, perhaps.
One thing is for sure: the exuberance came before the fall.
UBS staff clearly remember the executive meetings where the head of the Wuffli Group always issued the same order: to remove Goldman Sachs.
The Bank of America was the most powerful investment bank on the planet.
She commissioned the "League Tables" rankings, which documented the success of banks at the time.
After all, the UBS wanted to go all the way up.
Some of the steps he's taken have already worked.
In the case of currency and securities transactions it has played a very important role.
The corporate advisers, who were responsible for this, however, pointed out a weakness: in international interest transactions, in the "Fixed Income" banking jargon, there would be a huge difference from the larger banks.
UBS would have gaps in U.S. mortgage products.
To fill this gap, the UBS embarked on an adventure that nearly cost her life.
The growth rate is both the bank itself and a management fund created before it in the sub-prime US investments that have invested.
It turned into a massive machine that packed and passed valuable documents based on U.S. mortgage loans - but also kept risks.
Even when other banks have been trying to go down for a long time.
"Even in the summer of 2007, when the U.S. real estate market was on fire, UBS bought there", says banking expert Geiger.
The more euphoria, the more brutal the fall.
One manager after another had to leave, when ending the attempts proved to be harder than we thought.
Jobs at UBS have become enforceable and are still banking.
The one who runs the big bank has a near impossible task.
He has to come up with a strategy for a bank, for which all the proposed business models have disappeared.
The banker Geiger already has an idea: end investment banking, focus on asset management, return to Swiss roots.
But the bank doesn't want to go that far.
But the investment bank must atrophy vigorously, as has been clear so far.
Next Thursday, the head of the bank, Sergio Ermotti, wants to present his future strategy to the world.
The 51-year-old Italian-Swiss was only supposed to be on a temporary basis when the bank unexpectedly split from its predecessor Grübel.
In the meantime, he has made a commitment to continue running UBS's business, the Bank of Zurich said on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to bring the investment bank back to the state of progress of the mid-1990s.
It's cancelling 3,500 jobs.
But that's not enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What's she trying to make money with?
These are questions that Axel Weber certainly has already asked himself.
He has only publicly said so far that he and his wife are going to find an apartment in Zurich.

Europe will not be able to recover from a recession anytime soon, and there are other signs of weakness from banks.
Legendary investor Warren Buffett has only confirmed this caution: "It is not yet clear whether Europe would be strong enough to do anything to end the crisis", he said in an interview with CNBC.
Therefore, in his view, it was too early to invest in bonds from European states and banks.
Instead, Warren Buffett threw a decades-old principle to the wind and entered the American tech industry.

Smart horns are spreading in cities
In many places, freaks are considered a "bird problem", but experts say that these highly intelligent animals have long since been hunted from cities.
Some like them, some want to get rid of them as soon as possible. The horns have been in the city for centuries, but in many communities the residents complain about the dirt and the noise of the animals.
An antidote to the "bird problem" is not yet in sight.
At the first ostfriesisch symposium on horns, experts said that it was no longer possible to hunt the city's prawns.
Experts from all over Germany discussed possible solutions.
They're looking for alternatives in cities
The protectionists of nature also based the problems of cities on the exodus of particularly protected frees: the use of chemicals in agriculture is increasingly destroying traditional living spaces.
The hunting, planting, and cutting down of typical nesting trees made life difficult for birds.
The horns are under the protection of nature.
There are large settlements with over 600 breeding pairs in the westfälischen Soest, in the northwest including Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen as well as in Leer.
In 2005, a controversial project had received negative publicity because of the horned-goose massacre in that area.
Critics found the birds caught in traps and killed with particularly brutal turtles.
"Normal eviction, eviction, is useless", said Leer city and landscape planner Werner Klöver.
The destruction of nests by pressurized water or the cutting down of trees often has unintended consequences, said environmentalist Manfred Kaiser of Lahr, Baden-Württemberg.
"The animals are moving away, the large colonies are dividing and they are scattered elsewhere".
Expulsion is only conceivable in exceptional cases such as hospitals, retirement homes or schools.
"We are forced to live with them, we can no longer exterminate them".
The problem cannot be solved in cities without the inclusion of the periphery, according to Mayor Wolfgang Kellner de Leer.
A combination of evicting animals in an unfriendly conditioning and catchy offers to allow them to relocate elsewhere is conceivable.
Psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens looked to "information signs instead of cutters" to establish completely different relationships with them: "We can finally better handle a face button with a dose of self-confidence".
Jürgens co-founded the Schleswig-Holstein Ascheberger-Trail-Educational Basket, road signs that inform the lives of these very intelligent rodents.
This project has since been adopted by tourists.
Jürgen gave his own opinion on the criticism of the noise caused by birds: "This is a lot of communication, these birds have a lot to say".
The intelligence and skill of the animals are legendary: the freewheels not only use working tools to get to a treat but they themselves make their own tools as working tools.
Scientists at Cambridge University recently tested four frogs for the intelligence of birds.
In one experiment, birds learned quickly that they had to knock down a scaffolding with stones to get to a larva.
Without much training, they were determined to recognize that a stone must have some size and shape to bring down the platform.
In a second attempt, the cunning horns were then to solve a more complex problem.
In a cylinder placed vertically, the researchers had placed a small bucket with a larva.
The birds couldn't reach their prey with their beaks.
However, the researchers had put pieces of iron wire at their disposal.
All four creatures made a hook with which they used to fish the little bucket from the little pipe.
Three of the four freaks are successful even from the start.
Cristiano Ronaldo is out of the country for the 2012 European Championship
The hopes of the Bosnians and Turks for a coup were unsuccessful.
The favourites Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and Ireland will also compete in the 2012 European Championship.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland bought the last tickets in the qualifying round of the 2012 European Championship in Poland and knocked out Ukraine.
Led by superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8th, 53rd), Portugal defended against Bosnia and Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and perfected their fifth European Championship appearance after a 0-0 draw.
The Czechs reached the play-off match by Montenegro 1:0 (0:0), while the first round (2:0) had already been a matter of course.
Nothing was more burning in the 0-0 draw between Turkey and Croatia, Ireland took a 1:1 (1:0) break against Estonia.
Nani (24), Helder Postiga (72nd, 82nd) and Miguel Veloso (80th) scored the other shots for Portugal.
Former Bundesliga Wolfsburg player Zvjezdan Misimovic, with an 11-meter penalty played at hand (41st) and captain Emir Spahic (65th) made two shorts for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic was faced with a yellow-red card (54).
Bosnia had already failed in the qualifiers for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa in Portugal.
At the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal, the start was well-measured.
Ronaldo sent a 30-meter shot forward into the grid.
A quarter of an hour later, Nani showed her skills at a distance and shot from a distance of 25 meters to a 2-0.
The Bosnians, who in the first half-hour did nothing, got their first clear shot thanks to the attacker Edin Dzeko.
The former Wolfsburger, the English championship leader of Manchester City initiated a head ball aimed below the crossbar, the ball did not cross the goal line (33rd).
Jiracek scored a goal for the Czech Republic
Finally, the referee Wolfgang Stark of Ergolding is the center of attention.
After an attack on Helder Postiga during the Bosnian penalty, Stark decided for Schwalbe and showed the yellow card to the Portuguese (36th).
On the opposite side, Stark granted an 11-meter penalty played at the controversial hand after an action by Fabio Coentrao that Misimovic probably diverged from.
But after the break, the 2004 European vice champion won four times and it all became clear.
For the Czech side, Petr Jiracek also finished the last doubts in the 81st minute.
The 1976 European champion will be competing in the EM for the fifth time.
Coach Michal Bilek's team, with legionnaires Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1st FC Nuremberg), also had luck and had to survive a shock moment in the initial phase.
Goalkeeper Petr Cech with a reflex prevented a last minute goal by potential Tomas Sivok (9th).
Montenegro had its greatest potential when the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic scored in the 40th minute of the rotation on the repair surface right next to Cech's shot.
After the break, the cross had to come to the rescue of the world-class goalkeeper of the Czech Republic who had already been shot down, once again the forward of FC Seoul had been replaced (50th).
The goal of the end was finally clear.
Turkey missed the Zagreb football miracle during this time.
Four days after the 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb could not go beyond a 0:0.
While national coach Guus Hiddink also had to give up his place on the bench in the third round of the 2002 European Championship, the Croats were able to rejoice in their fourth round in the European Championship final.
In the presence of 31,000 spectators in the Maksimir Stadium, the Turks had almost caught up with a dream start.
Selcuk Inan scored in the seventh minute with a long-range shot only the pole, attacker Kazim Kazim could not even bury the ball in the goal.
After the moment of fear, Croatia gained more and more control.
Even after the break, the Croats didn't leave anything burning.
In addition to Mario Mandzukic of VfL Wolfsburg, who was replaced by Ivan Perisic of Dortmund in the 62nd Minute, Bundesliga leaguers Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) remained on the field.
Trapattoni participates in the EM
In Dublin, Irish people celebrate their first participation in EM since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward led the team to coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who had already successfully taken over the first leg by 4:0 for a preliminary decision, 32nd Minute.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57th) tied for the visitors.
Ireland pushed the top speed from the start, but had to wait until the 23rd minute, before Robbie Keane of the Los Angeles Galaxy got the first good chance.
Only at the last moment did Estonia's defence prevent a possible goal from the first scorer.
It happened in the 32nd minute.
After an unsuccessful defense by goalkeeper Pavel Londak, Ward was within reach and hit the ball on the line for 1:0.

SAP wants to double its employees in China
Europe's largest software company, SAP, plans to invest billions in China in the coming years and will almost double the number of its employees in the country.
By 2015, some US$2 billion (€1.5 billion) will be allocated, the Dax Group said on Tuesday.
"We will create additional research facilities and development centers and hire employees accordingly", CEO Bill McDermott told his clients on a fair basis in Beijing.
The number of employees will increase from about 2,500 to 4,500.
The number of branches of the world leader in enterprise software will double from five to ten or eleven.
SAP has a presence in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
Approximately 4,000 of SAP's 176,000 global customers are located in this expanding country.
Growth plans in China are also an important part of Dax Group's 2015 Strategy.

"Now we want to expand our activities . . . " said McDermott.
"Our aim is to promote sustainable growth in China, supported by comprehensive information".
The mass killing of individuals
Peter Englund's new book offers depth and generosity, and begins with a long list of characters that will touch your heart.
A tip to start with: rip this page apart carefully and make it your page tag.
In this novel by Peter Englund, this list of characters will be your GPS, a beacon for those few moments when, like one of his men or women, you will be troubled and desperate in the fog of war.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize in Literature.
He wrote an extraordinary book here, which he accurately describes as "an anti-historical work".
It contains a few well-known names, important treaties or famous battles; there is hardly any ambassador or discussion of strategies or material.
He explains that it is not so much a book about what happened as a "book describing what it might have looked like".
"Beauty and Sorrow" summarizes the wartime experiences of 20 more or less ordinary men and women on both sides of the war, from young schoolchildren and botanists to climbers to doctors, ambulances and salesmen.
Some of them will become heroes.
Some of them will be prisoners of war, some of them will lose limbs, some of them will go insane or lose their lives.
Their lives here are like the candles of a church. When some of them go out, new ones are lit.
Peter Englund's book is a departure from traditional history books.
It denies the idea that the First World War was simply a terrible trench war on the Western Front.
"Beauty and Sorrow" skillfully describes other war theaters - the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, and East Africa.
The soldiers in this book are under hives; one spends Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; tsetse flies are an unmanageable problem.
This book is moving from the very first page.
War is invading these people's lives like a natural disaster, like a stinking cordite hurricane Katrina.
When gunshots ring in the distance, and you're a housewife, do you stay or do you run?
Who's coming anyway?
Almost no one can understand what happened, or even the reasons for the war.
According to Peter Englund, "the lack of facts has been overcome by speculation, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares, and rumors".
"Beauty and Sorrow" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young sailor in the German High Seas Fleet.
Their stories are mainly based on memoir, letters and other documents already published.
Their versions of life can be terrifying or exciting, but they are most preserved by the accumulation of tiny moments and isolated details.
Most of them are about deprivation and the ability to get by.
In the story of a German school girl, Peter Englund writes: "Ersatz, everywhere ersatz".
"Replacement coffee, fake aluminum, imitation rubber, paper bandages, wooden buttons".
He's continuing on the replacement food in Germany.
It describes "meat made of rice cooked in sheep fat (and finished with a fake wood bone); tobacco made from dried potato roots and dried skin; wooden shoe soles".
He says that "837 authorized substitute meats are registered in the sausage production, and 511 substitute coffees are also found".
Some stories are about honor and courage.
One American acknowledges his own impulse toward savagery and says of war: "You feel that after all, that's what men were meant to do, rather than sit in a comfortable chair, a cigarette and a whiskey in hand, read a newspaper or a bestseller, and rather pretend that such a painting is synonymous with civilization, and that there is no barbarian behind your thick, cloudy shirt.
On the other hand, a British soldier realizes that he is in grave danger of death, and that no one will notice or pay attention to him.
"When you're resigned to self-sacrifice, you hope to have an audience", he writes.
Unfortunately, it is rather like "a condemned man strangled in secret".
Other observations concern the decline of an old Europe and new types of terror.
"Conflict is becoming increasingly a matter of economic competition", writes Peter Englund, "a war between factories".
He seizes the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the early-century livestock industry: the well-articulated, ideologically convinced mass murderer, dressed in well-timed clothes, who carries out his slaughter while sitting behind a counter".
People act unexpectedly; you find as much basic behavior as heroism.
Peter Englund talks about soldiers who tried at all costs to catch a venereal disease in prostitutes in order to avoid front-line service.
"The most grotesque expression is found in the trade in gonorrhea-related pus, which soldiers buy and spread to the genitals in the hope of being hospitalized", he writes.
"The most desperate people apply it to their eyes, which translates into blindness for life".
In this Swedish translation by Peter Graves, Peter Englund's prose is flexible but not ostentatious, perfectly adapted to his human task.
In dozens of short scenes, he captures how war "has provoked forces beyond our control: extreme nationalism, social revolution, and hatred of religion".
People are starting to wonder why their leaders are waging a war on them.
The best books on World War I are often indirect, such as Paul Fussel's "Great War and Modern Memory" or Erich Maria Remarque's "Nothing New in the West", rather than complete.
Peter Englund's work is an unconventional pantheon.
The end of the book is the most overwhelming thing I've ever read in a nonfiction work.
I'm not gonna reveal it.
But it's like he's come out of his book, grabbed this listing page with your hands and burned it with a match.
After a first mistake, a carefully planned operation
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some wearing riot protection helmets.
Monday night to Tuesday was chosen because the Zuccotti Park would be the most empty.
The operation was kept secret from all but a few high-ranking officers and others informed early on that they were going to conduct an exercise.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the heart of the operation, his presence highlighting the risks and challenges for the Police Department.
There could be no repeat of episodes in recent weeks, such as the use of pepper gas against protesters, which went against the regulations of the department and generated a storm of public solidarity for the protesters.
The operation to clean up Zuccotti Park of its protesters was launched after two weeks of planning and training.
The police had prepared themselves by observing the occupation in other cities.
A capital exercise was held on Randall Island for the operation at Zuccotti Park.
Police officers are getting better training against riots - counterterrorism measures that involve rapidly displacing large numbers of police officers - to focus on the Lower Manhattan neighborhood.
The last training session was held Monday night on the East River side of Manhattan.
Orders to move around the park came "at the last minute", said one resident, referring to the operation as "a simple exercise".
"The few police officers I know who were called didn't know they were going to Zuccotti Park", the person said anonymously.
"The only people who know they're going to be there are at the top of the police department".
The city learned a lesson, hence the secret of the operation.
On October 14, police tried to clean up the park but were repulsed by hundreds of protesters who were informed of the plans.
Tuesday's operation involved officers from various police units, including operational forces from around the neighborhood - dozens of officers accustomed to particularly criminal neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly said that many people were coming and going to the park during the day, in the manner of migrants, so one o'clock in the morning was a good time.
"It was appropriate to proceed when the park had the fewest people", he said.
Emergency vehicles equipped with spot and speaker speakers gathered on Pipe Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive near the Manhattan Bridge before intervening.
The lights and recorded messages sounding from the speakers seemed to intimidate the protesters.
As community affairs officers entered the park equipped with their light blue windshields, many protesters simply packed their bags and left.
No tents were touched before 1:45 a.m., police said, giving the occupants time to pack their belongings.
Other police teams were spotted on the perimeter, ready to intervene if arrests were necessary.
Journalists inside the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Browne, the spokesman for the police department, said the move was only taken for security reasons.
But many journalists say the police prevented them from watching the raid inside the park, which was strictly controlled by the officers.
Browne said the TV cameras trucks on Church Street, along the west side of the park, were able to capture images.
As the police moved westward through the thick business of the protesters, including luggage, plastic lawn and leaf bags filled with clothes, teams from the sanitation department followed, cleaning up everything the occupants left behind.
The few protesters who refused to leave were dragged away and the images were posted on the Internet shortly after.
The main group of protesters took their stand near the camp kitchen, not far from the center of the park.
Some have formed a barrier that the police moved to stop methodically.
About a dozen people in the center of the camp clinged together.
Finally, two people were chained to trees, Mr. Kelly said.
Emergency services have been called to cut the locks.
No arrests have taken place in the park before 3:30 p.m., Mr. Kelly said.
According to the police, the cleanup operation ended about an hour and a quarter later.
According to Browne, nearly 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of them for "disorder and rebellion".
Joseph J. Esposito, Chief of Police, is the highest-ranking officer to be on the scene.
Phil T. Pulaski, head of the detective department, was also present.
Mr Kelly, although present, "was not in charge of operations", Mr Browne said.
A second group of police officers waited along the east side of the park, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in case of necessary intervention.
Barricades were erected on Cortlandt Street, a block of houses north of the park, and Pine Street, south.
We saw the police widen the perimeter well beyond Zuccotti Park.
Several officers, mostly armed with shields, were even seen pushing people away.
About 28 people were on the north side.
One of the most intense actions of the night took place south of the park.
Around 5 a.m. south of Pine Street, a protester jumped on the hood of a police car, and others were seen smashing the tires of a police truck.
One day, a piece of plywood came up stealing from the crowd.
Finally, a police officer and a protester were hospitalized.
The school help union sues the city for layoffs
The union, which represents hundreds of school help workers who lost their jobs last month, plans to bring a lawsuit against the city on Wednesday for unnecessary and discriminatory layoffs, with disproportionate impact on schools that host disadvantaged students.
The prosecution is probably the union's ultimate weapon, the 37th District Council, to try to get the layoffs canceled.
Six hundred and seventy-two school helpers, parents' coordinators and other employees, among the city's lowest-paid, lost their jobs on October 7.
The municipal authorities categorically denied this accusation.
At a City Council hearing last month, Chancellor Dennis M. Walcott said the redundancies were part of the budget closed in June.
A member of the Council replied, noting that school aid layoffs were not specified in the budget.
Officials from the 37th District Council said they would file a complaint notice, warning the Department of Education that it would be prosecuted; a press conference will be held Wednesday to officially announce the lawsuits at the Manhattan State Supreme Court.
Dennis Walcott and the city's Department of Education will be the defendant, represented by eight redundant female workers, all black or Latin American, as are most school helpers who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the city's legal department, said the municipality has not yet been able to see the reasons for the trial and therefore cannot comment on the allegations.
According to a draft complaint obtained by the New York Times, the union would use the number of layoffs in schools in the city's most deprived neighborhoods to support its complaint of unfair treatment, stating that the poorest schools would lose the most aid due to regular underfunding.
While there are no layoffs on Staten Island, and only a few in the Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school assistants lost their jobs in the 23rd District of Brownsville, and 46 in the 8th and 9th Districts of the South Bronx.
Noting the loss of five out of eight school helpers at public school 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of schoolchildren live in poverty, the prosecution says that "it is not a neighborhood of wealthy parents that can raise funds to fill the budget deficit".
The budget for public school 36 was reduced by 3.26% this year, and funds were also lost when the city changed its calculation of additional funding for each disadvantaged student enrollment.
The union also claims that school directors may have been misled by certain terms in a memo authorizing the firing of parents' coordinators.
The memo used the term 'overtaking' to describe the action, although 'overtaking' more generally describes the action of moving a teacher from a school to a group of available workers whose salaries are paid by the central office.
According to the draft complaint, "sixty-six parents' coordinators have been fired", and "not just for overstepping".
Mission completed: Congress reaches agreement on Libya
It seems that the Republicans and Democrats have finally reached an agreement on the issue of the Libyan uprising.
It would have taken a successful uprising, the capture and death of longtime dictator Muammar Gaddafi and American involvement.
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee is expected to make a decision next Tuesday, supported by President John Kerry (Democrat - Massachusetts), with Senators John McCain (Republican - Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Independent - Connecticut), applauding the Libyan people for their revolt and the American troops for their "courage".
"This resolution is to honour the courage of the Libyans as they begin to rebuild their country", said John Kerry.
"It's a bipartisan support for their democratic aspirations".
The language may be harmless but the debate on Libya has never been easy until now.
This summer, lawmakers from both parties have been in conflict, as well as with the White House, over the drafting of several resolutions to approve or reject the US military role in NATO's mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain introduced a resolution authorizing the limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
The bill was defeated by a wide bipartisan margin and never received a vote in the Senate.
But on the same day the bill failed, the House also rejected a measure to cut funding for U.S. operations in Libya.
So the American mission has remained in a form of legislative purgatory - Congress upset enough to criticize Obama's mission management, but not enough to cut the grass under his feet.
The uncertainty of Congress was overtaken by events.
Tripoli fell to the insurgents in August and Gaddafi was killed on October 20.
NATO's mission officially ended on 31 October.
The Senate can now act.
The Foreign Relations Committee resolution "commends the Libyan people for their extraordinary courage and determination for freedom" and "commends the men and women of the US armed forces and their coalition partners engaged in military operations to protect the Libyan people for their fantastic courage and professionalism".
The resolution also affirms "the national interest of the United States in achieving an irreversible and successful transition to democracy in Libya".
Will the new measure win the full support of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee or will it divide lawmakers as it did last June?
Senator and Chairman of the Commission Richard D. Lugar (Independent) opposed the latest version.
His spokesman said last Monday that Richard D. Lugar had not yet read the latest version of the new draft.
In the Capitol, the House is due to vote this week on an amendment to the Constitution to get a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all Republicans in Congress, and a few Democrats.
The measure, supported by Republican Bob Goodlatte of Virginia, will be the first constitutional amendment to the budget, or any other issue, to get a floor vote in the House or Senate.
Other lawmakers have so far failed to get their amendments approved but they have tried.
The Goodlatte Amendment is one of 68 constitutional amendments to be introduced in Congress on a wide range of subjects.
Some are recurring - the same bill being proposed in both the House and Senate - and others are slight variations on a precedent.
There are at least 15 versions in the House of Representatives of the amendment for a balanced budget alone, and a handful that would "control federal spending".
Some of these bills are identical, but give their supporters - particularly new Republicans who want to go gold on their CVs - the chance to boast of being the "author" of such a measure.
The Budget Control Act passed last August required a vote in the House and Senate on amendments to a balanced budget.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting such an amendment.
In addition to the budget, several members want to limit the number of terms members of Congress can serve, while José E. Serrano (Democrat - New York) wants to raise the limit of two terms for presidents.
Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrat - Illinois) proposed a multitude of amendments guaranteeing the right to quality education and health care, among other subjects.
An amendment prohibiting same-sex marriage is being proposed perpetually, as is the amendment prohibiting the desecration of the flag.
Some legislators also want to allow the repeal of federal laws if two-thirds of the states oppose it.
As eager as the Members have been to propose amendments, they are not as quick as they have been in the past.
At the 111th Congress, lawmakers proposed 77 amendments, and introduced 66 in the 110th.
The pace is slowing compared with the early 1990s, when members generally proposed more than 150 amendments every two years, according to figures provided by the Senate Library.
But those amendments were not as successful as they are today.
The last amendment to be added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992 but was proposed to Congress in 1789.
"Slaughtered but not beaten", Gabrielle Giffords says in her first television interview since the shooting
Ten months after a gunman shot her in the face in Tucson, Representative Gabrielle Giffords (D-Arizona) appeared on a Monday night television show, sang Broadway's "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and said she wanted to recover first of all rather than return to Congress.
When she appeared on ABC's "20/20" alongside Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords struggled to form sentences and needed help walking.
The show tackled his difficult return after the bullet fractured his skull and punctured the left side of his brain, crossing his head.
Three months ago, she made a surprise return to the House of Representatives to vote on the debt ceiling.
In her first television interview since the January shooting, which killed six people and wounded 13 others, Gabrielle Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - and called her recovery "difficult".
After Diane Sawyer asked her how she was feeling, Gabrielle Giffords, 41, said "quite fine".
The interview with Gabrielle Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, took place during a one-hour special edition of "20/20", aired the day before the couple's new book, "Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope", was released.
The special has been tracking Gabrielle Giffords' recovery since the January 8 shooting.
In videos that Mark Kelly filmed during the first few weeks, we see him on his hospital bed, his head shaved and a wide scar on his forehead.
She can only use one or two fingers, with her husband's encouragement.
A few months later, Gabrielle Giffords is in a wheelchair as doctors teach her simple actions.
A sign from the head.
A movement of the lips.
And finally, his first word, "What".
A few days later, Gabrielle Giffords whispered another word ("Toast") to ask for a change in her breakfast menu.
The videos shown by ABC show the important role of music in Gabrielle Giffords' recovery: the Rep. is seen singing along with the doctors the air of Cyndi Lauper's "Girls Wanna Have Fun" and Tom Petty's "Free Fallin'?"
In the interview with Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords, who spends two hours every day with the doctors, said she doesn't remember the shooting.
According to her husband, he was reading her an article about the March 12 shooting when she stopped him and asked for information about the six people killed in the incident for the first time.
The gunman, Jared Lee Loughner, is being held in a Missouri prison and is being treated vigorously pending trial.
"There have been many deaths", Gabrielle Giffords told Diane Sawyer.
"Hard, hard, hard".
When she recovered, Mark Kelly told Diane Sawyer, she said, "I was beaten".
"So I would say, 'Gabby, you weren't beaten,'" said Mark Kelly.
You just got slaughtered.
And you're gonna get out of it, get better, and come back even stronger than ever.
More compassion than respect for the troops
The event: a gala on Wall Street to raise millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, frustration and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, pilots and Marines surrounded him.
The crowd in tie-clad clothes stood at his feet to cheer him up.
"Military men and women are considered heroes", said David Saltzman, the organizer of the spring fundraiser.
A senior military officer at the gala, who also included U.S. Army Chief of Staff Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops differently.
"They were presented as some kind of orphan", the senior military officer wrote in an email.
I'm sure the organizers had good intentions.
I know, I know.
But it wasn't respect, it was just pity.
The absolutely contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationships that have developed between the military and an enthusiastic but often distant American audience.
Praise is poured out to the crowds for their sacrifices.
But they have a price, some military officials say.
The public is acting more and more like they're sorry for the men and women in uniform.
"We are not victims at all", said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who led the troops in Iraq and will soon be heading to Afghanistan.
"But it seems that the only way to support ourselves is to lock ourselves up in the role of unlucky spirits".
This is a very sensitive subject for military leaders, who do not want to appear ungrateful or disagree with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger of the returning troops from the Vietnam War was much worse.
So most of the conversation about compassion is done in private among veterans.
After his two sons returned from the Marine Corps, retired Colonel Mark Cancian warned them that the public would consider their service from two perspectives.
Some would look at them with respect because they faced rebels and traveled to distant lands.
Others wonder if "an angry, violent veteran is hiding under the surface", said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to work for the government in Washington.
When he was looking for a job, he said, he felt that a few people interviewing him were subtly asking if he would be able to cope with the stress of a demanding job in Washington immediately after returning from the war.
"When you discuss service, you are faced with negative impressions", recalls Colonel Cancian, speaking to his sons.
The military's problems arise, in part, from American indifference to war.
Victory is rarely welcomed by a country so unfamiliar with the military and which sees little direct benefit from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"As a nation, we no longer value heroism in the same way we did in World War II", said retired lieutenant general David Barno, who led the troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the political and public commendations focus largely on the depth of a soldier's suffering.
Troops are known for the number of service periods they endure, the number of lost friends or the extent of injuries.
The military faces increasing pressure to crack down on rapists
This week, a key hearing will decide whether 28 men and women will be prosecuted against the military for alleged inaction in relation to rape.
If necessary, hundreds of complainants will prepare the next one.
First-class soldier Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and 11 weeks pregnant the night she claims she was raped by a soldier.
It was October 2008 when she was returning to her home base at Miramar Air Station, north of San Diego, after having dinner with a friend, when she met a colleague carrying a pack of beers.
He asked if he could join her in her room for a drink.
"It was a warning sign", says Elizabeth Lyman.
But Texas put aside her concern.
I thought, no, he's 19.
"He's from Texas", she says.
"I should have followed my intuition".
A few minutes after entering Elizabeth Lyman's room, the man grabbed her from behind, threw her to the ground and raped her, she claims.
This week, November 18, Elizabeth Lyman and 27 other military personnel, some still in service and some not, will look forward to the court ruling in a historic trial in Arlington, Virginia, that will decide whether to proceed with a trial against former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld.
The latter are accused of not having stopped the widespread rape within the army, thus violating the constitutional rights of soldiers.
The trial, initially involving 17 plaintiffs, was filed in February by Susan Burke, a Washington lawyer, and rose to 28 the following months - 25 women and 3 men, all claiming to have been raped or sexually abused by fellow soldiers.
Susan Burke says she's going after the gallon soldiers, because the problem starts with them.
"The army is a vertical structure", she says.
"Who are the individuals in a position to eradicate the culture of retaliation?
The lawyer also says that since February, she has been contacted by nearly 400 other survivors, most of whom could be involved in future legal proceedings.
Her strategy: Instead of bringing all the plaintiffs together in this case - putting all her eggs in one basket - she will bring several lawsuits, if necessary, to keep the pressure on her.
The defense team, for the Department of Defense, led by U.S. attorney Neil MacBride, filed a motion to dismiss the case.
The court documents obtained by Newsweek detail the defense strategy, and essentially the fact that the military cannot be prosecuted by soldiers on duty or not for injuries caused in the armed forces.
According to a 1950 Supreme Court decision, known as the Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for injuries suffered by active duty personnel.
"The alleged wrong is inherent in the complainants' military service", the documents state.
The Department of Defense declined to comment.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
While women still do not officially have the right to go to war, this distinction is only written on paper: the front lines of recent wars are rarely exclusively male.
In Iraq and Afghanistan, female soldier teams are playing an increasingly important role, including in contacting local women.
The result was that 150 women soldiers lost their lives - two thirds of them in combat.
It's time for the military to modernize itself, says Susan Burke.
She is not alone in this fight: three other trials are underway in addition to her own.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans Legal Services Center is preparing a lawsuit against the four major military academies for allegedly encouraging a misogynistic atmosphere.
On the other hand, the nonprofit Vietnam Veterans of America Foundation is preparing a lawsuit against the military, focusing on diagnosing "personality disorders" attributed to rape victims in order to give them leave - a relatively common fact, according to activists such as Anu Bhagwaru of the Service Women's Action Network, a human rights group.
His group filed a lawsuit in December with the Veterans Administration, accusing them of discriminatory practices in the way they handle benefits claims for people who report having been sexually assaulted in the service.
Nine independent bills were introduced to Congress by a bipartisan mix of senators and representatives, proposing various solutions.
In 2010, 3,158 sexual assaults were recorded according to the Department of Defense's Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office.
But it is well known that the number of sexual assaults is underestimated, for the Pentagon estimates that this figure is about 13.5% of the 19,000 incidents that occurred that year.
The report published in March also examines the percentage of lawsuits: in 2010, 20% of cases registered in the military were tried - half the percentage of the civil justice system.
Complainants in the Susan Burke case describe their assault as the first in a series of trauma.
In Lyman's case, she reported the rape to the Military Police less than an hour after the incident.
That night, she said, she was asked to tell 11 times in detail about her rape to various police officers, doctors and commanders.
She was raped, and the blood of her assailant - from a cut in her arm - was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Elizabeth Lyman was sitting in front of a judge, at a trial in which she was questioned about her sexual relations with her boyfriend earlier in the day of her assault.
Six people testified as moral witnesses for the perpetrator of the crime, who was eventually acquitted.
"I remember the day the verdict was handed down", says Elizabeth Lyman.
"I thought I was going to start having contractions, so I started screaming outside the courtyard".
"I was placed in a psychiatric unit, and when I got out, I remember telling my commander, 'This was not his trial, it was mine.'"
Elizabeth Lyman was forced to see a military psychiatrist, who eventually diagnosed her with a personality disorder, rendering her unfit for service.
In January 2010, she was dismissed on less than honorable terms, preventing her from receiving any benefits.
Whether Lyman and the other plaintiffs will advance or not is a long story, says John Turley, a law professor at the University of Washington School of Law.
However, he notes, "I think they should be able to move forward".
Only this doctrine, which has been criticized since its introduction, is between them and a verdict.
I have always been critical of the Feres doctrine.
The military is decades behind because it doesn't have the same advantages and deterrents that responsibility does.
"The odds are stacked against them... but it's important that they try", he adds.
These things only change when the good guys are willing to fight.
If the trial fails, Susan Burke, the plaintiffs' lawyer, will gather her hundreds of other plaintiffs for further trials.
"We will continue to fight the army on this issue until there is reform", she said.
Where until we die, either of the two options.
Walls have eyes: researchers study you on Facebook
Before he became the new face of the far right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was just a guy sharing his anti-immigration views online.
On Monday, Breivik, who admitted to being taken in by a murderous insanity in Norway in July leaving 77 victims, faced his first trial.
While Breivik acted alone, he was far from being on cyberspace: he had spent much of the time before the attack on his computer, chatting with a few of the millions of nationalists who support far-right groups on social media sites.
After the tragedy this summer, researchers want to know more about these people.
But how do we find them?
Easy... connect to Facebook.
"We realized that it was not that difficult to find them", says Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a recent report by DEMOS' think tank on digital populism in Europe.
Facebook is so full of personal information, says Jamie Bartlett, that researchers could simply use the site's advertising tool to find the people they're looking for with scientific accuracy - the way marketers have been doing it for years.
Jamie Bartlett's team found that half a million members were fans of far-right groups in Europe. They targeted them with ads, but instead of linking them to a new group or product, the ads invited users to respond to a survey.
By connecting with these people through Facebook, Jamie Bartlett and colleagues were able to interview 10,000 supporters of 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries - without leaving office.
"It's a new way of doing research", says Jamie Bartlett.
Some findings are not at all surprising: online supporters of right-wing groups are more men, young people and anti-immigration.
But surprisingly, "those who associate online and offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic, and less violent than those who stay behind their computer screens".
The DEMOS study is just one example of how Facebook has become the new indispensable tool in the hands of scientists.
Think tanks, medical researchers and political scientists use the site to study all topics that touch on health issues such as social trends, through "I Like", wall posts and statutory updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding an average of three content per day, the "data supernova" is generating an explosion in search, increasing the number of research papers whose name appears in the title of the site by almost 800% over the past five years.
For some researchers, the advantage of Facebook is that it allows you to study people you couldn't approach on the street.
"Before, when you tried to investigate people in the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them".
"You were supposed to go to the party, but they would never let you in", says Jamie Bartlett.
"Facebook avoids all this - you have direct access to their information".
Others say the site could offer a way to identify and treat health and social problems.
According to a recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and colleagues, young students who shared their achievements on Facebook while intoxicated were vastly more likely to be alcoholics than discreet students.
Megan Moreno suggests that fellow students, such as counselors, could monitor the site and intervene to help a student whose status would talk too often about alcohol.
"You can't treat a problem if you don't diagnose it", says Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Megan Moreno and director of the Center for Child Health, Behavior, and Development at the Children's Research Institute in Seattle, Washington Post.
"We know how to identify children at risk, and who would otherwise not be recognized".
Facebook also constantly accesses the information of its users.
The site's data team studied statistics on the love situation and Valentine's Day, the turnout rate in the 2010 midterm elections, and a national happiness index (thanks to only available information - digital freedom champions have long argued that the site could make its data treasure available to others for research purposes).
But Facebook users know that the site watches them, whether they like it or not - in exchange for being able to play Scrabble with a friend thousands of miles away, the site is allowed to access your information.
But what happens when Facebook users are part of a survey they haven't even heard of?
While researchers have well-defined guidelines on how to collect information other than through the Internet, there is a whole other thing online.
"I don't think a lot of users have ever thought about the fact that a researcher could study their profile", says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Laboratory, according to a 2006 study he conducted by looking at his students' Facebook walls.
"As soon as they knew, the exchange was only seen by their friends".
Then comes the question of methodology.
Even without going online, there is no guarantee that the subject of a study is completely honest.
On Facebook, it's impossible to know the degree of truth of a profile or a user's wall.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do in real life are two completely different things", says Neil Selwyn.
That is why, despite his experience as a technologist, Neil Selwyn believes that a notebook and a pen remain the best tools one can use.
"Nothing can replace the real world and contact with people", he says.
"Social studies are supposed to address the social aspect - and social is not in front of a computer".
"Cold and Inhuman" by Anders Behring Breivik
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who admitted to organizing the two bombings that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself as a "resistance fighter" when he first appeared at the Oslo trial.
"I am a military commander of the Norwegian resistance movement and the Norwegian Templars", he explained in front of a 500-strong courtroom.
"As far as the jurisdiction of the court is concerned, I refuse it because you hold your mandate as an organization that supports a hate ideology and because it supports multiculturalism".
"I admit the facts, but I'm not pleading guilty".
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during the monologue because he "did not want to give him the opportunity to use this trial to express his views".
For the same reason, he refused to let Breivik, who had brought a paper speech with him, speak to the victims' parents at the end of the hearing.
Justice Nesheim also asked the police to keep Breivik in custody for 12 more weeks, banned him from speaking to the media for four weeks and warned him that authorities would monitor all visits and correspondence very closely for eight weeks.
About 30 relatives of survivors and victims were present at the hearing.
Some came in hopes of looking Breivik in the eye, others to be sure he would be put behind bars.
All of them attended the hearing in order to see the end of the trial.
"I found it cold and inhuman", said a Utoya survivor to Norwegian TV channel NRK.
"I was uncomfortable, but I personally moved a little forward after seeing and hearing the suspect".
Dressed in a dark suit and a blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the trial, looking the journalists and survivors in the eyes as they entered and left the courthouse.
Despite the strange idea that Breivik belonged to a large "resistance" movement, the judge determined that he was not crazy.
The attacks of 22 July appear to have been carried out by an extremist rather than a group of radicals, which may comfort some.
But this does not reduce the grief or confusion felt by the entire nation.
"I would have preferred it to look like a monster, but it's not", said one victim's relative.
"It would have been a lot easier".
Seven lessons from Steve Jobs' lost interview, at the movies this week
After Steve Jobs died on October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford - distinguished himself as a technical engineer and inventor of modern computing.
But what Apple fans can find most revealing in a recent interview with Steve Jobs that will be released this week as the first part of a film on major markets is how much this creative spirit had understood the processes and workflows of products.
He was undoubtedly a creator and a dreamer, identifying himself as a hippie but also being very meticulous and organized, as well as an organisational enhancer - a man who believed that many business leaders suffered from a "disease that made them think that a great idea makes 90% of the work... [but] a considerable amount of manual work separates a great idea from an exceptional product".
In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the television series "Triumph of the Nerds", which chronicles the birth of the computer, and he sat down for over an hour with Steve Jobs for a long, rare conversation.
By this time, it had been about 10 years since Steve Jobs had left Apple, and he was already working hard on his new computer company NeXT, aiming to popularise the Internet.
While a small portion of the interview with Cringely is used in Nerds, he says the main copies have disappeared in transportation.
It wasn't until after Steve Jobs died that a full video was found in the director's garage.
This slightly re-cut video is the basis for the 68-minute film Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, which will be released in theaters next Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone known to hate in-depth interviews, Steve Jobs here seems surprisingly enthusiastic about exposing technology philosophies and his business strategies.
And incredibly attentive.
On four different points during the interview, the answers come long after the questions - between 10 and 15 seconds of reflection, during which Steve Jobs clearly weighs his thoughts, with the goal of providing a precise answer.
We also find moments when Steve Jobs' perfectionism resurfaces, where he seems eager to hear Cringely's questions, clapping his elbows to get him to speed up and move on to more important questions or topics.
Filmed before the era of Pixar, iPod or iPhone, there's a strange predictive aspect to Lost Interview where Steve Jobs evaluates what he sees as good or bad in other companies and shares his own vision for the future of computing.
It's one thing to read the posthumous evaluations of Steve Jobs' career, but there's something raw and inspiring about the man we see here, the anxious dreamer on the eve of greatness.
He has a vision of how things can and should be.
He explains them and then applies them.
Here's a quick summary of seven remarkable episodes of Lost Interview:
About how he learned to run a business:
"All these years, I've always asked, 'Why do you do things?' and the answers are always the same, 'Oh, just because you have to do them.'"
Nobody knows why, nobody thinks deeply about things in a company.
That's what I found out.
Steve Jobs continues by giving details of his efforts to simplify accounting at Apple.
Confused about how costs were recorded - often starting with a "standard cost" assessed at a glance and then adjusted with a "variation" - he developed an automated factory that ensured accurate calculation of commercial costs.
On the opportunity to play a round at the Pope:
Steve Jobs tells the story of the "Blue Box" he created with Steve Wozniak - a device that was used to hack into phone networks and make free long-distance calls.
The device has been the subject of much writing in the past, but Steve Jobs' euphoria here in his description of the Blue Box as an act of appropriation is contagious.
He describes how he and Wozniak tested the box using a public phone, making a call and then connecting from one AT&T network to another while bypassing as many satellites as possible.
"We wrapped the ball around different things half a dozen times and you screamed on the public phone and it happened to you a minute later on the next public phone", Jobs laughs.
"We were young and thanks to this Blue Box, we learned that we could create something ourselves that could control billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world".
We didn't know much, but we did invent a little thing that could control big things, and it was an incredible lesson, and I don't think Apple would have ever existed without it.
Steve Jobs continues by recounting a wonderful tour he and Wozniak developed: he called the Vatican with the Blue Box in the middle of the night pretending to be Henry Kissinger and asked to speak to the Pope.
As several members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to speak to the American diplomat, the two accomplices laughed madly just before the Pope himself was awakened.
About his love of technology (and Bill Hewlett's departure):
At the age of 12, while hunting for spare parts to make a frequency meter, he searches for Bill Hewlett's number in the directory and makes a phone call.
Shortly after their 20-minute conversation, Steve Jobs gets a part-time summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
"It had a remarkable effect on me, and it was the only company I had seen at that age, and it shaped my definition of a company and the way employees are treated".
Steve Jobs later became one of HP's employees to visit the company's research labs in Palo Alto, where he discovered the "first desktop computer ever designed".
It was as big as a suitcase, had a little cathode tube, and I fell in love with it.
My teenager went back to HP and started writing programs for this machine.
The improvisation of innovation:
Several times in the interview, Steve Jobs talks about inventing new products at a glance.
Early in his career, while he was moving in to sell some printed circuit boards, a client asked him to assemble a complete computer.
He worked only 30 credit days and was responsible for assembling and delivering the finished appliances.
Later, at Apple, he recalled the difficulties he encountered in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember big fights... they were yelling at me saying it would take me five years [to make a $300 mouse] and I got tired of it, and I went out and went to a designer".
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could make for $15 and that proved incredibly reliable.
Big companies that are losing their breath:
Long before he revived Apple, Steve Jobs had predicted how many industry leaders would go wrong and lose control of their market share.
"Let's say you work for IBM or Xerox, you make a better copy or a better printer, and then what?"
You have a monopoly on the market, so the company is not more successful.
Sales and marketing can make it evolve, so [these types of people] end up running companies and product-specialized staff are left out of decision-making.
The product engineering that led to this monopoly position is completely rotten by people who can't imagine designing a good product versus a bad product - the manual labor required.
That's what happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have owned the entire IT industry.
Xerox would have been the Microsoft of the '90s...
They've won the battle.
On innovation as an art form:
"A huge amount of manual work separates a great idea from an exceptional product... as you develop that idea, it changes and grows".
You're learning a lot about his subtleties.
There are compromises to be made... some things you can't do, electrons can, glass, robots, factories can too.
You have to keep thousands of things in mind (these concepts) by putting them together.
Finally, decisions are made by personal taste, and it's about trying to expose yourself to the best products that humans have created, and trying to bring those things to the product you create.
Picasso once said that good artists copy and great artists steal.
We're always ashamed to steal great ideas.
And that's part of what makes the Macintosh exceptional. The people who worked on it were musicians, poets, zoologists, historians, who simply turned out to be the best computer scientists in the world.
If it wasn't for computer science, they would have done amazing things in another field.
Scalia and Thomas are having dinner with health law opponents as the court meets
On the day the Supreme Court convenes behind closed doors to consider whether to hear President Obama's opposition to the health care law, two of its judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were spotted at a dinner sponsored by the law firm that will defend the case in the high court.
The event took place last Thursday when the nine judges met for a conference to discuss petitions for consideration.
One of the cases involved a lawsuit brought by 26 states challenging the ambitious health care reform passed by Congress last year, a law that has been a rallying point for conservative activists nationwide.
The judges agreed to hear the complaint, as a monumental 5:30 p.m. argument is expected next March, and the result is likely to contribute to destabilizing the 2012 presidential race, which will be booming when the court's decision is handed down.
The lawyer who will stand before the court and argue the rejection of the law will likely be Paul Clement, who served as the United States Attorney General under the George W. Bush administration.
Clement's law firm, PLLC Bancroft, was one of two dozen law firms that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, a long-standing group dedicated to upholding conservative legal principles.
Another firm that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another promoter was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., which has a huge financial stake in the outcome of the dispute.
Dinner was held at a Washington hotel a few hours after the court's hearing on the case.
Among others, Mitch McConnell, a top Republican in the Senate and a vocal opponent of the health care law, was on the scene.
The star guests at dinner?
This is not new, for the two judges have been present at the events of the Federalist Society for years.
And there's nothing that goes against the rules of ethics.
In fact, judges are exempt from the code of conduct that governs the actions of federal judges.
If they were, they would probably argue with the Code of Canon 4C, which states: "A judge may attend fundraisers from law-related organizations and others, although the judge may not be a speaker, an honorary guest, or a member of the programme of such an event".
However, the mere presence of Scalia and Thomas near two of the law firms in the case, as well as a firm with massive financial interest, alarmed government ethics activists.
"This violation of ethics and this superb indifference to the code contradict statements by several judges that the Court follows the same rules as all other federal judges", said Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause.
"The judges drank and ate and celebrated a fundraiser with lawyers who have cases pending before the court".
Their presence and participation in the fundraising of this event dismisses any claim of impartiality and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas showed little regard for critics who claimed that they too easily mixed up court cases with the agenda of groups such as the Federalist Society.
And Thomas' wife, Ginni, is a high-profile conservative activist.
Moreover, conservatives claim that it is Judge Elena Kagan who has an ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was the Obama administration's solicitor general when the first objections to the law were brought to the trial court.
Her critics pressured Kagan to refuse to hear the case, saying she had invested too much in upholding the law to be impartial.
Kagan gave no indication that she would.
Boeing records a record $18 billion order for airliners
Emirates is ordering 50 Boeing 777s, with the possibility of buying 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliners to Oman Air, a market estimated at more than $1 billion.
There is nothing extraordinary about a company receiving an order for 50 of its products.
It is a big deal, however, when the company in question is the Boeing aircraft manufacturer and the amount of these 50 aircraft reaches a record high of $18 billion.
Equally amazing is who Boeing got the order from: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In forecasts published Monday, the Chicago-based airline estimates that airlines in the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft worth a total of $450 billion over the next 20 years.
Over the weekend, Boeing announced the order for the most expensive commercial aircraft in its history - 50 Boeing 777 bi-aisles.
It was Emirates Airlines based in Dubai that passed this pharaonic order.
Boeing announced at the 2011 Dubai Air Show that the airline is also likely to purchase 20 more aircraft, which would raise the total order amount to $26 billion.
On Monday, Boeing said Oman Air had ordered six Boeing 787-8, dubbed Dreamliners, a model that boasts significant fuel savings and passenger convenience.
The total value of these six aircraft is over a billion dollars.
"This is clearly a very positive thing for Boeing", said Morningstar analyst Neal Dihora.
"These customers in particular are of immense value".
In the Middle East, oil-producing countries own many of their airlines.
So not only do they have the means to pay for these planes, but a rise in fuel prices - usually detrimental to airlines because it is their biggest expense - would not be so damaging to them since the country would make money from rising oil prices.
This is an important point because these companies will be less likely than others to cancel or delay their aircraft orders when oil prices rise, Dihora reported.
"They have a natural risk coverage", he said.
Emirates' order strengthens Boeing's dominance in the heavy-duty aircraft market and helps curb the attempt to interfere with competitor Airbus' A350 aircraft.
Boeing's victory at the Aircraft Show comes four months after Airbus announced it was postponing the debut of the larger version of the A350, which competes directly with the Boeing 777-300ER.
Airbus is postponing its debut to increase its momentum following a request from its customers to increase its load capacity and autonomy.
Boeing shares rose 1.5% to $67.94.
The Mexican president's sister apparently defeated in the Michoacán election
Luisa Maria Calderon says drug dealers helped her PRI opponent Fausto Vallejo in the governorship race.
President Felipe Calderon's sister appears to have lost her bid for governor of Michoacán in a violent election, and she said Monday that drug dealers favored one of her opponents.
Early results indicated that Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, was leading the race for governor of this western state.
"The intervention of organized crime throughout the voting process and especially yesterday is an alarming fact, not only for Michoacán but for the whole country", Luisa Maria Calderon told radio during an interview on Monday following the election.
"They threatened our candidates, our election officials... they seized ballot boxes, they set up roadblocks... and they forced people to vote" for the PRI.
The PRI governed Mexico for 70 years until it lost the presidency in 2000.
But he's organizing his return, and a victory in Michoacán is an important step in that effort.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have stood out only slightly from Calderon, who was leading the polls before election day.
Calderon, a candidate for his brother's conservative National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the left-wing candidate of the Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, who is currently serving as governor, came third, a painful defeat before the 2012 presidential election for this divided and unhappy left.
Aureoles also refused to acknowledge the initial results.
Vallejo, a former mayor of Morelia, the state capital, denied any connection to drug dealers and strongly advised other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacán has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in the trafficking of marijuana, heroin, and methamphetamine.
This is President Calderon's home state, and he chose Michoacán to launch a military offensive against traffickers in December 2006.
Yet, violence continued.
A week before the election a PAN mayor was assassinated while campaigning for Luisa Maria Calderon, and many candidates left the campaign locally out of fear.
However, for the PRI, as corrupt as the Michoacán elections may seem, a victory will help the party in its momentum.
The man expected to represent the PRI in the presidential race, Enrique Pena Nieto, congratulated Vallejo from Washington and said, "I think this victory is very encouraging for next year".
The DPA strongly urges Asia to help the euro area
The Asian Development Bank has asked India and China to prepare to help the euro area emerge from the sovereign debt crisis to avoid a long-term decline that would impede the development of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, the managing director of the Manila-based BASD, said the world's two fastest growing economic powers must "do everything in their power" to accelerate the recovery of the monetary zone through the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He advised the BRICs (Brazil, Russia, India, China) not to look at Europe's difficulties with an "indifferent eye" and pointed out that Asian financial support alongside Europe's leaders and resources would prevent a long-term collapse of the world economy.
"We are all in this together".
"So anyone who can help Europe out of the crisis is useful", he told the Financial Times in an interview during the World Economic Forum in Bombay.
"Asia can be protected to some extent but it is not protected".
"So if China and India can help, let nothing stop them".
In recent months, the euro area has been seriously shaken by a sovereign debt crisis.
Recently, the cost of Italian borrowing has risen dangerously and the Prime Ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The thriving sovereign debt crisis in Europe has raised fears that the world economy may re-enter recession, and has prompted calls from the major emerging economies to come together to help the euro area find a solution.
Mr Nag predicted that the IMF would send any Asian aid, but he also said that this bilateral assistance - such as buying bonds from the US financial bailout fund, the European Financial Stability Fund - offered greater negotiating power to Europe's Asian partners.
Anand Sharma, the Indian Minister of Trade and Industry, said that "India will do everything it can" to help the eurozone as its own economy now suffers from a decline in exports and a drying up of foreign capital inflows.
"No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and unstable", he said.
"We have enormous challenges to tackle and we must maintain a high level of growth".
"This is not a choice, it's an imperative, because where would we find work for the tens of millions of our young men and women?"
Others argue that developing economies such as India should not help the rich Europeans when they face their own important economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the United States, said it would be politically very difficult to get help from Europe to the 1.2 billion Indians, of whom at least 800,000 live on $2 a day or less.
"One day they will find out that Greeks retire at 50 and go on holiday in the sun and will have a hard time swallowing it", he reported.
Lee Howell, the president of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why India's reserves should be used to keep many well-paid Greek officials in poorly managed jobs that result in losses, such as in the railway sector.
Mr Nag said that the eurozone crisis could have "significant repercussions" across Asia.
The BASD forecasts of 7,5% economic growth in Asia in 2011/2012 are now facing 'risk of loss' due to the European threat.
He pointed out that vulnerable emerging markets needed to develop 'rescue plans' to protect against economic upheaval and major capital leaks.
The Pentagon's strong warnings about potential defence cuts
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta put pressure on Congress Monday, warning that the impending automatic budget cuts would undermine national security, triggering a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon corridors to the battlefields of Afghanistan, including civilian rallies.
The Pentagon is already digesting $450 billion in cuts for the next decade, but now fears that an additional $600 or more in cuts is imminent if Congress fails to reach a spending agreement.
"The impacts of these cuts would be devastating to the department", Panetta said in a letter to Senators John McCain, R-Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina.
He said that if Congress fails to reach a budget agreement resulting in what is called secretive, it would result in 23% cuts and the freezing of many new projects.
"Such a major reduction, applied without discernment, would render most of our ships and construction projects unfeasible - you cannot buy three quarters of a ship or a building - and seriously undermine other modernization efforts", Panetta wrote to the senators.
"We would also be forced to part with a number of our civilian staff and, because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, we would almost certainly have to send civilians on unpaid leave in order to achieve the goal".
"These changes would undermine the faith of those who support our military and seriously damage our readiness".
The reductions would eventually affect the fighting troops, continues Panetta.
"While wartime financing of foreign contingency accounts is not directly affected by the sequester, war efforts would be adversely affected by serious disruptions in basic budgets", Panetta warned.
"The contracting staff would be reduced, leading to delays in contracting and overseeing contracts that support the war".
"Wages management staff would be reduced, leading to late payments to war suppliers, and legal and political support would be disrupted".
The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days earlier, asking for details about the potential impact of automatic cuts on the Defense Ministry.
"The consequence of a seizure of the Department of Defense would have triggered a rapid decline of the United States as the undisputed world leader of military power".
"We are strongly opposed to this draconian action", the senators said in a joint statement Monday afternoon as Panetta's letter was published.
"It's not a consequence we can live with, and it's certainly not the one we should impose on ourselves".
"Sequestration is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and it shouldn't have to happen".
Whether Panetta's letter and recent warnings from senators increase pressure for a budget compromise or a call to exempt the Pentagon from cuts remains to be seen.
Panetta was increasingly vocal about possible cuts, even though he himself reached the top of the Pentagon, accumulating years of budget expertise in Congress and the White House and knowing he was faced with difficult choices.
At a press conference last week, the Secretary of Defense painted a bleak picture of what might happen - a soldier with a shell but no core.
"It's a ship without sailors".
"It's a brigade without bullets".
"It's a fighter jet, with no trained pilots".
"It's a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs that don't have enough trained soldiers to complete the mission", Panetta said in his opening remarks to the Pentagon.
"It's a depressed force, ill-prepared and unable to cope with potential adversaries".
"In fact, she calls for aggression.. "
In an addendum to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta specifically stated how further reductions could "generate significant operational risks: delay in response to crises, conflicts and disasters; severe limits on our ability to deploy and engage in the world; and unacceptable risk in future combat operations".
And Panetta said some of the biggest defense projects could go to the top, including those already tested and some just in the early stages of planning.
This list included the Fighter F35 Joint Strike, a new planned bomber, the next-generation ballistic submarine, the new coastal combat ship, and the new field vehicle, which would replace the Army and Navy Humvee.
Stopping development and testing of the F35 could generate $80 billion in savings over 10 years, but its supporters say it's a critical step in improving and responding to potential threats from China and other rivals.
How to Tell a Lie
A look at recent headlines shows how pervasive deception and lying are in everyday life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy exchanging allegations of sexual harassment with several women, each side accusing the other of lying.
Penn State administrators have been charged with perjury for allegedly covering up reports that a retired football coach sexually assaulted boys.
Last week French President Nicolas Sarkozy was caught on an open microphone claiming to US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
The lie has destroyed careers and shaken countries.
New York congressman and Internet celebrity Anthony Weiner has been seen as an idiot by quickly making contradictory denials with irrefutable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards has been charged with campaign finance violations related to covering up an extramarital affair.
And then, no one who's ever lived through history will ever forget the media circus that President Bill Clinton started by lying during his second term about his sexual involvement with Monica Lewinsky.
The stories of cheating on school and college tests are legion.
There have been instances where teachers have given students test answers to show their performance ratings.
Mentors who should teach the opposite are sending the message that lying and cheating are acceptable.
How many deception are we facing?
In a given day, studies show that you can hear 10 to 200 lies.
In fact, many of them are pious liars.
Another study found that strangers lie to each other three times within the first 10 minutes of meeting each other.
Detecting or spotting lies is a vital skill that everyone must acquire, for both personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a social game like, say, charades, where the goal is to shout, "I got you", cheating detection is a serious branch of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades from prestigious universities that have conducted in-depth research on such projects, particularly in psychology and physiology.
One of the results of the research is that the oldest myths about lying have been debunked.
Liars look you in the eye.
They don't always bark, red or move.
Do not conclude that liars are difficult to detect and difficult to expose.
A qualified lie detector can discover the truth by examining the structure of the statement, the micro-facial expressions, the formation of the question, and the response time.
I've spent several years examining scientific findings across the vast body and knowledge about cheating is still emerging, and it's clear that cheating detection is a modern skill that's easy to learn and useful for navigating our complex world - especially if your professional responsibilities include hiring, interviewing, negotiating or managing.
Good liars are skilled at reading others, making them comfortable, managing their own emotions, and intuitively detecting how others perceive them.
We know from research that extroverts lie more than introverts, that men tell more "self-centered" lies while women tell more "other-centered" lies - usually to protect someone's feelings - that married people lie to their partners less often than unmarried people (but the lies they tell tend to be huge).
We also know that if you are perceived as a disbeliever, others will feel less guilty about lying to you.
How can you tell if someone's lying?
First, observe the normal behavior of your subject.
This is called "establishing the benchmarks".
This helps to provide a reference point for measuring subsequent changes.
Look at the posture of your subject, the laughter, the quality of your voice.
You should be aware of anyone who is regularly shaking his feet so that you do not make unjust accusations when you see him shaking his feet in the middle of the meeting.
Then look for clues of verbal and nonverbal deceptive behavior.
Consider these clues as red flags, not evidence of deceit.
Deceptive people can hold their upper body when they try to remember their story, they can point their feet to the door, lean toward an exit, significantly change posture or present a "post-interview" relief - an exaggerated sigh of relief, a change of posture when all the difficult questions are over.
Interviewees often falsely state that the interview is over just to try to trigger the post-interview reaction.
So be careful of your subject vocabulary.
Famous Scott Peterson has slipped past the past while pretending that his murdered wife was alive, sparking a national search for her.
Deceptive individuals may also use distant language: "I have not had sex with this woman... Miss Lewinsky" or repeat a difficult question entirely.
The most common verbal indicators are subtle.
A person may use a lot of "wood language" when answering a difficult question: "Well... to be honest... if I remember well... to my knowledge".
This makes the response perceptual rather than factual and is often a red flag.
There's no magic formula for detecting lies, but developing the skills to recognize deceit is possible.
These skills will improve the chances of anyone avoiding being victimized by scammers in their professional and personal lives.
The controversial pipeline plan will be disrupted after the US threat of delayed approval
A few days after the Obama administration threatened to delay approval of a Canada-Gulf oil project - angering unions while appeasing environmentalists - the company seeking to build the pipeline says it is ready to redirect the project to bring it back on track.
TransCanada said Monday night it will move the projected pipeline out of the environmentally sensitive area of the Nebraska dunes, and is confident the project will still win approval.
The company announced the decision at a press conference at the Nebraska Capitol.
TransCanada official Alex Pourbax says the company remains confident that it will eventually get approval for an oil pipeline, but with a different route.
This follows the State Department's announcement last week that it would delay its decision to grant a federal permit for the project until it receives further potential route studies to avoid areas of the Nebraska Dunes and Ogallala Aquifers, vast sources of groundwater.
"This is a real way forward", says Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, to Fox News.
The new environmental review commissioned by the State Department would have likely postponed any decision until 2013, after next year's elections, although officials deny the policy's involvement in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the State Department's decision, and expressed his support.
The 2,735-kilometer pipeline would extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would transport 700,000 barrels a day from the province of Alberta to the refineries in Texas.
To do that, he would have to travel through six states.
It is hated by environmentalists, but loved by working groups, who have bet on the estimated 20,000 jobs linked to the pipeline.
But Nebraska lawmakers opposed to the plan are pushing for legislation to force the removal of the Sand Hills area and the Ogallala aquifer, a major source of drinking water and irrigation.
The State Department's ongoing environmental impact study found that the project would only have limited negative environmental impacts, but the energy industry said the inspector general of the Department ordered a separate investigation of the review process, focusing on two issues.
One is that a TransCanada lobbyist, Paul Elliott, who was a campaign adviser to Hillary Clinton in 2008, would represent a conflict of interest in the program.
The other is whether a company that was hired to conduct the initial study was an inappropriate choice because of its relationship with TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle sued for allegedly causing a young child to vomit in fear
A New York family says that the Disco diva Patti LaBelle, who launched a violent riot in the lobby of their Manhattan apartment building, terrorized their little girl to the point of vomiting out of fear.
The "Lady Marmalade" singer's play scared 18-month-old Geneviève Monk so much that she suffered "personality changes, sleep disturbances" and "increased fear of strangers", her family said during the Manhattan Supreme Court trial.
It was November 10 last year when stage technician Kevin Monk, his wife, kindergarten teacher Roseanna, and Geneviève were preparing to go on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk was picking up the car, Roseanna Monk went down the hallway of their building on Riverside Boulevard with their luggage, carrying Genevieve in her arms.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped by the door and put her daughter down for a while.
"Someone came behind me and said, 'Do you know what your daughter's doing?' I said 'yes' and went to get her", she said.
LaBelle rebelled furiously at the pregnant woman.
"She said to me in an aggressive tone, 'You shouldn't leave your daughter at the door,'" says Roseanna Monk.
"I said, 'I don't care what you say or think.'
She got angry and started using curses - the word "" and the word "" in a loud voice...
She had a bottle of water and started sprinkling me with the bottle of water.
She said that at this point Genevieve became hysterical.
"I said to this woman, 'Look what you did to my daughter,'" said the child's mother.
LaBelle jumped on the mother - who was still holding Geneviève in her arms - and had to be held back by her entourage who drove her to a car waiting for them, says Roseanna Monk.
The little girl was crying so loudly that she started vomiting, she adds.
Later, the family sent a note apologizing to LaBelle, but received no response.
LaBelle's lawyer and representatives have not returned our calls for comment.
The complaint claims unspecified damages, but the family's lawyer, Sam Davis, said he took the case for free and that the family plans to donate all the money received to a children's cancer charity.
"The aim is to hold Patti LaBelle accountable for her conduct", Davis said.
"This kind of behavior is totally unacceptable, especially for a kindergarten teacher carrying an 18-month-old child".
Climate change has slowed the economy
During the first year of Mario López Valdez's administration, unemployment and informal life in Sinaloa increased, foreign investment declined and the economy contracted.
2011 is a year that will be remembered in Sinaloa's economic history, it is the first year of the government of Mario López Valdez, self-proclaimed change, which has generated high expectations regarding the progress of the economy, but given the climate adversity of the beginning of the year, the increase is not observed, in return there is a deterioration of the main indicators of economic development.
The low temperatures of February, apart from causing trillions of dollars in losses for the agricultural sector, limited the state's economic growth opportunities, causing general economic activity to shrink by 3.6% in the first half of the year, mainly due to the historic 31.16% drop in agriculture, which affected the dynamism of other economic sectors.
According to the report on frost damage issued by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, 582 million 835 hectares of crops were damaged, of which 78.03 percent were damaged in total and the remaining 21.07 percent were partially damaged. The main crops affected were vegetables, maize and peas.
The decline in economic activity has generated, up to November, a steady increase in unemployment in the State, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography. The state unemployment rate during the first three quarters of the year has seen an accelerated increase, as from January to March 55 053 Sinaloens were unemployed, with a rate of 4.53 percent of the Active Economic Population, in the second quarter the rate became 5.28 percent and from July to September the average continued to rise to 6.19 percent, a rate that represents more than 74 thousand Sinaloens unemployed, an increase from the first half of 18 969 people.
Less liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, according to economist Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences at UAS, the rise in unemployment can be explained indirectly by actions taken by public policy.
"What we are seeing is an increase in unemployment that is due to various factors, including the loss of market liquidity due to a restriction of resources by legislation passed by Congress to combat money laundering, because for people who make dollars illegally it is not easy for them to work to earn them, to invest them and use them in something", he says.
Immigration detained
López Cervantes pointed out that the rise in unemployment is also due to a demographic factor.
"The number of people who leave the state to work abroad in the United States has been limited, firstly because of the difficulties of entry and secondly because when they enter they already have a lot of difficulties finding work, these people stay here and ask for sources of work, which causes unemployment to rise", he said.
Lack of seriousness
The analysis of the Sinaloese labour market is exacerbated by the high level of seriousness that prevails among working conditions, according to INEGI, 60.38% of the population employed in this state work there without contributing as a worker to any social insurance institution.
Apart from unemployment and lack of seriousness, another reason for the state's lag is low wages, the entity has the lowest salaries in the country, according to the records of the Mexican Institute of Social Insurance and the Secretariat of Labor and Social Forecasting.
The average monthly income of Sinaloa workers was 5 352 pesos, much lower than the national average of 7 375 pesos, up to September.
Contraction of FDI
Apart from the decline in economic activity and the rise in unemployment, the biggest reduction in FDI in the last 10 years was recorded in 2011, according to the Economic Secretariat from January to June, when the State FDI reached $630 thousand 697 which represents a decrease of 87.74 percent from the $5 million 143 thousand 312 recorded in the same period of the previous year.
The State Government's Economic Development Secretariat, in turn, accounts for a total investment of 17.280 trillion pesos a year, recorded mainly by companies in the tertiary sector.
Debt
Given the economic contraction scenario, the State Government requested the approval of a 3 trillion pesos loan to the public congress in July for investment in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities, with the aim of re-energizing the economy. The approval of the State congress was 2,600 trillion pesos and until November no debt gains were observed in any sector of the state economy.
Reactions
For employers, the first year of the government of Mario López Valdés shows a lack of management capacity in the government.
Miguel Loredo López, President of the National Chamber of Transformation Industry, said that in 2011 there was no harmonisation of the wills of the various sectors, including the State Government.
"The Sinaloa economy's performance this year has been really very poor, we have to work hard to recover the ground we lost this year, in 2012 we have to double our efforts, we have to align everyone's efforts and most importantly the good already synchronized march of this new government team, hopefully next year will be much better", he said.
Economic sluggishness
Loredo López said events like the frosts of the beginning of the year have held back the state's economy and restricted its yield and growth.
"Low economic flow is the result of several events, including freezes, one of the main effects was a slow economy that does not turn fast enough to generate an economic dynamism that allows for an acceptable level of flow in processes, products and services and therefore, at the end of the year we close much lower than expected", he says.
Redefining vocation
For Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, President of the Patronal Confederation of the Mexican Republic of Sinaloa, we want to channel the state towards more dynamic productive activities.
"In general terms we have observed that we have worked, we believe it is necessary to develop a long-term programme that redefines the vocation and economic direction of the state, because it is important that we unlock the full potential of Sinaloa's material and human resources", he says.
A lot to do
The President of the Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a vision for the future that better channels the Government's efforts.
"Generally speaking, I would say that the Government has made efforts to deliver good results in various areas, in terms of economic development there is some progress, but it is important to develop a long-term programme", he said.
He pointed out that the current administration has made progress in the way public policy is managed.
"There are elements that allow us to say that the Government is more inclusive, and what I can say is that we have worked hard and the Government is aware that there is still much to be done", he says.
Convicted of eight pounds of marijuana
A resident of Novolato was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days in a fine for possession of eight kilograms of marijuana.
The Prosecutor General of the Republic has informed that the convicted minor trafficker is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, for health crime, in his possession of marijuana for sale.
According to the AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I file, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by Mexican Army officers on 7 June 2010 during a surveillance operation on Cipriano Valdez Street, outside number 80 in El Castillo, Navolato.
The small trafficker was driving a white pickup truck carrying a black bag in the trunk of the vehicle and a small backpack where the military found eight kilograms and 23 grams of marijuana.
For this reason, the confiscated items were made available to the Second District Judge and the convicted person is still in the Criminal Law Enforcement Center.
Debt on contributions to the works
The social projects covered by programmes such as Hábitat, Rescate de Espacios Públicos and 3x1 para migrantes may not be finished with serious delays due to lack of economic resources, Miguel Ángel López Miranda reported.
The Director of Municipal Social Development said that although the construction programmes have progressed so far, they are in a risky situation because the State Government has not fulfilled its obligations to offer contributions in excess of 11 million pesos in the three programmes.
He pointed out that the total investment of these three programmes is approximately 50 million pesos, of which the State must provide 25 percent and so far only the Federation and the Municipality have provided resources for the works, so there is a possibility of a delay in their completion.
"They have to provide a contribution of 12 million and despite the fact that the year is about to end they have given us nothing, even if since July they had to give us some of it", he said, "and we, to avoid delays, have started the works and we have made a lot of progress, but we need the money".
He mentioned that last year, during the administration of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the State had not paid the corresponding contributions, so at the beginning of the administration the Municipality had to apply for a credit to cover the 7 million that the State administration had not provided on that occasion.
"We had already experienced this in the previous six-year period because the State did not have the economic capacity to participate and the programmes continue to operate and this year we had to obtain the resources to cover what the State did not pay to be able to access these programmes", he explained.
Despite the fact that there is a commitment from the State authorities to provide these resources, he said that they had asked the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to activate the management so that the corresponding percentages arrive as soon as possible.
"They have to provide almost 12 million and despite the fact that the year is coming to an end, they have given us nothing".
Court approves "analog cut" in Mexico in 2015
The replacement of analogue signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has experienced in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) has dismissed the constitutional controversies that the Senate and House of Representatives have made against the presidential decree that advances the so-called "analog cut" from 2021 to 2015, as the eight votes needed to invalidate it have not been met.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón did not go beyond his powers when he issued the decree detailing the actions to be taken to make the transition to digital terrestrial television a reality.
As a result, the constitutional controversy brought forward by the Senate of the Republic was rejected for not having reached the qualified majority of eight votes for the Court to rule on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree, and this remains in force.
The draft sentence, drawn up by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed declaring the decree unconstitutional, because the regulation of radio and television is a law-abiding attribution to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in contravention of the principles of hierarchical subordination and reservation of law.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted in favour of the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies have promoted two constitutional controversies to challenge the decree and by admitting the complaints, Minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the implementation of the decree and all actions envisaged by it for the digital transition.
The plenary session of the ministers also decided to reject the complaint made by the Chamber of Deputies, without discussing the project, which is also the responsibility of Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his speech, the Prime Minister said that he did not agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the Federal Executive cannot structure measures for public administration to prepare through general standards.
"I also consider that doing so would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body", and he recalled that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector is the responsibility of the Federal Executive, which has the constitutional mandate of the State administration.
The replacement of analogue signals with digital signals is one of the most significant changes the world has undergone in recent years and this translates into better use of radio spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
He argued that postponing change would be postponing the benefits of digitalisation, which involves a decision of public interest that is not only technical, "because it also includes economic, social, political and national security issues".
These questions, he stressed, "require the operation of an entire system established, in accordance with the principle of economic management of the State, which includes a group of attributes which the Constitution grants to the power of the State Executive".
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world have already completed the digital transition and they have done so through the Executive, despite the fact that they have highly specialized technical bodies.
It cannot be concluded that the Executive, by issuing the contested decree, has invaded the sphere of competence of the Congress in any way, because it ensures compliance in the administrative sphere with laws issued by the Legislature, he said.
The possibility of a vote-by-vote counting is being analysed in Michoacán
According to the data highlighted by PREP, the difference between the first and second place in the election of the governor is only 27%, even without counting the votes corresponding to 879 of the 6 74 minutes.
The possibility of a vote-by-vote count is a reality in the Michoacán election process this year, where, according to data highlighted by the Preliminary Election Results Programme (PREP), the difference between first and second place in the governor's election is only 27%, even without counting the votes for 879 of the 6 74 minutes in total.
In this regard, the President of the General Council of the Electoral Institute of Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, on 9 November, the electoral body approved a series of guidelines to harmonize local standards with federal electoral reform.
It should be recalled that Michoacán did not approve his Political Constitution, State Electoral Code or Electoral Justice Act, while the State Congress approved the reforms shortly before the legal deadline for this election process to come into force and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel omitted its publication within the deadlines set by the State Official Gazette Act, arguing that he had some objections.
On November 9, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) resolved the constitutional controversy brought forward by the local Legislative Power and called the state's mandate to vote for constitutional reforms "invalid and illegal" because it had no right to "sanction or challenge them".
When asked about the possibility of a "vote by vote", María de los Ángeles Llanderal said that the approval of the relevant guidelines by the IEM General Council would allow the local electoral body to count the total and partial votes.
The partial counting of votes, of one or more electoral packages, may be either: the results of the minutes do not coincide; there is no voting minutes and the counting in the ballot box is not with the president of the ballot box; or there are obvious errors or alterations to the minutes.
In addition, the total number of votes received in all the ballots in the election may be counted where there is evidence that the difference between the alleged winner of the respective election and the candidate who obtained the second place in the election is equal to or less than one percentage point; provided that at the beginning of the session there is an express petition from the representative of the party and/or coalition who presented the second of the reported candidates.
The total number of votes may also be counted if at the end of the joint count the difference between the alleged winner and the second-place candidate is equal to or less than one percentage point, provided that there is an express petition from the representative of the political party whose candidate came second, in which case the electoral packages which were the subject of the partial counting will be excluded.
It is worth mentioning that this is the case in the election of Morelia, where according to the PREP, the difference between first and second place is only 0.16%, even without counting the votes of 129 of the 923 minutes in total.
His last will
His ashes will be scattered in the Zapaliname mountain range, the family confirmed.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés will arrive in his hometown of Saltillo this Sunday night, and on Monday people will pay their respects and there will be a requiem mass.
According to his family, the lieutenant colonel's last wish was that his ashes be scattered in the Zapalinamé mountain range.
After receiving the tributes alongside the others who died in the accident, the family of Bacio Cortés returned to the capital of Coahuila aboard a Mexican Air Force aircraft, the closest to the ceremony in Campo Marte.
At noon the ashes of the lieutenant colonel arrived at the vigil chapel on Nazario Ortiz Garza Boulevard, where family and friends visited.
At 5:30 p.m., he received a tribute to the Saltillo Institute of Technology organized by his former colleagues from the University of Technology and the American football team that included Felipe Bacio as he prepared for the bachelor's degree.
"He wanted to go back to Saltillo and have his ashes scattered in the Zapalinamé mountain range, he always said that `` to his family and friends", said Sandra Bacio Cortés, the pilot's sister.
She felt that the lieutenant colonel had fulfilled all her dreams, that he was at the peak of his life, "successful, an extraordinary father and son, a loving brother and caring family".
Felipe Bacio Cortés left Saltillo at a very young age to enroll in the Air College in Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some couldn't believe it, because they said he was even sick of a truck, but he always followed his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio recalls that he was a very good person, "when he was in Saltillo the whole family wanted to greet him, as was the occasion when he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo".
The young man even remembers that when he was seven years old he traveled to Zapopan for his relative's graduation, so he knows that his uncle died doing what he loved most in life: flying an airplane.
His last goodbye
With honours the Lieutenant Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Bacio Cortés, was greeted with a tribute by the people and the State Government, the Mexican Army, the Sixth Military Zone, the Mexican Air Force, the directors and students of the Saltillo Institute of Technology, where he studied in 1985 and distinguished himself in both studies and sport.
Bacio Cortés died recently when the helicopter he was piloting crashed, along with the government secretary, José Francisco Blake Mora, and six other people, all officials of the department.
The remains of Saltillo-born pilot Bacio Cortés arrived (incinerated) at 6:05 p.m. for the funeral of members of the Mexican Air Force, led by Major Jaime Martinez, on the group's splanade, where he was awaited by his family, including his daughter Amanda and wife Cristina, his mother, brothers and other parents, students and teachers.
Three abandoned bodies, located on Cadereyta NL property
Hours before they were found, the military authorities had presented to the media eleven people who had been arrested in the same municipality for organized crime.
Three men were found shot dead in different body parts and with the grain of salt in an abandoned property in the municipality of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The discovery took place 1.5 kilometers from Cadereyta to Santiago, in the community known as El Castillo.
A few people who passed by the place noticed that in the property, whose fence is beige and coffee-colored the gate was wide open.
Looking inside, about three meters away, they located the bodies of three people, so they immediately informed the relevant authorities.
One of the individuals was wearing a yellow T-shirt with black jeans, no shoes; next to him was another with a white T-shirt, with braces.
A meter away was the body of another individual wearing a red T-shirt and blue jeans.
All three of them were lying on their stomachs.
According to the data obtained in situ, the three people were murdered elsewhere because no in situ doubles were found.
In the fence of the property there were legends sent by an organized crime group to the other, except for a few bullet holes in it and in the gate.
11 captured in Cadereyta
The Secretary of National Defence introduced 11 persons, including a minor, who were part of a criminal group operating mainly in Cadereyta municipality and who are considered to be related to seizures, homicides, halconeo (surveillance) and clandestine burials.
According to published reports, in a first incident on November 11 in the colony of Los Alveros eight people were arrested and one who had been deprived of liberty was saved.
They confiscated three buildings and a cell phone, and they claimed to be part of a criminal group called "Los Zetas".
In another incident on November 12 at 06:00 military personnel made a surveillance tour of Rancho Viejo, Cadereyta, detecting a car without a license plate with two subjects on board.
Arresting them and conducting an inspection, the military found a long gun, a loader, and 18 cartridges.
Later and after these statements, on 13 November at 14:00 a.m. one of his accomplices was arrested in La Frauda, when he tried to escape by seeing the military.
They are credited with underground burials in the municipalities of General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
The new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday.
The Prime Minister-designate, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to present the new government that will face a crisis that has brought this country to the brink of economic disaster.
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the Italian President on Wednesday to present the new government that will deal with a crisis that has brought Italy to the brink of economic disaster and put the entire Eurozone at risk.
A statement from the presidential palace announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, will meet with President Giorgio Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm that he can form the government.
He is expected to introduce a cabinet composed of technocrat majorities, although it is unclear when the new executive will take office.
Monti said he would present the president with the results of his talks with political parties in his attempt to form a government.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase", the former European Commissioner told journalists.
Monti did not say explicitly that he could form a government, but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles were overcome.
"The frame is now well mapped", he added.
Monti completed the process to form a government in less than three days, in less than normal time, as Italy struggles with a political and financial crisis that has pushed its debt costs to unsustainable levels.
The new administration, led by former European Commissioner Monti, must approve a tough austerity package demanded by European leaders to restore the trust in Italy that had been affected.
The unstable market situation has put the yield of Italian BTP bonds above 7% over 10 years, the level at which Greece and Ireland have had to be saved.
Emma Marcegaglia, leader of Italian employer Confindustria, told the media after her meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government very much".
We believe this Government is the last opportunity for Italy to get out of this emergency situation.
Monti's chances of success were greatly boosted by the support of Silvio Berlusconi's PDL party, which was forced to resign last Saturday by the crisis.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts will have a good outcome", said Angelino Alfano, secretary of the centre-right party.
The support of the PDL, Italy's largest party, is significant because until now many of its members had opposed the technocratic majority government that Monti is forming.
Parliamentary support
The new Monti government needs strong parliamentary support to implement what are likely to be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blockage or delay in its efforts could lead to another devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks added to the pressure by noting that Monti's bankruptcy would be a disaster.
Monti began consultations with political parties, trade unions and employers' groups and youth and women's organisations on Monday.
He'll finish his meeting tour Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed on Sunday by Napolitano, who authorized an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief break at the end of last week, when it was clear that Berlusconi was going to resign, the costs of Italian debt have now returned to critical levels amid uncertainty about the success of the new prime minister.
To save Italy, with a public debt of 1.9 trillion euros, would be too much for the current financial defenses of the Eurozone.
Monti said his government should continue until the next elections, scheduled for 2013, despite widespread predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement reforms before the elections are held.
Monti said he would like politicians in his cabinet, but the major parties insist that it should be trained only by specialists, an indication of their objections to a process forced by financial pressure.
Political sources have reported that mutual mistrust and disagreements between the parties complicate the attempt to include political figures.
The Spanish are more experienced than the Costa Ricans
Of the 22 Spanish players, ten have played in more than 50 international matches.
In Costa Rica, only one of the 22 invited delegates attended 50 meetings.
A huge contrast to Costa Rica, if you compare the 22 summonses by both countries for today's friendly at 3:05 p.m. at the San José National Stadium.
While the national and European champions, the number one in the FIFA monthly rankings, have a large roster of Class A inter-sports matches, only the Tricolore has defender Michael Umana as the only one to have all 50 international matches.
This figure was reached last Friday in the match against Panama (0-2) over Rommel Fernández.
Spanish footballers who play in the Star League and in powerful clubs in the English Premier League, maintain an intense yearly activity in national league and cup competitions and European cup competitions such as the Champions League.
To all this we must add the experience with Furia Espanola during the complicated qualifiers of the European Cup and the World Cup.
Costa Rican footballers, on the other hand, have limited international experience in one area, such as the Concacaf, which is considered a lower level in FIFA.
We see that the greatest record in the Spanish national team is that of goalkeeper Íker Casillas, who on Saturday before against England (defensive 0-1 in London) tied the previous goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta's record, with 126 international matches.
Casillas will play against the Tricolore today and they will set a new record for Spain, 120 international games.
Xavi Hernández, the Barcelona brainwasher, has 106.
Casillas and Xavi were even recognised the week before by UEFA alongside the other centurions of the Iberian team, Zubizarreta mentioned above with 126 and the Schalke centre-back Raúl González with 102.
The 100th anniversary figure is Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
He is followed by Xabi Alonso, with [Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta, with 62; Cesc Fábregas, with 61 and David Silva, with 53.
On the Costa Rican side, and next to Michael Umana are left-handed Júnior Díaz, with 48 appearances and scorer Bryan Ruiz, with 45.
After that, only five have surpassed the 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36, and José Luis López with 35.
The least.
The few who have more than 30 presentations in Spain are Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side, with less than 30 appearances, Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest of it doesn't even get to 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar has only one and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson are still not in the starting lineup.
Spain's historic scorer is David Villa, with 50 flies, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the record holder, with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quinteto has included the country in its tour to celebrate two decades of trajectory
"Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true"
In the exclusive interview with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam said the band is ready to play one of their best shows next Sunday at the National Stadium.
They have waited more than 20 years, but the group says that for them it will also be a dream come true to happen in this country.
It's that bassist and founding member Jeff Ament made sure, speaking exclusively to Viva, Brazil, last week.
The band is on the South American leg of their two-decade-long tour and Sunday 20 will be their only stopover in Central America.
On that day, they will perform at the National Stadium, starting at 7:30 p.m., alongside the Los Angeles band The X and the Las Robertas Nationals.
This is an excerpt from the conversation, the full transcript of which can be found in La Nación on the Internet.
For his Costa Rican fans, the fact that Pearl Jam will perform in Costa Rica is a dream come true.
Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true for us too.
This is our second time in South and Central America and so far it's been great.
I've only been to Costa Rica once on vacation; it's such a beautiful country and I think we can spend a few days there.
So it's exciting to bring our music there.
I ask you, because there's a kind of devotion to the band, fans are living with intensity the previous days.
What is your message to your most zealous followers?
Thank you for staying by our side all these years.
It took us 21 years to get to Costa Rica, and thank you for waiting so long, and we're sorry that it took so long to get to that concert.
Some people already say his concert is the biggest show of the year.
Does that add a little pressure to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we've done in the last 21 years have been in the last two weeks.
We did two huge shows in Sao Paolo and we hope that it set us up for this concert in Costa Rica.
We're really looking forward to performing there.
We love this country, we love surfing and the jungle; for both reasons, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you discover Costa Rica and its waves for surfing?
We have a lot of surfer friends and I have a very good friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves are amazing there.
My friends used to go surfing in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, next to Mexico, is a great place to surf, and that's how we learned from surfers.
You saw the tour, you had huge shows, lots of songs.
What have you planned for your presentation in Costa Rica?
Since we have never been there, we have no restrictions on what we can do.
We'll try to do the best show possible, with a wide variety of songs; we'll try to perform two songs from each album and offer our fans a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
Why is that?
I think it's partly because we have nine records and we can play over 120 songs and everyone likes different songs, which is why it's very difficult to choose which songs to play every night.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we haven't played in a very long time, it helps us stay focused and surprises us because it reminds us why we loved those songs and we may have forgotten.
It makes the show more interesting to us and therefore I think it becomes more interesting to people as well.
With this tour, you're celebrating 20 years of trajectory.
Looking back, is it hard to believe everything you've accomplished?
Yes, I certainly do.
First of all, I think none of us ever imagined we'd be forming a great rock band, and the fact that we've been doing it for over 20 years makes it sound like a dream.
We keep telling about our blessings and the fact that we can continue to make music together is very emotional.
We love each other and we love creating music.
We're lucky to be going to places in the world we've always wanted to go.
Things couldn't have gone better for us.
What does it mean to you to have been a key part of the creation of the grunge?
It has always been an honor to be part of this group of great groups.
We're very close friends with the people at Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It's surprising when a movement comes out of a group of friends and is uncommon.
Occasionally, a group emerges from a city, but it's much more strange when five or ten groups emerge from the same city at the same time.
We're proud and honored to be part of the Seattle group.
We still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year we went to a festival with Alice in Chains and we went to Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on their tour, so we're lucky to still be friends with them all and it's an honor for us to be part of that Seattle sound that came out.
It's also very strange that a group like yours stayed together and with the same members for so long.
Yeah, four of us have been together for 21 years, and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, and only that's a lot longer than most groups normally do.
First, I believe we are all lucky to be alive and second, we all care about others.
We're all close friends and thanks to that there are musical boulevards that give everyone the freedom to experience.
We trust each other with everyone's music and it couldn't have been any better.
Your relationship with the word celebrity has not been easy, but thanks to your success, you have been able to do whatever you want.
How do you find a balance?
As we grew older, it was easier for us to find balance.
We make sure we don't spend too much time on tour because it's easy to fall into this game of huge crowds and people who love your music.
If we remember that people are there for music, it helps us remember that we have to respect music and what it brought, without thinking about the fact that we're famous and a rock star, which none of us really care about.
How do you remember your other project, Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote some good songs and at first it was great.
We were a band for almost three years and we didn't release a record until after Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
There's been a lot of frustration about the fact that it lasted so short and the most important thing is that we're still very close friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who started in the band with us and when I listen to a song or I see a photo I think about the amazing person Andy was and how he made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to work, laugh, talk about music, football and a lot of other things with him.
He was a surprising human being and we miss him.
The national group Las Robertas will open the show in Costa Rica.
It's true you know his work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose him for the opening?
Yeah, the production sent us videos with different proposals and that was the band we liked the most, so we're looking forward to seeing what Las Robertas can offer live and it must be very distracting.
Why do you always change the lyrics of Yello Ledbetter live?
This is a question for Ed, so I don't know.
He's singing it, and I think he's doing it with the first words he can think of.
As a bass player, what are his influences?
There are so many...
The first ones I remember are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C.J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There's so much influence, I could talk all afternoon about the bass players I love.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep grunge up despite the fact that it's out of fashion?
I think we all feel a little disconnected from the word grunge.
When I think about it, it reminds me of the bands I just mentioned, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the other bands that came out at the same time and, if that's relevant now, I think it's wonderful, because it's music that's worth listening to and bands like Mudhoney are now making the best music ever.
At first, his music had a darker content, but now it has become more positive.
Why this change?
It's interesting, because I think there are songs on the new album that sound lighter, but there are also songs like The End or Just Breathe that are classified as very dark songs, even if they can sound a little positive.
With them, when Ed played them for me, I cried when I listened to them, and these are deeply dark songs.
I think that when you grow up and there's a trauma in your life and you lose a relative or friend, those things start to influence your art and your music and these songs, no doubt, represent that to me.
I also think that you can be happy and even that way you can make dark music.
The following is the list of countries:
Fujimori hospitalized again for medical examinations
Former president Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized on Tuesday in a public hospital to be evaluated for the loss of muscle strength he exhibits in his feet, his family doctor informed.
Fujimori, 72, who is serving a 25-year prison sentence for human rights violations committed during his government (1990-2000), suffers from various conditions, including tongue cancer for which he has undergone four operations and is under control.
Congressman Alejandro Aguinaga, his personal physician, told TV channel N that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the cause of the pain and loss of strength in his lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that in his opinion Fujimori would be a candidate for the benefit of the pardon for humanitarian reasons, doubtless, he said he did not want it because he felt innocent.
He has undergone four operations for tongue cancer, has lost 18 pounds in weight, and other conditions, such as severe erosive gastritis, pancreatic cyst, kidney stones, high blood pressure, and circulatory problems in the feet, the doctor listed.
Fujimori has been detained since September 2007 in the National Police Directorate of Special Operations.
In April 2009 he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the deaths of 25 people because of an army annihilation squad that operated clandestinely during the first years of his government.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official procession, led by Uruguayan President José Mujica and composed of various ministers and bosses, will begin a visit to Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two nations and address political issues in the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with his Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderón, the high point of a long agenda of meetings with political, commercial authorities and a meeting with the community of Uruguayan residents in Mexico, according to the agenda released by the Uruguayan Presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara will be "beneficial for the exchange of information on political affairs between the two nations", according to the information published by the South American country's presidency on its website.
According to local media, Mujica is trying to convince Calderón to support Uruguay in the incident with France that took place when French envoy Nicolas Sarkozy included the South American country in the list of tax havens at the G20 meeting in Cannes, France.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude countries that remain tax havens from the international community, a statement that prompted Uruguay's rejection and the call for consultations from its European ambassador.
Mexico has been the chairman of the G20 since November, a group of the world's strongest emerging and developed countries, and has been in force since January this year with the South American country a treaty to exchange tax information to avoid double taxation.
The Uruguay Round has been trying in recent years to accelerate the implementation of tax exchange agreements to move out of the OECD's "grey list", which includes countries that do not implement all international standards for tax cooperation.
In terms of trade, Mexico and Uruguay have been in force since 2004 under the Free Trade Agreement (FTA), which increased trade in goods between the two nations.
The mustachioed plumber moves to three dimensions with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has fought tirelessly for 25 years to save Princess Peach from the clutches of the evil Bowser, but he's never done it in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the love of the young girl in stereoscopic technology.
The title, which is coming to stores around the world this month, was designed from the start to take advantage of the features of the Nintendo 3DS mobile console, which allows you to play in three dimensions without using glasses.
"Mario is the character who has to tell how to operate the glasses-free stereoscopy", said Nintendo's Spain press officer Omar Álvarez during the video game's presentation in Madrid.
Álvarez stated that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "Nintendo's first video game originally designed for this medium", as so far hits like "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of existing titles.
Nintendo's spokesman argued that despite being in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is an "accessible" video game that allows for fast and smooth play.
Álvarez claimed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" to hang less skilled users.
Once overcome, the most skilled will be able to make a "second round" at the game levels, which this time are more difficult.
In addition, users will be able to choose in real time between an aggressive D or one that only affects the depth of action, but it would be necessary to play in three dimensions to overcome the different challenges and "not succumb to optical illusions".
This invasion of Super Mario in three dimensions also involves the character returning to a mobile console, a fact that has not happened since 2005.
In these video games Nintendo nods to the fans of the saga and repeats the success formula of previous games, which is that the mustachioed plumber must navigate dangerously mined platforms to free Princess Peach.
Even though I'm a player, I find new moves, environments, costumes and enemies and also in the case of Luigi "playful".
Colom supports the extradition of Portillo to the United States
President Álvaro Colom announced last Tuesday that he had ordered the extradition of former governor Alfonso Portillo to answer to the United States for conspiracy to launder US$70 million.
The trial ends so that Guatemala can respond to the request of the northern country to have Portillo tried there.
At a press conference, Colom said his decision respected the independence of the judiciary and executive, taking into account the fact that a court of first instance had already ordered his extradition.
He claimed that during his term "he had not helped" in any court resolution and had conducted all the extraditions he had known.
Apart from Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will also be extradited for murder and serious injuries, and Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes will be extradited for drug trafficking.
What Colom did involves an executive step after exhausting all the judicial and constitutional bodies to try the former 2004-04 deputy.
According to the resolutions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo should be extradited after he has resolved his legal situation in Guatemala and after he has guaranteed his human rights.
Portillo was acquitted of embezzling Q120 million from the Ministry of Defence when he was president, which was the trial leading up to the extradition, but the Public Ministry appealed and reactivated the case.
Trinijove has helped 6,000 young people in danger
The entity was created to prevent the marginalization of uneducated youth
The first 25 years of life of the Trinijove social support organisation are important: 6,000 young people at risk of exclusion have been helped to overcome a difficult situation during this quarter of a century.
In addition, the long 100 years of employment currently obtained by this social group.
The anniversary was marked yesterday by a celebration at the former Fabra i Coats industrial complex, attended by over 300 people.
Trinijove was born in the Trinitat Vella neighborhood in 1986 with the aim of helping people with low education, unemployment, drug addiction and marginalized problems.
The celebration in Sant Andreu yesterday brought together a large number of heads of entities and institutions who have worked with the association for the past 25 years.
The varied political representation in the middle of the election season showed the unity of Trinijove's work.
Alongside the President of the Catalan Regional Government (Generalitat), Artur Mas and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, the former Minister of Socialist Education, Ernest Maragall and the former Deputy Mayor of the City and current Eco-Socialist City Councillor Ricard Goma, attended the event.
The current Minister of Social Welfare and Family Josep Lluís Cleries and the Director General of the charity La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa, also attended the large hall of Fabra i Coats.
Mr Mas said that Trinijove was born in a very difficult time and that the current one is also, but he added that the work done so far "is a good foundation".
The President gave Trinijove an example of how to cope with bad circumstances and give hope to people in difficulty.
"The crisis is not new to the entity and to the work it is doing", he said.
Property invaded by micro-party squatters, evacuated
The invaders had seized 11 of the 13 apartments in the building, in Balmes, 51
The 12 occupants left the property at noon yesterday without any resistance.
Everything seems to indicate that the nightmare that the residents of 51 Balmes Street were living has ended.
Twelve people voluntarily left the building they were illegally occupying at noon yesterday, where they were holding micro parties that desperately despaired the neighbors, by court order and without the need for police intervention.
At the end of the operation, the lock on the door was changed to prevent a repeat.
"From this day onwards there will be access control", the administrator said.
The squatters, who had invaded 11 of the 13 apartments in the building - the rest were occupied - took away the electrical and some water installations, painting the walls and leaving any kind of residue, especially cans of alcohol.
The first three apartments were the scene of mass parties, which lasted for up to two days and desperately disappointed the tenants.
Next to the building is a nightclub, Balmes 51, which was also affected.
Its owner, Maria Pantinat, told Europa Press that since the building was occupied, her business has declined by 80 percent.
The owner of the club said that the invaders were unfairly competent, selling the glasses for three euros, while in the club they were worth 10.
In addition, the owner of the leisure venue had to respond to neighbors' complaints about the noise, while according to her, the trouble was not caused by the club's guests but by the occupants of the house and especially the participants in the parties held there, which were more frequent and intense in recent weeks, according to the angry neighbors of the area.
The manager of the club explained that the trouble was so great that she even reached an agreement with the building owner and that he has been "forgiving" her rent for nine months.
The Guardia Urbana (municipal police) also confirmed that in recent weeks they had received more complaints from neighbors about the situation.
The president of the municipal group of the PP of the municipality, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had called last week for "immediate evacuation of the building to end the problems of common life and civic life that it caused to the residents and the degradation of the area".
The popular leader explained that before the summer only one floor of the building was occupied, but in the last few months the squatters had occupied every floor of the building and almost every apartment and that in some apartments there were also thefts.
In this sense, he added, "impunity must be ended and the anti-social behaviour generated in property must be relentless".
Yesterday, the Mossos (Catalan local police) evacuated a building in Nou Barris.
At 3.30 p.m., police moved to 35 Rue Mont-ral, after receiving a call from a neighbor who observed four people entering the building.
All four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountain?
Architects agree on the appropriateness of the summit beyond the fee controversy
The municipal competition for the 16 gates opens up the debate on Collserola's role in Barcelona
In the mid-1980s, at the height of the already defunct Barcelona Metropolitan Corporation (CMB), this Administration printed posters promoting Collserola.
The brochure described the mountain as the great park of the Barcelona metropolitan area.
It also contained a comparison, in numbers, with Central Park in New York.
With the death of the CMB in 1987, the park became again, in the imagination of many people, the upper limit of Barcelona, the Catalan capital being the only one not oriented on the north-south axis, if not high (mountain) - low (sea).
The designation of Collserola as a natural park is in favour of this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park but Yellowstone, with wild boars playing the role of the Yogi Bear.
This was the case until, in September, the city council convened a mega-competition consisting of 16 contests for all the entrances to Collserola.
A door reminds me of a park, no doubt.
That's it, or someone wants to put doors in the field.
The question arises: Collserola: park or mountain?
The competition, both in terms of its organisation and in terms of thinking about the city, is a topic of conversation for all Barcelona architects.
It's almost a recurring theme that two members of this ancient elite caste talk about when they recognize each other in an elevator.
And this is one of the few opinions that three Barcelona architects, university professors, have shared.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the competition is timely.
For Roldán, after addressing the coastal front, "it is necessary" to debate on the "mountain front" because Ildefons Cerda's speech on green building blocks was not completed.
"We have to start from the bottom that the largest park in Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things, its great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex", the architect, who described the "Collserola gates" as a "lexic trap", said in the verdict.
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with experience in the urban planning world, calls the proposal an "intellectual challenge" with "some dangers".
The dangers arising from the "uncertainty of the projection of public space" following the experience of the 1980s, which had its "swings singing" in the Forum area.
The first fear is the very definition of the boundaries on which one can build.
"To limit something is to set the next step", that is, to go beyond it.
"We need to think about new urban planning and planning instruments, because the current ones [in reference to the Metropolitan General Plan (MGP) ] can cause real disasters".
Modol, in his opinion, is more concerned with the question and says that, in a simplified way, the slope of the Collserola valley "can be heard as a park, but Barcelona's is not".
Modol recalls that there is already work being done by the Collserola Patronate which "should not be lost", thanking the town hall for the opportunity it offers its corporation to intervene in this project "from the very beginning".
He also believes that the proximity of the mountain to the city is the only way for architects to enter the debate, but doubts whether this technical profile should guide the multidisciplinary teams ("a success", he says) that have been created: "We architects should be just an instrument".
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question that gives the title to this piece is complex, because the basis of the competition lacks a comprehensive vision of Collserola: "16 cross-sectional competitions have been called - he says - in the mountain-sea direction, but there is no longitudinal reading that sees and understands the area as a whole".
This means, at least in this case, that he has chosen to participate in all 16 competitions.
In other words, a design so that one of the doors can collide in the program and definition with that of the architect of the next door.
In its opinion, yes, the municipality should ensure that the immediately higher band than that of Ronda de Dalt should provide, throughout its extension, with an area of equipment that makes a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgives Jonas Larrazábal and he will be released
After 72 days of provisional arrest, the legal power of Casino Red granted pardon to the brother of the mayor of Monterrey for the prosecution of him for alleged blackmail
After 72 years in prison, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal will be released after the founder of the legal power of Casino Red granted him amnesty in the Second District Criminal Court, which follows a trial for blackmail against the brother of the mayor of Monterrey.
After the Casino Royale bombing, the owner of the Casino Red, Sergio Gil García, posted a series of photos and videos in which Manuel Jonás allegedly demanded that he pay an economic quota for the mayor of Monterrey to allow the clandestine operation of the casino.
After the public denunciation, the Prosecutor's Office opened a criminal case against the brother of Mayor PANiste and on 2 September he was arrested and held in provisional detention for 30 days.
After four hours before the Public Ministry 3 Crime Agent, he was transferred to Detention Center 1, located in the Old Quarter of the state capital.
He remained there for the next 49 days when he was given a second arrest warrant after the Public Ministry official denounced the corruption and organized crime.
On 19 October he was transferred to the Cadereyta Criminal Center allegedly for blackmailing the owners of the Red Casino with a million and a half pesos; but he spent only a few hours in the medium-security detention centre because there were death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to continue the trial in the municipal cells of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On October 25, an arrest warrant was issued by the Clerk of the Second District Criminal Court, Jorge Yánez, who said that after nearly two months of investigation there was enough confirmed evidence to determine Jonás' guilt, such as that relating to the collection of 1.5 million pesos from representatives of the gambling house in exchange for allowing it to operate.
On Monday, the founder of the legal authority of Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, appeared before judge José Luis Pecina to ask forgiveness for the brother of the mayor of the area, so he could regain his freedom within the next few hours.
During the legal proceedings, the Public Ministry official attached to the Tribunal, Ramiro Arias, questioned García Gómez whether the damage had been recovered and which of the partners of the gambling house had granted the pardon, but the lawyer tried not to disclose the name.
Under case 197/2011 Jonas Larrazábal is granted legal remission and thereafter no claim can be made in relation to the trial against him; no compensation for damages or punishment will be demanded from him.
After the hearing of the founder of the legal authority of the gambling house, at 15:50 Larrazabal Bretón was ordered to be released immediately.
The court clerk, Jorge Yánez, went to the San Nicolás de los Garza municipality prison to inform Jonás that he had been legally pardoned and his case would be closed.
The court will also inform the person of the immediate release order issued by the judge.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome gives details of the plane crash in which the government secretary, Francisco Blake and seven other people lost their lives
The Secretariat for Communications and Transport (SCT) reported that the results highlighted in the accident in which the government secretary, Francisco Blake Mora and seven other people lost their lives, indicate that the helicopter hit the ground directly in full structural integrity, without the pilot being able to attempt a forced landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transport, mentioned that before the aircraft took off, the pilot found that the weather conditions were adequate for the flight.
"Elements that seem to indicate that the unit had various contact with the ground, the blades came into contact with trees 25 meters away where the unit lost its fuselage".
He also informed that the unit was designed for 19 persons, so it met the requirements for transporting personnel.
He also said that the investigation in the impact zone did not report any debris on the ground.
"In one study, there were no reports of aircraft parts or components elsewhere, and the impact was structural.
"The helicopter was designed for 19 passengers and met the requirements for transportation.
The ground was tilted seven to 30 degrees.
The secretary said that the priority was to get results as soon as possible, but the investigation could take a few months, even a year.
Gilberto López Meyer, Director General of Airports and Auxiliary Services, said that at the time of the impact, the President's helicopter was operating at cruising speed and it was on a smooth upward ground.
"This information supports the hypothesis of normal cruising operation at the time of impact", he says.
During the press conference, the head of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, listed six important elements in the investigation:
The visual flight:
According to the aeronautical regulations, the flight was carried out according to visual flight rules, which implies that the crew must have visibility during the flight and on the ground.
Weather conditions:
The reports in the AICM mentioned adequate conditions for takeoff, and as the aircraft moved towards the border area between DF and the State of Mexico there were layers of low-altitude fog.
Routes selected:
It is likely that the misty conditions caused the crew to seek a lower altitude area and greater visibility into the Cuernavaca Valley.
Location of impact.
The impact coordinates and the last radar recording of the aircraft coincide, probably before the impact there was no loss of control or alteration of flight path.
Dispersion of aircraft remains in a restricted area:
The information available so far suggests that the impact took place on a straight and lateral trajectory.
The scattering pattern of the aircraft's remains suggests that the helicopter struck the ground under structural integrity conditions.
No trace of fire or explosion was detected.
At the scene of the accident there is still no trace in the remains of the aircraft of any kind of explosion or fire.
The latest results of the investigation indicate that the aircraft had multiple contact with the ground.
During fieldwork, aircraft parts were found at an altitude of 9,200 feet above mean sea level, with the ground sloping seven degrees to an inclination of 30 degrees.
The photographs show the sequence in which he may have disarticulated along the way.
The information provides evidence that appears to indicate that the helicopter may have had multiple impacts with the ground.
After careful searching of a wider area than the surrounding area around the crash, no scattered parts of the aircraft were found, supporting the presumption that the impact took place under structural integrity conditions.
MSS announces protocol to find the obesity gene
Social Security is conducting an investigation to find the gene for obesity in children and young people, supported by specialists from the NIP
The Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) has announced that it is conducting an investigation to discover the gene for obesity in children and young people, called the 'Children and Adolescents' Obesity Genetics Protocol' which will allow for the markers associated with being overweight.
In a statement, Miguel Cruz López, head of the Medical Research Unit in Biochemistry at the Hospital of Speciality of the 20th Century National Medical Center, explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers had been formed.
This team is supported by specialists and postgraduate students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Centre for Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
The survey is open to all persons with or without a right to attend the participating sports units of the IMSS in Valle de México, where the tests are held every Saturday from 8:00 a.m.
He stressed that the protocol had started in the Cuauhtémoc Sports Unit (Estado de México Poniente) and that from 8 October the activity will be held in the Nezahualcóyolt Sports Unit (Estado de México Oriente).
After the goal of bringing together 500 or 600 minors is reached, the study will continue in the Sports Unit Independencia (south of the Federal District) and finally in the Morelos Sports Unit (north of the Federal District).
He explained that the aim of this research was to understand the components and importance of genetics in the development of obesity and to identify risk factors for preventing the onset of chronic degenerative diseases in Mexican children and young people.
As World Diabetes Day is being celebrated on 14 November, he said the goal is to bring together 3,000 children and young people aged six to 14 years, with the consent and supervision of their parents, for the application of specific dietary questionnaires.
They will also be asked about their physical activity and their family history of inherited diseases, to avoid risk factors that trigger conditions such as diabetes or kidney failure.
He detailed that on Saturdays anthropometric measurements (weight, height, waist circumference), blood pressure, glucose, triglyceride, cholesterol and insulin levels and genetics (identifying people associated with childhood obesity) would be applied to all participants.
Cruz López reported that this investigation is the result of concerns from health professionals about the alarming weight gain in the case of minors.
'Health surveys in 1999 and 2006 have shown that in just six years there has been a 77 percent increase in obesity among boys and 47 percent among girls; there has also been a dramatic increase in overweight,' the IMSS expert noted.
He said the justification for the search for markers was based on the fact that the country's population is different from others by its genetic history.
He reported that on average, Mexicans are 65 percent Indo-American, 30 percent European and five percent African, and this condition is reflected in people associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that the genetic cause of obesity is generally the inability to burn the excess energy (calories) consumed, which is broken down into fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for the participants was the full assessment of the children, which allows to detect whether they were overweight or obese.
Ila even says that the presence of dark-colored folds (acanthosis) on the neck and forearm indicates the likelihood of metabolic changes and even pre-diabetes.
The information is handled in a confidential manner, and doctors write it down to parents, who are briefed on the measures and lifestyle changes they must take to prevent disease.
Cruz López explained that there are three main causes of overweight, obesity, and other chronic conditions: sedentary behavior, which is the lack of daily physical activity, sitting in front of the TV most of the day, and using transportation instead of walking short distances.
Another cause is high calorie intake, i.e. higher consumption of sugary drinks, carbohydrates (tamales - meat and maize flour paste wrapped in corn leaves, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with high fat and protein content and genetics analysed in this protocol.
The asphalt of the UNAM would prevent the chassis
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry at UNAM, develops asphalt modified with polymers to produce a mixture with better yields, regardless of environmental conditions and temperature
If the signals that the pavement was fixed, there would be no need to repair about 200 thousand cascades each rainy season in the Valle de México Metropolitan Area, warned Rafael Herrera Nájera, a researcher at UNAM's Faculty of Chemistry (FQ), who assured that if the process of building and maintaining the oil pavement is adequate, the cascades could be reduced or even eliminated completely.
During his conference A Technological Opinion on Chassis, organized as part of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory he was responsible for is developing asphalt modified with polymers to produce a mixture with similar properties to asphalt, but with greater mechanical strength at both high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera estimated that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places where the climate is extremely hot, such as some northern cities, to improve yields and, consequently, the formation of chassis.
He explained that asphalt, the heaviest part of oil, is a set of hydrocarbon molecules, molecules with a heavier molecular weight, called asphaltenes, and molecules with a low molecular weight, called malthenes, which together give the stone its characteristic viscoelastic behavior.
The viscoelastic behaviour of asphalt is that at high temperatures, almost 180 degrees, it behaves like a liquid, at 120 degrees C its viscosity is very high and at 50 degrees C it has an almost solid state, while at very low temperatures the asphalt becomes brittle, he added.
This means that the resistance of asphalt in the streets is not uniform and changes during the day depending on environmental conditions and temperature, warns the chemical engineer.
The FQ researcher observed that the streets of Ciudad de México were mostly covered with flexible paving, made up of six layers of material, the last three of which involve asphalt.
Among the more superficial layers is the asphalt layer, formed by small stones bathed in asphalt and later compacted.
Each of the small stones that make up the layer, he reported, is bathed in asphalt.
When vehicles pass through it by generating effort, it allows the forces to spread very well through the pavement.
If the asphalt had been modified, it would have spread better, the chemical engineer said.
And they put on the asphalt a layer, which is called a rolling layer, of fine stone, that is, of sand that is also washed with asphalt.
As this is the layer in contact with the wheels of vehicles, it must have more mechanical strength than the asphalt layer and provide adhesion in the street.
As the part of the pavement that receives and distributes the effort, the rolling layer also requires that it be of adequate thickness and that the material from which it is made be treated.
Climate, especially humidity and temperature variations, are also very important factors to consider, especially water, he says, as they have a significant impact on the yield of the asphalt layer.
When the soil gets wet, the water spreads inside the layer and it is difficult for it to come out, which softenes all the layers of the pavement and therefore causes the casings.
In the process of shaping a chassis, he says, the first thing that gets messed up is the rolling film and only later is the asphalt layer affected, but the damage does not take place immediately, but it is a process that must be treated at first signals with adequate maintenance programs.
The National System of Researchers member explained that vehicle load is another important factor for chassis formation and therefore the thickness of each layer of pavement must always be linked to vehicle load and ensure its satisfaction, to avoid frequent chassis formation.
Rafael Herrera warned that there is still much to be done to investigate and work on asphalt, for example, bituminous emulsions, which in other countries already exist on the market and allow for easy repair of the chassis without the need for high temperatures.
What did Valle's nominee miss to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that prevented Melina Ramírez Serna from winning the Miss Colombia crown.
Valle receives her title number 14 as Princess.
Once again Valle del Cauca remained with the desire to win the crown of Miss Colombia.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to settle for being on the podium of the winners, wearing the silver crown and the ribbon that credits her as the new Princess of Colombia.
With the result obtained last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico rode with the crown and sceptre, the department has already summed 14 titles of Princess and Melina to a legion of Valle del Cauca women who found themselves near the crown but were proclaimed princesses, including Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Gcés Aljure (2000), Giselle Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
The big question many people ask themselves today is:
Because the result represents the defeat of a big favorite who in every show proved that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia, because she had not been elected to the police queen and Vogue's Best Face, titles won by the Queen Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro who took the crown of Miss Colombia.
The first factor considered key in the jury's decision to appoint her First Princess was the fact that she was not convinced by her answer to the question "What book marked you and why?" by Martín Murillo Gómez of Carreta Literaria Leamos.
Here is the answer from the candidate from Valle to this question:
"I read a lot, I believe enough in literature, I believe it's a form of culturalisation, definitely I believe the book that marked my childhood is "The Little Prince", it's a pretty deep book.
Now I read Crime and Punishment, a book of universal literature that we should all read; and now I read the book of Irena Nemirovsky, a Russian woman, a very beautiful book called The Burning of Blood".
This response was not pleasing, firstly because of the term "culturalisation" and secondly because it did not explain in detail how each of the books cited had marked it.
But at the end of the ceremony Melina said she felt calm and happy with the result "the universe and wisdom is happening what has to happen.
And for everyone, please read a little, "The Little Prince" is a great book".
Among the hypotheses raised is that Valle was destroyed by favoritism.
A Bogota journalist suggested that being the favorite, ovation-driven and the candidate who received all the preliminary awards (Oster's gastronomy challenge, the public vote for the best artisan costume, and Queen Mother), "was a source of jealousy among other candidates, stressed the queen and therefore did not shine on stage".
And we noticed that in his first swimsuit presentation at Hilton Beach and his two parades the day before the coronation.
Although she had appeared confident in herself at both parades, she was noted as lacking in strength and energy as the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico.
Ariel Osorio, a reporter for the "Como en casa" program on CNR, said that Melina's designation as a princess "confirms that the candidate who gets the most prizes during the competition does not receive the queen's crown".
Besides, Valle avoided the press at the end, and that was a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury of his interest in social initiatives, which is actually the essence of the National Beauty Contest.
That is why two days before the election the international jury Lucy Doughty said they were looking for a woman committed to the social needs of her country.
"Only beauty is not enough in a Miss Colombia, you have to look beyond physics and focus on your social sensitivity, whether you are already involved in projects before the Contest begins", she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle sinned because of his back defects and fibrosis that was observed in his abdomen, but this is contradictory, as it is precisely the jury who chose him as the 'Natural Beauty' candidate with healthier body, good diet and responsible physical work.
The queen's cook Jorge Hernán Orozco admits that Melina did not have the best body, that there were better ones, "but her abdominal fibrosis problem, which in fact had not been too well known to me, left her with points on the last day".
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos of the journal Cromos considers Valle's candidate's mistake to have been the surgical procedures she underwent.
"The surgeries are good, but Valle didn't know how to do them.
Her body was never her asset and she lost because of that aspect".
For this award, which the National Beauty Contest presents for the first time, after the swimsuit parade a cruel prediction came true last night, it was said that it was a small gift Raymundo was giving Melina to not give her the taste of the crown.
Reality or not, the truth is that Melina is starting a year of reign today, not as a sovereign, but as a princess, a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in an international competition by designation of the National Contest.
However, she will go down in history as one of the queens who, despite her dazzling passage through Cartagena, did not receive the crown.
So was the work of the Cali person who identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A Cali typist has gone down in history as the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these civil servants is crucial.
On November 4, a CTI tactyloscopist from Cali made history as the person who confirmed the identity of the supreme FARC leader, "Alfonso Cano", by comparing his fingerprints.
Of the seven fingerprint scanners working in the local offices of the CTI, this week was the turn of "availability" for Eliazar González, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been working in the field of forensic investigation for 21 years.
Early in his career, González worked in the municipalities of Chocó, where he often spent more than five days in the forest to reach the location of the bodies to be identified.
In 2000 he moved to the capital city of Valle and after completing his studies, he specialized in scanning the skin of the palms and soles of the feet.
During the week of the operation against the alias Alfonso Cano, Eliazar was warned to take clothes with him for at least three days.
Something very big was waiting for him.
On Friday night he left for Cauca in a helicopter from Palmira.
He knew that he had to identify two bodies and that one of them was suspected to be that of the man who led the world's oldest guerrilla group, so he was asked to take the map with the ten fingerprints of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
But when he arrived with the investigation team at the body, he didn't recognize it by its physical appearance, because it was very different from what he had seen in the media.
He had no beard, he was dressed like a local peasant, no glasses and much leaner.
But the prints don't lie.
Accompanied by a Gallows' magnifying glass, ink, a puller, and a lantern, Eliazar compared the body's fingerprints to those on the map.
His eye did not deceive him: it was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night, the man from Puerto Tejada was the official who confirmed to Defense Minister Juan Carlos Pinzón that yes, he was the supreme leader of the FARC.
Searching for the Footprint
For a typist in Sijín de Cali, the recognition that President Juan Manuel Santos gave to Eliazar González at a press conference for the operation against "Cano" is very significant.
A lot of people don't know what we do.
Daktyloscopy is an exact science, without margin of error, which can be crucial in solving crimes.
In addition to identifying the bodies, the scanner supports investigations into crimes such as theft and murder and confirms the identity of those captured.
When caught, many offenders present fake ID cards or have no documents.
We take their fingerprints and look them up in the database.
The researcher said that in a case of theft he had to remove a part of the wall of a house because the thief had held his hand to get out a safe full of jewelry and money.
"The walls are difficult because they are not enough surfaces to get a fingerprint from, but in this case we were able to get the fingerprint of the whole hand and identify the offender who had been involved in various robberies", he recalls.
The prints can also dismiss or confirm suspects in homicide cases.
A man was recently found dead, with bottles of liquor around him.
The investigation concluded that a relative may be suspected of the crime and that a fingerprint on the bottle was a coincidence.
Even if that doesn't guarantee he's the killer, it puts him at the crime scene.
A CT scanner explained that "fingerprints are extracted from objects with chemical or physical reagents".
When they appear, a strip or a strip is used to remove them.
Later, the prints are sent to Asif, the database of the offenders, or to the National Civil Registry.
"The problem is that there are still many undocumented Colombians", said the CTI expert.
He explained that not everything is as shown on the CSI television program.
Just as not everything shiny is gold, not everything touched becomes a fingerprint.
However, it can be used if the necessary confrontation is achieved.
The "outraged" challenge the authorities in New York
Hundreds of protesters were rallying outside Zuccotti Square to camp there.
Many of the people agreed to the evacuation order and moved to a nearby park.
The Occupy Wall Street movement's members challenged the New York authorities on Tuesday by trying to re-enter, through a court order, the Manhattan Square, from where they were evacuated at dawn and when they tried to occupy another park in the Big Apple.
Hundreds of protesters were rushing out of Zuccotti Square, where they wanted access through a court order that allows the 'indignant' to camp there again, while the other side of the movement responded to the evacuation by occupying a park further north of the city, where there were new arrests.
"Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp in the square again, we will move to another place and we will continue the legal fight to return to Zuccotti, and through sit-ins and peaceful protests", said Mark Bray, a spokesman for the Occupy Wall Street movement.
Bray detailed that the response of the 'indignant' to the evacuation of their camp, personally dictated by New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, reached the courts, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order banning forced evacuation and allowing protesters to remain in the camp.
In addition, the "outraged" occupied a new park at the confluence of Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, owned by Trinity Church Parish.
For at least an hour they managed to occupy the place, but afterwards the police moved in and arrested some protesters, although Bray could not confirm the actual number, assuring Efe that he saw some journalists who had also been handcuffed.
The organization says that hundreds of people had settled in the area, where a delegation of religious leaders moved in support of the movement members and tried to intervene in their behalf before the police.
Meanwhile, Zuccotti Square - a privately owned enclosure - remains closed pending a court hearing scheduled for Tuesday to examine the legality of the morning's evacuation.
Some displaced protesters carried and distributed copies of the court order at the time and even handed it over to the police officers guarding the square, which caused 'some small clashes,' Bray said, who denounced the fact that some officials beat the protesters.
The court order forbids the authorities to evacuate members of Occupy Wall Street or to enforce 'laws issued after the occupation began or to prohibit protesters from re-entering the park with tents or other property they used before'.
Mayor Bloomberg told reporters that the city had suspended the reopening of the space to the public and protesters because of the court order, but warned them that local laws do not allow them to settle in tents and sleeping bags.
The city councillor personally defended the early morning evacuation in Zuccotti Square, an operation in which 200 people were arrested and decided because the protesters were 'violating the law'.
Bloomberg explained that he had ordered the place to be evacuated because it was becoming "a place where people did not come to protest but to break the laws and in some cases to hurt others", because "some shops had been threatened" and residents were afraid "for their quality of life".
"The morning evacuation was disgusting and shows that Bloomberg is more interested in defending financial interests than the interests of American workers", the movement's spokesman added, accusing the mayor of "failing to respect freedom of expression".
Occupy Wall Street officials also said they did not plan to hold "big events" on Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and unions to commemorate the two months of protests, which began on 17 September.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary on a Christmas special.
Alongside Michael Bublé and other famous Canadians, she will appear on the television show "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1.
Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant on "Home Improvement", a backup on "Baywatch", a rabbit on "Playboy", the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary on a Canadian television Christmas special.
Private TV channel CTV announced today that Anderson, alongside crooner Michael Bublé and other famous Canadians, will appear on the television program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1st playing a very special Virgin Mary.
CTV today distributed footage of the television show in which Anderson, also known for the widespread Internet distribution of a private pornographic video in which she appeared with her then-husband, "Mötley Crüe" drummer Tommy Lee, appears dressed as the Virgin Mary holding a doll that represents Jesus in a manger.
In the scene, Peters, a famous Canadian comedian of Indian origin who recently presented a segment of Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth", appears as Joseph.
Alongside Anderson and Peters, CTV's Christmas special also features Canadian singer Bublé, who in late March married Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires, and who is not far from the controversy himself.
Recently, Bublé called American Kim Kardashian 'bitch' during one of his concerts in New York.
Japan is reborn after the earthquake
GDP rises by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends the downward spiral of early March
Since March, Japan's economy has been crippled, recovering even after the devastating earthquake that turned into the nuclear crisis, the worst disaster in Japan since World War II.
Tokyo government estimates of the initial material loss were $300,000,000, a blow that, despite the difficult global environment, seems to have eased.
After three consecutive quarters of declines, GDP data from July to September served to turn the page: GDP rose 1.5% from the previous quarter and 6% at the annualized rate.
The second quarter - for the Japanese, the fiscal year begins in March 2012 - also represents the largest increase since January to March 2010.
The recovery is partly due to the resumption of the acquisition of equipment to restore the areas devastated by the earthquake and the post-tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1%, compared with a decrease of 0.9% in capital expenditure from January to March, the first decrease after six months of uninterrupted growth.
However, the real stimulus of the Japanese economy is not based solely on the Keynesian impulse to take advantage of the crisis to consolidate - or rebuild - infrastructure, to use shortfalls to grow from scratch.
Japan has been awakening mainly because of the evolution of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japan's GDP.
This variable increased by 1%, driven by increased spending on vehicles, travel and entertainment.
The stigma of the yen
Tokyo returned to the domestic market when the yen - the Japanese currency - became one of the "refuge values" chosen by investors fleeing the eurozone debt crisis and the uncertain forecasts of the United States, a privilege that weighs like a slab in the accounts of exporting companies.
With a stronger currency, products are more expensive abroad, a serious setback for a country whose economic float is determined by the health of large technology groups.
Toyota and Sony, for example, blamed the yen's contribution for their weak performance between July and September.
While markets continue to be located in the peripheral EU countries, the Yoshihiko Noda Government is not slowing down.
"The risks that persist, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of floods in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of the yen, must be monitored", said State Secretary for Economic Policy Motohisa Furukawa yesterday.
And indeed, the prospects are not encouraging at all.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said that most member countries showed clearer signs of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator that anticipates the turning points of the world economy has highlighted that the main powers are being held back.
Because it's down four decimals to 100.4 points, from 100.8 in August.
The eurozone was even below the average, which is at level 100, falling eight decimal places to 99.13 points.
Athens is again fueling doubts
Papadimos says the adjustments will be approved, but the Conservatives won't sign any written commitments
With peripheral risk premiums triggered and uncertainty resettled in parks, Greece continues to sink into the maze leading to the exit from the great European debt crisis.
The feeling that the 'consensus' of the new Greek transitional government is being imposed by the demands of Brussels rather than by a genuine conviction of political forces is beginning to be confirmed by the facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, yesterday indicated that there is no alternative to structural reforms and that the 100-day period set out in his nomination may be short to implement them, the leader of the conservative New Democracy party, Antonis Samaras, assured that he would not support the new austerity measures under any circumstances and reiterated his demand for new elections by the scheduled date of 19 February.
"The main task of this Government is to implement the decisions of the 26 October summit", Papadimos said when he opened a parliamentary debate yesterday which will end tomorrow with a vote of confidence for the new Executive.
A package of 24 programmes to boost employment, reform of the civil servants' disciplinary code and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, Samaras no's message raises doubts about his position: "We are committed to supporting the transitional government, but we have committed nothing more".
The Conservative leader has gone one step further than the EU and IMF, the bodies that must unlock the 8,000 million that Athens urgently needs, and has made clear that he will not approve any letter of commitment to implement the adjustments.
But the European Commission, still irritated by the impact of the Papandreou referendum, reiterated yesterday its firm demand that it will not unblock aid unless the new government and the leaders of the main Greek parties sign "a clear and unambiguous written commitment as soon as possible".
Economic Affairs spokesman Amadeu Altafaj said that the troika inspectors would return "very soon" to Athens to discuss with the new government "the necessary elements to pay the sixth instalment" of $8,000 million, although there is no definitive date either.
The Greeks have a lot to do.
Queen Sofía: "They are tools for progress and hope"
The Queen stresses Spain's "major" position in this type of finances
Spain has 'reached a leading position in the world in the role of microfinance'.
Queen Sofía recalled that the country has become the world's second largest donor in the last two decades of this instrument of cooperation, whose "essence" is that it is an "instrument for social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all mankind, based on trust in man".
The Queen opened the V World Micro-Credit Summit in Valladolid yesterday with the conviction that "there is no doubt" that this type of operation is "absolutely indispensable" to achieve the United Nations Millennium Goals for 2015, and "very specifically, in one that aims to halve the number of people living on less than a dollar a day, which is set at the 'poverty threshold'.
Spain "continues to work" to expand the network of beneficiaries "in all corners of the world, and takes this task on with "responsibility", said Queen Sofía, who hoped that the initiatives and contributions originating during the Summit, which will run until Thursday, "guarantee the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest and especially women", the main beneficiaries of these loans.
We have "reached many goals" and "we are facing many challenges".
The Micro-Credit Summit is not only seen as a forum for debate but also as a platform from which to promote 'two basic objectives'.
So His Majesty explained that the goal is that by the end of 2015 there will be 175 million poor families who have access to these financial services and that 100 million of these families will be lifted out of the poverty line they are now living in.
The impetus for micro-credit design in Spain and the rest of the world "followed the path pioneered a few years ago" by Muhammad Yunus, Queen Sofía pointed out as an "act of justice and due recognition".
And she described the father of the instrument as an "admirable idealist in the universal cause of poverty alleviation", a work she had known for 15 years, when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to learn about her lending policy on the ground.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those held in Ivory Coast in 1999, Canada in 2006, and "each meeting I saw a continuous evolution", explained Her Majesty, whose relationship with this project gave her yesterday the title of "family leader" in Valladolid by the "poor bank".
Finally, Queen Sofía concluded her speech by encouraging the audience to participate in the debate and to seek solutions to advance the fight against poverty.
"Ethical imperative"
Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez warned that solidarity "is an ethical imperative" for any democratic state.
In this regard, she said that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries to periods of economic prosperity, as this is a 'permanent obligation'.
Jiménez said that micro-credit is "a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to eradicating poverty", and that now "more than ever" governments in developed countries must work under criteria of solidarity and not allow it to be the victim of reductions.
For Spain, microcredit is "one of the main lines of development cooperation".
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodriguez, applauded the "success" of giving "trust" to the "excluded people to whom everyone closes the door"; and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed the people in a city that "opens its doors contaminated with the spirit of solidarity".
The CDU proposes to elect the European President by universal suffrage
The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) was held in Leipzig on Monday 14 November, and it was without real difficulty for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and President of the Christian Democratic Party.
The future of Europe was not initially planned in the programme but was set in motion in the autumn, in particular to satisfy activists who consider the government's policy towards Greeks today and perhaps Italians tomorrow too lax.
The motion for a European Commission presidency, proposed by the Management Board, was adopted almost unanimously.
Of the 1001 delegates, only nine voted against and ten abstained.
The standing ovation of several minutes which was given to Angela Merkel and then, a few hours later, to Wolfgang Schäuble, the very European finance minister, was not in doubt.
The main idea of the Chancellor - and the motion - is based on a slogan: the response to the crisis is "not less Europe but more Europe".
Not only because Europe is peaceful but because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro".
The Chancellor said: "It is time for a breakthrough in Europe".
This could result in amendments to the Lisbon Treaty to strengthen the European Union's control over the budgetary policies of the euro area countries, but it could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission by universal suffrage "to give a face to Europe".
This is at least one of the proposals for the motion adopted by the Congress, clearly inspired by Wolfgang Schäuble.
It is unlikely that the Twenty-Seven will agree quickly on this revolution: Britain is hostile to it and the leaders of the CDU believe they know that Nicolas Sarkozy is also hostile.
But the milestone is now.
Similarly, the delegates rejected by an overwhelming majority the proposal to weigh the weight of each country in the European Central Bank's Executive Board according to the weight of each economy, which obviously reinforced the weight of Germany.
In order to calm the climate within her party, the Chancellor has multiplied her references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl but she has also not sought to win her congress on the backs of "small" European countries or countries in difficulty who are quick to criticize the arrogant Germany.
While the motion on Europe is a paragraph on the importance of 'French-German friendship', Angela Merkel did not mention France.
Except in the open.
Recalling that two centuries ago, Leipzig was the center of a bloody battle.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of Napoleon's army.
What is sick leave fraud?
After the allowances, the UMP and the government launched an offensive on sick leave.
Nicolas Sarkozy will visit a family allowance fund in Bordeaux on Tuesday 15 November and deliver a speech on the theme - which has been repeated since 2007 - of combating social fraud and aid.
And to accompany this offensive, which starts with a desire to save money in a context of rigidity, but is no less an announcement of a right-wing presidential campaign axis, the majority wants to focus on sickness cuts.
Firstly, in order to save on the budget: the government is considering imposing a fourth day of shortage on private employees before taking over a work stoppage.
Clearly, without a specific agreement, a sick employee would lose four days' wages, or at least 15% of his monthly income.
A move that could cause outrage, but could bring in 280 million euros, according to The Echos.
The Commission has also proposed a new measure, which would be more symbolic: imposing a day of unpaid leave on civil servants when they are out of work (they have not yet had a period of leave, compared with three days in private practice).
While these issues are being discussed, the majority also re-examines the subject of fraud, this time targeting the abuse of work stoppages.
"The checks will be much more important and, in addition, if you are caught, you will be reimbursed", Xavier Bertrand warned on RTL's microphone on Sunday, November 13.
As in other cases, the effects of advertising appear to be somewhat disproportionate to the reality of job-saving fraud.
This has been the subject of constant monitoring and political attacks since 2002, and has most often paid off.
The French are no more sick than the rest of Europe.
Let us first look at the national figures.
According to the National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM), more than EUR 237 million in daily allowances were issued in 2006.
According to the Institute for Health Economics Research and Documentation, daily allowances accounted for 5% of health expenditure in 2008, with 11.3 billion euros.
Of this total, 46% were maternity leave and accidents at work, and 54% were sick leave, or EUR 6.2 billion.
And that's 2.5% of health care spending.
In 2010, the average French work stoppage was 14.5 days, compared with 17.8 in 2009, according to a study by Alma Consulting.
An average that hides some discrepancies: another survey, published in 2007 by career management site Monster.com, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees surveyed said they had not taken any sick leave.
Another study, this time by Health Insurance , states that in 2010, 37% of sickness stops were less than 8 days, 22% 8-14 days, 15% 15 days to a month, 15% one to three months and 11% beyond.
Compared to their European neighbours, French workers are not more prone to work stoppages than elsewhere.
A long-term study carried out in 2010 by two researchers at the CNRS showed that between 1994 and 2001 the overall absence rate (for health reasons or not) fluctuated between 10% and 11% in France, compared with 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
The fraudulent termination of sickness is very little compared to the black work.
The fraud is only of a small extent.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 means that checks are systematic on sickness leave of more than 45 days.
In 2008, out of 1.5 million checks, the CNAM found that 13% of the 285,000 short-term arrests were 'unjustified or too long', or 37,050 cases.
In the case of judgments lasting more than 45 days, systematically controlled, 11% of the 1.2 million cases were 'inappropriate or unjustified', or 132 000.
In total, 169 000 cases were 'unjustified', out of several million workers who had a sickness.
This is a figure that is very small compared to, for example, black labour.
According to the Member for the United Nations Environment Programme Dominique Tian, who wrote a report on the subject in June, this would represent between €9 and €15 billion of tax revenue lost each year, more than the total cost of daily allowances, and therefore far more than the amount of tax fraud.
Papademos: Greece will have to implement a new adjustment plan
Greece will need a new adjustment programme to restore its economy.
This was stated by Prime Minister Lucas Papademos in Parliament on Monday 14 November, adding that the 100 days given to his Union Government would not be enough to accomplish this task.
"To continue the recovery efforts, we need the support of our European partners and a new budgetary adjustment programme", said the Prime Minister, who gave his first public speech at the opening of the vote of confidence in Parliament on Wednesday.
Implementing the decisions taken at the euro area summit on 27 October will be the new government's 'main task' as the country's participation in the euro area 'is at stake,' he added.
As a result, Papademos forecasted that the country's public deficit will be reduced to "around 9%" of GDP by the end of the year, after being 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The right-wing rejects new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, the leader of the right, on Monday expressed support for measures already approved to try to get out of the debt crisis but warned that his party would not commit to further austerity.
"We will not vote for new measures", he said at a meeting with MPs from his New Democracy party.
He agreed with the objectives of reducing deficits and debt and fighting waste but was hostile to any policy that would prevent economic recovery.
On the other hand, the Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, Olli Rehn, warned that the IMF and the EU would not unlock the necessary €8 billion loan without written guarantees from all parties supporting the measures envisaged.
Euthanasia and assisted suicide must be legalized, says a committee of experts
Canadians live in denial of death, according to a report by the Royal Society of Canada
In the field of palliative care, the committee calls for governments, healthcare institutions and doctors to work together to provide better palliative care, beyond cancer cases.
Canadian society lives in the denial of death.
Only 9% of Canadians agree to talk to their doctor about the conditions under which they want to die and make arrangements to do so.
This is one of the conclusions of a major report by the Royal Society of Canada, which included six experts in a variety of fields, including ethics, law, and medicine.
The committee recommends that the government amend the Criminal Code to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, where appropriate, with a patient deemed competent to make such a decision.
To start with, experts cite a recent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of deaths in 40 countries around the world.
While Canada was ranked 10th, the study notes that "the mediation of death in Canada has given rise to a culture in which people are afraid to approach the subject of death".
Medication or not, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, report experts commissioned by the Royal Society of Canada.
And despite the desire of most Canadians to die at home, 68.6% of them end up dying in the hospital.
Overall, Quebec has the highest death rate in the country, with 86 percent of deaths occurring in hospital.
On the delicate issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the report's authors come to conclusions that go against the position of the federal government, which has already said it does not want to change anything to the Criminal Code on euthanasia and assisted suicide.
However, according to the experts, who have also reviewed all countries where these approaches are legalized or decriminalized, there is no evidence that decriminalization results in abuse in enforcement, i.e. the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicide on unqualified or unconsenting persons.
On the contrary, Jocelyn Downie, who co-signed the report, said yesterday in a teleconference that more cases of such overflowing would be found in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legal.
"Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal".
"Assisted suicide is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal", explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians are for euthanasia
Recall that 85 percent of Canadians have already voted for euthanasia because they believe it would help end-of-life people alleviate their suffering, according to a 2010 Angus Reid poll.
And 66 percent believe that legalizing euthanasia will not send the message that the lives of the elderly or disabled are less valuable.
As for those who have assisted suicide, 41 percent of respondents believe they should not be prosecuted.
The report's authors say that the situation is less clear when it comes to maintaining or discontinuing care for a patient.
They also suggest that the list of recommendations should state in the Criminal Code that withdrawal of care for which there has been a valid legal refusal is not a crime.
The Committee also calls for health professionals to be trained to respect refusal of end-of-life care without fear of criminal prosecution.
In the field of palliative care, the committee calls for governments, healthcare institutions and doctors to work together to provide better palliative care, beyond cancer cases.
Finally, in the case of palliative or terminal sedation, which is already widely used in Canadian health institutions, the Committee calls for consideration, where it is not used to reduce physical pain, such as euthanasia, and for the same procedures to be followed.
Reservations by other experts
Some experts in the field of health law have already expressed reservations about the findings of the Royal Society of Canada's report.
The report's signatories, Mr Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, called the position of the experts "extreme", among other things because it does not limit the practice of euthanasia to terminally ill patients.
"This opens the door to a situation where anyone who would be tired of life and over 18 could ask for help to commit suicide", says Mr Deschamps, who read a summary of the report yesterday.
Deschamps also points out that the authors of the report seem to place the autonomy of the person above all other values that contribute to the social fabric of society.
But, he says, "in society, there are signs and constraints".
Health law expert Margaret Somerville also expressed "strong opposition" to the report's findings, which she called a "pro-euthanasia manifesto".
Margaret Somerville, who is herself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, particularly disputes the report's data on the absence of abuse in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legal, namely the Netherlands and Oregon.
Jordan's King calls on President Assad to step down
Damascus denounces a "conspiracy"
Syria is increasingly isolated
Supporters of Bashar al-Assad demonstrated yesterday outside the premises of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Diplomatic pressure on Syria under Bashar al-Assad has intensified yesterday, and with the support of Russia, he is resisting and denouncing a "conspiracy" against the country.
Two days after the Arab League's suspension of Syria, the European Union has tightened its sanctions on Damascus while Turkey and Jordan, neighbours of Syria, have taken a stand in favour of President Assad's departure.
King Abdullah II of Jordan was yesterday the first Arab leader to call on President Bashar al-Assad to "leave power" in Syria where another 40 civilians and members of the regime forces have been killed.
"If Bashar was in the interest of his country, he should resign, but he should also create the conditions for a new phase of Syrian political life", the king of Jordan, a neighboring country of Syria, said in an interview with the BBC.
For his part, the Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu lamented that the Turkish mediation efforts with the Syrian regime since the beginning of the year have failed.
"Those who are not at peace with their peoples in the Middle East and cannot satisfy them will leave", he said, referring to Syria, a neighboring country to which Turkey is taking an increasingly hard line.
The United States, for its part, welcomed a "strengthening of the consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime" following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League, countries like Turkey are taking an increasingly tough tone" in the face of the repression in Syria, noted Mark Toner, a State Department spokesman.
Meanwhile, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime forces have been killed in the Deraa region of southern Syria, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (OSDH) announced.
Two other civilians were killed "in exchange of fire and heavy machine guns in Jobar" in the besieged city of Homs, according to the NGO.
At a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Mouallem said the country was "going towards the end of the crisis".
He also reacted strongly to the Arab League's decision to suspend Damascus' work, which he said was a "dangerous step".
Syria "will not fail", he added, assuring that "the plots against Syria will fail".
Following its decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is now studying a "civilian protection mechanism" and wants 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, media and military observers to be sent to the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé also expressed his support for the deployment of UN observers to help protect civilians from the repression of the regime, which he said is locked in "paranoia".
A new extraordinary meeting of the League is scheduled for tomorrow in Rabat to discuss the implementation of the crisis-resolution plan adopted on 2 November, including the withdrawal of armed forces from the cities affected by the protests and the release of arrested protesters.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov yesterday called the Arab League's decision "wrong", while China urged Syria to implement the crisis-resolution plan while avoiding any possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti asks for time at the markets and sacrifices from the Italians
Italy's future head of government, Mario Monti, has called for some time in the markets to train his team and implement a programme, which will include "sacrifices", to regain the credibility lost in the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former European Commissioner was in discussion with the political parties yesterday before meeting today with the trade unions and the employers.
It should set up a relatively small cabinet composed of technocrats outside Parliament.
"Monti spoke of an important programme with many sacrifices", said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the many small parliamentary groups involved in the talks, after meeting with the President-in-Office of the Council.
The President of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, said he expected Mario Monti to call for a vote of confidence in Parliament by Friday to ensure that the new government has sufficient support.
The consultations will end with Mr Monti presenting a short list, probably of a dozen ministers, to the head of state, Giorgio Napolitano.
Mr Monti commented on the nervousness of the stock and bond markets yesterday, asking for time.
In "democracy, there are specific deadlines" for preparing a government and its programme, he stressed, saying "certainly that markets will be patient and understand".
The President's appointment was initially welcomed by the markets, but concern has picked up again, particularly after an unexpected fall in industrial production in the euro area in September.
The Prime Minister-designate should be a team comprising mainly technocrats, although he stressed that he would like to include "politicians".
The new government should last until 2013, the date of the next legislative elections, he said.
According to the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will gain Parliament's confidence by Friday.
Mr Monti, once in office, committed himself to working urgently to ensure that Italy 'become a leading player' in Europe.
A spokesman for European Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that "even with a new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy does not change".
The EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its budgetary balance target in 2013 despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, has called for new measures of rigour.
Italian "boss boss" Emma Marcegaglia, who will see him on Tuesday, also stressed the need to boost the economy, "because a country without growth cannot meet deficit parameters".
Mr Monti, renowned for his competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents a "turning point" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconism", the "professor" symbolizing "the challenge of seriousness" and "another Italy", according to the editors.
The big unknown is the longevity of his team.
President Napolitano would like to avoid early elections, as Italy must place 200 billion euros in state bonds by April 2012.
A Russian scientist helped Iran's nuclear program
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, helped Iran develop a detonator that could be used with a nuclear weapon, an American NGO specializing in nuclear risk said Monday.
The Institute for International Science and Security (ISIS) relies on the recent report of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents from that UN agency to identify this researcher.
The IAEA expressed last week its "serious concerns" about a "possible military dimension" of Iran's nuclear program.
According to ISIS, drawing heavily from IAEA documents, Mr. Danilenko, born in 1934, is said to have worked for three decades starting in the 1960s at a Soviet military nuclear facility in Cheliabinsk (Ural), and was reportedly involved in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds by blast.
In 1989 or 1991, he reportedly left the centre to set up a company producing "nano-diamonds" in Kiev.
Economic difficulties in his company led him to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He was then reportedly cooperating with the Iranian program from 1996 to 2002, before returning to Russia.
In its latest report, the IAEA cites "strong indications that Iran's development" of a nuclear detonation system "was aided by the work of a foreign expert, who not only was well versed in the technique but who, as a Member State informed the Agency, worked for most of his career on this technology within his home country's military nuclear program".
Crime and anti-Muslim crimes have increased by 50%
Crime and crimes against Muslims increased by nearly 50 percent from 2009 to 2010, while other racial and religious violence declined slightly or slightly, according to FBI statistics released Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of Muslim violence has increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, a 49 percent increase compared with a 13 percent increase in violence against Catholics, a 4 percent decrease in crimes against Jews and a 14 percent increase in overall anti-religious crimes and offenses.
The total number of "hate crimes" has increased very slightly to 6,628, with 47.3% being motivated by racial differences and 20% by differences in religion, according to the FBI.
"After a decline in 2009, it is disturbing to see these crimes and offenses rise again", Human Rights First said, "the increase in anti-Muslim violence is particularly significant", the organization added in a statement.
"Human Rights First has long stressed that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crime, must be considered a serious violation of human rights", adds one of the organization's officials, Paul Legendre.
"The US government can and should do more to tackle these abuses", he added, believing that this could be through improved police reporting on "hate crimes".
The "hate crime" in U.S. federal law is a legacy of the civil rights era.
This legislation was passed after the death of Martin Luther King to punish violence related to race, color, religion, origin and now sexual affiliation.
Twitter is changing its platform and more like Facebook
The micro-blogging site Twitter introduced changes to its platform presentation on Monday, allowing users to observe the activity of those they follow, making its service a little more like Facebook's.
A new "activity" tab and another "name" allow you to more easily read and live track the activity of other "Twittos", the users whose messages are followed ("tweets") and those who follow you.
This allows you to know if they're following messages, if they're subscribing to new accounts, if they have favorite messages, etc.
The new Twitter formula was tested "on a small percentage of users in August" before being rolled out across the network on Monday, Twitter spokeswoman Carolyn Penner told AFP.
Twitter, which was known for its uninstinctive operation, with somewhat esoteric terms (RT to re-broadcast someone else's message, #followfriday to recommend following another user) making the in-laws happy, is thus opening up to a wider audience in a manner more comparable to that of the mainstream networks Facebook and Google+.
On the network, users were debating the importance of this innovation in sharp tweets.
"It's useless, invasive, and it looks too much like Facebook", wrote @jemb123.
"The Activity feature will help me better track some of my Twitter feed", @dannykronstrom posted.
Austria
The introduction of a budgetary "golden rule" into the constitution
The ruling Social-Democratic/Christian-Democratic coalition government in Austria decided on Tuesday to include a budgetary "golden rule" in the constitution to reduce government deficits and thus avoid a possible degradation of Austria's sovereign rating agencies (triple A).
It was the Social-Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann who announced this decision after a Council of Ministers meeting, when Austria's public debt is 74.6%, well above the maximum 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty, but well below the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's solvency were reduced by only one stroke, from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay three billion euros more in interest each year", argued Vice-Chancellor and Christian Democratic Foreign Minister Michael Spindelegger.
Austria follows a request from the Eurozone summit in Brussels on 26 October, when the Heads of State and Government demanded that public deficit reductions and a return to public accounts balance be included in the constitution or legislation of equal value by the end of 2012.
The Austrian government's system is closer to the 'German model', with Germany being the first European country to adopt such a 'rule'.
By 2017, the structural public deficit will have to decrease by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) annually and, from 2017, the federal government's structural public deficit will not have to exceed 0.35% of GDP annually, while the regional states and municipalities will have to present balanced budgets.
The objective is to move the public debt to the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty by 2020/21.
High yen
Noda threatens to intervene again in the foreign exchange market
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that Japanese authorities would intervene again in the foreign exchange market if the yen continued to rise.
"We will intervene as we did last time if we see excessive volatility" in the yen exchange rate, Mr Noda explained to the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen was falling to near historic levels, which prompted Japanese authorities to intervene on October 31.
On that day, Tokyo sold massive yen against dollars to lower the value of the Japanese currency, which had just set a new record for the greenback since 1945.
But the yen has steadily risen since then, fueled by purchases from investors who see it as a "refuge value" in these uncertain times of global economic slowdown and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar fell below 77 yen on Tuesday and the euro fell below the symbolic bar of 105 yen, close to the levels triggered by the last intervention.
Before the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was worth around 120 yen and the euro more than 160 yen.
This surge in the Japanese currency is damaging the island's exports as it increases the cost of Made in Japan products and reduces the value of Japanese firms' foreign income when converting them into national currency.
"Japan is struggling to rebuild itself" since the March 11 earthquake and tsunami that devastated the Tohoku region (northeast), noted Mr. Noda, who fears that this rise in the yen will kill the fragile recovery.
The world's third largest economy rebounded in growth in the third quarter - 1.5% from the previous quarter - for the first time in a year, thanks to a rebound in exports and consumption from disaster-driven households.
But the prime minister felt that the yen's price was not reflective of "Japan's economic fundamentals".
Finance Minister Jun Azumi called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its monetary policy council on Tuesday, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
But the institution's deputy governor, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the BoJ had already taken "appropriate measures", implying that no further monetary easing was to be expected on Wednesday.
At its last meeting at the end of October, the issuing institution increased its purchases of Treasury bonds by 5 billion yen (€47 billion) to 55,000 billion yen (€519 billion) to increase the ceiling on the amounts it spends on purchases of various financial securities to flood the liquidity market.
The euro area:
The rates are rising, the stock market is floating.
The risk of contagion from the debt crisis is still lowering the European indices.
Despite the appointment of new heads of government in Greece and Italy and improved growth in France and Germany, rates in weak countries continue to rise.
Still concerned about the stability of the euro area, the European stock exchanges are plunging into a slightly negative territory on Tuesday 15 November.
In Paris, at 10 a.m., the CAC 40 loses 1.4% to 3,064 points.
The tax in Frankfurt is down 0.4% and London 0.1%.
"With new tensions on borrowing yields from euro area countries in difficulty, stock markets around the world continue to make a share of their recent gains".
"The nervous investors are just too aware of the risk of infection", explains Terry Pratt, institutional broker at IG Markets, quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange closed down 0.7%, which in turn was driven by renewed concerns from market participants about Europe's ability to contain the debt crisis.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, is looking to Europe and trade will continue in a narrow corridor of variations until investors have evidence that the situation is stable", said Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This renewed concern about the future of the euro area is putting the single currency on hold, which continues to decline on Tuesday.
The euro is at its lowest level in a month and a half.
At 10 a.m., the European currency is worth $1,3570, down 0.4%.
According to the brokers, it was withdrawn after Chancellor Angela Merkel's party, the CDU, adopted a motion at a congress on Monday, including the possibility for a country struggling to leave the eurozone without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates well above 6%
The borrowing rates in Italy and Spain remain at very worrying levels.
On Tuesday morning, the yield on Italian 10-year bonds reached 6.85%, compared with the yield on Spanish bonds of the same maturity of 6.2%.
These tensions on interest rates in the southern countries, but also in France, continue to fuel the concerns of stakeholders.
The future head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, has demanded time in the markets to restore the situation in Italy, which is threatened with suffocation by the weight of its debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister, Lucas Papademos, said that implementing the decisions taken at the eurozone summit on 27 October would be the "main task" of his government.
Spain is in the spotlight as the country holds parliamentary elections on Sunday.
The spread gap between German and Spanish 10-year bonds has reached a new historic high.
In anticipation of euro area growth figures
Statistically, France recorded economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, slightly better than the 0.3% expected, driven by household consumption.
However, the second quarter figures were revised downwards by Insee, with a decline of 0.1% in gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
And it is indeed the fourth most worrying concern for economists.
Germany, on the other hand, grew by 0.5% over the same period.
A first estimate for the euro area as a whole is expected at 11 a.m. as the European Commission has just warned of the risk of a further recession.
Energy policy:
facts must prevail over dogma
If there is one subject which cannot be dealt with from short-term considerations or emotionally, it is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly affect purchasing power and the competitiveness of enterprises.
It is healthy that an election date should be an opportunity to reflect on such issues and the place of nuclear power.
The debate will only be successful if it explores the full economic, social and environmental implications of the proposed options.
The French must base their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
With seven billion people on the planet, population change will double electricity demand by 2050, unless a huge part of the world's population is deprived of a vital element.
At the same time, the scarcity of fossil resources must be overcome to continue producing electricity continuously, not to mention the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate change, a subject that has disappeared from ecological debate.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.
This is why Germany remains isolated in its decision to abandon nuclear power.
This is not the case with Belgium, which is forced to find a replacement source that can replace it, nor with Switzerland, which just wants to build only the latest generation of power plants.
On the other hand, Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to name but a few, are pursuing their projects with determination.
The United States, meanwhile, decided after Fukushima to add a unit to its fleet by resuming construction of a power plant that was stopped after the Three Mile Island accident.
If the German renewable energy model is sometimes presented as an example, the reality is the opposite.
The choice of Berlin will result in higher electricity prices, an increased energy dependence on imported gas, especially from Russia, and a surge in CO2 emissions from the construction of gas and coal plants.
Within a few months, all these unfortunate effects are already being felt.
The case of Denmark is worth considering.
The European wind energy champion, which produces 30% of its electricity, is also one of the largest users of coal and gas due to wind intermittency, which means that its CO2 emissions and electricity prices are 65% and 50% higher than the European average respectively.
On the other hand, thanks to the consistency of our energy policy, our neighbors pay 40% more electricity than French households.
While in a globalised economy the cost of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and a guarantee of maintaining the industrial tool on national territory, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
The Commission has already adopted a number of amendments to the directive on the protection of the environment, which are intended to help the Member States to ensure that the environment is a safe place for the environment.
A price that a large majority of French people refuse to pay, especially since they do not express a principled opposition to this energy, surveys show.
We must remember that the energy policy of our country has led to the creation of an industrial sector with 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 indirect jobs.
It is a major exporter, attracting a galaxy of SMEs specialising in international markets and making them very unlocalizable job creators.
If France were to decide to leave nuclear power, it would be a sacrifice to many of these SMEs by reducing the €6 billion a year of French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
What electrical engineer would order an EPR designed to run for 60 years when the decline of its manufacturer would be scheduled?
To solve the energy equation, we must admit that there is no source of miraculous electricity generation, nor is there any demonic one.
The development by Areva of low-carbon, nuclear and renewable solutions is a testament to the complementarity of energy sources.
For nuclear power, maintaining the highest level of safety is an absolute imperative.
We have a security authority in France that exercises uncompromising and transparent control over existing power plants and the Flamanville site.
Our teams, whose professionalism is recognized, are inhabited by the same security obsession.
In half a century, the nuclear industry has suffered three serious accidents.
Only one, Three Mile Island, was operated under normal operating conditions; it remained without human or environmental consequences.
In Chernobyl, the design of the reactor and the unforgivable human faults caused the tragedy.
In Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident was the result of two unprecedented natural disasters that killed tens of thousands.
The nuclear industry will learn from this accident, as it did for the two previous ones.
The EPR is designed to withstand such phenomena as a result of this approach and cooperation between the safety authorities, French and German operators and manufacturers.
While it is considered by all electricians who wish to build a power station, the halt to its construction in Flamanville would be a wonderful gift to Areva and EDF's competitors, leaving them free to take the lead in the inevitable development of nuclear power.
It is essential and legitimate to seek the best energy supply for our country, but it would be irresponsible to allow emotion, dogma and partisan manoeuvre to dominate such a debate as this, which is crucial for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy of Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from various angles - the overload of police, judicial and administrative services subject to the numbering policy, the compatibility of this policy with France's self-proclaimed status as a "human rights country".
More recently, the administrative harassment of foreign students has been the news story, with the Minister of the Interior (read Liberation of 23 May) proclaiming in the passage that France "does not need foreign talents, masons and restaurant waiters".
But it is rarely analyzed from an economic perspective.
It's that there's a fairly broad consensus between left and right on this.
On the right, the tone was set by Jacques Chirac, who declared in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed people should not be a problem in a country with nearly 2 million immigrant workers", and on the left, by Michel Rocard, who explained that France "cannot accommodate all the misery in the world" in 1990.
The only difference is the degree of generosity
In 2005, the fear of the invasion of the national territory by hordes of Polish plumbers was shared by left and right.
On both sides, immigrants are seen as a burden on the French economy and society.
The only difference is the degree of generosity that will be shown to immigrants.
In his programme, François Hollande is holding back on trivia, saying that co-development will solve our "migration problem".
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, may be worth the price of election, but it is very expensive economically.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron point out in a recent book summarizing the latest knowledge on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is broad consensus among experts on the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth, wages and employment in countries that host immigrants.
Restricting immigration is anemia and damages employment.
Fears about the impact of migrants are based on the idea that they may replace domestic workers, particularly low-skilled workers, by putting downward pressure on their wages.
But experience shows that immigrants are in fact much more complementary than substitutes for national workers, mostly in jobs in sectors with a shortage of employment.
Low-skilled immigrants work in sectors which do not attract national employees, and the most skilled in dynamic sectors where training does not follow the job offer.
A positive effect on wages
Just as a surgeon will find it difficult to work in a country with a shortage of anesthesiologists, these complementarities between nationals and migrants have a positive effect on the wages and employment of nationals.
Giovanni Peri calculated that an increase of 1% in migration flows would lead to an increase of between 0.6 and 0.9% in real long-term wages.
This is without taking into account the fact that the diversity brought by immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (a large proportion of naturalized immigrants among the US Nobel Prize winners; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants are also net contributors to social systems, averaging up to 1% of the total budget in European countries.
The World Labour Organization estimates, for example, that in Germany an immigrant who reaches the age of 30 will contribute a net contribution (income minus expenditure) of EUR 150,000 to the public budgets on average over his lifetime.
Mr Sarkozy wanted to go "with his teeth" to look for the missing growth points at the beginning of his term.
The teeth in question, used to deter immigrants, had the exact opposite effect.
Europe invented democracy, but we must think about European democracy
Democracy is a precious asset; it is also a fragile asset.
The European continent should be able to remember him, who, for having invented it in Athens over two thousand years ago, witnessed the tragedies of the Great War, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the Gulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the colonels in Greece.
Some may have thought that it would be enough for democracy to triumph over its enemies once and for all to exercise the vote, and to exercise it in the most direct way possible.
We've known since Napoleon the Little that this was an easy thought.
Universal suffrage, in order to be the necessary condition of democracy, is not the sufficient condition and can even become an "instrument of oppression", as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: public space, public spirit, values, organization, separation and control of powers, education, the Enlightenment, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The crisis in Europe we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but it is also a crisis of politics and democracy.
The palinody of the true and false Greek referendum has been a double-folding factor in this respect: the need for a strong return to politics, but also the disturbing feeling of its impossibility, of its inconsistency.
This ambivalence must be thought out to be overcome.
The truth is that the front lines of democratic combat have now shifted, and for many of them, the Republican soldiers are no longer firing in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain from demanding a succession of national referendums, organised according to needs and in a dispersed order.
A white flag to the absolute monarch of Europe or a jump in the void of nationalist retreat: what a choice for the citizen!
We are not seeking a coup d'état but a common, full-fledged, peaceful and continuous exercise of choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal - and we cannot even stop counting them - because there is only one crisis, and it is in Europe.
It is the whole of Europe that is subject to the dictates of the markets and rating agencies, suffering from its impotence and lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that is humiliated on the international stage.
There is concern about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe - but it is the whole of Europe slowly losing its sovereignty, and with it each of its nations.
The urgency is to restore the leadership of the European project to the people's sovereignty.
For together Europeans can reduce the burden of their debts, free themselves from markets and prepare for the future by investing.
The crisis outcome will involve decisions at European level that cannot be taken without full democratic legitimacy, unless, of course, they lead to disaster.
After a long struggle against this proposal by the Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone is now demanding the European economic government.
Either that or not.
But to think of it without a stronger political and democratic integration, and lived as such by the citizens, would be another madness and a new stalemate.
We must take on a new stage in European construction.
To make the Republic in France, it took "making" Republicans.
The interest revolution could not do that.
That lesson is still valid.
We must build a more economically integrated Europe.
This can only be done by building a more politically democratic Europe, a true European people's sovereignty.
To make Europe, we must make Europeans.
Contactless smart cards are becoming more common
The World Smart Card Show opens on Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, with a positive atmosphere.
The year 2011 is expected to end with worldwide sales of microprocessor cards (bank card, SIM card phone...) increasing by 11% to over 6 billion units, according to Eurosmart.
The most prominent segment is contactless technology that allows you to pay for public transport or to pay for your purchases by simply approaching a reader's map.
This year, 460 million contactless smart cards are expected to be sold worldwide, up from 320 million a year earlier!
Their share is expected to grow further in 2012 (580 million expected units) and account for nearly 10% of the global smart card market (6,925 million cards).
Europe has long been lagging behind the Asia-Pacific region in the area of contactless payments.
Some 26 million Visa bank cards already have this feature and 75,000 payment terminals accept it.
In France, the start-up is more modest: 400,000 Visa contactless cards have been deployed.
But the large surfaces make the gaps double.
Carrefour has thus issued 2.5 million contactless MasterCard pass cards this year.
To move to higher speed, banks now need to equip their customers.
"Two major French institutions have committed themselves to systematically distributing contactless bank cards to their customers in the future", said Gérard Nébouy, CEO of Visa Europe France.
Banks are testing mobile payments
But this is just the first step towards the payment method of the future: mobile phones.
Few devices today have the near field communication (NFC) technology essential for transaction processing.
"They're late".
"But they should finally have a real boom next year".
"We expect to sell 80 to 120 million units worldwide in 2012", explains Marc Bertin, president of Eurosmart.
But the banks are taking the lead.
The Agricultural Fund announced yesterday the launch of a test from December to June in Caen.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and employees will be equipped with a contactless payment case.
The CFSP has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the General Corporation, too, said yesterday that it would prepare to put on the market an offer that would allow its customers to pay without contacting their mobile phone.
From the Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front spreads
Paris is concerned about links between al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and Boko Haram.
Long suspected links between the Islamic Maghreb terrorist group al-Qaeda (Aqmi) and the Nigerian Boko Haram sect are confirmed.
On Sunday, Algeria's Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel even said that Algiers had "acquired certainty" about this.
"The way the two organisations operate and intelligence reports show that there is good cooperation", he explained without further detail.
Paris seems to be doing a similar analysis.
The investigation into the kidnapping of two Frenchmen in Niger last January has revealed the gateways.
Kidnapped from a restaurant in Niamey by Akmi's relatives, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory were to be killed the next day along with several of their captors during an operation launched by French special forces.
In the rubble of the operation, French and Nigerian investigators had to find several phone chips belonging to terrorists.
The terrorist axis
Analysis of past calls to several interlocutors based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France International (RFI), two issues are of particular interest to investigators: one of them is about a Nigerian who has spent a long time in Maiduguri, a northern Nigerian city that is the birthplace of Boko Haram, and the other is about a man who claims to be close to Akmi and the sect.
"This is a step forward but we must probably wait for more formal evidence before we talk about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram".
"But it is possible".
"It has been known for years that the sect has external financial and intellectual support and is becoming increasingly active", says Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, these "supports" have been increasingly evident in the evolution and discourse of Boko Haram or in its methods of operation, which now involve the use of increasingly complex suicide bombers or explosive devices and the same bill as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, starting with Washington, has therefore pressured Abuja to take into account the problems posed by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have long considered the group a community of uninteresting enlightened people.
A quick success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist imam Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram - which means in Hausa "Western education is a sin" - advocates the establishment of an Islamic emirate in northern Muslim Nigeria.
In this poor area, the association is rapidly thriving.
It is politicised and demands strict adherence to Sharia law while its activists fight the godless central government.
The latter are primarily concerned with churches, bars, administrations.
In 2009, Boko Haram militants were particularly active, increasing attacks on police stations.
Abuja's reaction is, as usual, unambiguous.
The army is besieging the city, we're counting 800 dead.
Mohammed Yusuf, arrested alive, was killed in prison.
The sect will then radicalize and leave its northern fiefs.
Last Christmas, she claimed an attack that killed 80 people in Jos, then another in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram attacked the police headquarters in Abuja in a suicide attack, its first.
In August, the local UN headquarters will be its first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa that would sail from Mauritania to Somalia and through Nigeria is now a concern for all security experts.
While Aqmi has invested in Mali and Niger, while the Somali al-Shabaab operates in Kenya, Boko Haram appears as a new threat to the heart of the continent.
Last week, in an interview in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé warned against Boko Haram and said he was ready to "share all the information".
The world according to the Republican presidential candidates
On China, on Iran, on aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry are competing for simplicity and ignorance.
Can an America weakened by the crisis manage a complex world with simple, even simplistic ideas?
Listening to Republican presidential candidates, voters might believe that.
In recent days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and others have been making a lot of silly statements and shortcuts about foreign policy, traditionally a Republican point.
On China, on Iran, on aid to Israel, the slogans - often unsupported - were:
Mitt Romney, the best-placed candidate for the "Grand Old Party" nomination, threatened to drag the Chinese to the WTO and charge them with "money manipulation", a theme that has been echoed in an America angered by the migration of entire sections of its industry to Asia.
Especially if it means starting a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, Obama's former ambassador to China and the only candidate to have a sophisticated foreign policy vision, nearly choked himself on an attitude that flattered his emotions.
He called for a strong but constructive dialogue with Beijing (Obama's current position).
But Huntsman, who is stagnant in the depths of the polls, remains unheard of.
Like Reagan
Romney also promised military strikes on Iran if sanctions fail to stop its nuclear program.
"If I am elected, I will stop Iran", he boasted.
"If Obama is re-elected, they'll have the bomb".
He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing to meet his obligations to that partner.
The second-highest-ranked candidate, entrepreneur Herman Cain, has shown an embarrassing lack of knowledge of the records.
Recently, he called for countering the Chinese military threat because Beijing "is trying to develop nuclear capability" - apparently ignoring the fact that China has held the military atom since 1964!
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants strikes on Iran, says he is ready to engage the U.S. military in Mexico against drug cartels.
The use of torture against suspected terrorists, which was banned by Obama in 2009, is also advocated by Cain, Perry and candidate Michele Bachmann.
We're a long way from the 2008 Republican nominee, John McCain, a heavy foreign policy weight.
Opponents of the current president say Reagan too had simple ideas and won the Cold War.
They remind us that Obama himself was an amateur and he had to drink his wine in the fight against terrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, on the premature departure of the "boys" from Iraq, on his misconduct in Libya, thus labeling him weak.
But the attack is not so easy.
The public is rather positive about Obama's national security record, which eliminated bin Laden.
Since Iraq, she has been wary of military intervention that leads to involvement.
And by arguing that we need to rebuild America economically to revive its leadership, Obama is striking a fairer line.
The Nord Stream, the new gateway for Russian gas into Europe
The Nord Stream gas pipeline, which connects Western Europe directly to Russia through the Baltic Sea, has been put into operation.
It's supposed to supply the equivalent of 30 million homes with gas.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event with glory.
More than 500 guests, including four heads of state and government, attended the opening of the Nord Stream, a new gas pipeline that connects Russia and Germany directly under the sea, on the Baltic Sea on Tuesday.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte all rolled the steering wheel of the valve that controls the entry of Russian gas into the Western European grid.
With this new pipeline, an additional 27.5 billion cubic metres of Russian gas will be delivered to Western Europe each year through a first 1,224 km pipeline linking the St. Petersburg region to the Mecklenburg-Pomerania region.
A second pipeline is due to be completed by the end of 2012, providing a total of 55 billion cubic metres of gas, equivalent to the total French consumption.
And we are already talking about the possibility of building a third on the same route.
Gazprom believes that the timely completion of this huge construction site is a victory.
The project was strongly contested by Poland and the Baltic States.
The Nord Stream will allow gas to be delivered directly to Germany, avoiding any land passage through a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
The two countries lose a little of their power and it becomes more difficult for them to put pressure on Russia by threatening to shut it off from Western European markets.
At the height of the debate, Warsaw had not hesitated to compare the Nord Stream to a "new German-Soviet pact", referring to the 1939 alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland.
I mean, whether the subject is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, by supporting this Russian project, has gained greater security of supply.
But it is at the cost of a weakening of Europe's energy supply, since the project has created a rift between Eastern and Western Europeans.
Russia has managed to overcome its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, which are heavy gas consumers and whose deposits are declining.
"This pipeline is part of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that connects us organically", said François Fillon, who inaugurated the pipeline, demonstrating how political and economic the major gas contracts are.
This explains the broad smiles of Gazprom's leaders, who were in large numbers in Lubmin at the gas arrival point.
The construction of this pipeline is also a technical feat.
The submarine tube is made of steel reinforced with concrete to protect it from anchors on ships.
It lies on the seabed, at an average of 200 metres.
To build it, it was necessary to avoid minefields dating back to World War II.
"A hundred had to be taken away or destroyed, as a precaution", says Jens Müller, a spokesman for Nord Stream.
Measures to protect wildlife and plants have also been increased.
The tube is a long metal snake, as heavy as 242 Eiffel Towers, which nothing interrupts throughout its length: no valve, no maintenance station.
A control platform was planned off the coast of Sweden, but the project officials abandoned it as the Swedes were not keen on a Russian state-owned company permanently established off their coast.
"If there is a breakdown, we stop the gas flowing in less than a minute", says Jens Müller.
If the gas leaks, the gas in the pipeline then escapes into the air.
But this is considered unlikely by the builders who planned the welds to have a leak every 100,000 years.
The monitoring of the status of the pipeline shall be carried out by an underwater robot, towed by a ship, for outdoor observation, and by a device circulating within the pipeline.
The cigar is shaped like a cigar and is inserted into a tube, a meter wide, and it is pushed by the gas.
Upon arrival, after three days of traveling at a speed of 3 metres per second, he gives accurate information about the metal's possible deformities.
The gas pipeline was designed to run for fifty years without having to undergo any repairs.
The gas circulation is simply ensured by pressure.
It's 200 bars at the start, and 100 bars at the end.
Five companies have joined forces to realize this project.
The leader remains Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares.
The German E.ON and BASF (15.5% each) joined the group, as did the Dutch Gasunie and the French GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies have created a joint venture, called Nord Stream, to build and operate the pipeline.
It is headquartered in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then leased to this company all the gas transport capacity for 20 renewable years.
"Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, regardless of the amount of gas actually transported", says Jens Müller.
The construction of the pipeline was financed by 30% by shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
The total cost of the work is expected to reach EUR 7.4 billion for the two pipes.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment amounted to 240 million.
But the minority shareholders are sure to pay their own costs, since only Gazprom takes the risk.
The gas pipeline emerges from the Baltic Sea at Lubmin, on a sandy coastline planted with pine trees.
Valves, up to 4.5 metres high, form the gas exit gate.
Sensors measure the pressure, temperature and specificities of the incoming gas before it is transferred to the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal has been receiving one million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour.
At full capacity, there will be 3 million per hour and in 2012, 6 million.
Moleskine, a trademark book.
Created about 15 years ago by an Italian company, Moleskine wants to restore the taste of writing.
He smells of adventure, hours of writing by the light of a candle.
The Moleskine book is easily recognizable, with its black rectangular cover, its elastic, its broken white leaves, as aged by time.
Yet the Moleskine book as we know it today was born... in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decided at the time to launch a design but distinguished notebook.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant for the company, is in charge of the launch of the new product.
The booklet is inspired by an ancient production technique, the mole skin, which refers to a varnished cotton used to cover banquets, for example.
This type of notebook was very popular with writers and travelers.
"Moleskine brought back to life an old and forgotten object that was an icon of avant-garde artists until the 20th century", says Maria Sebregondi, who has since become Modo Modo's brand manager.
Success is here.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% to 12.7 million obsolete pieces.
We are far from the secret production of the early years, when only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine crosses Italian borders and is exported to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to draw a robot portrait of the buyer, because the notebook attracts both businessmen and students and professionals.
Like Moleskine, its consumers are cosmopolitan, open-minded and educated.
The small Italian company, which had 12 employees at its inception, now has nearly 100 and has two offices in Milan and New York since 2008.
She distributes her notebooks in bookstores, from Fnac to small downtown shops, and she's managed to impose her identity.
"We have followed the pace of time and this new need for writing, despite the rise of e-mail", explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature accompanies the development of Moleskine: recently, the brand launched an exhibition "Detour" where architects or artists exhibit their own book.
In August, she also launched a leopard cover at the Locarno Film Festival.
Taking advantage of its success and cultural aura, Moleskine has diversified its products: bags, calendar, pens, computer covers... the brand is based on a wide range of media.
A successful venture: In the fall of 2006, Modo Modo was bought by investment fund SG Capital Europe, now Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in Moleskine's history.
Why is the unemployment rate for disabled workers so high?
About 19% of people with disabilities are looking for work.
The 15th week of disability employment is now open.
Despite a voluntary public policy in place in 2005, the unemployment rate for disabled people is still twice as high as the average: 19%, compared with 9% for the entire population.
Discouraging ?
"No", says Eric Blanchet, managing director of Adapt, the organization that organizes the week for disabled workers".
"The progress made in the last 15 years is considerable".
"At that time, the unemployment rate was not two but three times higher".
"But there is still much work to be done".
It must be said that for disabled unemployed persons, the obstacles to employment remain numerous.
They are rather elderly: 37% are over 50 years old (average 17%).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% do not have a bachelor's degree and out of the 2.3 million higher education students, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, longterm unemployment is very widespread: 53% for disabled people, compared with an average of 38%.
In short, these are criteria that make it particularly difficult to return to work, and that "constitute the core of the problem", according to Christian Grapin, general manager of Tremplin, an association established in 1992 to help companies recruit workers with disabilities.
Here's to the objective brakes.
The unspoken, changing mindsets, of course, but too slowly.
A study by IMS-Entrepreneur for the City in April found that managers surveyed had "a low level of knowledge about disability", with "overrepresentation of people in wheelchairs, with mental or intellectual disabilities".
As a result, private firms with more than 20 employees are still far from reaching the employment target of 6% of disabled workers, set by a law of... 1987.
The latest figures, dated 2008, show a ratio of 2.6%.
"We are now around 3%", says Pierre Blanc, general manager of Agefiph, the organization responsible for collecting contributions from companies that do not comply with this law.
Evidence: the number of 'taxed' institutions and the amounts paid decreased between 2007 and 2011, from 59,000 to 46,000 structures (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 tax increase law has put a lot of pressure on businesses", explains Pierre Blanc.
"But this improvement also means real awareness, especially in large groups".
According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59% of establishments with 20 to 49 employees employ disabled workers, compared with 82% of enterprises with 100 to 199 employees.
Hazard: "What a joy"
Before the Blues on Tuesday night at 20:45, Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens were not hiding the pleasure they had from this friendly match.
We won't go so far as to write that there was some collusion between them, but the picture is symbolic.
Sitting side by side in the stadium's auditorium, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard made peace.
Five months after his striker's gesture of humor against Turkey, the Belgian selector has nothing but praise for him.
"I am very pleased with Eden, its progress and the fact that it is Belgian".
"I want to go forward", assures the Lillois.
As for the contrast between his club performance and selection, "it is a whole, he justified himself".
"I'm in Lille all year round, which is not the case in Belgium".
"I need to take my marks".
Drafted against Romania on Friday night for the match against France, Hazard comes to Saint-Denis to finally "glow".
But we must not forget the concept of "pleasure".
He's been encouraging the Blues since he was seven years old and the winning campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
"I've always been patient", he says.
This is certainly contributing to the further strengthening of the "special" nature of this meeting.
Especially when facing, "there's Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) ", he recalls.
"We just met before".
"To be able to play against them is only happiness!"
Leekens, for his part, spoke of pride with a good sense of humor.
Pride of playing a gala game.
I am also proud to say - as a 'neighbour' - that France has 'returned to a very high level team' a little over a year after the Knysna trauma.
"Laurent Blanc did a thunder job", he said enthusiastically.
While Belgium will miss the next Euro, the technician would be happy to share the plane with the Blues heading to Brazil in 2014.
"Our little Belgians are getting big", he stressed.
"We're building something, the players are ambitious, they're hungry".
"You'll see that in the next game". That against France included.
Portugal is very confident
The Portuguese side of Paulo Bento is starting its return to Bosnia at 22h00 on Tuesday in Lisbon with a very optimistic attitude.
At first, both teams had lacked realism.
"At the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, most importantly, a happy country".
Paulo Bento has already been there, in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no doubt that the Selecçao, which he has been in charge since September 2010, will qualify for Euro 2012.
Portugal is actually only 90 minutes from happiness.
But there's a game to play, and an opponent, Bosnia, to unleash.
Given the 0-0 draw on Friday in the hell of Zenica, it seems obvious that the games are not done.
Portugal dominated the game for over an hour, but they were unable to score such a valuable goal, which would have relieved them.
"It's a good result, but it's also a risk because we didn't score goals outside".
But at their home, in the bright Luz Stadium in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced to pass in front of an audience that should be there as hot, even though the game is obviously "very tight", said an optimistic but lucid Bento.
"We expect a very tight game, but we are quite confident that we can take the lead", said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have a 50% chance of being at Euro 2012", said Carlos Queiroz' successor.
The result of the Bosnian draw on Friday forced the Portuguese to score and win.
One zero can be enough for the Bosnians, who also need to score.
"It's a good result, but it also carries some risk because we didn't score a goal on the outside", Bento regrets.
"We will play against a team that has many technical qualities and players with many individual qualities", he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will intend to put maximum pressure on the Bosnians to "not give them time to think".
That's a good idea, as long as we're realistic this time.
