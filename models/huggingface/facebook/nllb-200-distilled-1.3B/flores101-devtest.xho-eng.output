This not only proves that some dinosaurs had wings, a theory that has been widely accepted, but also provides information that mere bones cannot provide, such as color, shape and three-dimensional coordinates.
Scientists say the animal was brown with chestnut on top and a pink or carotenoid underneath.
The findings provide insight into the evolution of birds' wings.
Because dinosaur feathers fit into a shaped, rounded shape, called a rachis, but have other feather characteristics  barbs and barbules  researchers have speculated that rachis is more like a cake than other feathers.

In partnership with the NPWS and the Sport Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited, under the Sport Shooter Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Acting Director of Park Conservation and Heritage at NPWS, the first four shooters identified for the shoot have received full safety instructions and training.
Martelly swore in the new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) yesterday.
It is Martelly's fifth year of CEP in four years.
Last month a presidential commission recommended before the fall of the CEP a series of measures to bring the country closer to the vote.
The movement was Martelly's response to the revolutionary toys that had just begun in October.
Another violent protest was over a planned election in 2011.
With 60 cases of iPod malfunctions reported, causing six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 weapons-related hazards.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported 34 cases of extreme heat, which the company said were "not significant".
After Apple withdrew the report, the department breathed a sigh of "this is unfortunate".
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 a.m. local time (09:19 p.m. GMT on Friday).
The Northern emergency services office said no damage was reported nationwide.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center has said there is no sign of a tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman finally took Hong Kong tourists hostage by attacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six have died so far.
Six arrests, including children and adults, have been released early, as have the Filipino photographers.
Photographers took the place of an elderly woman as she searched for laundry.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began working as a doctor.
She trained as a gynaecologist and began working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to research premature birth in her spare time.
Her research showed that the use of hormones would help to accelerate the development of the embryonic lungs.
Xinhua reported that government investigators found two black boxes of the flight recorder on Wednesday.
Other wrestlers paid homage to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first boss. Luna died in the night of two months. She was just as beautiful as she was. Strong woman".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was not as dumb as I was ... maybe even more ... I love her and I will miss her ... hopefully she's in a better place".
Of the 1,400 people who voted in the 2010 election, those who opposed Australia becoming a republic increased by eight percent since 2008.
Concerned Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should be made a republic at the end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
Thirty-four percent of those who voted agreed, wanting Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
In the case of the extreme test, 29 percent of those surveyed believe that Australia should soon become a republic, while 31 percent believe that Australia should not become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and three Commonwealth Games events, but due to her complaints her fitness was questioned.
He was unable to take the necessary medication to overcome the pain as it was banned from the games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, found the largest known number to date on January 25.
Several people confirmed the finding using various hardware and software tools in early February and announced it on Tuesday.
Ice and vapor from space may have been the source of water to the earth, fueled by natural radiation that can produce proteins to sustain life.
Scientists are trying to understand how the continents formed, especially the Earth, because the lines intersect the Earth for a long time.
Cuomo, 53, took office earlier this year and signed a gay marriage bill last month.
He referred to gossip as political and bathing reasons.
He is projected to run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a program the FAA says can allow airlines to fly shorter distances and save millions of litres of fuel a year and reduce emissions.
It uses solar technology unlike the old one that used ground-radar technology to allow air traffic controllers to pinpoint the aircraft accurately and provide their pilots with accurate information.
No additional vehicles are placed and subways do not stop at Wembley, and car parks and parking and ride-hailing facilities are not available on the ground.
Fears of a lack of public transportation have led to threats that the match will be without supporters.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the presence of a new species of bird on the Ecuadorian island of Galápagos.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although they believed that this process took a long time, due to the breeding between the Darwin finch, Geospiza fortes, and the migratory cactus.
Gold can be formed from any life form. It can be formed from many small life forms.
It can be pulled from a wire that is curved and visible, and it can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin, and adheres to other metals. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-drawn pictures in books called "light manuscripts".
This is called the chemical pH. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The color of cabbage juice changes depending on whether it is acidic or alkaline.
The pH value is indicated by the amount of Hydrogen (H to pH) ions in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons whose electrons have been stripped away (since hydrogen atoms have one proton and one electron).
Shake the dry powder together and then, with clean hands, crush it into a paste.
The moisture in your hands will be absorbed by the outer skin, which will have an unusual sound and make a rash.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet in almost every home, which was fitted with a sophisticated sanitation system.
Remains of sewage technology have been found in Minoan city dwellings of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets existed in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman times, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women were mixed together.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite in the air receives the call and sends it back, as soon as possible.
Scientists use aerial telescopes because the earth's atmosphere interferes with our light and reflection.
It takes a rocket no more than 100 feet long to launch a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has revolved the world in the most amazing way. The best thing the wheel has done for us is to give us easy and fast transportation.
It brought us trains, cars, and other means of transportation.
Below them are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, many small cats (including free-ranging cats) eat most insect prey, mice, lizards and birds.
Their success is based on doing rare tasks, each cat has its own task that makes them uncompetitive with the others.
Lions are the most social of the big cats, called bubu.
A lion pack is made up of one to three adult males, and females and their young up to thirty.
Women are often related, forming a large family of sisters and their daughters.
Lion families are like wild dog families or simply dogs, predators like death and lions (but not other wild cats) in the wild, and they are a major threat to their prey.
A good circle runner, the tiger can climb (though with a handicap), run long distances, and pull five times the force of a strong man.
The tiger is in the same group as the lion, the leopard and the tigress. Only four cats can roar.
The grunting of the giant leopard is not like the full-grown grunting of the lion, but it is shorter than the snare, which shouts words.
Ocelots are predators of small animals, and will prey on monkeys, snakes, mice, and birds if they can.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find prey (they can eat) by sniffing, scratching, and scratching the surface of the ground.
They see well in the dark with night vision, and move about in hiding. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings and then throwing their prey.
When a species (a small group) is separated from its parent (a large group, such as a species that has been moved to a mountain or river, or to a new island so that it cannot easily return) it tends to find itself in a different society than it was before.
The new area has different equipment and different competition, so the new population will need new things or adaptations to compete more strongly than we did in the beginning.
The native population has not changed at all, still needing the same adjustments as before.
Over time, as young people begin to adapt to a new society, they gradually begin to become like other people.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two individuals will look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the creation of a new species of nature. Speciation is an inevitable consequence of a change.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe, and they absorb the carbon dioxide that humans emit (that is, they breathe out).
Plants use photosynthesis to produce food from sunlight and shade.
We build our homes from plants and make our clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat comes from plants. Without plants, animals cannot live.
The Mosasaurus reptiles were the most voracious predators of their time, so they were fearless only against other mosasaurs.
Its long teeth had more than 70 sharp teeth, as well as extra teeth in the jawbone, which meant that none escaped anything that passed in its path.
We are not sure, but it may have had two tongues. It ate large fish, other massours, and may have eaten meat.
It has been able to attack anything that comes into the water; even a giant dinosaur like T. Rex will not be able to resist it.
Although many of their foods are unfamiliar to us, the Roma have a side dish that is as awe-inspiring as wild boar, pikoko, mosquitoes, and the dormouse
Another difference was that while the poor and the woman ate their meals sitting on chairs, the rich men preferred to have dinners together where they would sit side by side while eating their meals.
Ancient Roman cuisine could not have been based on food from Europe to America or Asia centuries earlier.
For example, they had no corn, or tomatoes, or potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a temple to their goddess, which they considered to be the home of their god.
People would bring sacrifices to the gods and priests would try to satisfy the gods' demands by holding festivals and celebrations.
Each temple had an open courtyard, with an inner sanctuary that only the priests could enter.
Sometimes separate structures, called ziggurats, were built for membership in churches.
On top of your tower was an idol shrine.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, a home was not important.
Most of the life in the Hebrew family took place in outer space.
Women cooked in the yard; shops had counters facing the street.
And there are not many forests in the land of Canaan, so the timber is very expensive.
Greenland was settled slowly. In Norse sagas it is said that Erik the Red was banished to Iceland for murder, and when he travelled west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But despite this discovery, the Eskimo tribes were already living there.
Although each country was a 'Scandinavia,' there are many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have ever seen the movie National Treasure, you may think that a treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although the document has a message on the back, it is not a treasure map.
The back of the Declaration of Independence reads "First Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776", the text at the bottom of the document, reversed.
While no one knows who wrote it, it is known that from its earliest days, a large parchment document (measuring 293⁄4 by 241⁄2 inches) was folded up for preservation.
Now, it is likely that the seal was embedded as a bell.
The landing of D-Day and the ensuing battles liberated the north of France, but the south was not.
It was condemned by the "Vichy" French. These were Frenchmen who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of the census.
On August 15, 1940, the United Nations invaded southern France, in a campaign called Operation Dragoon.
Within two weeks, the allied armies had liberated southern France and were advancing on Germany.
Enlightenment is a single culture shared by a large group of people who live and interact in society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civilized, which is cognate with the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and in some sense describes the size of a community.
Urban cities are the hubs of nations. Civilized culture describes the transmission of knowledge from generation to generation, the cultural distance left and the appropriate distribution.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving a relevant historical record and are too small to be considered modern civilizations.
During the Civil War, thirteen states began to form a weak central government - with Congress the sole subordinate - the Articles of Confederation.
The legislature had no power to impose taxes, and it was for the reason that there were no national rulers or judges, that it depended on the government authorities, who had on occasion been uncooperative, to enforce all its laws.
It also had no authority to trample on the laws of taxes and tariffs between nations.
The Articles required the express consent of all the provinces before they could be changed and the provinces despised the central government so much that their representatives were not regularly present.
Italy national football team, along with the German national football team is the second most successful team in the world and were the winners of the 2006 FIFA World Cup
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, field hockey and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are popular in the Nordic countries, with Italians competing in the World Games and the Olympics.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the largest island in the world.
Because of Japan's archipelago, Japan is often called the "archipelago"
Taiwan dates back to the 15th century when European explorers who passed through recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or the beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, beginning a revolution in grain production and hiring Chinese laborers to work in the rice and sugar fields.
In 1683, Qing dynasty (1644-1912) forces took control of the western and northern coastal areas and Taiwan as a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after winning the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimoneki, in which it transferred the administrative authority of Taiwan to Japan, which controlled the island until 1945.
Manchu Pichu has three important buildings, called the Intihuanta, the Temple of the Sun, and the Three Windows.
Many of the buildings alongside the complex have been built to give tourists a better idea of their original appearance.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and the restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common ground photography is 35mm, which was the dominant film size in the late analog film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly its ratio was taken over by the digital camera image sensor format.
The 35 mm species is known to prefer a beak, 36 mm to the tail and 24 mm in length.
The radius format (dividing by twelve to get a simple whole-number radius) is said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS family of formats, for example) equal or approximate this equation.
The most misused and criticized rule of thirds is a simple guide to making changes while maintaining balance in the picture.
It says that the most useful part of the main subject is the intersection of lines that divide the image into vertical and vertical triangles (see example).
At this time in European history, the Roman Catholic Church, once rich and powerful, was viewed with suspicion.
For over a thousand years, Christianity united European nations despite their differences in ethnicity and culture.
It is an opposing force that affects from the king to the bridegroom.
One of the basic tenets of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and church funds exist primarily for that purpose.
The head of the church law had been in Rome for over a thousand years and the pressure of money and power made many doubt whether his constitution was correct.
Soon after the outbreak of the war, Britain began to blockade German coastlines with naval forces.
The plan seemed to work, cutting off vital military and stability support, although the ban violated a principle agreed to in international treaties two centuries earlier.
Britain had to block foreign waters to prevent ships from entering the sea, damaging innocent ships.
With no unusual response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response in its unrestricted naval warfare.
During the 1920's, the prevailing attitude of citizens and nations was one of peace and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, nations have longed to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to work for the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the US with 4 cents to his name, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his former job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a different way of marking different seasons; each stage of China or each ruling dynasty was a different class.
The most well-known of these periods was the Three Kingdoms epoch which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin Dynasties.
During these times a fierce war was raging between the royalists for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms Period was the bloodiest in ancient Chinese history, with many dying fighting for the highest seat in the imperial palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political consequences such as the adoption of the metric system, the shift from absolutism, to republicanism and nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to its people and not to the ruler alone.
And after the Revolutionary work is open to all applicants to allow the most prized and successful to win.
The same goes for the military because instead of the military being based on the class it is now based on the cailaber.
The French riots have also inspired many other oppressed workers abroad to start their own revolution.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond the ordinary. He frequented the cave known as "Hira'" on the "Noor" (light) mountain to meditate.
He was surrounded and survived these times, giving a clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclination.
Resting on the northern slopes of Mecca, the cave is isolated from the rest of the world.
After all, it's not easy to know if someone even knew it existed.
Nothing is visible except clear, beautiful clouds and many mountains around it. Little of the world can be seen or heard inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders still standing.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century, the Great Pyramid is one of the largest monuments built in honor of the late Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in Egypt's underworld district has many pyramids (of which the largest is also the widest), many tombs, many temples, and a great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The up-bow is V-shaped and the down-bow is a downward facing U or a square not complete on the down side.
High means you should start at the tip and push the bow, and low means you should start at the sling (where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
The upper arrow usually makes a low sound, while the lower arrow is strong and powerful.
Put your pencil notes freely, but remember that printed bending notes exist for the sake of music, so they should be respected.
The fearful King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette and their two children (eleven-year-old Marie Therese and four-year-old Louis-Charles) and the King's sister, Madame Elizabeth, on 6th October 1789 were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by the Malikean forces.
At the college, they head back to Paris with a crowd of people shouting and threatening the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to open the windows of the plane.
On one occasion a member of the mob beat the head of the royal guard who was executed at Versailles before the frightened Queen
The costs of U.S. imperialist warfare in taking over the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the US colonial authorities to cover the size of the expenditure and income of the Philippine government's bond on Wall Street housing bank.
Of course, the huge profits made from exploiting the Filipino people make up the profits of U.S. imperialism.
To understand the Templars one must understand the context which led to the formation of the Order.
The period in which the events took place is commonly referred to as the Middle Ages, the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300).
The Early Middle Ages preceded the High Middle Ages and were followed by the Late Middle Ages, usually ending in 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses many everyday things, from the technological advancement or technological importance to the rigorous conclusion that the future of man is the laws of science and its manifestation in technology.
Most of the conclusions of technological determinism are divided into two strategies: that technological development itself follows a path that is beyond the traditional or political hand, and that technology also has effects on independent nations, rather than those affected by humans.
For example, one might say that a vehicle leads to road development.
However, road connectivity is not a viable option for the small number of vehicles, so new development routes must be developed to reduce the cost of owning a shed.
More traffic leads to more traffic accidents, leading to new approaches to health care and physical therapy.
Romanticism had a great deal of cultural expression, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the case of Romanism, Geography shaped the people, and over time customs and cultures associated with that geography emerged, and these, in keeping with the social environment, were superior to established laws.
In this way Paris became known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was thought of as the fashion capital of ancient Europe.
Its reputation as the epicenter of luxury began about 400 A.D. and continued until it was hit by a storm about 1100 A.D.
Its popularity declined during the 12th century largely because travellers returned with gifts such as silk, spices that were valued above the Byzantine market offerings.
It was at this time that the title of Fashion Capital was moved from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th and 14th centuries.
The dress was originally heavily influenced by Byzantine eastern culture.
However, with slow communication, western styles could be 25 to 30 years behind.
In the late Middle Ages, western Europe began to develop its own style. The major development of the period was the use of buttons in clothing.
Sustainable agriculture is agriculture that is carried out with the aim of producing enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his household.
Simple, often fertilizer-based, live farming with a system of locally stored seeds combined with the circulation of a variety of crops or any type increases yields.
Historically most farmers were engaged in subsistence farming and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Small cultures bring together like-minded people who feel ignored by social norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may differ due to age, race, class, location, and/or gender of members.
Characteristics that define a different culture such as language, beauty, religion, politics, sexuality, geography, or a combination of factors.
Members of a culture often express their membership through distinctive and symbolic uses of style, including fashion, manners, and rhetoric.
One of the most common ways to illustrate the value of social interaction is to take a few unfortunate cases where children have been neglected, disaster-ridden, or deliberately abused, isolated from other people by people they had been dating while they were growing up.
Some natural children are confined by humans (usually their parents); in some cases the abandonment of a child was caused by the parents' denial of a severe mental or physical disability.
Abused children may have been severely abused before being abandoned or run away.
Some were blamed for being raised by animals; others were said to have lived alone in the wild.
When raised by an animal, a baby displays traits (which are inherent in the body) that are very similar to those of the animal that cared for him, such as fear, and a lack of judgment.
While project-based learning should make education easier and more interesting, the scaffolding stage takes a step forward.
Scaffolding is not a learning method but a support method that provides support to people learning new subjects such as using a computer program or starting a new job.
Scaffolds can look real and real, in other words, the teacher is a kind of scaffold but so is the paperclip person in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are internal to the software and are designed to query, accelerate, and explain processes that can be challenging for the learner to handle on their own.
Children are placed in Child Support for a variety of reasons ranging from neglect, abuse, and even robbery.
No child should grow up in an environment that is uneducated, uncaring, and uneducated, but it is possible.
We see the Child Care System as a safe haven for these children.
Our childcare system must provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
Child care should provide all the things that were lacking in the previous home.
The Internet combines both and connects people.
The clear nature of the Internet leads to other levels of usage and contentment.
For example, "learning" and "connecting with others" are suggested as important reasons for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
"Engagement" and "continuous relationships" were identified as new motivating factors by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when investigating audience responses to websites.
The use of video and recording has made important discoveries in understanding the subtle signs of facial changes, facial movements that last a few seconds.
In particular, it is said that one can tell when someone is lying by being able to interpret facial expressions accurately.
Oliver Sacks, in his essay The President's Speech, showed that people who cannot understand speech because of a brain injury can get to the truth more accurately.
He even suggests that a way to interpret human gestures may exist in animals such as domestic dogs.
Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two pockets of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutations add to the genetic diversity, and selection removes it from the pool of varieties shown.
The division and association of the species moves back and forth between the age-dividing apples.
In a plateau environment, it is difficult for man to establish his amino-acid requirements using available plants.
After all, doing so has dire consequences: increased stress, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The most readily available nutrients for plants are proteins found in leaves and legumes, but the products or people they eat are difficult to digest unless cooked.
On the other hand, animal food (ants, ants, eggs) is easily digested, and there are high-quality nutrients that contain all the amino acids.
All things considered, it should come as no surprise that our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way as the chimpanzees in the desert today.
Sleep apnea is a condition in which you wake up at your normal sleeping time and fall back asleep within 10 to 60 minutes.
This can be done easily by using a silent alarm clock to alert the mind without completely waking you up.
If you find that the timer keeps on turning off when it wakes you up, it can be moved to the other side of the bed, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of water (especially water or tea, known as dehydrating) before bed, forcing the person to get up to urinate.
The degree of peace a person has is proportional to the degree of physical and emotional distress a person has.
When stress is reduced, the energy to live becomes greater.
The only thing that stands in our way of this stage is our self-control and self-doubt.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but is supplemented by the Mahayana way of love and by many practices from Indian Yoga.
Essentially, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It includes Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of unconditional love.
With Kundalini Yoga the Kundalini energy (light energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and sight.
The center of Tibetan meditation is Divine Yoga. Through the vision of various deities the energy pathways are purified, the chakras are activated and the knowledge of enlightenment is achieved.
Germany was a major enemy during World War II, which led to a partnership between the USSR and the United States.
Two years after the war ended, former friends became enemies and the Cold War began.
It was to last for the next 40 years and be needed by armies from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba, and elsewhere.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish forces had been defeated, and the only hope was to retreat, making adjustments along the Romanian side of the bridge.
However, these plans were made impossible almost overnight, when more than 800,000 troops from the Soviet Union Red Army entered and created the Belarusian-Ukrainian borders after invading eastern Polish regions in defiance of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport cargo is the most accurate way to transport large numbers of people and cargo across coasts.
The role of ships has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move its people and goods, while at the same time, disrupting your enemy's ability to move people and goods.
One of the most notable examples was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. The Americans were standing by to transport men and equipment across the Atlantic Ocean to aid Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using mainly U-boats, tried to stop the vehicle.
If the Allies had failed, Britain would have been defeated by Germany because the rest of Europe was on its side.
Goats were apparently domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to preserve them to make it easier to obtain milk, hair, meat, and skins.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that roamed the hills or grazed any pasture, tended by shepherds who were usually young or young, like the famous shepherds.
Wagonways were being built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the chariots had wooden planks placed on the sides, they allowed horses to pull them at a greater speed and to carry heavier loads than on the rough roads of those days.
Crossties were introduced early on to hold the tracks in place. Each time, however, it was realized that the tracks would work better if they carried the metal overhead.
This was normal, but the iron caused the wheels of the chariot to wear out.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones. In 1767, the first iron railways were built.
The first walking was pedestrian, with humans beginning to walk upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (meaning upright man).
The Australopithecus' predecessors did not walk upright as they normally did.
Bipedal expertise has been found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 - 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start to be more environmentally friendly, we can join an environmental movement, and we can volunteer to reduce future suffering to some extent.
This is like treating a habit in most cases, but if we don't want a short-term solution, we need to look for the causes, to stop them.
Clearly, the world has changed dramatically because of advances in science and technology, and the problems have been exacerbated by overpopulation and a deprived lifestyle.
After it was passed by the legislature on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Speaker John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to printers near John Dunlap's shop.
During the night between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as "Dunlap broadsides".
The first reading of the document was by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, which was to be read to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides are the oldest known copies of the document. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Most paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive today.
Most people don't think of dinosaurs as creatures because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that are like dinosaurs.
They have shelled legs and claws, lay eggs, and walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
In theory all computers in use today rely on the playback of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number is a two-digit number, that is, 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits  or bits when used in computer programming.
The symptoms, such as vomiting, are so common that they are not a symptom.
The most obvious sign of internal obesity is the presence of a container of a dangerous medication or household chemical.
Check the first-aid instructions for certain poisons.
Photographers later took the place of an elderly lady as she searched for a lavatory.
The name is derived from the ancient association with bed bugs, insects that can eat humans.
Both the Assassin-bugs and the Bed-bugs are non-nocic, arranged to live in the nest or houses of their host.
In the United States of America, there are about 400,000 people known to have Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the leading mental illness among young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Studies have found that females are twice as likely to develop MS as males.
A couple may decide that it is not suitable for them, or they may think that it is better for them, to adopt their child.
The couple may decide to make an adoption plan.
In the case of adoption, the biological parents give up their parental rights to allow the other couple to take over the child's custody.
The main goal of science is to discover how the universe works in a scientific way, which is the basis for most scientific research.
Not only that, an experiment is a test used to rule out one or more hypotheses, ask questions and make observations that guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on ancient texts and, especially, on the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all aspects of science, including psychology, were accepted.
Even as Greek knowledge declined, Westerners found themselves cut off from their Greek intellectuals and their scientific roots.
Many observe rhythms in appearance and patterns that depend largely on the existence of these endogenous cycles and their development over time.
The rhythm of the seasons, not merely a response to the external forces of the seasons, has been recorded in many organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks create oscillators that will continue to rotate freely even without external signals.
The Hershey and Chase experiment is one of the key suggestions that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to insert their DNA into a virus.
They performed two tests to identify either DNA in a page containing radioactive phosphorus or a phage protein containing explosive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the piece of genetic material involved, and whether the affected cells are germ-line cells.
Only changes in the cells of the viral line can be passed on to children, while changes elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts tourists who are interested in nature, including plants and wildlife.
Examples of activities on the site include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, visiting parks, and learning about nature.
An example is to visit, photograph and learn about organgatuangs in orneo.
Every morning, people leave the country's villages in cars to their workplaces and are passed by other workers in the area they have just left.
In this flexible transport shuttle everyone is somehow connected to, and supported by, a private car-based transport system.
Science now shows that the carbon economy has shifted in the biosphere from one of its stable states that supported human evolution two million years ago.
Everyone is involved in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, complaints about water quality and the collapse of bridges are common.
Why do transport systems cause such complaints, why do they fail every day? Are transport engineers unable to work? Or is something more important happening?
Motor transport is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles from one place to another and how they interact with one another.
Unfortunately, learning the volume of traffic is difficult because the driver's behavior cannot be perfectly predicted.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave well within the appropriate range; therefore, traffic currents tend to have good consistency and can be represented statistically.
To be a better representative of traffic flow, a relationship is established between three key characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
This interaction helps to plan, design, and operate roads.
Insects were the first animals to fly, and their ability to fly makes it easier for them to avoid predators and to find food more easily.
Most insects have the ability to fold their wings sideways.
This gives them many small hiding places from other animals.
Today, insects that cannot fold their wings are flies and mosquitoes.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System revolves around the Sun.
Some people thought he was right but many believed otherwise; that the Solar System revolved around the earth, including the sun (and other stars).
It seems to be in the mind, because the Earth doesn't seem to be moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river in the world, with more than eight times the volume of the second largest river.
The Amazon is the world's largest river, sometimes up to six miles wide.
A total of 20 percent of the water that flows from the world's rivers to the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River is 6,387 miles (3,980 km) long and draws water from thousands of streams.
Although stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, the Giza pyramids were not surpassed in size and perfection.
The new kingdom of ancient Egypt was amazed by its ancient monuments, which were more than a thousand years old.
The Vatican City is the world's smallest independent country with the smallest population.
Vatican City uses Italian for administrative and official correspondence.
Italian is also the language of the working class and Latin is used for religious ceremonies.
The Vatican is almost entirely Roman Catholic.
People have known about the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, as they can all be found in nature in a natural way and are very easy to mine with ancient tools.
The philosopher Aristotle taught that everything was made up of a mixture of one or four elements - earth, water, air, and fire.
This was similar to the four sides of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he thought they changed into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are mixtures of two or more metals.
Metals such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Yes, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
It is also possible to obtain alloys that include a small number of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything on earth is made up of matter, which is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so tiny that trillions of them combine to form a comma at the end of a sentence.
Thus, the pencil became the most trusted friend of many people when it was first invented.
Sadly, as new writing techniques have developed, the pencil has been reduced to a minor role and use.
People now text on computer screens, never even approaching the driver.
One may wonder what the keyboard will be like when something new comes along.
The fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to combine a nucleus with more protons and neutrons.
It is like lifting a cart up a hill, and the re-division of the nucleus releases some of this energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei which means they are usually decaying with little or no suspicion.
The Moon's surface is made of rocks and dust.
The land slopes 70 metres and slopes 100 km in the far side.
It is thin below the port and thick below the high ground.
There may have been more maria on the near side because the crust is thinner.
Context theory focuses on finding what makes people mark or refer to them.
These theories suggest that humans have certain needs or desires that have been retained internally as a person grows older.
These theories look at what motivates people to do what they do and what environmental factors influence them to do what they do.
Two well-known theories are Themous' Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Herzberg's Two Factor Theory.
In general, two behaviors may emerge as managers begin to lead their former peers. one end of the show tries to remain "one of the guys" (or gals).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking corrective action, evaluating performance, assigning responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
On the other hand, a change-maker is a stranger who feels that he must change everything that the group has done and make it his own.
In everything, the leader is always responsible for the success or failure of his team.
This practice tends to have consequences that create a gap between the leaders and the group as a whole.
Internet service providers must meet the same standards as the general public, but there are slight differences.
The members of the appropriate group always act as a point of contact with their body group.
They are often more independent than members of the regular group as their groups may meet at different times that are not understood by their local superiors.
The existence of a real "invisible" group (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also unique to the visible group.
Invisible Panel is the executive body to which officers report. Invisible Panel sets the rank of each officer.
Why would an organization want to go the time-consuming route of setting up a learning organization? One purpose of setting up learning organization contracts is to design.
When all tools are used appropriately in all parts of the organization, professionalism and integrity can be evident.
As a result, a cooperative system to overcome the barrier may lead to a new system to serve the needs of the customer.
Before a company can innovate, managers must establish a culture of innovation and sharing of knowledge and learning.
Angel (2006) describes the Continuity approach as the most commonly used method to help organizations achieve high performance.
Neurobilogy data provides tangible evidence for the theory of brain research, and so it narrows the research down to a very specific one.
The relationship between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in research
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, injuries, ulcers, and sores affect behavior and cause changes in certain brain functions.
The rise of new technology allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes that have never been seen before.
This provides us with a wealth of information and tools to simulate what is going on in our mind.
Although AI is a pseudoscience, AI forms an important foundation in the field of computer science dealing with behavior, learning and machine intelligence.
Research into AI involves making machines that automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and punctuality, the ability to respond to customer miscommunications and questions, the ability to identify the handwriting, the ability to identify voice and face.
Such things have been divided into sections, aimed at providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI is now commonly used in the economic, medical, engineering and military sectors, as it has been built into computer and video game software applications.
Educational tours are a big part of any classroom, and the teacher often likes to take his students to places where the bus is not available.
Technology offers a solution through virtual field trips. Students can look at artifacts, visit an aquarium, or see fine art while sitting in their classroom.
Taking a walk is almost another way to get acquainted and discuss ideas with future students.
For example, every year students from the Bennet School in North Carolina create a website about their trip to the State Capital, every year the website is updated, but older versions are kept online to serve as scrapbooks.
Blogs can help improve readers' writing. Although readers often bring back their blog experiences with poor grammar, and with poor spelling, the presence of readers often changes that.
Since readers are often the audience with something to say, the blogger begins to work on improving his writing style to avoid criticism.
Blogging also "forces readers to become more aware of the world around them". The need to nurture the audience's interest encourages readers to be intelligent and curious (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that encourages collaboration, and encourages students to expand their learning beyond the traditional school setting.
The effective use of blogs "can empower readers to be more analytical and critical; by actively responding to online resources, readers can express their position in the context of others' writings and express their own views on particular issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is a beautiful capital of Canada with a bilingual or multilingual population, several galleries, and museums that showcase Canada's history and modernity.
To the south is Niagara Falls and to the north is home to the natural beauty not only of Muskogee and beyond.
All these and other features make Ontario a typical Canadian territory.
The larger northern areas are sparsely populated and some are almost entirely populated.
A population comparison that shocks many: More African Americans live in the US than in Canada.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest continent, and it is isolated in terms of wildlife.
Many of the smaller islands become independent nations, or associated with France, known for their quality recreational beaches.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the countries, and it took a major turn in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vaco da Gama discovered the Cape route from Europe to India.
The region is bounded on the north by the Sahel, and on the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that women who travel say they are married, whether married or unmarried.
It is also helpful to wear a ring (but not to look too intimidating).
Women need to understand that cultural differences can lead to what they perceive as abuse and are not usually followed, held by the arm, etc.
Be sure to say no to men, and don't be afraid to stand up for yourself (cultural differences or not, don't make it right!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BCE, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids as a port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it again after an earthquake in 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Daru Badya and renamed it Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the most attractive shopping areas in Morocco.
In the old Medina it is easy to find stalls selling traditional Moroccan garments, such as tags, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and full gegaws, but all for tourists.
Goma is a popular tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo on the eastern side of the border with Rwanda.
In 2002 Goma was devastated by the eruption of Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city streets, especially the city center.
While Goma is reasonably secure, all visits outside Goma must be investigated to understand the situation of the ongoing fighting in the North Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for the Nyiragongo volcano, as well as other affordable mountains for African Gorillas.
You can take the boda-boda (motorized taxi) to get to the areas in Goma. The usual (local) fare is 500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
Coupled with its inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has been used as a metaphor for far, far away lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor town, despite its name, that attracts tourists, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was placed on the list of world heritage sites in danger, due to its desert sands.
It was one of the main stops during Henry Louis Gates' PBS special The Wonder of Africa.
The city is unlike any other city in the country, as it is more Arab than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) lies in northeastern South Africa and is bordered by Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the southern border is the Crocodile River.

It is one of the most attractive sites in South Africa and is considered the centrepiece of South Africa's National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African Parks, there is maintenance and entrance fees.
It may be useful for a person to purchase a Wild Card, which allows access to certain South African parks or all South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives the territory of Hong Kong its name and is a popular tourist destination.
The cluster of buildings that make up the skyline of Hong Kong is compared to the glittering bar chart that is reflected by the presence of Victoria Harbour.
To get a good view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head for the Kowloon waterfront.
Much of the urban development on Hong Kong Island has been built on land that was once the north sea.
This is the area the British colonialists took and so if you want evidence of the region's past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the world's longest coastal strip, stretching 80 km (50 mi) inland from Bangladesh and inland from India.
The Sundarbans is declared as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The forested part of the Indian subcontinent is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are mangrove swamps - but they include the last remnants of the vast forests that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, of which about one third is covered by water/marshes.
Since 1966 the Sundabans have been a wildlife sanctuary, and there are now an estimated 400 Royal Bengal tigers and 30,000 extinct tiger cubs.
Buses leave the inter-district station ( across the river) throughout the day, although some, especially those heading east and Jakar/Bumthang run between 06:30 and 07:30.

The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational by September 2017, when the customs clearance points in Brazil are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group in what is now Eastern Paraguay who lived a hunter - farmer lifestyle.
The Chaco region was home to indigenous groups such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, who lived by hunting, harvesting, and fishing.
In the 16th century Paraguay, once called "The Giant Province of the Indies", was formed as a result of the invasions of Spanish conquistadors and indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a three-century colonial period.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve its rich heritage.

There are no "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall remains the same throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are used to seeing humans, wildlife is wild and should not be disturbed.
According to park authorities, stay at least 100 yards/meter away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meter away from all other wildlife!
No matter what they look like, buffalo, elk, deer, bears, and almost any large animal can attack you.
Every year, tourists get hurt because they don't keep a good distance. These animals are big, aggressive and dangerous, so give them space.
Also, be aware that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so be careful about handling or cooking food and keep the camp clean.

Booking in advance gives passengers the peace of mind that they will have some room to sleep once they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents have agreements with certain hotels, and you may also find it possible to book other types of accommodations, such as camping, through travel agents.
Travel agencies usually provide packages that include breakfast, arrangements for transportation to/from the airport or combined plane and hotel packages.
They can also save your booking for when you need time to think about a gift or try out other travel documents (e.g. a visa).
Any changes or requests should be made first to the tour operator rather than directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, most music festival attendees end up camping out at the festival site, and many attendees consider it an important part of their experience.
If you want to be near the sound, you will need to arrive early and find a campsite near the music.

Be careful not to let the cloth become too hot (which can cause it to shrivel, or even burn)
There are many methods of water purification, some of which are particularly effective in eliminating obvious problems.
In some places a minute's boiling is sufficient, while in others more than a minute is necessary.
Filters vary in their performance, so if you are not sure, consider buying your bottled water from a reputable company.
The nomads may encounter insects from animals they are not familiar with in their neighborhood.
Insects can spoil food, cause poverty, in extreme cases cause allergies, increase venom poisoning, or spread infection.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people, are not called epidemics.

Stirrups are supports for the driver that hang from the bottom of the foot on the sides.
They provide more support for the rider but may be a safety concern because the rider's legs may become trapped in them.
If a rider falls from a horse and his foot gets caught in the stirrups, he may be pulled over if the horse runs away. To reduce the risk, several factors must be considered first.
First, many riders wear high-heeled boots and a tight sock and a sling.
Next, some Salis, especially English ones, have safety features that cause leather belts to fall out of the saddle if pulled back by a falling rider.

If conditions allow, you will be able to walk longer distances than you would if you walked  but you will rarely be able to ski at the speed of a stick without a backpack on the paved trails.
Europe is a small continent but a vast number of independent countries. Under normal circumstances, travel to many countries may require frequent travel on a visa and a passport.
The Schengen zone, however, operates as if it were a single country.
If you live in the area, you will cross the border without going through the passport control points again.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for visas for various Schengen countries, saving you time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universally accepted definition of antiquity, and some tax authorities classify items over 100 years old as antiquities.

Handmade products can be considered old, although they may be newer than similar mass-produced products.
Reindeer herding is an important way of life for the Sámi, and the tradition associated with this trade is also important for people who do other professions.
Traditionally, though, not all Sámi are involved in the hunting of the shrimp, living off fishing, hunting and the like, with the shrimp as working animals.
Today, many Sámi work in the timber industry, and tourism is the main source of income in Sápmi, a Sámi community.
Although commonly used, especially by non-Romani people, the term "Gypsy" is considered derogatory because it is associated with prejudice and prejudice against the Romani people.
If the country you are visiting has travel advice, your travel insurance or cancellation insurance may be affected.
You may also want to consider government advice rather than just your own, but his advice is for the people of their community.
For one example, American residents in the Middle East may encounter different conditions than European or Arab ones.
A briefing is a summary of the political situation in a country.
The opinions expressed are often disparaging, inclusive and overly biased when compared to the information available elsewhere.
Bad weather is simply an umbrella term for any description of weather that has the potential to cause great damage, disruption, and loss of life.
