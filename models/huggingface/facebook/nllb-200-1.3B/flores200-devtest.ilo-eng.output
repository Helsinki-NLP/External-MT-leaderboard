Not only does this prove that some of the dinosaurs had feathers, a theory has circulated, but it also provides details that fossils generally do not, such as color or three-dimensional order.
Scientists say that the fur of this animal is shaped like an upper chestnut with a smooth or carotenoid-colored belly.
Their discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since dinosaur feathers were not made with fine horns, called rachis, but with other features such as feathers  horns and small spines  researchers have suggested that the monkeys may be the last evolutionary improvement they show.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight but rather for temperature control as shown. The researchers suggested that even if this was the tail of a young dinosaur, the feather sample would show an adult rather than a pig.

The road where the accident occurred was still temporarily closed during the emergency services' release of the driver of the red-shouldered Audi TT.
He was first hospitalized at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya was tried in Edinburgh Sheriff's Court for the murder of her son.
He is in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but any witness evidence may be tainted by the publication of his picture.
This is a common occurrence in the UK but in Scottish justice it is a different matter and the courts will view the release of images as possibly different.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee wrote that Journalists are walking a dangerous line when they publish images such as rooftops.
The Crown Office, the main prosecutor, told the press that no further comment would be given until the lawsuit was settled.
The document, according to the leak, was about what the borders were, which Palestine wanted to base on the borders before the 1967 Mideast War.
Other discussions it covers are the future state of Jerusalem as sacred to the nations and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel has been demanding a continuing military presence in the valley for ten years once the treaty is signed while the PA has agreed to allow that military presence for only five years.
Shooters at the pest control experiment were closely monitored by rangers, for the experiment was monitored and its effectiveness was measured.
In partnership with the NPWS and the Sporting Shooting Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers are called in, through the sporting shooting program of the Sporting Shooting Association.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Acting Director of Park Conservation and Heritage with the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received comprehensive safety instruction and training.
Martelly swore in yesterday the new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the former CEP as part of efforts to prepare the nation for new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
Violent protests have sometimes been over the failure to hold elections, some as far back as 2011.
At least 60 cases of iPod breakdowns and burns were reported, ending six fires and suffering four people in the process.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said that it was aware of 27 industrial accidents.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had notified them of 34 additional incidents of overheating, which the company considered "not serious".
The ministry responded by calling Apple's delay in reporting a "deplorable delay".
An earthquake struck in the Mariana at 07:19 am local time (9:19 pm GMT Friday).
The Northern Marianas administration office said that no damage was reported in the nation.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said that there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman took tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking the buses in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza threw an M16 rifle at the tourists.
Many of the survivors were captured and fewer than six were confirmed dead.
Six of the captives, including children, were elderly, and they were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers soon took the place of an elderly woman who needed a maid.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and entered a career in medicine.
She trained as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began investigating preterm birth in her spare time.
His findings show that when the hormone is released it accelerates the maturing of the fetal breath.
Xinhua said that government investigators recovered two black-collar recorders on the flight on Wednesday.
Luna also received honors from fellow wrestlers.
Tommy Dreamer says Luna was the first Extreme Queen. My first manager. Luna died in the night two months later. She was different. She was a strong woman.
Dustin Goldust Runnels says Luna is a comedian just like me... maybe even worse... I love her and miss her... I wish she was in a better place.
Of 1,400 people polled prior to the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia's becoming a republic have increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Caretaker Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the campaign for the 2010 federal election that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
The opinion of 34 percent of those polled was the same, wanting Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
In contrast to the final poll, 29 percent of those polled believed that Australia should become a republic in the short term, and 31 percent believed that Australia should not become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist swam the 100m and 200m freestyle and three relay events at the Commonwealth Games, but his claims cast doubt on his health.
She was unable to take the medication she needed to cope with her pain because it was banned at the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number discovered to date on January 25.
Several people confirmed the discovery using various hardware and software in early February and it was announced on Tuesday.
The bands may be the birthplace of water on earth along with organic matter that can make protein and support life.
Scientists hope to understand the formation of the planets, especially the Earth, because comets collided with the Earth in ancient times.
Cuomo, 53, began his term as governor earlier this year and signed a bill last month to legalize same-sex marriage.
He called the gossip political and ridiculous.
It is estimated that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says will allow commercial vehicles to fly on short-haul routes and save millions of gallons of oil per year and cut carbon emissions.
This is used in satellite-based technology versus older ground-based radar technology to allow air traffic controllers to pinpoint the exact location of the aircraft and provide pilots with accurate information.
No extra cars were put on and the above-ground train did not stop at Wembley, and on-site parking and passenger facilities were not available on site.
Concerns about the lack of transportation have raised the possibility that the game will be forced to be played indoors without the teams' supporters.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reports the formation of a new bird species on Ecuador's Galapagos Island.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that new species evolve over two generations, but this process is believed to be long-lasting, due to the breeding of the endemic Darwin finch, Geospiza fortes, and the migrating cactus funch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be cut into many different shapes, and it can be made into tiny pieces.
It can be cut into thin strips, which can be pulled and welded, or it can be rolled or rolled into a thin, flat shape.
It can be made so thin that it is sometimes used to decorate hand-painted illustrations in books called transparent manuscripts.
You can make a substitute using a source of red cabbage.
The source of the cabbage varies in color depending on how much acid or basic (alkaline) chemical is present.
The pH level is determined by the number of Hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the detected chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost electrons (since hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Kill the two dry powder together and, using a clean washed hand, press them together to form a ball.
The fluid in your hand interacts with the external tissues, which produce a pleasant sensation and form a shell-like structure.
Flush toilets are found in almost every house in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro , connected to a beautiful sewage system.
Remnants of household sewage systems have been found in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
In ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, toilets were sometimes part of a public bathhouse where men and women shared the common room in a group of troops.
If you were calling someone thousands of miles away, you would be using a satellite.
A satellite in space will pick up your call and instantly drop it back to earth.
Scientists use space telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere absorbs some of the light and allows it to be seen.
A giant rocket more than 100 feet [100 m] high would be needed to launch a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in a wonderful way. The great things the wheel has done for us have given us ease and speed in moving.
This led to the development of trains, automobiles, and many other forms of transportation.
Many smaller cats eat smaller animals such as rabbits, antelopes, and buffaloes.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free-ranging domestic cats) that feed on distant and more small animals such as insects, rats, wasps, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of the niche, a special work that cats hold that does not allow them to fight.
Lions are the most sociable of cats, living in large groups called pride.
The pride included one to three male members, and up to thirty women and children.
Women were generally close relatives, like a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion herds act like wolf or dog herds, predators that are as demanding as lions (but not other big cats) in their nature, and even more dangerous to their prey.
A skilled athlete, the tiger can swim (but not very well), swim long distances and pull five times the force of a strong man.
The tiger is a member of the same group (Genus Panthera) as the lion, leopard, and jaguar, and these four cats are the only ones that roar.
The roar of the tiger is not the full-throated roar of a lion, but it is like a sentence with a wild, shouted phrase.
The ocelot's favorite food is small animals, such as snakes, frogs, and birds, which it preys on when it is able to do so.
Scientists think that ocelots track and hunt prey by smell, tapping on the ground.
They are able to see well in the dark by night vision, and they can move in secret.
When a small group of organisms (small populations) are separated from the dominant populations from which they originate (such as moving across a mountain or river, or moving to a new island so that they cannot easily return) they often find themselves in a different environment than they were before.
With a diverse range of resources and competitors, this new environment requires a new population of different traits or habits to become more competitive than it once was.
Not only has its original population remained the same, but it still needs the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the population began to move into its new surroundings, they began to look different from other populations.
Eventually, over a thousand or a million years, the two populations will be so different in appearance that they will no longer be considered the same species.
The inevitable result of speciation is a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen, which humans breathe, and absorb carbon dioxide, which humans emit (which is the exhaust gas).
Plants produce food from the sun by photosynthesis.
We make our houses out of plants, we make our clothes out of plants, we eat most of our food from plants, and without plants, animals cannot live.
Mosasaurus was the primary predator of small animals in its day, so it was not feared by anyone, except its fellow Mosasaurs.
Its long beak is lined with 70 razor-sharp teeth, as well as an extra set of teeth in the roof of its mouth, meaning that it has no escape from anything it encounters.
We cannot be certain, but it may have a branching tongue, and its diet includes snails, large fish, other mammals, and possibly even a cannibal.
It also attacks anything that goes into the water; even giant dinosaurs like T. rex are powerless to fight it.
While most foods were familiar to us, the Romans had a strange or unusual feature at the feast, along with wild boar, paboreal, birruruku, and a species of rat they called dormouse.
One oddity was that while these poor people and the woman had changed and ate the food that was currently sitting on the bench, the rich men wanted a bench that could be a lounge to sit on while they ate.
The diet of ancient Rome may not have included foods that came to Europe from the Americas or from Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, or tomatoes, or potatoes, or cocoa, and the ancient Romans never tasted the spice.
The Babylonians built their gods in temples that they claimed were the house of a god.
The people brought their sacrifices to the gods and the priests tried to satisfy the gods' needs through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open vault and an inner sanctuary that was open only to priests.
Sometimes towers shaped like unusual pyramids, called ziggurats, are made as a part of temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
The warm climate of the Middle East, the house is not very crowded.
Much of the life of Hebrew families was a matter of uncertainty.
Women cooked in front of their houses; shops were open tables in the street; houses were built of stone.
The land of Canaan was not very fertile, so timber was very expensive.
Greenland was not settled much, and Norse mythology tells that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and on his journey westward he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
Despite the lack of discovery, Eskimo tribes still remained there at the time.
Although the country as a whole is Scandinavian, Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland have many different peoples, kings, customs and histories.
If you have seen the film National Treasure, you might imagine that there is a treasure map inscribed on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Even if the document had a written inscription on the back, it was not a treasure map.
Inscribed on the back of the Declaration of Independence are the words Original Declaration of Independence dated 4 July 1776.
No one really knows who wrote them, but it is known that early in his life, a large parchment document (measuring 29 3⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was rolled up for storage.
Thus, they may have added a notation as simple as a label.
The D-Day landings and the ensuing battles liberated the north of France, but the south was still not.
The French defeated the Vichy, who were Frenchmen who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and had worked with the victors rather than against them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies attacked southern France, the attack being called Operation Dragoon.
Within two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces had opened up southern France and were on their way to Germany.
A civilization is a culture in which a dominant group of people live and work together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and which in turn gives meaning to the size of society.
The city-states were the first to form a nation. Civilized culture implies a succession of generations, a continuous flow of culture and a fair distribution.
Minor cultures often disappear without any valuable historical evidence and are not recognized as a full-fledged civilization.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states formed a weak central government Congress was the only one involved under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress lacks the power to impose taxes, and, therefore, without a national executive or judiciary, they rely on government authorities, often uncooperative, to enforce all its laws.
Nor does it have the power to change the tax laws and tariffs between states.
The Articles required unanimous consent from all the states before they could be amended and the states were not given much attention by the central government and often had no representatives.
The Italian national football team, as well as the German national football team, are the second most successful team in the world and were the champions of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the Northern regions, and Italians compete in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Because Japan's islands are contiguous, Japan's geography is often referred to as an "archipel".
Taiwan dates back to the 15th century when the island was named Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island, by seafarers from Europe.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwest Taiwan, pioneering the reform of aboriginal grain production and hiring Chinese laborers to work for the rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing (1644-1912) dynasty forces captured the western and northern coasts of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded Taiwan's sovereignty to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu contains three major structures, named Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Lakes.
Most of the buildings along the complex have been remodeled to give tourists a better idea of what they once looked like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Pichu had been restored and restoration is still underway today.
For example, the standard format of photographic film worldwide is 35mm, which was the most widely used film size before the end of the analog film era.
It is still inventive, but most importantly, the aspect ratio is inherited from the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
In fact, the 35mm format is deceptively long, 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The ratio of this form (each measure divided by 12 to get the smallest integer) is said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS family of formats, for example) are similar or closely related to this aspect ratio.
The often-abused and often-discredited rule of thirds is a simple guide to creating dynamism while maintaining the measure of order of an image.
This suggests that the most efficient location for the main object is at the intersection of the line that divides the picture of the three buildings and the floor (see example).
In the European past, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was the subject of a search.
For over a thousand years the Christian religion united the states of Europe despite differences in language and culture.
In his extensive rule he affects everyone from the king to the common people.
One of the basic Christian teachings that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty is that church funds are earmarked for that purpose.
The center of church authority has been in Rome for over a thousand years and, as the center of power and money, many have questioned whether this teaching can be practiced at all.
Shortly after the war broke out, Britain began to intercept German shipping.
The measure, the withdrawal of necessary military and civilian supplies, has proved effective, but this closure violates the generally accepted international law provided for by several treaties of the last two centuries.
Britain had given mines to international waters to prevent any ships from entering the entire ocean, posing a danger even to neutral ships.
With limited response to these tactics, Germany expected a similar response for the inevitable submarine warfare.
In the 1920's, the dominant attitude of most people and countries was pacifism and selfishness.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, nations wanted to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla traveled to the United States to accept a job with the Esidon Company in New York city.
He arrived in the US with only 4 cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his first job) for Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had different ways of showing time; each part of China or each ruling family was a different dynasty.
And between each dynasty was a tumultuous period of provincial division, the most famous of which was the Three Kingdoms period that spanned 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
In these times fierce wars have occurred with many rulers fighting for the throne.
In the Three Kingdoms was one of the bloody times of the past in Ancient China thousands of people died fighting just to sit in the highest position in the great palace in Xi'an.
Many of the social and political effects include the adoption of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the nation is a body of people rather than a single head.
Even after the Revolution, the workshops were open to all male applicants who allowed ambitious and talented men to succeed.
So too are the military, which now classifies soldiers by caliber rather than by class.
The French Revolution inspired many other persecuted working-class people in other nations to start their own revolution.
Muhammad was deeply interested in things beyond ordinary life, and he often went to a cave known as Hira on Mount Noor (light) to meditate.
The cave itself, which still exists today, gives clear evidence of Muhammad's interest in spiritual things.
Perched atop a mountain north of Mecca, the cave is cut off from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is hard to find even if we know it exists.
Nothing is visible except the clear, beautiful sky above and the many surrounding mountains.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that has ever stood.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BCE, the Great Pyramids are one of many large pyramidal structures built in honor of the late Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or Giza Necropolis in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, has several pyramids (the great pyramid being the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the majestic Sphinx.
The great pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wife and family members.
The up bow is V-shaped and the down bow" is a staple or a square with a downward slope.
Up means you start at the end and pull the arrow, and down means you start with the frog (the hand holding the arrow) and pull the arrow.
The up-bow is usually a weak one, but the down-bow is strong and firm.
Feel free to write your own stamp, but remember that the printed stamp is for musical purposes, and it needs to be honored.
A group of women merchants forced the terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette and their two children (11 years old Marie Therese and four years old Louis-Charles) and the King's sister Madam Elizabeth, to return to Paris from Versailles, on the 6th of October 1789.
On the train, they traveled back to Paris surrounded by crowds screaming and disappearing threats against the King and Queen.
The King and Queen were pressured by a group of quarrelsome people to open the windows of their chariots.
On one occasion, a member of a disorderly crowd held up the head of a royal guard executed at Versailles before the terrified Queen.
The Filipinos paid the war costs of U.S. imperialism for their occupation of the Philippines
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial government of the United States to pay the bulk of the costs and interest on bonds used on behalf of the Philippine government by Wall street banks.
Of course, the superprofits derived from long-term exploitation of the Filipinos constitute the core of U.S. Imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context of why this movement was motivated.
The period in which such events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, the period in European history of the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended in 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas that are in common use, such as the creation of a product because of technology or the use of technology for profit and the strict idea that human destiny is governed by invisible logic connected to the laws of science and what technology reveals.
Most interpretations of technological determinism give two ideas: that the production of technology follows a path that goes beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology also has an effect on inherited meetings, rather than on those conditioned to the meeting.
For example, one might argue that a motor car should lead to road improvements.
For example, having a national highway system was expensive when cars were scarce, so new methods of car manufacturing were developed to make the car more affordable.
Mass car representation also stops the higher incidence of street accidents, which has led to the development of new health-care techniques to organize the disabled.
Romanticism has a large cultural determining element, drawing on writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography elevates individuals, and over time practices and cultures associated with that geography evolve, and these, having a place of meeting, are superior to arbitrary laws.
Just as Paris is the famous fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople is also said to be the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its popularity as a center of affluent life, beginning in 400 A.D. and lasting until about 1100 A.D.
Its status in the early twelfth century was diminished by the fact that the Crusaders returned with supplies of silk and rubber more expensive than Byzantine wares.
This period was marked by the shift of the title of Fashion Capital from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style was promoted in the period between the 10th-11th century and the 14th century.
Clothing was originally heavily influenced by Byzantine cultures in the east.
However, because of long communication, western styles last for 25 to 30 years.
By the end of the Middle Ages, western Europe was beginning to develop its own style, with one of the greatest flows of the period as a result of the Crusades, when people began to use buttons to fasten their shoes.
A subsistence farm is one that is used for the production of enough food for the farmer and his family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, mostly organic, system that uses stored seed grown locally and added crop rotation techniques or other simple techniques to increase yields.
Historically, many farmers have made a living by farming and this practice is still practiced in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together identity-minded individuals who feel left out of the meeting and allow them to create a sense of identity.
Subcultures are distinguished by age, ethnicity, class, location, and/ or gender of members.
The qualities that make a subculture unique may be language, appearance, religion, politics, sexuality, geography, or social cohesion.
Members of a subculture often identify their membership by distinctive and symbolic use of style, including fashionable items, characteristics, and language.
One of the common systems for demonstrating the value of interaction is to take the rare failures of children who, because of neglect, degradation, or abuse, are overlooked by an adult as they grow up.
Some feral children are abused by tattoos (often by their parents); in some cases, this abandonment is due to the parents' rejection of a child's severe mental or physical weakness.
Children who are isolated from society may have experienced severe abuse or extreme hardship before they were abandoned or fled.
Some are thought to have been raised by animals; they say that some lived alone in the wilderness.
When raised by a nonhuman animal, a feral child will display behavior (with physical limitations) similar to those of caretakers, such as fear or prejudice toward other humans.
While the learning project-based approach makes learning easier and more interesting, the scaffolding system is better.
Scaffolding is not a method of learning but rather a help providing support for individuals learning new experiences such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be both virtual and physical, in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffold but is also a small paperclip in Microsoft Office.
Virtual Scaffolds are embedded in software and are designed to ask questions, guide, and explain in ways that would be difficult for students to do on their own.
Children are brought to Foster Care for a variety of reasons ranging from neglect, to abuse, and even to extortion.
No child needs to grow up in an environment that is helpful, caring, and learning, but it is unavoidable.
We can see that the Orphan Care System is a safe haven for these children.
The foster care system should provide a safe haven, a loving caregiver, a secure education, and a reliable health care provider.
Foster Care is expected to provide all the necessities that were not available in their former home.
The internet has combined both the element of mass and of communication.
The Internet's characterization results in a further dimension of uses and how satisfying it can be.
For example,  learning and  socializing have been suggested as important drivers for Internet use (James et al. , 1995).
 Personal association and  ongoing relationship are identifiable new aspects of motivation, say Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated the reaction of viewers to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements that can occur in milliseconds.
One key belief is that it is possible to tell if a person is lying by correctly interpreting very small expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his play The President's Word, indicated how often a person cannot understand a word because of a brain leak and cannot perceive the truth well.
He also suggested that these human-like abilities could be inherited from animals such as domestic dogs.
20th-century research has revealed two genetic variants: hidden and visible.
Mutation adds to genetic diversity, and selection removes them from choice.
Separation and amalgamation restore and lead to the blurring of the differences between the two lakes in each generation.
In the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans to get the amino acids it needs from the available plant resources.
After all, failure to do so has serious consequences: stunting, malnutrition, and death.
The proteins in leaves and seeds may be the most readily available plant resources, but they are difficult for primates like us to obtain unless cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (cotton, chicken, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but also provide high levels of protein with all the necessary amino acids.
All things considered, we should not be surprised if our ancestors solved the protein problem in much the same way that savanna geese do today.
Sleep disturbance is the process of forcing waking at the time of normal sleep and falling back to sleep for a short time (from 10 to 60 minutes).
This is only done quickly by a low-pitched alarm clock that restores your nose but does not actually wake you up.
If you need to stick your watch when you go to sleep, it may be moved to the opposite side of your room, forcing you to get out of bed when you fall asleep.
Another biorhythm-based option involves drinking large amounts of fluids (especially water or tea, known theoretically) before bed, which slow a person's erection to a boil.
The amount of inner peace that a person has is the exact opposite of the amount of tension in a person's body and spirit.
When tension is lowered, the life force is more positive, and everyone has the potential to find complete peace and contentment.
The only thing that prevents this goal is our own anxiety and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but the path of mahayana love has been widened and extended by many techniques from Indian Yoga.
The principle of Tibetan Buddhism is simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of all embracing love.
Along with Kundalini Yoga, Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened from yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visions.
The Yoga God is at the center of Tibetan meditation. Through the personification of various gods, energy pathways are purified, chakras are opened, and clarity of mind is created.
Germany was an enemy of all during World War II, which resulted in the alliance of the USSR and the U.S.A. By the end of the war, systems, processes, and cultures had become incompatible and countries were fighting each other.
Two years after the war, the former allies were now at war, and the Cold War had begun.
This lasted forty years and was fought by real, proxy armies, the battlefield stretching from Africa to Asia, to Afghanistan, Cuba and various other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defences were destroyed, and their only hope was to delay and re-attack at the birdgehead in Romania.
These plans were dashed almost overnight, however, when nearly 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships to transport goods is the most efficient way to transport large amounts of people and goods overseas.
The navy's role is usually to ensure that the country is inhabited within its capacity to transport people and goods, while at the same time, it is to intervene in the ability of its ally to transport its people and goods.
One of the most interesting examples of this in recent times was the North Atlantic campaign for WWII. The Americans were trying to move men and materials across the Atlantic to help Britain.
Its ally, the German navy, which uses only the U-boat, is trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had not succeeded, Germany might have conquered Britain, which had occupied all of Europe.
Goats may have been domesticated for the first time some 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to raise them to provide a convenient source of milk, hair, meat, and hides.
Goats were usually herded and herded to hills and other pastures, often led by children or young people, as the more familiar shepherd does.
Wagonways were first developed in England in the 16th century.
Even though the wagon tracks were made of wooden planks, they allowed the horses to pull them to gain speed and to pull larger loads even when the dirt tracks were crossed during the day.
Crossties were introduced early to plaster the tracks, but, over time, they became more attractive with the iron on top.
This became a common practice, but the iron made the wooden chariot rails more rusty.
Later, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones, and the first all-iron railway was introduced in 1767.
The first transport was by walking, and humans began walking upright two million years before the emergence of Homo Erectus (i.e. upright man).
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright as was the custom.
The unique ability to walk on two legs was found in fossils of Australopithecus 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can live environmentally friendly lives, we can imitate environmental movements, and we can become activists to better prevent future suffering.
This may seem like a sign of a companion cure, but if we do not want a temporary solution, then we go to the root of the problems, and we should eliminate them.
Clearly, the world has changed because of human scientific and technological advances, and problems have increased because of overpopulation and high living standards.
After Congress convened on June 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was delivered to the nearby printery of John Dunlap.
Overnight, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now called Dunlap broadsides.
The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document, and no original handwritten copy has survived.
Some paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are alive today, which we call flying insects.
Many people do not think of dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things with birds that resemble dinosaurs.
They have legs with spines and tentacles, they move, and they walk with two hind legs like the T-Rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on manipulating information written in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only two values, namely 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits, or bits, in computer speech.
Internal toxicity may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms, such as vomiting, may be so different that immediate treatment is not possible.
The primary sign of internal poisoning is the presence of an open container of medication or toxic chemicals used in the home.
Check the label for proper first aid for the poison in question.
The term bug is used by entomologists in a formal sense for these groups of insects.
The term comes from the ancient knowledge of Kiteb, insects that easily become parasites on humans.
Both the killer whale and the moose live in their owners, either used to living in their nest or in their living quarters.
In the United States of America as a whole, there are about 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disorder among children and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord and optic nerves.
Research has found that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS.
The couple can decide whether this is not in their best interests, or if it is in the best interests of their child, to raise the child.
These couples may make an adoption plan for their child.
In adoption, the biological parents waive their parental rights so that another spouse can become the child's parent.
The main objective of science is to find out how the world works while using the scientific method, which requires the most scientific study.
But more than that, experimentation, an experimental test used to eliminate one or more possible assumptions, questions, and observations and also leads to scientific investigation.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, in particular, on the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's ideas were accepted in all fields of science, including psychology.
With the decline of Greek knowledge, the West found itself cut off from its philosophical and scientific Greek roots.
Many observable physiological and behavioral rhythms are often important in relation to the presence of an endogenous cycle and reproduction by biological clock.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external signals, are documented for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks maintain their own oscillators that continue for a period of time to operate autonomously without any movement.
The Hershey-Chase experiment on one of the most famous claims that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used a microbe, or virus, to insert their own DNA into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments that marked the DNA of a phage containing radioactive phosphorus or the protein of a phage containing radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the piece of genetic material affected and whether cells are affected by germ-lines.
Only mutations in the germline can be passed on to offspring, but mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based Tourism invites people interested in visiting natural areas for enjoyment of sights, including flora and fauna.
Examples of local activities include hunting, hunting, photography, bird watching, and visits to parks and ecosystem studies.
Examples include a photo tour, and learning about the orangutans of Borneo.
Every morning, fishermen from small towns take a ferry to their own fishponds and meet people whose only fishpond is the place they come from.
In this dynamic transportation system all people are as it were connected to, and supportive of, a transportation system based on private vehicles.
Today, the census suggests that the great coal economy has pushed the biosphere out of the stable state that has sustained human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses the transportation system.
In a more prosperous country the same complaint about water quality or a bridge being destroyed is rarely heard.
Why do automotive systems complain so much, why do they fail every day? Are automotive engineers not doing enough? Or are there more important things?
Traffic alignment is the study of the motion of a navigator and vehicle between two points and the interactions they make with each other.
Still, learning traffic rules is difficult because of the driver's habits and is certainly not one hundred percent impossible.
Fortunately, drivers end up in a reasonably consistent range; so traffic patterns are also in reasonable harmony and can be mathematically represented.
To show that the car is more organized, relationships are established between three key differences: (1) organization, (2) quantity, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first birds, and their ability to fly enabled them to escape quickly from their enemies and to search efficiently for food and companions.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back into place.
This gives them ample space to hide from potential predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot be tamed are the toads and the mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus proposed that the Solar System revolved around the Sun.
Some people thought he was right but many people believed otherwise; that the Solar System revolves around the Earth, along with the Sun (and other stars).
This sounds real, for it doesn't feel like the World is moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth, with more than eight times the water volume of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the longest river on Earth, covering six miles [6.5 km] at its widest point.
A total of 20 percent of the water that is discharged from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long and drains water from a variety of smaller rivers.
Although stone pyramid making continued into the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza did not surpass in size and sophistication.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were amazed at the monuments of their predecessors, which were over a thousand years old.
With a population of about 800, Vatican City is the smallest independent country in the world and the least densely populated.
The Vatican City uses Italian in its legislature and in its official communications.
Italian is also the daily language of most of those who work and Latin is also often used in religious ceremonies.
All inhabitants of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known about the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, for they are found only in nature and can be easily mined even in our ancient tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that all matter is formed by the combination of one or more of the four elements - earth, water, air, and fire.
This is similar to the four states of matter (of the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, even assuming that they differ in forming a new substance in order to form it in our eyes.
Alloy is a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals, and of course, there are metals such as silver and gold.
Alloys with small amounts of nonmetallic elements such as carbon may also be produced.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, all matter made up of tiny particles called atoms.
The atoms are so small that trillions of them could contain the nucleus at the end of this sentence.
Thus, the pencil was considered a friend by the people.
Sadly, as new writing methods emerged, the pencil fell into disuse.
People today are just typing on a computer and can't even touch a pencil.
No one can tell what the keyboard will be like when a new one arrives.
A fission bomb works on the principle that energy is needed to make a nucleus with a large number of protons and neutrons.
The nuclear fusion process, which is like pulling a heavy cart up a hill, releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have spherical nuclei that are either spherically or non-spherically separated.
The surface of the Moon is made of rock and dust, and the outer surface of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km (43 mi) thick on the near side and 100 km (62 mi) thick on the far side.
It is thin under the sea and thick under the high ground.
The lava may be more abundant near the edge because the surface is thinner, and the lava can easily rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on measuring what motivates people or what they like.
These theories suggest that people have special needs and/ or desires that they adapt to during their lifetime.
These theories look at what motivates people to want the things they want and what factors in their environment motivate them to do or not do things.
Two of the most popular theories are Maslow's Heirarchy of Needs and Herzberg's Two Factor Theory.
In common parlance, two traits may arise as managers prioritize their former colleagues. One end of things is trying to be one of the men (or women).
This type of ruler finds it difficult to make difficult decisions, to discipline, to monitor work, to assign responsibility, and to hold his people accountable.
At one end of the spectrum, one changes into an unknown individual who realizes that he must change everything he has done in the group and make it his own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the group.
This behavior is often the result of disagreements between leaders and other members of the group.
Created groups have the same standards as a normal group, but there are subtle differences.
Members of the virtual group serve as a point of contact for their primary physical group.
They are often more independent than normal group members because their groups may meet according to different time zones in their locations that may not be understood by their local manager.
The existence of a real invisible group (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a distinct feature of a virtual group.
The invisible group in the group that commands that each member report. The invisible group sets the standard for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization? One purpose of implementing organizational learning concepts is change.
When all resources are effectively used throughout the entire department of an organization, creativity and wisdom remain.
As a result, the organizational process works together to overcome obstacles and can result in a new and improved process to better serve the customers' needs.
Before an organization can change, leaders must create a culture of change as well as a balance of knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains that Continuum replacement as a method can be used to help organizations achieve higher levels of productivity.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for theoretical approaches to cognition investigation, thus expanding the scope of research and making it more precise.
The correlation between pathology and brain function supports scientists in their research.
It has long been found that various types of brain damage, trauma, injury, and tumor can affect behavior and halt the change in certain thought processes.
The development of new technologies allows us to see and investigate structures and processes of the brain that have never been seen before.
This provides a wealth of information and materials to build a simulation model that will help us to take processes into our minds.
Although AI has a lot to do with science fiction, it is a vital branch of computer science, which studies ways to insert behavior, learning, and skills into a machine.
Research into AI involves the development of machines to automate tasks that require intelligence.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and news, as well as the ability to see the letter by hand, voice and face.
Such matters became a separate discipline , hidden from providing solutions to real problems in life.
AI systems are now widely used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, having helped to build many home computers and video game software applications.
Field trips are a big part of any school, and a teacher is always happy to take his students to places that are inaccessible by bus.
Technology offers solutions such as virtual field trips, where students can see artifacts in a museum, visit an aquarium, or enjoy a beautiful art scene while sitting with the class.
Participating in a virtual field trip is also a fine way to remember the field trips and share experiences for the next class.
For example, students from the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website each year about their trip to the State Capitol, which is updated each year, but the old versions remain online to serve as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing skills, and as you try to write a blog with your grammar and spelling problems, you will gradually improve as others read or see it.
Since students often read for themselves, the blogger does everything he can to be well-informed and to avoid being overlooked.
Blogging  emphasizes students being intelligent about the world around them. The need to feed the audience's interest encourages students to be intelligent and curious.
Blogging is a collaborative tool, and it encourages students to focus on studying outside of school.
Proper use of blogs "can empower students to be critical and analytical; by actively responding to Internet materials, students are given meaning of their positions in the context of others' writing as well as expressing their own perspective on particular issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's beautiful, bilingual capital and offers many art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Farther south, Niagara Falls is located and to the north is home to the unspoiled natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.

Goma is a tourist city of the Democratic Republic of the Congo in eastern Rwanda.
In 2002 Goma was devastated by the lava eruption of the Nyiragongo volcano that buried most of the town's roads, especially in the town center.
Although Goma is safe, the current situation of conflict in North Kivu province must be determined before any visit outside Goma.
The city is also the starting point for climbing Nyiragongo volcano and other easy-going hunting for the African Mountain Gorilla.
You can take a boda-boda (motor taxi) to get around Goma. The standard (local) fare is ~500 Congolese Francs for a nearby trip.
Among its difficulties in this regard, Timbuktu has come to be used as a metaphor for an exotic, distant land.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor town, despite its reputation as a tourist attraction, and it even has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of world heritage sites in danger, because of the threat of desert sand.
This was one of the main stops during Henry Lous Gates' PBS special Wonder of the African World.
The city is very different from other cities in the country, for it has more Arab than African traditions.
