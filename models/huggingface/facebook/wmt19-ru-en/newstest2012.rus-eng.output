Parliament does not support the amendment giving Tymoshenko freedom
Today, the Parliament of Ukraine, in the course of amending the Criminal Procedure Code, rejected an attempt to abolish the article under which the opposition leader, Yulia Tymoshenko, was convicted.
An amendment that would have resulted in the release of the imprisoned former Prime Minister was rejected during the second reading of a bill to commute sentences for economic offences.
In October, Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for signing a gas deal with Russia that was deemed unprofitable.
The verdict is not yet final; the court will hear Tymoshenko's appeal in December.
Tymoshenko claims that the verdict is a political vendetta against the regime; in the West, the trial is also suspected of bias.
A motion to repeal Article 365 of the Criminal Procedure Code, under which the former Prime Minister was convicted, was supported by 147 members of Parliament.
Ratification would require 226 votes.
Libya's Victory
In the history of liberation, or rebellion, Libya already has losers.
Muammar el-Qaddafi is buried somewhere in the desert; without him, the war is over.
It is time to identify the winners.
Islamists usually win; the question is whether they are moderate or radical.
The Transitional Government has declared itself a follower of the customary Sharia law we have heard about.
Libya will become a crime-free country, because the punishment for theft is amputation of the hand.
Women can forget about emancipation; would-be apostates will be executed; and so on.
Instead of a dictator, a society of rival clans will be united by the Koran.
There will be an order in Libya that we cannot imagine, and that we would hardly wish for.
In any case, our way of life is neither unique nor the best, and would probably not suit, for example, the people of Libya.
In fact, it is surprising that Islamic militants have accepted help from non-believers.
Their only justification is that, in their view, the NATO raids were led not by an American general, but by Allah, whose greatness they glorified after each strike.
And if Libya is looking for winners, the West is not one of them.
We have engaged in firefights, served Islam, and our politicians got rid of a dictator, their political ally, without any guarantee of benefit.
Given the recent painful experience with Afghanistan and Iraq, we have decided to abandon the military occupation of Libya.
The local population thus need not worry about the expulsion of the crusaders.
Without occupation, however, will oil companies get Libya's black gold for almost nothing?
They probably won't, and the West will finally be able to boast of its selfless defense of civil rights.
Unless the followers of Sharia put an end to it.
A New Wave of Crisis Begins
France and the rest of Europe are now at the center of investors "attention.
A statistical storm swept across Europe on Tuesday.
Individual countries released Q3 GDP data.
Compared to the previous quarter, the Czech economy was stagnant, with Germany and France showing growth.
And yet the debt market is now breaking records.
Investors are no longer just looking to Italy; they are now focusing on Spain, France, Austria, and elsewhere.
Eurozone statistical offices in Germany, the Czech Republic, and several other countries have released their preliminary estimates of economic development in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP grew by an expected 0.5%; France's by 0.4%.
Both countries also adjusted data for the second quarter, in which Germany fared better than expected (growth of 0.3% instead of the original 0.1%). France reported a small decline, of 0.1% (initial information suggested stagnation).
In the third quarter of this year, the Czech economy posted preliminary growth of 1.5%.
However, compared to the previous quarter, GDP was stagnant. According to the Czech Statistical Office, this confirmed the trend of a gradual slowdown in economic growth.
The results were worse than analysts had predicted.
Key events:
In the third quarter of this year, the Czech economy posted preliminary growth of 1.5%; however, it was stagnant compared to the previous quarter.
Based on preliminary and seasonal data, Germany's economy grew by 0.5% in the third quarter.
From July to September, the economies of both the eurozone and the European Union grew by 0.2% quarter-on-quarter, in line with analysts "forecasts.
Greece's economy posted a preliminary contraction of 5.2%.
Its 10-year bond yield is 28.45%.
Yields on both Italian and Spanish bonds are nearing a critical point.
Even Austria, the Netherlands, France and Belgium, etc., are beginning to experience difficulties.
Although the situation in the region is worsening, the yield on Czech 1-year bonds remains around 4%.
In Germany, there is talk that the ECB is the last creditor to bail out the situation.
The Czech team qualified for the EURO.
In Montenegro, they won 1-0 and are celebrating a surprise cash prize of $200 million.
The national team successfully coped with the most difficult task of the season!
Thanks to Petr Jiracek's superb goal, they won 1-0.
In the second half, the Czech team was fortunate to maintain a significant advantage after the home return match, and it will again participate in the European Championship.
IHNED.cz observed the match and compiled a detailed report.
Almost nothing remarkable in the first half and a lot of luck in the second.
The Czech national team, partly because of the team's defeat at the end; the great Czech; and the heroic Jiracek; won 1-0 in Montenegro and celebrates reaching the European Championship.
Superb defending by the Czech team allowed Montenegro to create dangerous moments only in the second half of the game.
Damjanovic and Vucinic were the unlucky pair of the match after missing two great opportunities.
The magnificent Petr Cech is one of the reasons why the Czech national team will not miss next year's European Championships, thereby earning Czech football around CZK 200 million.
From the first minute, the game was very tight.
Both teams had difficulty making combinations; the game was played most of the time in the middle of the field.
It also explains the lack of pressure from the home team in the first half, with long-range strikes over the defensive line neatly intercepted by Czech defenders.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country's nuclear program.
They created a human shield.
Several hundred university students set up a human shield around a nuclear power plant in Iran.
In doing so, they want to express their support for their country's nuclear program in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
On Tuesday afternoon, students' prayers outside the building were followed by a prayer service for the deaths of both the US and Israel.
In Isfahan, Iran, several hundred university students set up a human shield around the Isfahan uranium enrichment plant.
In doing so, they demonstrated a willingness to defend their country's nuclear program at the cost of their own lives.
In its latest report, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) indicated that everything indicates that Iran has not given up trying to acquire nuclear weapons.
A possible attack on Iran's nuclear facilities has been discussed in Israel.
On Tuesday afternoon, students' prayers at the entrance to the Isfahan uranium enrichment plant were followed by a prayer service for the deaths of both the US and Israel.
In the event of an attack aimed at maximum paralysis of Iran's nuclear program, the targets would be, according to the Israeli press, facilities in both Isfahan and Natanz, where uranium enrichment takes place.
Eating obese children: No breakfast and sausage for dinner
More than a third of children aged 9 to 13 weigh more than normal; while 9% of schoolchildren are overweight, 5% are obese.
According to a recent study, obese children tend to come from families with unhealthy lifestyles.
Once again, we see the importance of the environment and behaviors that accompany a person for his or her healthy development.
For example, sausages appear on the desks of obese children almost twice as often as in families with children of normal weight.
More than 19% of obese children ate French fries for dinner on the eve of a survey related to an educational event called Obesity is no accident.
Moreover, the families of obese children do not participate in sports. This is true for most families of today's schoolchildren, however, with only 15% of children saying that their parents take time to exercise at least once a week.
The study involved 900 children.
The study was carried out at the end of the last school year and involved almost 900 primary school pupils throughout Bohemia.
Obesity is no accident, the event was held for the second year in a row, with the support of insurance company Všeobecná zdravotní pojišťovna and Unilever.
To date, more than 12,000 schoolchildren in grades 4-8 have joined the project.
Proper nutrition and adequate exercise are the main determinants of the rapidly growing number of children who are either overweight or obese.
"For example, only half of respondents said that they eat five meals a day, according to the breakfast-snack-lunch-snack-dinner scheme, which is one of the prerequisites for good nutrition," says one of the study's findings.
No lunch or sausage in the evenings
Experts warn that even such relative details as the family's regular breakfast time are important for healthy development.
In the Czech Republic, only 23% of school-age families eat breakfast together.
In most families, everyone has breakfast separately.
The worst finding was that in one in ten households, people do not eat breakfast at all.
And yet breakfast is the basis of a proper daily diet.
Research has shown that fried food is more commonly consumed in families with obese children.
Almost everyone - regardless of weight - drinks sugary soft drinks every day (70%).
Although more than 40% of children regularly exercise, this figure falls by more than half - to 15% - when it comes to their parents.
Make your own menu.
In another part of the study, selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) were asked to create their own menus based on the products offered and on their tastes and preferences.
"The food preferences of Czech children aged 12-15 are far from ideal when it comes to healthy eating."
Their favorite food includes a lot of meaty, meaty, and sweet dishes.
"Of particular concern is the high popularity of sugary soft drinks," the study concludes.
As the main lunch dish, the paste beat the bird by a narrow margin.
However, the children showed little interest in legumes, fish and vegetables.
Aspiration for a healthy lifestyle
The study also showed that children are willing to change their eating habits, provided they are provided with relevant information.
"Many of the study's control group participants demonstrated a significant shift in preferences toward healthy food when filling out a questionnaire after completing the lecture. Obesity is not an accident," the study concluded.
This was particularly noticeable, for example, in the case of sugary soft drinks, with more children choosing water over water.
In addition, children were more likely to mention poultry and fish as their main course, limiting the amount of sugary foods and pastries.
A stylist should also be a good psychologist, say professionals
In the first article on stylists "training, I complained about the amount of information in the introductory sessions.
I had no idea what was going to happen next.
Lectures by three experts in the field; tips for choosing clothes for non-standard figures; and a seminar on how it all works in real life.
More to come.
The closer we get to the final exam, the more information and practical tasks await us.
The training takes place every Saturday and Sunday, but it is really informative.
This time, with Alenka, the director (there are no men on the course), we discussed how to dress a woman whose body is not perfectly symmetrical.
Most women are not completely symmetrical.
One has a short neck, the other a boyish figure with no proper shape, and another weighs more than the norm.
The stylist must know how to visually reduce the broad shoulders, lengthen the neck, or add missing volume.
We were given advice on how to accentuate the figure of women like Jennifer Lopez, who have bigger breasts and thighs and a narrow waist, without dressing them too provocatively.
For example, if the difference between the waist and the thighs is so great that you can't pick up a skirt or trousers, it is worth having at least one item sewn to order.
You will obviously not regret the investment, as perfectly fitting clothes are priceless.
In a skirt made to measure, you will feel much better than in one that is constantly moving, rolling, exposing the waist, etc.
Women with boyish figures, on the other hand, can wear garments with ruffles, appliques, embroidery or pleats.
Given the abundance of such information and types of figures, I am glad that I have a full week to realize all of this.
And yet, I fear, it is too much, given the homework we have received.
Each participant had to come up with two outfits for a celebrity, one for the day and one for the evening.
We must take into account their modern appearance, their style of dress, and the type of figure.
I'm going to dress Miranda Kerr, who you may know from the Victoria's Secret ad campaigns.
I rejoice in myself because she is much easier to dress than, say, Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, who recently recovered by a ton (please note that I exaggerate), or the very young Selena Gomez.
We must cut clothes from magazines or find them on the Internet, print and process them using graphic programs.
The mudboard - that is, the result of work - then reflects our own style and attitude to the graphic image.
It is important to keep the graphic component of the style in mind.
The stylist does not just dress real people, but creates food pages in magazines (based on specific instructions, such as fashion bags, coats, etc.).
This is what stylist and designer Mario Kamenik told us.
But it wasn't until Sunday.
Stylist needs general knowledge
Saturday's lecture, full of information about the types of figures, was animated by three guests - specialists in the field.
Stylist Honza Pokorny; fashion designer Jakub Polanca; and fashion photographer Ben Rench.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion, and a stylist must exploit this fact.
A good stylist knows how to use one item of clothing in different ways.
In this case, diversity is the key to success.
For example, a trench coat can be worn in the usual way, over jeans and T-shirts, like a coat; but it can also be worn on a bare body, without clasps, like a dress.
Another option is to roll up your sleeves or raise your collar, and the whole image changes completely.
"Play with him," he said.
Whatever the case, the advice I most appreciated was this: "For your job, you need to know the rules perfectly."
Then you can start violating them, 'Jakub told us.
Here I finally understood why we memorize all the definitions and rules, what to combine with what and why, whereas in fashion magazines we often see something different.
Not to mention fashion shows.
I learned from Ben, the photographer, that the stylist should have more outfit options at hand than the number of photos he needs to take.
So, for a fashion review of ten pages (equivalent to ten outfits), I must be ready to create at least fifteen images.
Now I also know that, in the picture, a piece of clothing often looks and works in combination with others quite differently from what it actually does.
We should bear this in mind when creating an image.
Honza Pokorny confirmed that often image and style are half the success.
Just look at Madonna, who doesn't have the amazing vocal range, but her image and marketing have turned her into a global star.
Attitudes to stylists in the Czech Republic are still rather cool.
Even famous people often find it superfluous (and believe that it is enough to be an expert in something, and the way they look is secondary).
And if someone finally allows us to create their style, we should expect them to tell us a different (smaller) size than the one they actually wear.
Then we turn to Google to find out if the tabloids have written anything about a celebrity getting fat / losing weight, etc.
On Sunday, Honza and Mario emphasized that it's not enough for a stylist to know fashion and be able to pick an outfit.
Our work mainly consists of communicating with the people we dress; therefore, it is important to be a good psychologist.
To be able to judge people, not to pander to them, and to hold one's own opinion.
"If a manager asks you to review her clothes and add some nice things, you can't throw away her entire wardrobe by telling her that her clothes are terrible."
"Find at least a few things you can compliment and advise what you can wear with them," says Mario.
He also showed us exactly what a work bag should contain.
This is a bag that you tie around your waist to wear whatever you need.
In addition to the obvious things, such as scissors, a sticky roller, or English pins, it must have a nylon thread (stylists use it when shooting certain items, such as bags or hats), special clips to fasten cloth to the back in case the garment is too big (pins and similar items are forbidden because they spoil clothing), or a sewing kit.
To distract ourselves from lectures and gain some hands-on experience, we learned how to put the right shoes on the soles.
Even when shooting in a studio where the floor is smooth, the soles can get damaged - not to mention shooting outdoors.
And so we got into the sticker business.
You should not touch your shoes with scissors to avoid spoiling them.
It takes real skill.
I was pleased that Mario praised my work.
These skills didn't appeal to me.
This is only part of what we heard during the second part of the weekend course.
I am beginning to understand that being a professional stylist is not easy, whatever people say.
V Need for Speed: Escape takes place in America.
Overview
What was supposed to be a light-hearted outing turned into a routine morning commute to work due to a series of entirely inappropriate and careless errors.
Ambitions were met to a certain extent, but that didn't matter, because no one clearly wanted to do the extra work.
Before the release of the new version, high hopes were pinned on the subtitle "Escape."
It was expected to move the previous Need For Speed series in a new direction; the demonstration versions indicated that the game would take its rightful place in the racing game genre.
We were curious to see parts of the game where the main character gets out of the car and runs.
As is often the case with NFS, the end result is very different from what we expected.
The game is a pretty good arcade race, but the overall impression is spoiled by a few unnecessary mistakes that have been present in this series of games for several years.
So it is not really a mistake, but a manifestation of inexplicable laziness on the part of developers.
The adventure starts very well.
You become part of a story in which the protagonist, Jack, decides to solve some personal problems by participating in an illegal race through America.
You get in a car on the west coast, in San Francisco, and your goal is to get to New York first.
This idea has some interesting features.
The route consists of ten stages divided into more than fifty races.
This means that each race takes its own route, with individual stages taking place in a diverse and interesting environment.
So it doesn't feel like the same thing is happening all the time in the game.
Despite the fact that the graphics are at the same level as in the previous parts of the series, some tracks are nice to look at.
Yet the game does not evoke strong emotions.
Driving a car through the desert, through the autumn suburbs, or high in the snowy mountains, though, is a pleasure.
What's more, the race is livened up from time to time by an unusual detail.
In the desert, for example, you are caught in a sandstorm that significantly reduces visibility.
On the other hand, in the mountains, one must be careful not to get caught in an avalanche.
Individual races are pretty well ordered.
There are only a few varieties, but that is enough.
For a while you try to overtake several rivals (essentially a normal race); then you try to improve the time (a standard race with a stopwatch); or you compete against one opponent.
Among other things, you come across the police from time to time, which makes your task even more difficult.
The components on the outside of the car are new.
It's just an interactive animation where Jack runs away from someone most of the time and you have to help him by pressing the right buttons at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
Although surprisingly, there are far fewer of these fragments than you might expect (just three to be precise).
In fact, it turns out that it's good for the game because it's not bothersome; given all that, it's one of the things that makes the game more fun.
The racing model follows in the footsteps of previous models.
This means that it is no longer something special, but it is not a disadvantage.
If you're looking for an imitation of real life, you'll have to look elsewhere.
Still, this driving model is very suitable for dynamic racing, although there are better options on the market.
So far, so good.
After a while, however, problems begin.
Unlike the driving model, the collision model is not that good.
You don't expect complex transformations and collisions from such a game, but if you have no idea how your car will behave before hitting an object, something is wrong.
Usually, when overtaking or passing cars in dense traffic, you sometimes touch another car slightly. And yet sometimes, in an almost identical situation, your car begins to spin frantically.
Or crumbled.
This is not so important thanks to the restart system, but it is enough to spoil the fun.
The restarts are arranged so that if you crash or get far off the track, the game returns you to the point where it stopped.
However, only five restarts are available for each race.
If you use them all, you have to start the race from the beginning.
This is useful when something doesn't work out, but you can't rely entirely on it.
Sometimes restarts are not enough and you have to memorize a particular part of the race.
An important flaw in the game is that the same things often happen in the same places.
For example, some twists and turns need to be completed in a certain way, otherwise you simply won't fit in.
In other cases, you meet civilian vehicles at a specific location in the same configuration, whether you arrive first, fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
This is particularly irritating in situations where you see your opponent driving easily between two cars moving in the opposite direction, whereas when you get there, the cars are already positioned so that you either have to overtake them or reset their speed.
It does not matter when you are next to them; everything is arranged so that the situation always happens just in front of your nose.
Rivals have other advantages.
During the game, you will find several places where, regardless of the time, the same opponent overtakes you in the same place.
This is especially evident at the end of the game, on a long bridge where you are driving in the opposite direction.
Obviously, your opponent must stand up to you no matter what.
The fact is that when it drives in front of you, it impairs your visibility, leading to one or more accidents on that stretch.
One can understand the attempt to make the game more interesting and adrenaline-filled, but it is so obvious that it quickly becomes irritating.
It's a pity, because despite the simple model of driving, the game is entertaining and sometimes so eventful that you don't have time to pay attention to what is happening around you.
It doesn't matter what keeps you bored - a concept with fifty unique tracks, a sequence of races, or whatever.
The idea of changing cars during a race is unusual.
You need to keep track of the gas stations along the way, as this is where your car may change, even though in most cases the one you already have is sufficient.
The machines fall into three categories.
Sports cars are suitable for cities; powerful American cars for straight stretches of highways; and exotic super-sports cars for technical driving, for example, on curved mountain tracks.
The main story mode is closely linked to challenge mode; it is a race over individual areas that you will learn in the course of the game.
Here you win medals for your own cause, as well as points common to challenges and story modes.
Many features are available for higher levels of driving, ranging from cars to profile data.
In addition, the profile is linked to the online Autolog function, which, among other things, compares your results with those of other players, and provides public relations.
Here is another flaw that is difficult to understand; it is an example of the last race in a sequence.
You and your car end up in a subway tunnel (let's assume so), where you race along the tracks in the dark (let's assume so).
Your speedometer shows numbers from 150 to 200 km / h (let's assume that is the case) when suddenly a subway train runs over you from behind, turning your car into a pile of scrap metal.
For several days, our editorial team has been debating whether no one really thought for a second during the game's creation, or whether its creators really think we are such nerds.
The technical aspect of the game is nothing special; but the overall impression of the video series is for the most part pleasant, sometimes even stunning.
Although it is a pity that at some critical moments the quality of the recording, sometimes quite dramatically, decreases.
This is especially true for incidents with large numbers of participants, where a good record would not have helped much either.
The sound is fine; the soundtrack is on the amateur.
To please as many young people as possible, the soundtrack 'includes songs from different styles'; but it is unlikely that many people will buy the game because of its music.
The overall impression on Need for Speed: The escape is rather messy.
If the game had avoided obviously unnecessary mistakes, we could honestly say that Escape is the best part of the NFS in the last few years.
Be that as it may, the game leaves a sense of unfinished business.
Sure, it's good fun, but prepare for the flaws to blind you like an airport spotlight.

Ambassador to the EU Vitsenova:
The Czechs have a reputation as euro-detractors and euro-skeptics.
"The Lisbon Treaty caused considerable disagreement among individual organizations."
"I didn't expect it to be such a brutal war."
"It will take five or six years for things to stabilize, calm down and all players to get used to their new roles," EU Ambassador Milena Vitsenova began her lecture at the Faculty of Law harshly.
She proved how adhering to her motto, "Clear and open about Europe," in the first part of her lecture, where she described the individual EU institutions and the relationship between them in a way that many lecturers at KU Law School would have envied.
Moreover, Vitsenova praised the work of the new permanent president of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy:
"At first, the critics said he was just a grey office mouse who couldn't play any role; I must say, everyone was amazed at how well he handled his role."
"He is a man who can listen to the twenty-seven member states at the same time, who communicates well with them, and who has a clear idea of the direction the EU should take."
She explained her new position as representative for international relations and security as an answer to the question, "Who is the European Union? What number do I need to call?" - an important step toward unifying and making the Union's policies toward countries like China or India more transparent.
No one is going to ban our cheeses
Vitsenova went on to focus on a key agenda for the EU in the past, present, and near future.
She called the Czech Presidency the year before last a success.
The Czechs were dealing with a looming financial crisis; they overcame that crisis and organized an Eastern Partnership summit.
She said the resignation of the government at the time was a negative development that had done considerable damage to the Czech Republic.
Currently, the Czech Republic's representatives in the EU are very busy.
As the ambassador said, both the presidency and the subsequent financial crisis caused the current ferment.
Moreover, a new seven-year EU budget must be adopted, which is not easy, given the current crisis.
Whether the budget will be tight and frugal, which areas will be preferred, which countries will receive more support and which will receive less, all of these issues are on the agenda.
The ambassador recalled the key slogans she had brought to Brussels: "On Europe, in plain language."
'I really don't like acronyms, foreign words and jargon that no one understands.
How can citizens understand that in Brussels people are not trying to sell crooked or round cucumbers, bananas of different sizes, or that someone is going to ban our cheeses. '
It also intends to make better use of the EU's environment and bring more Czechs into European institutions.
A Multi-Speed Europe Is Our Future
The ambassador argues that Czechs are seen as Euro-skeptics; and as people who note the negatives rather than the positives.
She wants more Czech representatives to be involved in European organizations.
She believes that several factors are to blame: for example, the modesty of our candidates and their inability to write motivational letters; at the same time, there is little support from the Czech side.
Along with the successful chairmanship of the Czech Republic, she noted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group.
"Believe me, when I meet someone from Poland and Hungary and we are joined by a Slovak, the Frenchman next to me says," Hey, what's the meeting about, the Visegrad Group again? "and he's not happy about it."
In the future, Vitsenov's Union expects mainly strict new rules for the budgetary policies of the member states.
Compared to the new European Federation, it considers the idea of a two-speed, if not multi-speed Europe more realistic.
"We have countries both inside and outside the Eurozone."
"We have a Schengen area and we already have an institution of enhanced cooperation."
"For the first time, it was said that countries that want should unite, while those that don't can stand by."
"The number of such institutions will grow; it will be a truly two-speed Europe," Vitsenova expects.
In this respect, she emphasized the role of both the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuy in promoting the rule that all EU-wide issues should be discussed by all member states, not just those within the Eurozone.
History of the brand:
IBM's innovator is entering its second century.
If one wants to find the word that best expresses the IMB's strategy, the closest one is likely to be "durable."
For the general public, IBM is a symbol of the technological revolution; the company is considered very modern, even though it was founded more than a century ago.
The company's longevity was laid down by its first boss, the visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He believed in his motto that many of the world's problems could be solved easily if people wanted to think.
His slogan, "Think!," thus became the cliché around which the future giant's life unfolded (as well as the title of his in-house magazine, which the IMB began publishing in 1935).
Indeed, it was at the heart of a corporate culture that Watson carefully built.
"For us at IBM, long-term thinking means constantly moving toward the future.
IBM survived and prospered for a century because it remained true to its original values, though it was not afraid to change everything around it.
In our first hundred years, this enabled us to transform technology, business, and company.
In the second century, we hope to achieve even more, "says current CEO Samuel J. Palmisano on the occasion of the anniversary.
The Complex System
In the 1930s, Watson approached the issue of employee care in the same way as Batja in the Czech Republic - IMB employees were among the first American employees with paid leave, employer insurance, elegant uniforms, and a complex system of bonuses for the best inventors and entrepreneurs.
Just as advanced are IBM's long-term relationships with consumers.
It was one of the first companies in the world to eliminate all discrimination, which gave it a great choice.
The current plan, under which a woman, Virginia Rometty, will succeed Palmisano next year, is also consistent with the anti-discrimination strategy.
She has worked at IBM for thirty years; she is currently Director of Sales, Marketing, and Development.
Over the past few years, IBM has been organizing meetings, online brainstorming sessions, during which many future innovations are emerging.
Unsurprisingly, there are plenty of ideas - the company employs around half a million people.
An organization with a good reputation
The company's strong position in the business is ensured by a strong internal and external image.
"From the outset, IBM was more of an organization than a technology company," Harvard Business School professor and author of a book on IBM, Rosebeth Moss Kanter, told the Economist.
"IBM is not a technology company, it's a company that helps solve business problems using technology," adds Joj Coloni of Forrester Research, a consulting firm.
As the company itself says, there is a difference between entering the market and creating it.
In a century, IBM, or "Blue Giant," as it is known in the United States because of its logo, has become one of the world's largest companies.
It seems to be the most universal technology company - developing hardware and software; infrastructure; hosting and consulting services - from servers to nanotechnology.
It holds the most patents of any US technology company, and five of its employees have won Nobel Prizes.
Its inventions include, for example, an ATM, a bank card, a financial swap, a bar code, and a floppy disk.
With $220 billion in market capitalization, IBM this year became the second-largest technology company (with Apple in first place), overtaking Microsoft for the first time since 1996.
Looking ahead
Not all of its products appeal to consumers and fit into an era. For example, IBM failed with its OS / 2 operating system; the online service Prodigy; and IBM PCjr computers.
"If your business is driven by moving forward, you can't be emotionally tied to the past," says Samuel J. Palmisano.
That is why IBM easily lays the groundwork on multiple platforms - if they don't work, it abandons them.
This makes it different, for example, from its rival Microsoft, which is based on, and is experiencing, falls on Windows, its operating system.
Promising technology
IBM derives most of its revenue from services, with about one-fifth in each case coming from computer programs and hardware.
Whereas in 1990, with half its capital, it was the strongest equipment manufacturer.
Since 2000, IBM has sold $15 billion worth of low-margin assets, while investing $58 billion to buy promising technologies.
It continued to invest even after 2008, when the current economic crisis first hit the world.
IBM is following in the footsteps of its first CEO, Thomas J. Watson, who increased investment during the Great Depression.
So far, IBM does not seem to have been harmed by the current crisis.
Since the beginning of 2008, IBM's share price has risen by a record 120 percent; the company's net earnings have been rising steadily.
IBM's corporate motto is to change everything but its own values.
So, even if another crisis erupts, the flexible giant can be expected to cope.
IBM's History: From Cheese Knife to Space Flight
IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York a century ago. Its original name, "Corporation for Computation, Tabulation, Recording," was rather complicated.
It took the name IBM in 1924, originally the brand used for the company's offices in Canada and South America.
The foundations of the future of IBM were laid by the merger of four companies, the history of which goes back to the 1880 "s.
They possessed technologies such as the legendary "service clock," a clock that records the time when employees come and go from work.
The architect of the new company was businessman Charles Ranlet Flint, who also chaired the company's board of trustees until 1930.
Flint hired a director of a rival company, Thomas J. Watson, to help him run the company.
Then the boss pushed the IBM founder into the shadows - Watson's ideas remain the bedrock of an unshakeable corporate culture and identity.
Watson ran the company until 1952.
IBM, as its name makes clear, began by producing and selling a variety of business equipment - from cheese knives and meat cutters to cash registers.
In Watson's first four years in charge, revenues doubled to $9 million, and the company began a massive expansion across continents.
Watson became so important to the company that, almost forty years later, his son, Thomas Watson Jr., took his place in the director's chair.
Under his leadership, IBM began to develop artificial intelligence technologies and created the first programming language.
In the 1960s, both IBM employees and computers helped NASA control space flights - to Mercury, Saturn, and 1969 - to the moon.
Meanwhile, in 1964, IBM developed the first family of computers, the IBM line System / 360.
The classic PC that defined computer standards at the time, called the IBM 5150, entered the market in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold computer manufacturing to Lenovo, a Chinese company, while buying PricewaterhouseCoopers, a consulting firm, focusing entirely on high-value-added consulting and services.
Over the past three years, IBM has made great strides with its Smarter Planet concept.
It aims to make smart use of technology in areas where it has not yet been planned, and to improve road conditions and urban management.
In commerce, IBM recently introduced its Smarter Commerce platform, which helps businesses control the entire trading cycle.
IBM's tradition is strong even in our country.
In the former Czechoslovakia, as the first country to be located simultaneously in central and eastern Europe, IBM founded its branch in 1932.
Today, IBM CZ also operates a strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
Central and Eastern Europe is headquartered in Prague, where a world-class research team is also working on speech recognition.
Rikhtarzhova on her unfaithful husband:
Iveta, leave yourself a fool, I don't need him anymore!
Darina Rikhtarzhova (53) said that it's over!
After her husband, Josef Richtarz, 53, became Iveta Bartošova's bodyguard and lover, Darina still hoped that he would wake up and return home.
However, she no longer wants to wait, and has laid out clear rules for her future life.
"Pepa can come home, but no longer as my partner," Richtarzhova explained.
When Darina Rikhtarzhova provided Bartoshova with shelter in her home in the summer, she probably had no idea what would happen to her marriage.
Although she forced Iveta to leave Rzican after 30 days, Pepa did not abandon the singer.
Indeed, he has publicly declared that he loves her.
After a while, Darina gave up pretending to accept her husband's affair; and now she has finally said goodbye to him.
I don't care who his wife sleeps with.
Even if Richtarz and Bartoshova ever part ways, his wife will not welcome him with open arms.
'He's the biological father of my sons and if he wants to spend his last days in our house, no one will kick him out. '
"However, he will end his days not as my favorite, lost and found old fool, but as a person with whom I have something in common," said Rikhtarzhova, adding that she has already freed herself from her husband and insists only on mutual decency.
For now, Joseph has nothing against his wife rejecting him.
'I respect my wife's decision. '
'I'll be with Iveta, I'm not going to change that. '
"My wife has decided to put the marriage on paper and I respect that decision."
"Our union is still functioning; I am responsible for the renovations, the garden, the house and the shopping."
"Darina and I communicate perfectly well, but we don't share the bed anymore," Richtarge told Blesk magazine.
He claims that if Rikhtarzhova finds a new love, he will not interfere with her.
'We don't sleep together and I don't care where she goes, with whom or if she has a boyfriend.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Yvette and I take full responsibility, "Joseph concluded.
Worst Female Habits: Do They Affect You?
When you ask men to name some typical bad female habits, they usually list them all at once.
Dear ladies, will you recognize yourself in the following lines, describing a few women's habits that make men angry?
Shopping
Does your other half complain that you're constantly shopping?
Do you need to buy at least one item every week?
Do you like to shop at big sales?
If so, your shopping can be considered a bad habit.
Some women admit that they need to somehow control their shopping cravings.
And yet, who among you will refuse to go shopping for clothes in search of perfectly seated clothes and try them (preferably in different color versions) in sample ones?
Shopping may be a hobby for most women, but for men it can be hell.
Just remember how many times you told your other half to wait for you outside...
Perpetual discontent
"Am I too fat?"
'I need to lose at least five kilos - maybe I should start doing gymnastics? '
"Are you still attracted to me?"
Are you familiar with these phrases?
Yes?
Then you are part of a group of women who are obsessed with their appearance.
Not that you need to stop looking after yourself, but many men are literally allergic to their partners "constant complaints about their appearance.
The strong sex also agrees that the more frequent these complaints are, the more women will irritate them.
The most important thing is order and cleanliness.
It's like an endless story.
Glass cleaning, vacuum cleaning, floor cleaning, dust wiping, bathroom cleaning - at least twice a week.
Do you criticize your partner for stepping on clean tiles in dirty shoes; children for dirt in a clean sink; and fingerprints on window glass in the living room that was so hard to clean?
If you suffer from this "deviation," try to realize that going to extremes is not good; and that order and cleanliness should not come first in your family.
The harmless pursuit of cleanliness can threaten your relationship, as well as the whole family.
Aspiration to Command
"Throw your underwear in the basket."
"Are you going to put dirty socks on tomorrow?"
"Wet dish towels should not lie on the floor."
If you make remarks to your partner several times a day, he may find it very annoying.
Of course, you have good intentions, you just want everything to be perfect.
Perhaps if men had understood this, women would not have had to command them so often...
Gossip
Some women like to gossip, insult, and whip up intrigues against others.
Women are focused on relationships, so they like to discuss who, where, with whom, how, and why.
Every now and then, perhaps, each of us dispenses with gossip.
Let's be honest, that seems to be the nature of all women.
In any case, there are more serious gossip women, who often gossip and despise others. They, especially in the female workplace, are a great danger to their environment.
Jagr and Voracek's productive assists helped Philadelphia win
During Monday's NHL game, two assists by hockey forward Jaromir Jagr helped Philadelphia win 5-3 on Carolina's ice.
On both occasions, Claude Giroux capitalized on the 39-year-old star's experience; he added another assist and was declared the best player of the match.
Jakub Voracek, who plays in the same team as Jagr, also had two assists.
After the match, Jagr told foreign reporters that he had predicted a great evening for Giroud.
"I told him before the match that he would score a hat-trick."
"I felt it."
"Sometimes you feel things like that," explained Jagr, whose actions led to Giroux scoring at the first opportunity the Flyers gave.
A little later, the team's second goal also had a "Czech mark."
Hurricanes tight end Voracek grabbed the puck and passed it to Maxim Talbot, who scored between the circles.
A second before the first break, home player Patrick Dwyer narrowed the gap with a numerical advantage, but the Flyers led again early in the second half.
Especially Giroud.
After Jagr's assist, he scored the third goal; his shot was then converted into Wayne Simmonds' fourth goal.
"I love playing with him."
"I don't mean to say he's the best player in the league, but he's definitely in the top three," Jagr said, praising his center.
"I never thought at the end of my career I would play with a hockey player like him."
"It makes me happy."
"I want to support him."
"All these years in the NHL, my teammates have tried to help me, and now it's my turn," Jagr added.
Carolina made the match more dramatic with the help of Tuomo Ruutu and Dwyer's penalty, reducing the gap to one goal.
Further complications were averted by Matt Reed, who widened the gap to two points.
"Pronger did very well in our zone."
"He hit the puck, I accelerated and Reed went to the far edge."
"I took aim at him and I'm glad it worked," Voracek described his impression of the last goal of the match.
The victory moved Philadelphia into first place in the Eastern Conference.
Montreal defenseman Jaroslav Spacek did not finish the game against Buffalo; he left the game in the second period because of an upper-body injury.
Together with an experienced defenseman, the Canadiens lost their two-point lead and lost 2-3 after a penalty shoot-out.
Tomas Plekanec failed to score during one of their attacks.
More than points lost, the home coach was frustrated by the number of injuries in the back row as the match ended with just five defenders.
"The situation is bad."
"We finished the match with only one experienced player, the rest were young people."
"Whatever it is, there is nothing we can do about it, we just have to put up with it," Jacques Martin said.
'Substitution after substitution, it was amazing and we couldn't resist. '
"We needed to simplify the game, move the puck out of our zone."
"That was our weakness," defenseman P.K. Subban added.
After 30 attacks, Czech goaltender Ondzej Pavelec helped Winnipegs beat Tampa Bay 5-2.
The goals by the Jets, who ended a five-game losing streak, were scored by five different players.
Trends in travel prices since 1989
Until 1989, only five state tourism agencies could operate in the former Czechoslovakia: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
Because travel to the West was severely restricted, travel agencies at the time mainly sold tours to socialist bloc countries.
Thus, Czech tourists went on vacation to the German Democratic Republic; the Soviet Union (Sochi, Crimea on the Black Sea); Bulgaria; Romania (both countries on the Black Sea); and Hungary (Balaton).
The only exception was between 1962 and 1972, when we had the opportunity to travel to Yugoslavia. Then the Yugoslav regime turned to the West, which entailed considerable restrictions on Czech tourists "travel to Yugoslavia.
The great paradox of the socialist period was that citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e. Czechoslovakia as well) were not allowed individual travel to socialist countries.
If a Czechoslovak citizen wanted to travel on his or her own to, say, the Soviet Union or Poland, an invitation letter from that country was needed; there was no other way to travel individually.
At the time, travel agencies offered trips to the West, but you had to either stand in line all night with a sleeping bag, or have "good friends" at the agency.
And that was not all.
Currency permits were necessary for travel to the West. They were not issued to politically unreliable people who were not allowed to travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not freely convertible; without currency authorization, it was impossible to obtain funds (Western currency) to travel to the West.
More often than not, Czechs spent their vacations at home, resulting in a large number of cottages and summer homes, a habit that continues to this day.
After 1989, tourism in the Czech Republic thus experienced a real revolution.
Whereas before 1989 holidays in the GDR or Bulgaria were the culmination of our travels, last year Czechs spent 4.5 million holidays in countries around the world.
The great paradox that we are no longer aware of is that, until 1989, we could not freely visit Croatia, now the most popular, because it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
At the very beginning of 1990, visa requirements for the neighboring countries of Western Europe were abolished, setting in motion a huge wave of short trips, mainly to Vienna and Germany.
Czechoslovaks could not be satisfied with traveling to the West. Everyone wanted to go there at least for a moment.
In Paris, for example, Czech tourists slept in parks in tents because their income at the time was not enough for a hotel or a guesthouse.
A typical feature of Czech tourism at that time was the desire to bring their own food (canned food, salami, etc.) in order to save money.
Another important point is the introduction of the freely convertible Czech crown. After decades, our tourists are finally free to buy Western currency.
Our standard of living and average income have been rising, which has led to another important development since around 1997.
Since 1997, increased demand has enabled travel agencies to prepare regular flights operated by charter airlines. Compared to the past, air travel is now incredibly cheap, thanks to the ability to book bulk discounts.
By the late 1990 "s, Czechs did not need a visa to visit virtually all of the world's developed countries except the US, which made our travel even easier.
The next major event in the history of travel after the revolution took place in 2000. Strong demand led to the historic first direct charter flight from the Czech Republic to an exotic country, Thailand.
Since then, direct charter flights have taken Czech tourists to warm exotic countries. This winter, flights from the Czech Republic will depart to twelve exotic destinations.
Today, about 100,000 Czechs visit exotic countries every year!
Another important event of this period, symbolizing our development since the revolution, took place in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the United States abolished the need to obtain a visa for Czech tourists, thus permanently joining the world's most developed countries.
For the first time in history, Czechs spent more than half of their vacations abroad in 2008 (50.3%); and for the first time in history, they spent more than 15,000 crowns per person on vacation abroad, including their spending at their destination.
Assembly must elect president, stalemate threat returns
For about five months, Czech football has been without a president. There is a risk that Ivan Gašek's successor, the head of the Czech Football Association (FAČR), will not be named even after another extraordinary general meeting, to be held in Nymburk on Tuesday.
There is still no agreement on which election rules to follow.
Without this, voting for one of the three candidates will not begin.
Jindrich Reichl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomas Patzlik are eager to lead Czech football.
Hasek resigned from his post in June, and when he left, he called on his colleagues to unite and find a strong personality to lead football in the future.
Yet the Gašek era has plunged football once again into strife between the two chambers of the association, which cannot choose a single candidate.
This became abundantly clear on September 16, when a new president was to be elected.
The delegates to the general assembly arrived in vain at the National House in Prague, Smichov, because the negotiations remained blocked, not only by the election procedure.
There was no agreement on whether the right to vote at the general meeting was restricted to legal representatives or also to authorized officials.
This point has since been partly addressed by the recommendation of the Institute of State and Law that representation based on the powers granted is not possible.
Disputes over election rules, however, continue.
Nor has the Executive Board helped much, though its meetings, both ordinary and extraordinary, have focused on this issue.
Perceptions about how to vote have changed several times, but the key question remains the same.
The question is: how do we move on to Round 3 and avoid a stalemate?
"The dispute is whether to follow the established norms or find a different model," says one of FACR's vice-presidents, Dusan Svoboda, who represents professional football in the association's management.
Based on the model established by the statute, the winner of the third round is the candidate with the strong support of the chamber from which he or she is running.
Moravia is said to be willing to compromise to consider the candidate with the highest number of votes in both houses the winner of the election.
The Czech side insists that in the overall percentage, the winner must win at least two-thirds of the vote.
"However, the previous two rounds would then have lost their meaning; this would have totally rejected the concept of two chambers," Svoboda agrees with Moravia's arguments. He says it would have been better not to change the rules and vote according to the existing rules.
Somewhat unexpectedly, Tomasz Patzlík agrees with his opinion, although the electoral rules defined by the constitution are more favorable to Pelta than to other candidates.
"I would like the elections to be held as much as possible in accordance with the statute."
"I want to avoid all kinds of representational stupidity, like at the previous general meeting," says the owner of Victoria Pilsen, who is a first-time candidate; and in his remarks he mostly contradicted Pelta.
Pelta remains optimistic.
He believes that the new president will be known in Nymburk; he also hopes that the candidates will cooperate constructively in the future.
"All the emotional ferment will calm down after today's expected entry of the national team into the European Championship."
"Football will be on a happy wave again, people will be more willing to cooperate," says the representative of Jablonec. Of the three candidates, he has the most experience in football management, both at the professional and regional levels.
Reichl is more restrained.
"I hope for an agreement, but the situation is very ambiguous."
"This is not between Bohemians and Moravians, but there are attempts to deliberately adapt the rules."
"This could cause another disruption of the general meeting."
"I hope common sense prevails," Reichl said.
There is not much time left for the parties to reach an agreement.
According to some reports, separate talks took place directly in Montenegro; but who knows if football unity will be achieved before the match.
An additional flight that was supposed to take, among others, vice-presidents Dalibor Kuceru and Raihl to Podgorica did not leave Prague in the morning due to a technical fault.
After all, the ministerial-level meeting expected on Wednesday could be crucial.
The Minister of Education, Youth and Sports, Josef Dobesch, would like the opposing sides in the strongest sports association in the country to come to an agreement.
Much is at stake: government subsidies; football's creditworthiness; and the planned general meeting of ČSTV with the new Czech Sports Directorate after Sázka's financial problems.
Patzlik enters presidential race as he sees no suitable candidate
If, before the extraordinary general meeting, the head of Pilsen's football players, Tomas Patzlík, had seen a strong candidate who met all his requirements for the presidency of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR), he would not even have applied for a high post.
"If there was a worthy candidate, I would have fought for him and I wouldn't have fought for him."
"But no such person has been found yet," Patzlik told ČTK.
Patzlík's motive for entering the fray with Miroslav Pelta and Jindrich Reichl is to try to prevent Pelta, the presumed front-runner in the election, from entering the FAČR administration.
Moreover, Patzlik emphasizes that if he wins, he will remain president only until 2013, when the next general meeting is scheduled.
In the future, he would like to have an experienced top manager who is not too connected with football life.
'I've spoken to a few people that I could have had in mind. '
'It was horrible for me to hear some of them say they didn't even want to play Czech football at the moment. '
"I would like to change that view," he said.
Currently, Patzlick's main disagreement with Pelta stems from the latter's relationship with Roman Berbre, the president of the regional football association in Pilsen. Berbre is a controversial figure who is known behind the scenes as an influential lobbyist capable of influencing the votes of delegates to the general assembly.
Patzlik thus finds it unacceptable that Pelta should become president.
'If he wins, the current situation won't change and football won't move forward. '
"With the support of Berbre, a capable businessman, it would be even more damaging for football," Patzlick said.
He alludes to the fact that a few years ago, Pelta's name was recorded during phone taps in a corruption investigation; Pelta escaped conviction.
'I don't know what prestige a Pelta win would bring to football. '
"And what would we look like in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Patzlick, who now makes no mention of his earlier statement that he would "sell the Pilsen club if Pelta becomes president."
If Patzlick wins on Thursday, he could imagine working with Pelta in the future.
That view is shared by another candidate, Reichl, whom Patzlick endorsed before a general assembly in September that ended in fiasco.
'He (Pelta) would be the first person I'd turn to. '
'He's very capable. '
"I can imagine him leading the national team."
"But he can't run an association."
"I don't hold my nose about things that I don't understand either," said Patzlik, who attracted a lot of attention in September when he supported the removal of the judging team led by Ludek Maciela, who was replaced by Dagmar Damkova.
Patzlik says he will risk running the association.
He cites his experience managing private companies; since last summer, he has managed the Pilsen team, which with his help celebrated its first league triumph in May.
"I have the power to make the football environment change, to support its change for the better."
"To limit the influence of certain groups of individuals who tend to influence the disciplinary and appeals board, which leads to disgusting situations," said Patzlik. He makes no secret of his antipathy to, for example, the director of Sparta, Daniel Krzetinski.
One of his priorities will be to strengthen the relationship between FACR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with whose help he will lobby at the highest political level for more lottery money for sports.
'This is one of the key things that the new president should be doing. '
"If gambling is taxed, as the political parties claim, I understand their arguments, but they need to be clear about where the money will go," he said.
Patzlik does not see his association with the Pilsen club as a burden, although he argues that the president of the FACR should be independent.
Pelta is associated with Jablonec, and Reichl with Prague Dukla.
"It's not ideal."
"And yet I don't see the point in hypocritically transferring my shares of the Pilsen club to someone else if I'm going to be back there in six months," Patzlik says.
Pelta Promises New FACR Rules to Avoid Elected Pat
Two days before the Football Association's general meeting, one of the presidential candidates, Miroslav Pelta, promised that if elected, he would fight for new FACR rules in order to avoid future disputes over election rules.
Prior to Thursday's talks in Nymburk, the Jablonets functionary remains optimistic and believes that the attention from the pre-election struggle will significantly distract from today's expected success of our football team.
Before the failed election in September, Pelta had promised that if he won, he would focus on both representation and fundraising.
He decided to run at the last minute before the last general meeting. A two-month delay could thus be useful for him to defend his ideas about football in a broader context.
"People at all levels have been in football for a long time and they expect the president to be known on Thursday." "
"They feel that now is the time for someone to lead the association," says a man mainly associated with the Jablonec club; but he has spent many years at Sparta and the association's executive committee.
This suggests that he is experienced enough to run Czech football.
He believes that the current problems are caused by the euphoria that prevailed during the rule of Ivan Gašek.
"Unfortunately, the rules, which were not as perfect as we all thought, were adopted at the general meeting in June."
"If different modes of representation had not been adopted, we would have had a president since September," Pelta said.
He treated the rewriting of a key Civil Association document as a false goal for delegates.
"If I become president, I will consider it my personal task, and I am going to take personal responsibility if this attempt fails."
"This is a fundamental question without which we cannot exist," says Pelta.
Beyond that, he says he's not trying to set himself apart from his rivals.
He has said in the past that he can imagine collaborating with Jindrich Reichl, whom he values for his legal education; he is well aware that his rival candidate should be his first vice-president.
For a long time, he did not attack Thomas Patzlick, who was a constant critic of Pelta.
'He's been in football for over a year and has had some success. '
"Whatever the case, his attacks were unseemly, and many people were surprised by his campaign methods."
"It is also why some of them now doubt his true identity," Pelta said of his rival. Pelta himself maintains that he is true to the declarations he announced in September.
He considers his main weapon knowledge of football, from competitions at the lowest level to the national team.
The national team should represent all football.
"I would also try to stop all incidents, starting with the Bohemians case or the aftermath of last year's corruption scandal."
"Immediately after that, I would focus on negotiating with both the private and public sectors to ensure that there is enough money for all football," the 46-year-old said two months ago.
He then promised that his election as football chief would not lead to staff being sacked.
"I will need to know the job descriptions of individual employees." This was his message to Strakhov, where a protracted period of interregnum causes understandable nervousness.
Despite the current cataclysmic scenarios surrounding the planned general assembly, he believes that delegates will not come to Nymburk in vain on Thursday.
"If the only issue is how to hold elections in the third round, we can deal with it."
"Football needs the trust that it can gain only by finally electing its leader," says Pelta, who, two days before a key day in his career as a functionary, remains optimistic.
Reichl promises that under his leadership the FACR will become active
If Jindrich Reichl, the current vice-president, becomes president of the Czech Football Association at Thursday's meeting, many people in the Association are rumoured to be unhappy.
Reichl promises that if elected, it will be a time of hard work.
He wants to introduce changes to the system and make executive committee members responsible for certain areas of football.
He also promises to tackle the Bohemians problem; improve relations with both UEFA and FIFA; bring more money into football; and continue the work of the previous president, Ivan Gašek.
"As president, I would like to focus on football in general."
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA, to the national team, professional football and youth football events."
"This is not to say that I will do everything myself," Reichl said in an interview for CTK.
"I am a team player and I want to distribute powers on the executive committee so that each member focuses on a particular area."
"I will carefully allocate tasks so that in each of these segments football will take big steps forward."
"It probably won't appeal to a lot of people because it will mean hard work, not just criticising the work of others," he added.
The atmosphere of criticism in the football movement allegedly made him doubt his candidacy.
"I know that I work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know if that makes any sense; and that I won't be surrounded by people putting sticks in my wheels and questioning my every move," he explained.
"However, many people have told me that I must not give up, otherwise others will come."
"It's a trust I can't throw away," he said.
Moreover, he says that his motivation is to continue the work that he started with Gashek.
"A lot of work has been done in those two years and I don't want to overshadow it."
"Processes have been initiated that could yield results in a few years, and I don't want anyone else to stop them," he said, fearing that if another candidate, Miroslav Pelta, is elected, the situation in the Association could return to what it was before Gašek.
"I believe in a systematic approach, and that is something that Mirek Pelta is hardly competent at."
'He's surrounded by people who play football in a way that is accessible only to a select few. '
"I can be blamed for many things, but certainly not for subjectivity."
"I try to be objective."
"I want to make football accessible to everyone because then everyone will have a good time, not just a select minority," Reichl said.
Moreover, he refutes the charge that he will be only the president of the Czech Republic.
"Although many people try to argue otherwise, I plan to do my best for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to think about dividing the second league into the Czech and Moravian parts, the winners of which would continue to fight in the first league."
"This will prevent the current situation where there are only three Moravian teams in the league, which is a problem for young players in Moravia," said Reichl.
While Pilsen club manager Tomas Patzlik entered the presidential race, Reichl does not dare to assess his chances of winning.
"Nevertheless, I still feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which elected me as its vice-president, and I see that I have made some obvious progress," said Reichl.
On the other hand, he partly blames himself for the lack of unity in the association.
Claiming that Pelta had been "excluded from the process of returning creditworthiness to Czech football," he sees another rival, Patzlik, as a strong candidate with much to offer.
"No one can doubt that he did an excellent job in Pilsen this year."
"If he is elected, I hope that he will continue what Ivan Hasek started, without significant personnel changes in the committees."
"He wouldn't distort the facts for his own benefit," Reichl said of his rival.
Europe's most beautiful swimming pools
Jump in the water
Julia Stanek
Children's pools with universal fiber optics and status pools in Budapest. Travelers can experience Europe's incredible water - and relax their tired bodies in a Jacuzzi after a city tour or a walk.
One book can tell you where the best water is.
Iris Meder couldn't do without one thing during her research trips over the past year and a half: her bathing suit.
Lying on her back in the water, she looked up at the tastefully decorated domes, swam to the marble cherubs waiting for her at the edge of the pool and admired the carefully restored Art Nouveau swimming pools.
She hastened to add every swimming pool she liked to her notebook - with important details about the building's construction and history.
Architectural historian Meder has seen more than 200 swimming pools - and has now collected impressions in her recently published book Badefreuden (The Joy of Bathing), which includes everything from public pools in Munich to historic bathing palaces in the Black Forest and "functional concrete buildings" in Taunus.
In addition to Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, she visited baths in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, and Poland - and one city each in Luxembourg, Serbia, and Croatia.
The 46-year-old author is a true swimming enthusiast.
She has very little enthusiasm for the sport, Meder says, but things are different in the water.
The only drawback is that swimming fans have to put up with blue tiles and the smell of chlorine, while runners can breathe the alluring scent of coniferous forests or listen to the joyous twitching of birds in the park.
"I once asked myself why swimming pools should always be so horrible," says Meder, who lives in Vienna.
"So I started collecting beautiful pools."
When the Surface Doubles Architecture
Splashing in the pool and gourmet oils in the sauna are so important health factors in baths because, according to Meder, all senses are stimulated.
And swimming pools can be a real eye-opener if the builders do the work. "Instead of having a pool floor, you have a surface of water."
"The surface is very transparent, but it also reflects the beauty of the whole building."
Everything is visually reflected: high ceilings, coloured tiles and springboards.
The 190-page illustrated edition of The Joy of Bathing contains valuable information about the architectural and cultural history of health oases - and makes you want to jump in.
A collector of Meder reservoirs discovered several outstanding specimens during research in Hungary.
She found nitrate-rich water in a karst cave (Miskolc Tapolc Cave) and a thermal bath filled with alkaline water in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jasberen), as well as splendid therapeutic baths, such as the 100-year-old Széchény Baths in Budapest.
The many heated outdoor pools in Switzerland and Austria, on the other hand, offer stunning views. You can see all of Zurich from the rooftop swimming pool or view the snowy Arlberg from the outdoor pool in St. Anton. And the steam room has a window that allows you to see what is happening on the ski slopes.
Perhaps the most unusual design awaits bathers in Langenfeld. The Aqua Cathedral in Ötztal looks like a UFO that has just landed in the Alps.
In winter, steam from three open shells rises from it, which seems quite small against the backdrop of the Ötztal Mountains.
The Alhambra in the Black Forest
The Meder pool collector did not find the smell of chlorine in every pool.
Many thermal baths smell of sulphur. The baths named after Árpád in Bekescsaba smell so strongly of oil that you may find it hard to believe that you are in a wellness spring.
The smell is caused by hydrocarbonates in alkaline water. The water is almost black from the silt that sticks to the skin as soon as you dive into the pool - a wellness experience of a certain type.
Iris Meder, however, at one point became disillusioned with her search for beautiful swimming spots. When she tried to visit the outdoor swimming pool of the Czech Baths in Luhačovice, she found the area sealed.
The baths, designed by architect Dušan Jurković in 1902, were closed.
When Meder peered through the windows of the red, white and yellow Art Nouveau building, she saw weeds growing between the tiles.
One of the places where the destruction was stopped in its tracks is the amazing swimming pool in the Black Forest - the Palace of Thermal Waters in Bad Wildbad.
The pools have already gone through three stages of construction. You will find not only neo-Romanesque elements of the period after construction in 1844, but also a Moorish Alhambra Hall, added around 1900.
After a thorough renovation in 1995, the Thermal Palace is the favorite swimming pool of pool connoisseur Iris Meder - and not just because she hails from the Black Forest.
"It's a real achievement to combine such different architectural styles so skillfully," says Meder.
Diving in a thermal pool in such a palace is clearly a secondary activity.
Agricultural speculation
Deutsche Bank is investigating agricultural trading.
Christian Thieves
Will Deutsche Bank stop trading in agricultural products?
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, Joseph Ackermann commissioned a working group to investigate the impact of speculation on the world's poor.
The CEO plans to make the changes in January.
Hamburg -
For German citizens, the situation is clear. According to one study, 84 percent of Germans find it unacceptable that banks speculate on agricultural products such as wheat and maize.
Two-thirds of respondents are demanding that Deutsche Bank and other banks stop trading in agricultural products, as trade exacerbates the problems facing the world's poorest people.
The findings were made in a study conducted by the Forsa Institute for Social Research and Statistical Analysis on behalf of consumer organisation Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report submitted by Foodwatch in mid-October.
The report's author, Harald Schuman, demonstrates that betting on world commodity exchanges drives up prices - and banks are thus complicit in a worldwide famine.
The consumer-advocacy campaign is directed directly at Deutsche Bank's chief executive, Joseph Ackermann, even though big banking houses like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley trade in the same way.
Initially, commodity bets were conceived as a means of protecting traders from price fluctuations.
Whatever the case, most experts now agree that players have abandoned the rules of supply and demand - and are profiting at the expense of the poorest.
Unlike competitors in the United States, Ackermann has responded to the criticism, pledging to investigate the allegations and saying that no trade "is worth risking Deutsche Bank's good reputation."
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international task force is currently investigating the allegations contained in the Foodwatch report.
The investigation is due to be completed by the end of the year, when the results will be presented to Deutsche Bank's board of directors - with recommendations for action.
The head of the bank then plans to announce changes following the investigation at the end of January.
Trade in goods may decline or stop altogether.
Ackermann is working on his image.
Foodwatch President Thilo Bode welcomed the news, highlighting his criticism of the financial sector. "Betting on rising food prices is a glaring example of how thoughtless banks are now acting against the common interest."
As the bank's chief lobbyist, Ackermann has a certain responsibility, according to Bode.
"Deutsche Bank should remove from its portfolio all investments that place monetary bets on food prices," Bode said.
"It doesn't matter if it's starving people or Deutsche Bank's reputation."
Ackermann's quick reaction is surprising at first, but in the meantime the director would like to have an impeccable image just a few months before the end of his tenure.
Deutsche Bank announced on Monday that the chairman would not be joining the supervisory board as planned.
Abolishing controversial speculation in the food market could improve its image.
Nor does he have to worry about spending - his successor will have to deal with the consequences.
One in two would refuse to invest in goods.
Foodwatch is trying to keep the pressure on the manager.
To date, more than 30,000 Internet users have joined the organization's campaign.
Bode published the study on Tuesday. The study was conducted for the Forsa Institute for Social Research and Statistical Analysis on November 7 and 8, and 1,001 people took part.
No more than eleven percent believe that investments that bet on the price of food are acceptable to Deutsche Bank.
Many banking customers would also take concrete steps if they discovered that their bank was involved in such trading. According to the study, one in two would withdraw deposits that ultimately lead to commodity speculation.
43 per cent would recommend leaving the bank, while 49 per cent said they would consider closing an account and switching to another bank.
The House of the 21st Century in Vienna
Pavilion in a new place
Ingeborg Winsowski
An architectural story with ups and downs and a happy ending. Austria's pavilion for the 1958 World Expo in Brussels won prizes, became a museum in Vienna, was empty and abandoned.
Now it is being reopened as an exhibition centre.
The Austrian Pavilion, designed by Karl Schwanzer for the 1958 World Expo in Brussels, is a well-known example of modern post-war architecture, with its simple forms, glass halls, bold ones that expressed faith in technological progress.
The Schwanzer Pavilion won the Grand Prix of Architecture in 1958 for its light, soaring steel and glass structure.
The building is considered a landmark in modern architecture.
This made the architect so famous that he also built the Austrian pavilion at the next World Exhibition.
After all, he became famous around the world in 1973 for his legendary four-cylinder BMW turret and its sister, a bowl-shaped building.
The pavilion, designed as a temporary exhibition building, was moved to the Swiss Garden near Vienna's South Station, converted and opened as the 20th Century Museum in 1962 - and is often referred to as the "20th Century House" for this reason.
In any case, the building was not suitable for a museum for technical and spatial reasons - it had no walls on which to hang works of art and poor air conditioning.
However, it continued to be used until contemporary art in Vienna received a new home.
The house had been empty since 2001, and its condition was getting worse and worse.
Architect Adolf Krishanitz has now restored the pavilion, which has been named the "House of the 21st Century" and will be used as a museum of contemporary art.
This museum - a branch of the Belvedere Museum that will open its first exhibition on Tuesday evening - is in every sense a joyous event.
Agnes Husslein-Arko, who became the new director of Austria's Belvedere Gallery in 2007, has been instrumental in this new venture.
Husslein-Arko, an art history graduate with a brilliant career as a figure skater in her youth who worked at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and eventually became founder and director of the Museum of Contemporary Art in Salzburg, persuaded politicians and curators to continue the renovation, raised public funds and private donations, and decided on how the building would be used.
The new museum was to contain a permanent exhibition of the Fritz Wotruba Foundation, a café and a bookstore, along with contemporary art, and an office building was to be built.
Strict Control & Limited Budget
Krishanitz was then the ideal candidate for the project.
He was known, of course, for the restoration and expansion of Joseph Olbrich's Vienna Secession, and won the competition, but he also studied with Schwanzer at the Vienna University of Technology, and the pavilion was "an extremely important place" for him, where he visited exhibitions "almost every week."
He knew the original design and knew the challenges facing the building, a building that had already lost some of its grandeur and lightness when it was moved to Vienna and converted.
The problems encountered in the last redevelopment were much more serious. The building was an "energy sink," Krishanitz says.
Window profiles on the glass facade were replaced, glass-reinforced safety glass was inserted, and the glass roof was replaced with high-strength safety glass.
The steel bars of the heat bridge were reinforced or replaced, and asbestos was removed from the ceilings.
The lower two floors have created space for the new use of the building, the sunken light well between the building and the street provides lighting - almost a new building, but still a graceful Schwanzer Pavilion.
The original exterior doors have been preserved and the building has been painted an old red-brown colour to protect against corrosion.
The cinema hall is the same as it used to be.
All this is done under strict control of museum management and with a limited budget.
"We often had to find material that was good, cheap, and would be approved by the museum board," Krishanitz says, pointing to the uneven flooring in the basement.
The building has remained flexible and light, despite constraints, challenges, and conversions.
Krishanitz recently remarked that the "Brussels Pavilion" was rough - a typical "drop-in-the-city" story.
Such an architecture is "always out of place" and yet wants to "stimulate real awareness."
The 21st-century house is in the right place, because the town planning had an unexpected stroke of luck. A completely remodeled "main station quarter" with offices and residential real estate grows around the Swiss Garden.
A second happy event could happen. The 21st century house could be complemented by a second Krishanitz building - the collector Francesca von Habsburg has acquired Berlin's Temporary Exhibition Hall and is reportedly in talks with the city about its location next door in the Swiss Garden.
Deutsche Bahn Plans Multi-Million Winter Crisis Package
Deutsche Bahn has unveiled a crisis-fighting plan to avoid train cancellations in the winter.
The number of employees should double.
The costs will run into millions of euros.
According to the newspaper, Deutsche Bahn will spend an additional €70 million this year to avoid winter cancellations and train delays.
Referring to Deutsche Bahn's internal anti-crisis plan, Bild newspaper reports that investments totalling around 300 million euros are planned until 2015.
The investments are designed to improve the performance of locomotives and the rail network, even in extreme weather conditions.
The number of in-house and outsourced staff involved in clearing snow from tracks and platforms will be doubled, to 16,000.
The goal is to clear the platforms of snow and ice before work starts and 90 percent of the required hands within four to five hours.
Rüdiger Grube, head of Deutsche Bahn, warned of the possibility of train cancellations and delays this winter at a meeting with government and industry leaders two months ago.
Last winter, Deutsche Bahn experienced significant difficulties with passenger traffic because it lacked reserves when weather conditions worsened.
Many new regional trains have been waiting years for approval by the Federal Railroad Service.
There were also some delays to ICE trains.
Deutsche Bahn has also had to carry out far more frequent checks on the axles of ICE trains over the years, after one of the ICE trains broke an axle at the main station in Cologne.
Deutsche Bank to pay multi-million pound fine in US
The new troubles come on the heels of turmoil surrounding Joseph Ackermann, Deutsche Bank's chief executive, with Deutsche Bank facing a multi-million pound fine in the US.
As if Deutsche Bank didn't have enough trouble at home, the industrial giant's past in the US has now caught up with it. Deutsche Bank, headquartered in Frankfurt, will pay $145 million (€106 million) to settle disputes arising from the bankruptcy of the five largest credit unions during the financial crisis.
The problem arose over the sale of mortgage bonds.
The National Credit Union Authority (NCUA), the financial-market regulator, accuses a number of major banks of using false promises to trick credit unions into buying their financial products.
Bond prices plummeted during the financial crisis and dragged down credit unions.
"We are pleased to have resolved this matter without litigation," a Deutsche Bank spokesman in New York said.
The bank pleaded not guilty in the settlement.
The same is true for Citigroup, which agreed to pay $20.5 million.
NCUA President Debbie Matz welcomed the swift response of both banks.
The National Credit Union Authority (NCUA) is responsible for US credit unions and intervenes in bankruptcy processes to protect consumer deposits.
The NCUA is fighting to compensate for losses that run into the billions.
This is the first agreement of its kind.
The regulator has also turned its attention to other major banks and in the summer brought cases against JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
Questionable mortgage bonds are so-called mortgage-backed securities.
They are backed by domestic borrowing.
This sealed the fate of a number of financial firms when the US housing bubble burst in 2007.
The US investment bank Lehman Brothers ordered a long life in September 2008 on the brink of financial crisis.
A few years later, banks in the US are still struggling with the storm.
Investors and regulators have filed a large number of claims, demanding compensation or punishment for the fraudsters.
Behind the largest wave of claims is the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA).
It accuses the 18 largest international banks of having purchased collateral agreements worth about $200 billion from US lenders Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
Deutsche Bank also faces the threat of legal action from the FHFA over numerous agreements worth a total of $14.2 billion concluded between 2005 and 2007.
The regulator is demanding that the Frankfurt-based bank take responsibility for "substantial losses," but has not yet specified the exact amount.
Deutsche Bank dismissed the claims as unfounded and said it intended to contest them.
Warren Buffett invests $10 billion in IBM
Buffett, the financial guru, is investing heavily in the IT company IBM.
Since March, he has bought more than ten billion dollars worth of shares.
Until now, the largest US investor, Warren Buffett, has always said that he does not invest in computer and IT companies, because their long-term development is difficult to predict.
But IBM's annual report changed his mind about investment in the industry.
Buffett said he should have realized much earlier that IBM primarily offers services and buys computer systems for other companies "IT departments.
In the financial world, Warren Buffett's investment was regarded as a chivalrous act.
IBM, an IT veteran, has now been dubbed "Sir IBM."
In an interview with US business television network CNBC, Buffett said that since March, he has purchased IBM shares worth a total of $10.7 billion.
His investment holding, Berkshire Hathaway, became one of IBM's largest shareholders with a 5.5 percent stake.
Buffett said that even IBM was unaware of his involvement until recently.
He praised a management that managed to make a profit even during the financial crisis.
"They did a great job," Buffett said, referring to management strategy.
For a considerable time, IBM has been focused on high-margin IT services such as data centers.
The founder of the computer industry, who is now more than 100 years old, also offers software and consulting services, as well as powerful computers for business.
So far, Buffett has shunned technology companies.
He argued that he only invests in companies whose businesses he understands
and has invested, for example, in rail freight, lubricants, and machinery.
His holding company, Berkshire Hathaway, owns stakes in a long list of major companies, such as Coca-Cola and Munich Re (formerly Münchener Rück), along with some 80 of its own subsidiaries.
The 81-year-old bought the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and, with skillful investment, built it into one of the world's most expensive companies.
His way of life, however, remained modest,
making him a cult figure for countless investors around the world.
His almost unmistakable instinct for making money earned him the nickname "The Oracle of Omaha."
IBM's share price rose one percent before the markets opened after Buffett's investment announcement.
The "blue giant," as IBM is also known, is worth more than $220 billion on the stock market, making it one of the world's most expensive high-tech companies, along with Apple and Microsoft.
Buffett, however, said he has no intention of investing in Microsoft.
Its founder, Bill Gates, is a close friend.
The Immediate Danger
After the discovery of the "Zwickau cell," Turkish media began to question the rule of law in Germany.
One newspaper speaks of a "bloody ideology" that is now resurfacing.
The murders of eight Turkish and one Greek businessman between 2000 and 2006 were the result of right-wing extremist ideology.
Fear and concern have become a reaction to this message in Turkey and in the German-Turkish community in Germany.
For many Turks in Germany, this news has brought to life long-forgotten fears. Such right-wing extremist attacks on Turks have not occurred since the arson attacks in Mellna in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993.
It was never in doubt, however, that xenophobia existed in Germany.
But the right-wing extremist network that has now been discovered is of a scale that has not yet been fully understood.
"Revival of bloody ideology?" was the headline of the online version of the Turkish newspaper Haberturk.
Sabah, on the other hand, notes that one of the perpetrators was a secret informant for the secret services, and expresses concern that the German authorities could be drawn into a right-wing extremist swamp.
The Turkish Community in Germany (TGD) reacted calmly, commemorating the victims of racial hatred with a silent vigil in front of the Brandenburg Gate this weekend.
Just two weeks ago, the Turkish community of Berlin celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish bilateral labor agreement at a ceremony attended by German and Turkish politicians.
Cooperation between the two countries was presented in a positive light - as a success story.
Coverage in some Turkish media was like a slap in the face. "A gift from Germany for the fiftieth anniversary" is the title of an article on the Turkish Internet portal Haber X commenting on the circumstances of the series of killings.
The German publication Hürriyet also did not miss an opportunity to draw this parallel.
"It starts to smell bad" is the title of Ahmet Külahcı's column.
He notes that people who paid their taxes and contributed substantially to the transformation of Germany through their work were killed.
The conduct of the police and the subsequent successful raid drew sharp criticism on German-Turkish Internet forums.
The authors wondered why the German authorities had not thought sooner about monitoring suspicious individuals in right-wing extremist circles.
Some of the authors have gone so far as to say that "if they continue to act as clumsily as they did, migrants will have no choice but to act in self-defense."
"It will be the best self-defense."
"Peace in Germany depends very much on how the whole network is uncovered and on the legality of the punishment," writes "Selen."
The crimes in Melln and Solingen in the 1990 "s were an example that peace in Germany is under threat.
A photograph of burned ruins in Solingen is deeply etched in the minds of Germans and Turks.
No other event has shown so clearly to the Turks living here that they are in danger, and to the Germans that mistrust and indifference can turn into real violence.
These crimes, however, have increased the sense of unity among Turks.
Don't repeat the mistakes of the past
The Turkish press at the time condemned mainly the failures of the German police after the attacks. Helmut Kohl refused to visit the Melln survivors.
He sent a telegram of condolences to the President of Turkey after the arson attacks in Solingen, but his foreign minister, Klaus Kinkel-Kinkel, attended the memorial ceremony in Cologne, calculating the taxes Turks pay in Germany.
It is as if he has defined a person's worth by the taxes he pays.
The current coverage in the Turkish media once again shows how deep the distrust of many German Turks towards the current German state has deepened since then.
By making clear what needs to be done now, beyond efforts to identify and re-evaluate right-wing extremist terrorist organizations in Germany.
Banking scandal on Lake Zurich
Most of Europe's risky banks are not in France or Italy, but in Switzerland.
UBS nearly went bankrupt during the financial crisis, and has struggled with one crisis after another ever since.
Now it is up to the German to get him back on track.
Alex Weber probably didn't know he was going to get the role.
In July, following his spectacular departure as head of the Federal Bank, it was announced that he would take up an equally spectacular position in 2013: Chairman of the Board of Directors of the largest Swiss bank, UBS; an unexpected and lucrative career move.
Alex Weber was clearly delighted, praising Switzerland for its beauty, UBS for its newfound solidity, and making some friendly remarks to his future colleagues.
"UBS has managed to change for the better."
"I'm looking forward to working with Caspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
But it became clear in September that things would be very different.
A UBS trader in London bypassed the bank's security systems and lost about €1.7 billion.
UBS CEO Oswald Gruebel, a banker known not only in Switzerland, had to step down.
Since then, the UBS chairman has been deemed sick, and everyone wants to know: When will Alex Weber finally take over?
Weber has been advising the bank since February 2012.
And, as the bank said on Tuesday, he will take over as chairman in May, not 2013.
It won't be easy for Alex Weber.
He is an economics professor and central banker, not a traditional banker, and he will undoubtedly need time to adapt.
He suddenly found himself in charge of the bank's strategy, which proved once again that it had long deserved to be called "Europe's biggest banking scandal."
UBS, on the one hand, is very large - until recently it managed the world's largest assets - and, on the other, has not recovered from scandals for years.
Nothing, it seems, is spared by the proud Swiss bank.
It all began during the financial crisis.
Until 2007, UBS had an excellent reputation.
The bank combined the image of a secretive and resilient but adept asset manager with ambitious goals and the ambition to become a major player in investment banking.
As a result, in 2007 UBS managed 1.6 billion, thus managing more money from wealthy clients than any other bank in the world,
and entered the league of the world's largest banks as an investment bank.
It made an impression.
Hans Geiger, a former banker and banking professor who has long taught at the Institute of Banking at the University of Zurich, explains: "I have always cited UBS to my students as a model of a good bank."
"Knowing what we know now, you may ask how I could have been so wrong"
He was very wrong indeed.
It was only in 2007 that it became clear that something was wrong at UBS.
In the middle of the year, chief executive Peter Wuffley - regarded as an eminent intellectual and equally brilliant banker - unexpectedly stepped down.
A few months later, we were able to speculate why he left.
The bank's investment arm tried to gamble on sub-prime securities and was forced to write down billions.
Believe it or not, UBS has announced a capital increase of 13 billion Swiss francs to counter the crisis.
The Bank did manage to find investors - but investors that many bankers would have politely rejected not long ago - one very opaque Asian sovereign wealth fund from Singapore and one Arab sovereign wealth fund so secretive that not even its name was disclosed.
It was only the first strike.
In April 2008, things got much worse.
The bank had to announce billions more in losses, and Chairman Marcel Opel - Switzerland's second-highest-paid chairman in 2006 - resigned.
In October 2008, disaster struck. Lack of investment during the financial crisis put UBS at risk of collapse, and the state had to bail it out.
The National Bank bought an undisclosed number of billions of toxic securities from UBS, and the Swiss Confederation paid six billion Swiss francs for a convertible bond with mandatory conversion to become a co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was in shock: the country realized the dramatic consequences of having huge banks based in a small country.
After all, UBS's balance sheet in 2007 was five times larger than all Swiss output (see chart).
"We won't be able to save UBS a second time," said banking analyst Geiger.
The second disaster came soon after the first.
A few months later, UBS capitulated in a tax dispute with the US and said that it was willing to hand over the data of wealthy clients who may have used the bank to evade taxes.
UBS also agreed to pay $780 million, consisting of recoveries of unjustified profits from the business plus fines.
UBS thus more or less admitted that it was an instrument of tax evasion.
At the same time, UBS has lost what has always been its advantage in fighting for wealthy clients - a veil of secrecy.
In the wake of the scandal, Swiss banking secrecy was no longer the same.
The CEO and Chairman of the Board of Directors have since resigned, and
The exodus of customers "money has begun.
In the space of a few months, the bank has lost credibility in both of its main areas of activity - investment because of failed speculation, and asset management because of aiding and abetting tax evasion.
It was only when things calmed down that it seemed that UBS had managed to turn things around, as happened to the rogue trader. A single trader dropped 1.7 billion euros before the bank noticed that something was wrong.
One thing is clear - risk management in the investment division is not yet working.
"The Adoboli incident made it clear that risk controls have not changed enough," said Martin Janssen, a professor of economics and finance at the Swiss Institute of Banking at the University of Zurich.
The CFO of one of Germany's largest banks is also in no doubt: "The problem with UBS is that it doesn't have a tool to control risk."
It is prudence that has long made Swiss bankers custodians of the world's largest assets - not undue risk, but safety for money, whether or not the world outside the Alpine republic has unraveled.
Swiss bank safes have become a symbol of unshakeable reliability, just as Lindt and Sprüngli symbolize refined taste in chocolate.
UBS's Zurich headquarters still conforms to the image of a decent Swiss private bank - only it is a bit bigger.
Its location is itself a classic.
The bank's head office is located in Zurich on Bahnhofstrasse, which leads from the main station directly to Lake Zurich, surrounded by the snow caps of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are luxurious, and the rental rates for shops are among the highest in Europe.
Among the traditional Swiss stores like Confiserie Sprüngli, you can find jewelry companies like Tiffany's.
Swiss banks have been here for hundreds of years, from the National Bank to Credit Suisse and elite private banks like Julius Baer.
A heavy door leads to the UBS lobby.
There are large leather sofas along the marble-covered walls, with a large "Safe" sign next to the bank's emblem.
UBS knows what its customers need: reliability.
But both of Switzerland's largest banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, have at some point abandoned Swiss notions of banking - or, as the head of one of the small Swiss banks believes, betrayed them.
He would not want to see his name in a newspaper - like all Swiss bankers, he, too, cooperates with the two largest banks.
He believes UBS has become too big - particularly in investment banking, where Anglo-Saxons are very active.
In his view, the Swiss have nothing to add here.
"If there is anything, it is that they have long since adapted to Anglo-Saxon customs."
Indeed, it was Anglo-Saxon investment banking that betrayed UBS, yielding its first big profits - and then a debacle. No other European financial institution lost as much money in the jungle of sub-prime assets as Switzerland's largest bank.
The disaster became apparent on October 15, 2008.
"On that Wednesday, the ruling coalition of a small country of seven million people launched the biggest rescue operation in the country's history," writes Lukas Hassig in his book The UBS Crash.
Politicians approved 68 billion Swiss francs (about 45 billion euros) to save the bank from bankruptcy.
How could it come to this?
If you ask Swiss banks, they will say that the problem is mainly UBS's size.
Two of the three largest Swiss banks merged into one large group in June 1998.
There was a bank that was already too big for little Switzerland at the time of the merger - and a bank that continued to grow.
It helped that the two banks that formed UBS complemented each other. One was a wealthy but sophisticated Zurich-based bank specializing in asset management; the other was less wealthy but much more internationalized.
Internationalized investment bankers suddenly had access to large amounts of money that they could use to spin the almighty wheel.
Two names are associated with UBS's growth: Peter Wolfley, UBS group chief executive from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Opel, chairman of the board.
"I have always believed that Wolfley and Opel are a dream team," said banking analyst Hans Geiger.
"Wolffley, an outstanding intellectual, modest and deeply understanding of models and statistics, and Opel, with his inner instinct, who went all the way up, starting as a trainee at a bank."
But Opel eventually relied on Wolffley.
And Wolffley could have made a critical mistake. "He decided that his models were real," says Geiger.
'It's tragic. '
This may be tragic.
Pride precedes defeat.
UBS employees well remember board meetings in which Wolfley always repeated the same slogan - to move Goldman Sachs.
The US bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
At the time, he was at the top of the "tournament table" of banks "successes.
UBS wanted to get to the very top of the table.
He was able to do some of that.
UBS was the largest player in currency and government securities trading.
Authorized management consultants, however, pointed to a weak spot. By what is called "fixed income" in banking terminology, UBS was well behind the largest banks.
UBS has had failures in US mortgage products.
To plug the hole, UBS embarked on a gamble that nearly cost him his life.
Seeking growth, the bank and the hedge fund it founded invested in US sub-prime securities.
This evolved into a large mechanism that pooled securities based on US mortgages and sold them on - continuing to carry the risk itself.
Even as other banks have long sought a way out of this process, UBS has not stopped.
"UBS was buying until the summer of 2007, when the US housing market was already on fire," said banking analyst Geiger.
The higher the growth, the deeper the fall.
One manager after another had to leave as attempts to clean up the bank proved more difficult than first thought.
Posts at UBS have become a child's play with chairs, and to this day remain unreliable.
Whoever heads this huge bank faces an almost impossible task.
It must find a strategy for a bank that has turned its back on all existing business models.
The banking analyst Geiger already has the idea of abandoning investment banking, focusing on asset management, and forgetting his Swiss roots.
The Bank, however, is not (yet) ready to go that far.
Nonetheless, it is clear that investment activity needs to be squeezed significantly.
The bank's new chief executive, Sergio Ermotti, plans to present his future strategy on Tuesday.
The 51-year-old Italian-Swiss banker was actually seen only as a temporary solution when the bank abruptly parted ways with his predecessor, Grübel.
He has since shown character and now heads UBS on a full-time basis, the Zurich bank said on Tuesday.
Ernotti plans to return the investment bank to where it was in the mid-1990s.
It is cutting 3,500 jobs.
But that will not be enough.
UBS needs a development vision.
What is UBS?
How does he plan to make money?
These are the questions Axel Weber must be asking himself.

Recession fears in Europe drag down US stock market
Europe's looming recession dampened US investor sentiment earlier in the week.
Changing governments in Athens and Rome has had little effect.
The continent's decline in industrial production has dampened hopes that the debt crisis can be overcome in its infancy.
The general relief that followed the changes of government in Rome and Athens has not been matched.
The euro fell against the dollar.
Last week, the Italian and Greek glasses were still considered half full, not half empty - but now the problems are back in the spotlight, said Mark Luschini of Janney Mongomery Scott.
Financial exchanges, in particular, were on the sales lists.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed at 12,078, down 0.6 percent.
The market barometer fluctuated between 12,027 and 12,170 points during the trading session.

Eurostat, the statistical service, reported that companies produced two per cent less in September than the previous month.
"We are not on an island; we depend on them," said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
He also said that Europe was unlikely to shake off recession quickly and that banks were showing further signs of weakness.
Legendary investor Warren Buffett could only confirm these fears. In an interview with CNBC, he said that it is not yet clear whether Europe is strong enough to do what is needed to end the crisis.
So, in his view, it is too early to invest in European government bonds or in banks.
Instead, Buffett has thrown a decades-old principle into the dustbin and invested in America's high-tech industry.
His investment in IBM, valued at more than $10 billion, lifted the stock price of the oldest company by nearly one percentage point against the trend in trading.
The stock closed little changed at $187.35.

Smart crows fill cities
Grapes are considered problem birds in many places. Experts now say that these highly intelligent birds will no longer be able to be driven out of cities.
Crows have been part of the urban landscape for centuries, but the number of residents complaining about dirt and noise is increasing in many communities.
The bird problem, however, is far from being solved.
At the first symposium on crows in the town of Leer in East Frisia, experts argued that rooks could no longer be driven out of cities.
Experts from all over Germany discussed possible solutions.
Finding alternatives in cities
Conservationists argued that the root of the problem in cities was the migration of specially protected rooks, pointing out that the use of chemicals in agriculture was increasingly destroying traditional habitats.
Hunting, expanding construction, and cutting down traditional nesting trees made life difficult for birds.
The Crows are under guard.
In the city of Zest in Westphalia and in the northwest in Jever, Dipholz, Achim near Bremen and Ler, there are large colonies with more than 600 breeding pairs.
The controversial plan to shoot crows in Lera made headlines in 2005.
Critics described trapping birds and beating them with sticks as particularly cruel.
"Ordinary moving and scaring doesn't work," said architect and landscape designer Werner Clover of Ler.
Knocking down nests with a jet of water or felling trees often has undesirable consequences, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser of Lahr, Baden-Württemberg.
"Animals are dispersed, and large colonies are divided and spread to other areas."
Intimidation is possible only as an exception near hospitals, nursing homes, and schools.
"We will have to live with them. Getting rid of them is not an option."
In isolation, the urban problem will not be solved, says Lera Mayor Wolfgang Kelner.
A combination of scaring birds away from residential areas in need of protection and encouraging them to return to other areas could be the way out.
"Information stands instead of chainsaws" was the slogan proposed by psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jurgens, who advocates a very different approach to birds. "We need to be confident in ourselves to live with this problem."
Jürgens was one of the founders of the educational crows route in Asherberg in Schleswig-Holstein, where information stands provide information about the lives of highly intelligent rooks.
The project is already attracting interest from tourists.
Jurgens also gave her opinion on complaints about bird noise. "Noise transmits a lot of information. They have a lot to say to each other."
The intelligence and smarts of these birds are legendary. Graves often not only use tools to grab a nice piece, but also make the tools themselves.
Researchers at the University of Cambridge recently tested a measure of bird intelligence on four faces.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to tap a plank to get a moth larva.
Without much training, they learned the size and shape of the stone needed to knock down a board.
In another experiment, intelligent rogues had a more difficult task to solve.
The researchers put a small bucket of moth larvae into a vertical cylinder.
The birds could not get their prey with their beaks.
But the researchers gave them pieces of wire.
All four birds used wire to make hooks and used hooks to grab the bucket by the handle and pull it out of the cylinder.
Three of the four rooks managed it at the first attempt.
Ronaldo takes Portugal to Euro 2012
The hopes of the Bosnians and Turks for a last-minute victory were short-lived.
Favourites Portugal, Croatia and the Czech Republic, plus Ireland, will compete in the 2012 European Championships.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland finished last at Euro 2012 in Poland and Ukraine.
Led by superstar Cristiano Ronaldo, who scored on 8 and 53 minutes, Portugal beat Bosnia-Herzegovina 6-2 (2-1), perfect for their fifth Euro exit after a 0-0 first-leg draw.
It was enough for the Czechs to win 1-0 (0-0) in the second round of the play-off against the outsider Montenegro after a clean victory in the first round (2-0).
Croatia didn't miss a chance, drawing 0-0 against Turkey, and Ireland easily made it 1-0 against Estonia.
Nani (24th minute), Nelder Postiga (72nd and 82nd) and Miguel Veloso (80th) scored the other goals for Portugal.
Former Bundesliga professional Wolfsburg player Zvezdan Misimovich and captain Emir Spahic narrowed the gap to two points with a penalty in the 41st minute and a goal in the 65th for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic received a second yellow card in the 54th minute.
Portugal have already knocked Bosnia out of the 2010 World Cup play-offs in South Africa.
Portugal got off to a great start in Lisbon's Estadio da Luz.
Ronaldo got off to an early start, striking a free kick at goal from around 30 metres.
A good quarter of an hour later, Nani demonstrated his long-range skills to increase the score to 2-0 from the 25-metre mark.
The Bosnians, who had not opened the scoring in the first half-hour, got their first opportunity thanks to striker Edin Dzeko.
The former Wolfsburg player from English Championship leader Manchester City sent the ball into the bottom corner in the 33rd minute, but the ball did not cross the goal line.
Jiracek scores for the Czech Republic
Then the spotlight turned to Judge Wolfgang Stark of Ergolding.
Following an attack on Elder Postiga in the Bosnian penalty area in the 36th minute, Stark decided that the Portuguese player had simulated and showed him a yellow card.
Stark also awarded a dubious penalty for playing with a hand after a foul by Fabio Coentran - Misimovich converted it.
After the break, the 2004 European champions sealed the score with four more goals.
Petr Jiracek dispelled any remaining doubts about the Czechs in the 81st minute.
The 1976 European champions go to the European Championship for the fifth time in a row.
Luck also smiled for coach Michal Bilek's team and for the Bundesliga champions Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Thomas Peckhart (FC Nuremberg 1) after a mistake at the start that could have been catastrophic.
Goalkeeper Petr Cech prevented a potential own goal from Tomas Sivok in the 9th minute with an instant reflex.
Montenegro had their best chances when the duo of Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were on the pitch.
Damjanovic struck in the 40th minute from the edge of the penalty area and nearly scored for the Czechs.
After the break, the bar was saved by world-class Czech goalkeeper Petr Cech after the FC Seoul forward left the field in the 50th minute.
The winning goal was scored just before the final whistle.
Turkey, meanwhile, lacked football happiness in Zagreb.
Four days after losing 0-3 in Istanbul, the Turks couldn't play better than a 0-0 draw in Zagreb.
Although there is now little doubt that coach Guus Hiddink will now make room on the bench for the team that finished third in 2002, the Croats find themselves in the final round of the European Championship for the fourth time.
The Turks almost got off to the perfect start in front of 31,000 spectators at the Maksimir Stadium.
Selcuk Inan's long-range strike hit the post in the seventh minute and striker Kazim Kazim failed to beat the ball into the net.
Croatia then woke up and increasingly seized control of the game.
After the break, the Croats continued to play in excellent shape.
Bundesliga champions Daniel Pranic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) were on the pitch with Wolfsburg's Mario Mandzukic replacing Dortmund's Ivan Perisic in the 62nd minute.
Trapattoni goes to Euro 2012.
The Irish in Dublin were celebrating their first appearance at the Euros since Germany in 1988.
Coach Giovanni Trapattoni's team - already looking assured of their place after winning 4-0 in the first leg - grabbed the lead in the 32nd minute thanks to a Stephen Ward goal.
Konstantin Vasilyev of the visiting team levelled the score in the 57th minute.
Ireland started well but it wasn't until the 23rd minute that Los Angeles' Robbie Keane produced his first clean sheet
The Estonian defender was able to prevent him from putting Ireland ahead at the last moment.
The goal was scored in the 32nd minute.
Having bypassed the defence of goalkeeper Pavel Londak, Ward was in the right place and, having let the ball go over the line, changed the score to 1-0.

SAP plans to double number of workers in China
Europe's largest software maker, SAP, plans to invest billions and nearly double the number of its employees in China in the next few years.
The Dax-listed company said on Thursday that it would invest about $2 billion (about 1.5 billion euros) by 2015.
"We will create more research and development opportunities and employ thousands of people," Bill McDermott, SAP's co-chief executive, said in a statement at the Consumer Expo in Beijing.
The 2,500-strong workforce is set to grow to 4,500.
The world leader in industrial software plans to double the number of its offices from five to ten or eleven.
SAP now has offices in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
This booming country has about 4,000 SAP customers out of more than 176,000 worldwide.
Counting on China's growth is an important component of the Dax-listed company's 2015 strategy.

"Now we want to change the scale of our operations," McDermott said.
"Our goal is to achieve sustainable growth by building on information technology in China."
The Human Dimension of Mass Murder
Peter Englund's tense and very kind new book, Beauty and Grief: A Personal History of World War I, begins with a long list of characters that makes one's heart melt.
Here's a tip for reading on: carefully cut out this page and use it as a bookmark.
You get to know these people very closely as Mr. Englund's narrative unfolds, and this list of actors will be your GPS, your beacon when, like one of these men and women, you get lost in the fog of war.
Mr Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize for Literature.
The book he has now written is extraordinary, and he describes it, rather accurately, as "a work of anti-history."
There are few known names, important treaties, or famous battles; there are almost no ambassadors, deft journalists, or discussions of tactics and military hardware.
It is not so much a book about what was, he explains, as "a book about what it was like" - it is about "feelings, impressions, experiences, and the state of mind."
The book, Beauty and Grief, brings together the wartime experiences of 20 more or less unremarkable men and women on both sides of the front line, from schoolgirls and botanical scientists to mountaineers, doctors, ambulance drivers and civil servants.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Someone will be captured, lose an arm or a leg, go mad, or die.
Their lives flicker here like church candles: new ones are added to a host of others, and some are extinguished at the same time.
Mr. Englund's book is a departure from the standard of historical books.
It is also a correction to the notion that World War I was only a heavy trench war on the Western Front.
Beauty and Grief skillfully provides a panorama of other theatres of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
Bee beehives fall on the soldiers in this book; one of them celebrates Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; the insoluble problem is tsetse flies.
It's a moving book, almost from the start.
War covers the lives of these people like a natural disaster, like Hurricane Katrina smelling of smokeless gunpowder.
When you hear the cannon nearby, and you're a woman and you're at home with your children, will you stay or take refuge?
Either way, who is it going to be?
Almost no one understands what is going on, or why it is necessary to fight in this war.
"The lack of facts," Mr. Englund observes, "is filled with conjecture, conjecture, hope, fear, obsession, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares, and rumors."
"Beauty and Grief" traces the fate of people like Florence Farmboro, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young sailor in the German high seas fleet.
Their stories are largely taken from memoirs, letters, and other material that has already been published.
The stories of their lives may be scary or exciting, but they are supremely vivid, thanks to Mr. Englund's collection of small moments and sketchy details.
Many of them are about deprivation and how to cope with it.
Telling the story of a German schoolgirl, he says: "Ersatz, ersatz everywhere."
"Substitution coffee, fake aluminum, unreal rubber, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
He continues to talk about ersatz food in Germany.
He describes "meat made from pressed rice boiled in lamb fat (and decorated with a fake bone made from wood); tobacco made from dried roots and dried potato peel; shoes stuffed with wood."
He notes that there were "837 registered meat substitutes authorized for the production of sausages, 511 registered coffee substitutes."
Some stories tell of honor and courage.
One American notices within himself a penchant for brutality and says of war: "You feel that, after all, this is what men were made for, not to sit in comfy armchairs with a cigarette and a whiskey, an evening newspaper or a best-seller and claim that this is civilization, and there is no barbarian hiding under your starched shirt with cufflinks."
A British soldier, by contrast, notices that he is more likely to die and no one notices or grieves.
"When one comes to terms with the idea of self-sacrifice, one would like to think that it will happen in public," he writes.
But on the contrary, it is eerily similar to "a condemned man who is hanged in secret."
Other comments concern the old Europe, which is falling apart, and the new kinds of fear.
"The conflict became more and more an economic competition," Mr. Englund writes, "a war of factories."
He notes the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the bestiary of the beginning of the century: a beautifully articulate and ideologically convinced mass murderer in a well-tailored suit who arranges massacres by sitting at a desk."
People act in an unforeseen way: base acts are as much as heroism.
Mr Englund told of soldiers who tried their best to catch a venereal disease from prostitutes in order to avoid serving on the front.
"The most grotesque expression of this can be seen in the trade in gonorrhea pus that soldiers bought and smeared on their genitals in the hope of getting to hospital," he writes.
"Desperate people rubbed it in his eyes, often leading to lifelong blindness."
Translated from Swedish by Peter Graves, Mr. Englund's prose is flexible but unspectacular, perfectly suited to his humanitarian task.
In dozens of small scenes, he shows how the war "liberated completely uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred."
People are beginning to ask why their leaders are forcing them to fight.
The best books about World War I were often indirect, like Paul Fassel's The Great War and Modern Memory, or novels like Erich-Marie Remark's On the Western Front Without Change, rather than exhaustive historical writings.
Mr. Englund's book is part of this unconventional pantheon.
His book has the most stunning ending I can remember in non-fiction.
I won't talk about it.
But it's as if he reached up to a page with a list of characters in the book, snatched it from your hands, and set fire to it with a match.
After a previous mistake, a carefully calculated raid
Hundreds of police officers, some wearing protective helmets, were involved in the operation.
The Monday to Tuesday night clocks were chosen because Zuccotti Park was supposed to have the fewest people at that time.
The operation was kept secret from all but a few high-ranking officers, the rest of whom were initially told that they were going to the exercise.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the center of the events, and his presence underscored how much the Police Department attached to the operation.
There was no question of a repeat of episodes in recent weeks, such as the use of pepper gas against protesters, which contravened department rules and caused a storm of public sympathy for the occupiers.
So, after two weeks of planning and training, a police operation began to clear Zuccotti Park of protesters.
Authorities prepared as they watched the occupation unfold in other cities.
The largest anti-crisis exercise was held on Randels Island with Zucotti in mind.
Authorities have increased the number of so-called riot training - counter-terrorism measures that involve the rapid deployment of large numbers of police officers - with Lower Manhattan in mind.
The final practice took place Monday night on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The order to enter the park came at the "last minute," said a source familiar with the orders, which referred only to the task as "training."
"The few cops I know who were called to the case were not told they were being sent to Zuccotti Park," said the man, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
"The only people who knew they were going to Zuccotti Park were in the highest positions in the department."
One reason for the secrecy was the lesson the city had learned.
On October 14, the authorities wanted to clear the park, but backed down in front of hundreds of protesters who poured in ahead of the deadline after hearing of the plans.
Tuesday's operation involved members of various police units, including forces from the districts - teams of police officers usually used to control criminal neighborhoods.
Mr Kelly said many people, almost like work, come and go from the park during the day, making 1am a good time to go.
"It was the right thing to do when there were the least people in the park," he said.
Emergency vehicles with searchlights and loudspeakers gathered on Pike Slip and Franklin Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before moving forward.
Searchlights and pre-recorded announcements coming from loudspeakers seem to have frightened many protesters.
When officers in their blue vests entered the park, many protesters simply packed their bags and left.
Police said the tents remained untouched until 1: 45 a.m., giving protesters time to pack up.
Other groups of police, according to eyewitnesses, gathered around the perimeter to enter in case arrests were needed in the park.
Journalists in the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Brown, a spokesman for the head of the Police Department, said it was done for their safety.
But many journalists claim that they have not been allowed to see how the police operate and that they have been mistreated by the police.
Mr Brown said CCTV cars on Church Street, along the park's western edge, could have captured the image.
As police marched westward through a pile of protesters "personal belongings, including bags, plastic mats, and plastic bags full of clothes, crews from the Sanitation Department followed, collecting what was left behind.
Some protesters who refused to leave were dragged outside, photos of which soon appeared online.
The main group of protesters took up positions near the kitchen of the camp, in the middle of the park.
Some set up barricades and the police entered, methodically arresting them.
About 10 people in the epicenter of the camp shackled themselves together by their hands.
And two people chained themselves to trees, Mr. Kelly said.
Emergency services were called to cut the locks.
No arrests were made at the park until about 3: 30 a.m., Mr. Kelly said.
The sweep operation was completed in about 75 minutes, police said.
Mr Brown said about 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most were arrested for "disorderly conduct and resisting arrest," he said.
The most senior officer on the ground was Joseph J. Esposito, head of the department and the department's highest-ranking officer.
Phil T. Pulaski, the department's detective chief, was also there.
Mr. Kelly, though present, "did not direct the operation," Mr. Brown said.
A second group of police officers was waiting along the east side of Broadway, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in case they had to get inside.
The barriers were erected on Cortland Street, a block north of the park, and on Pine Street, a block south.
Observers saw police from these positions expanding the perimeter even further beyond Zuccotti Park.
At one point, observers saw a group of policemen, many carrying shields, push people further away.
About 28 people were on the northern perimeter.
Some of the most serious events of the night occurred south of the park.
Around 5am, south of Pine Street, one protester jumped onto the roof of a police car, while others, according to witnesses, let air out of the tires of a police van.
At one point, a piece of plywood flew out of the crowd.
As a result, one police officer and one protester were hospitalized.
School Employees Union to sue city for layoffs
A union representing hundreds of school maintenance workers who lost their jobs last month plans to sue the city on Wednesday, arguing that the layoffs were unnecessary and discriminatory because of the disproportionate impact on schools with poor students.
Litigation is probably the last resort available to the District Council union trying to overturn the layoffs.
Six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, parent coordinators and other employees who were among the city's lowest-paid workers lost their jobs on October 7 in what union leaders called a political reaction to their refusal to give the city access to health funds managed by labor groups to plug a hole in last spring's budget.
City officials have vehemently denied the charge.
At a City Council hearing last month, Schools Chancellor Dennis M. Walcott said the layoffs were part of the budget they signed in June.
One council member countered by telling him that nowhere in the budget was there any indication that school support staff would be laid off.
Representatives for the 37th District Council said they filed a notice of claims warning the Department of Education that a lawsuit had been filed against it; a press conference will be held Wednesday to announce the formal filing of the lawsuit in State Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The lawsuit will name Mr. Walcott and the city's Department of Education as defendants and list eight suspended employees as plaintiffs, all of them black or Hispanic women, as well as most of the assistants who lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the city's legal department, said the city had not seen the lawsuit and therefore could not comment on its specifics.
According to a preliminary version of the complaint obtained by the New York Times, the union has focused on a series of school layoffs in poor areas of the city to support a claim of unfair treatment, arguing that poor schools have lost more assistants because they are chronically underfunded.
He points out that while there were no layoffs on Staten Island and few in Upper East Side or Tribeca schools, 17 school support workers lost their seats in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 had to leave in Regions 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
Noting the loss of five of the eight school assistants who worked at free High School 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the lawsuit states, "These are not districts of wealthy parents who can find the money to fill the budget gaps."
P.S. 36th's budget was cut by 3.26 percent this year, and it also lost money when the city changed the way it calculates the additional funding for each poor student who enters school.
The union also claims that principals may have been misled by the language of the notice authorizing the dismissal of parent coordinators.
The word "exceeding" was used in the notification, although "exceeding" is more commonly referred to when a teacher from a school's payroll is moved to the list of available employees paid by the central office.
"Sixty-six parent coordinators were fired," the draft lawsuit says, "not simply transferred."
Mission Over, Congress Ready for Libya Deal
It seems that Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill are finally ready to agree on something related to the uprising in Libya.
All that was needed was for the rebellion to succeed, long-time dictator Muammar el-Qaddafi to be captured and killed, and the American intervention to end.
On Tuesday, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee is to consider a resolution sponsored by Chairman John Kerry (Democrat, Massachusetts), along with Senators John McCain (Republican, Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (independent, Connecticut), praising the Libyans for the successful uprising and American troops for their "courage."
"The point of this resolution is to honor the courageous people of Libya as they begin to rebuild their country," Kerry said.
"It is a confirmation of bipartisan support for their democratic aspirations."
Language may seem innocuous, but no discussion of Libya has ever been easy.
This summer, lawmakers from both parties have been bickering with each other and with the White House over the wording of a series of resolutions endorsing or condemning the role of the US military in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain introduced a resolution allowing limited use of US forces in Libya.
The bill was rejected by a large bipartisan majority in the House of Representatives and never made it to a vote in the Senate.
But on the same day that the bill failed in the House of Representatives, the House also did not support a proposal that would have cut funding for the US operation in Libya.
This has left the American mission in a kind of legislative purgatory - when Congress is irritated enough to criticize Obama's approach to the mission, but not angry enough to actually knock the ground from under its feet.
Then events overtook congressional indecisiveness
Tripoli surrendered to Libyan rebels in August, and Qaddafi was killed on October 20.
NATO's mission officially ended on October 31.
Now the Senate can be ready to act.
The Foreign Affairs Committee resolution "admires the Libyan people for their incredible courage and extraordinary fortitude in the pursuit of freedom," and thanks the men and women of the United States Armed Forces and their coalition partners who participated in the military operation to protect the Libyan people for their extraordinary courage and professionalism. "
The resolution also "affirms the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya."
Will the new measures receive the full support of the foreign affairs council or split lawmakers, as the June bill did?
Senator Richard G. Luger, the committee's Republican leader, opposed the latest version.
A spokesman for Luger said Monday that he had not yet seen the latest version of the bill.
On the other side of the Capitol, the House of Representatives is due to vote this week on a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget, a top legislative priority for nearly every Republican and some Democrats in Congress.
The measure, proposed by Representative Bob Goodlatte (Republican of Virginia), would be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or anything else to be put to a plenary vote in this legislature.
Other legislators have so far failed to bring their amendments to the plenary, but not because they have not tried.
Goodlat's amendment is just one of 68 constitutional amendments covering a wide range of issues that have been introduced this term.
Some overlapped - the same bill was introduced in the House and Senate - others were minor variations of each other.
There are at least 15 versions of balanced budget amendments in the House of Representatives alone, and some more on "controlling federal spending."
Some are identical, too, but give their authors - mostly freshly elected Republicans who want to decorate their CVs - the opportunity to boast that they have "put forward" such a proposal.
The Budget Control Act, which passed in August, required both the House and Senate to vote for a balanced budget amendment.
In March, 58 senators voted for a non-binding resolution supporting such an amendment.
In addition to the budget, some congressmen want term limits for members of Congress, and Representative José Serrano (Democrat, New York) wants to abolish the two-term limit for the president.
Congressman Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrat, Illinois) has proposed a host of amendments guaranteeing, among other things, the right to quality education and health care.
An amendment banning same-sex marriage has been proposed for years, as has another banning flag burning.
Some lawmakers also want to allow the repeal of federal laws if two-thirds of states object.
However eager members of Congress may be to propose amendments, they are moving no faster than in past years.
In the 111th Congress, legislators proposed 77 such amendments, and in the 110th Congress, 66.
That pace pales in comparison to the early 1990s, when members of Congress regularly proposed more than 150 amendments every two years, according to the Senate Library.
But they were no more successful than they are now.
The last amendment that was passed - the 27th - was approved in 1992, but it was actually introduced in Congress in 1789.
"Beaten, but not defeated," Giffords says in her first television interview since assassination
Ten months after a gunman shot her at point-blank range at a public event in Tucson, Representative Gabrielle Giffords (D-Arizona) appeared Monday night on a federal channel, sang a tune from the Broadway show "The Sun Will Return" and said she wanted to recover more than return to Congress.
Appearing on ABC News' "20 / 20" with Diane Sawyer, Giffords struggled to formulate proposals and needed help walking.
The program showed her the difficult path of recovery from the trauma of a bullet that fractured her skull and pierced the left side of her brain, going from the front to the back of her head.
Three months later, she returned unexpectedly to the House of Representatives and voted triumphantly on the debt ceiling bill.
In her first television interview since the January shooting that killed six people and injured 13, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - and called her recovery "difficult."
Asked by Sawyer how she felt, Giffords, 41, replied, "Very well."
The interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of an hour-long special edition of "20 / 20," which aired on the eve of the release of the couple's new book, "Gabby: A History of Courage and Hope."
The special aired about Giffords' recovery after the January 8 shooting.
In videos taken by Kelly in the first few weeks, she lies on a hospital bed with her head shaved and a long scar on her forehead.
She can only raise one or two fingers at her husband's request.
A few months later, we see Giffords sitting in a wheelchair while physiotherapists teach her how to do simple things.
Shake your head.
Pull your lips out.
And then her first word: "What."
Days later, Giffords uttered the second word, "toast," a request to change the breakfast menu.
The video, shown by ABC, shows that music played a central role in Giffords' recovery, with the congressman seen singing along to Cyndi Lauper's Girls Just Want to Have Fun and Tom Petty's Free Fall.
In an interview, Sawyer Giffords, who spends two hours a day on procedures, said she doesn't remember the day of the attack.
Her husband said he was reading Giffords a newspaper article about the March 12 shooting when she stopped him to ask for the first time about the six who were killed then.
Suspected attacker Jered Lee Loughner is being held in a Missouri prison and undergoing involuntary treatment pending trial.
"A lot of people died," Giffords Sawyer said.
"It's hard, it's hard, it's hard."
Once during her recovery, Kelly Sawyer said, she said, "I'm defeated."
"And I said," Gabby, you're not defeated, "" Kelly said.
You're just beaten.
And you'll go through it, you'll recover and come back stronger than ever.
Troops feel more pity than respect
The event was a celebration on Wall Street that raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, frustration, and loss.
At the signal, several hundred soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines lined up around him.
The audience in tuxedos gave him a standing ovation.
"The military was seen as a hero," said David Saltzman, who organized the spring fundraiser.
The senior military officer at the concert, which was also attended by the then chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops differently.
"They were treated like orphans," the officer wrote in an email.
I'm sure the organisers wanted as much as possible.
I know that.
But it wasn't really respect; it was pity.
Completely opposite impressions illustrate the difficult relationship that has developed between the army and an often indifferent, sometimes admiring, American public.
Troops are lavished with praise for their sacrifices.
But praise comes at a price, military officials say.
The public increasingly behaves as if it feels sorry for people in uniform.
"We are not victims at all," said Brig. Gen. Sean B. McFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and is soon leaving for Afghanistan.
"But it seems that the only way for some to show support is to treat us as if we were unhappy."
It is a sensitive subject for military leaders, who do not want to appear ungrateful or at odds with the society they serve.
They also understand that the anger faced by returning troops in the final years of the Vietnam War was far worse.
As a result, most of the talk of pity takes place quietly, and only among combat veterans.
After his two sons returned from combat with the Marines, retired Col. Mark Cannon warned them that people outside the military would look at their service from two perspectives.
Some will look at them with admiration, because they have crushed the rebels and visited exotic places.
Others will wonder if there is "under the guise of a brutal, evil veteran," said Cannon, who fought in Iraq and returned to a high-level government post in Washington.
While looking for a job, he says, he felt that some interviewers were cautiously asking if he could withstand the stresses of a demanding job in Washington right after the battle.
Cannon recalls telling his sons, "When you talk about your service, you have to count on the negative effect."
The military's embarrassment stems partly from American indifference to wars.
Victory on the battlefield is rarely praised by a country that knows little about the army and sees little direct benefit from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"As a nation, we no longer value military heroism the way we did in World War II," said retired Lt. Gen. David Barnow, who commanded American troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, much of the admiration of politicians and the public focuses on the depth of the soldier's suffering.
Troops are judged by the number of marches they have made, the number of comrades they have lost, or the scale of their losses.
Army faces mounting pressure from anti-rape campaigners
A historic court hearing this week is due to decide whether to accept a lawsuit by 28 men and women against the army for failing to prevent rape.
If not, hundreds of claimants will line up with the next one.
Private First Class Elizabeth Lyman is 25 years old and 11 weeks pregnant when she claims to have been raped by a co-worker during the night.
It was October 2008, as she was returning to her barracks at Miramar Airfield, north of San Diego, after dinner with a friend, she met a male colleague carrying a package of 12 bottles of beer.
He asked if he could come into her room for a drink.
"It was a red flag," Lyman said.
But the Texas native brushed off her concerns.
I thought: no, he's 19.
"He's from Texas," she said.
"It is a pity that I did not obey my instinct then."
Minutes after they entered Lyman's room, the man approached her from behind, knocked her down and raped her, she claims.
This week, November 18, Lyman and 27 other current and former service members will eagerly await the court's decision at a historic hearing in Arlington, Virginia, that will decide whether to take to court the lawsuit they filed against former Defense Secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rasmfeld.
The lawsuit alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld failed to address widespread violence in the military in violation of soldiers "constitutional rights.
The lawsuit, filed in February by lawyer Susan Burke of Washington, D.C., originally included 17 plaintiffs, but grew to 28 in the following months - 25 women and three men who all allege that they were raped or threatened with sexual violence by co-workers, and that the Army failed to properly investigate, prosecute, or provide due process after the alleged attacks.
Burke says she took aim at the Army's top brass because the problem starts with them.
"The army is a vertical structure," she says.
"Who are the people who can eradicate the cult of violence? The supreme leadership."
Burke also says she has been contacted by about 400 other victims since February, many of whom may be involved in future lawsuits.
Her strategy: instead of collecting all the plaintiffs in this case - putting all the eggs in one basket, so to speak - she will open many cases if necessary to maintain pressure.
The Defense Department's defense team, led by federal prosecutor Neil McBride, took steps to dismiss the case.
Court documents obtained by Newsweek reveal a defense strategy - essentially that former or current soldiers cannot sue the army for damages incurred in the armed forces.
According to the doctrine referred to in the 1950 Supreme Court decision as the Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not liable for damage caused by persons in military service.
"The alleged damage relates to the risk inherent in the military service of the plaintiffs," the documents said.
The Defense Department declined to comment for this story.
That has changed since the 1950s.
Although women are still officially prohibited from fighting, this division exists only in words: modern wars rarely have a clear front line.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of women soldiers are playing an increasingly important role, especially in reaching out to local women in the war zone.
The result: 150 female soldiers died between the two wars - two-thirds of them in combat.
It's time for the army to become modern, Burke says.
She is not alone in her struggle; in addition to her lawsuit, three others are preparing.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans Legal Service Seminar is preparing a case against the four largest military academies for promoting a misogynist atmosphere.
A separate non-profit group of American Vietnam War veterans is preparing a lawsuit against the military that focuses on diagnosing "personality changes" that victims of violence undergo to remove them from service - a common occurrence, according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati of the advocacy group Organization for Military Women Action.
Her group filed a lawsuit in December against the Department of Veterans Affairs, accusing it of discriminatory practices in handling pension claims from people who claim to have been sexually assaulted while serving.
Nine separate bills proposing a range of measures have been introduced in Congress by a group of senators and members of the House of Representatives from both parties.
In 2010, 3,158 attempted rapes were reported, according to the Sexual Violence Prevention and Combating Service of the Ministry of Traffic.
But attacks are notoriously underreported, and the Pentagon's own estimates put the figure at about 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 incidents that occurred that year.
The report, published in March, also examined the percentage of court cases: in 2010, 20 per cent of reported cases went to trial - half as many as in the civil justice system.
The plaintiffs in Burke's case call the attacks on them only the first in a series of other injuries.
In Lyman's case, she reported the rape to the military police less than an hour after it happened.
That night, she says, she was asked to tell the details of the rape separately 11 times to a string of police officers, doctors and commanders.
She collected a rape kit and the attacker's blood - from a cut on his arm - was found on her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman sat before a judge at a hearing in which she was asked if she had had sex with a friend earlier on the day of the attack.
Six gave a positive assessment to the accused, who was eventually acquitted.
"I remember the day the verdict was read out," Lyman said.
"I thought I was giving birth - I ran out of the courtroom screaming."
"They put me in a psychiatric unit, and when I came out, I remember my commander saying," This was not his trial, this was my trial. ""
Lyman was ordered to see a military psychiatrist, who eventually diagnosed her with a personality change that rendered her unfit for service.
In January 2010, she was dismissed in an unfavourable manner, which prevented her from receiving any benefits.
Whether the case brought by Lyman and her fellow plaintiffs will move forward is a complex question, said John Turley, a law professor at George Washington University School of Law.
But he notes, "I think they can move forward."
Between them and the verdict stands the doctrine that has been criticized since it emerged.
I have been a lifelong critic of the Feres Doctrine.
The army is decades behind because it lacks the incentives and disincentives that accountability imposes.
He adds: "The odds are heavily against them... but it's important for them to try."
These things will change only when decent people want to fight.
If the hearing does not go their way, Burke, the plaintiffs "lawyer, will assemble hundreds of other plaintiffs for future cases.
"We will continue to fight the army on this issue until there is reform," she said.
Or until we die, whichever happens first.
Walls Have Eyes: How Researchers Study You on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was an ordinary guy who shared his anti-immigration views online.
On Monday, Breivik, who confessed to the July massacre in Norway that killed 77 people, appeared at his first public court hearing.
Although Breivik may have acted alone, he was far from alone online: he spent a lot of time preparing for the attack on his computer, communicating with the millions of nationalists who support right-wing groups on social media.
After the summer tragedy, researchers wanted to learn more about these people.
But how do you find them?
It's easy - you just have to go to Facebook.
"We've learned that it's not hard to get to them," said Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a recent report on European cyber populism at the British think tank DEMOS.
Facebook's store of personal data is so large, Bartlett says, that researchers could easily use the site's advertising tool to target the right demographic with scientific precision - something marketers have been doing for years.
Bartlett's team found half a million fans of right-wing groups across Europe and then poked fun at them, but instead of showing them a new group or diet product, the ad asked the user to complete a survey that asked them about their level of education, attitudes toward violence, and optimism about their own future.
Using Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to interview more than 10,000 members of 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries - even without leaving the office.
"It's a whole new way of doing research," says Bartlett.
Some of the results are less striking: online supporters of right-wing groups are mostly young men dissatisfied with immigration.
But suddenly, "those who combine their online activity with offline activity are more intelligent, more democratic, and less aggressive than those who just hide behind a monitor."
The work of DEMOS is just one example of how Facebook is becoming a popular new tool in the hands of scientists.
Research centers, medical researchers, and political scientists use the site to explore everything from health issues to social trends expressed in 'Likes', wall posts, and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding an average of three posts a day, Facebook's "super-relevant information" is driving a research boom, increasing the number of scientific articles with the site's title by 800% over the past five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is that it allows them to study people who cannot be approached in the street with a notepad.
"In the past, if you wanted to interview people from the British National Party, it would be very difficult to identify them."
"You would have to join a party and they would never accept you," says Bartlett.
"Facebook eliminates all of this - you address them directly."
Others say the site could identify and investigate social health problems.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues found that students who discussed their drunken exploits on Facebook were significantly more at risk of alcoholism than students who remained silent about it.
Moreno suggests that students "peers, such as their dorm mentors, could monitor the site and intervene to help a student who is too often updating drunk statuses.
"You can't solve a problem without identifying it," Dimitri Christakis, Moreno's co-author and director of the Center for Child Health, Behavior, and Development at the Seattle Children's Research Institute, told the Washington Post.
"We found a way to identify at-risk children who would not otherwise be found."
Facebook also routinely extracts all sorts of data about its users.
The site's data-processing unit processed relationship status and Valentine's Day statistics, mid-term voter turnout in 2010, and the National Happiness Index (largely using information that is only available to them - the champions of cyberfreedom have long insisted that the site should make its vast data collection publicly available for research).
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they like it or not - in exchange for being able to play Scrubble with a friend thousands of miles away, the site can process your personal data.
But what about when Facebook users become participants in a study they don't even know about?
Whereas researchers have strictly defined rules for conducting offline research, online data are publicly available.
"I don't think many users ever thought that a researcher could monitor their profiles," Neil Selwin, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, said of a 2006 study he conducted using publicly available student Facebook pages.
"As far as they could see, it was only between them and their friends."
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline, there is no guarantee that the subject of the study is completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know how much information in a user's profile and page is true.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do outside Facebook are two completely different things," Selvin said.
That is why, despite his years of work in technology research, Selwin thinks that notepad and pen are still the best research tools to use.
"There is no substitute for going into the real world and talking to real people," he says.
"Social research is supposed to be about the social, and much of the social is still happening offline."
"Cool and inhumane": Anders Behring Breivik makes first public appearance in court
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed to masterminding the double attack that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself as a "resistance" fighter in his first public court appearance in Oslo.
"I am the military commander of the Norwegian resistance movement and the Knights Templar of Norway," he told the 500 people in the courtroom.
"I object to the court because you received your mandate from organizations that espouse an ideology of hatred and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I admit the actions, but I do not admit guilt."
Judge Torkiel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during the monologue because he "did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform to express his views."
For the same reason, he refused to allow Breivik, who had brought a pre-written speech with him, to address the relatives of the victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered police to keep Breivik in custody for another 12 weeks, banned him from media access for four weeks, and said the authorities would closely monitor all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and relatives of victims attended the hearing.
Some came hoping to look Breivik in the eye, others to make sure he was locked up.
Everyone came to find answers to their questions.
"I thought he looked cold and inhuman," one of the Utoya survivors told Norwegian channel NRK.
"It was uncomfortable, but personally I was a little relieved when I saw and heard the suspect."
Dressed in a dark suit and blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the hearing and looked into the eyes of reporters and survivors as he entered and left the building.
Despite Breivik's bizarre idea that he was part of a large "resistance" movement, the judge ruled that he was not crazy and said there was no evidence that he had acted with accomplices.
Some may take comfort in the fact that the July 22 attacks appear to be the work of a single extremist, not a group of radicals.
But that does not automatically diminish the grief and confusion that the entire nation now feels.
"I would like him to look like a monster, but that's not the case," said a relative of one victim.
"It would be much easier if it were."
7 Lessons from Steve Jobs's Lost Interview, which hits theaters this week
After Steve Jobs's death on October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford, describing the technical genius as the Great Inventor of Modernity.
But what Apple fans might consider the biggest revelation in the newly discovered interview, which was recalled ahead of previews in major markets this week, is how much this creative mind understood business processes and manufacturing technology.
He was, of course, a designer, a visionary, and considered himself a hippie, but he was also a meticulous organiser and modernizer of the manufacturing process, who believed that many business leaders suffered from "the disease of thinking that a really great idea is 90 per cent of the work... [but] a great idea is separated from a great product by a huge amount of skillful work."
Back in 1995, Bob Cringley was making the television series Triumph of the Nerds about the advent of the personal computer, and he spent more than an hour with Jobs for a unique long conversation.
By then, it had been about 10 years since Jobs had been kicked out of Apple, and he was already working full-time at his new computer company, NeXT, in anticipation of mass adoption of the Internet.
While a small portion of Cringley's interview was used in the Nerds, he says the originals of the interview went missing during transportation.
It was only after Jobs died that a full VHS copy was found in the director's garage.
The footage, slightly edited, formed the basis of the 68-minute film Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, which runs at Landmark Theaters this Wednesday and Thursday.
For a man known for his hatred of in-depth interviews, Jobs seems unaccustomed here to outlining his technological philosophy and business strategy.
And incredibly thoughtful.
At four different points during the interview, there are large question-and-answer intervals - reflections of 10-15 seconds, where Jobs clearly weighs his thoughts to say more accurately.
There are also moments where Jobs's perfectionism comes to the surface, where he seems irritated by Kringley's questions, forcing him to move more quickly to questions or phenomena of greater importance.
There is something ominously prophetic about the pre-Pixar, iPod, and iPhone Lost interview, when Jobs assesses what he sees various companies doing right and wrong, and offers his own vision of the future of information technology.
It is one thing to read about the posthumous appraisals of Jobs's work, but there is something wounded and inspiring about Jobs, whom we see here as an anxious dreamer on the cusp of greatness.
He has a vision of what things could and should be.
Soon after he said everything here, he went and did it.
A quick summary of the seven significant findings of the Lost Interview:
On how he learned to run a business:
"Throughout my time in business, I've always asked," Why are you doing this? "and the answers you invariably get are," Oh, that's just how it is. "
No one knows why they do what they do, no one thinks very deeply in business.
That's what I learned.
Jobs continues to detail his efforts to streamline reporting at Apple.
Frustrated by the way expenses were recorded, often starting with "standard expenses" that were taken from the ceiling and then tweaked with "refinement," he created an automated structure that ensured that they could track business expenditures down to the smallest detail.
On the Pope's joke:
Jobs details the "blue box" he built with Steve Wozniak - a device that allowed people to hack into a phone company effectively and make long-distance calls for free.
Much has been written about the device before, but Jobs's euphoria here in describing the blue box as an act of empowerment is contagious.
He tells how he and Wozniak tested the box using a vending machine, ordering a conversation, and then connecting from one AT & T network to another until they connected as many stations as possible.
"We covered the globe a half-dozen times and you shouted into the vending machine, and it got into the neighboring vending machine a minute later," Jobs says with a grin.
"We were young, and all we learned was that we could build something that could control billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world."
The two of us knew a little bit, but we could make a little thing that could control a big thing - it was an incredible lesson and I don't think Apple could ever have come into being without it.
Jobs goes on to detail one famous trick that he and Wozniak nearly accomplished by calling the Vatican through a blue box at midnight and asking the Pope to phone, struggling to copy Henry Kissinger.
When various members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to talk to an American diplomat, the two erupted in laughter just before the Pope himself was picked up to answer the phone.
On falling in love with technology (and Bill Hewlett's cool nickname):
At the age of 12, hunting for spare parts to assemble a frequency meter, he found Bill Hewlett in a telephone directory and called him.
Soon after their 20-minute phone call, Jobs got a summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
"It had a big impact on me, it was the only company I saw at that age and it shaped my view of what a company is and how well they treat their employees."
Jobs later became one of the HP employees who visited the company's research labs in Palo Alto, where he saw "the very first desktop computer."
It was the size of a suitcase, it had a small monitor with an electron ray tube, and I fell in love with it.
I used to go to HP as a teenager and spin around that car and write programs for it.
About Improvised Innovation:
In several places in the interview, Jobs talks about inventing new products on the fly.
Early in his career, when he went to sell a handful of circuit boards, one buyer asked him to assemble an entire computer.
Working just 30 days on credit, he had to think about both assembling and delivering the finished devices.
Later at Apple, he recalls the difficulties he faced in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember a violent argument... they were shouting at me that it would take five years [to assemble a mouse that would cost $300] and I was fed up and went out and found a designer."
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could assemble for $15, which was incredibly reliable.
About Big Companies Losing Energy:
Long before he spearheaded Apple's resurgence, Jobs accurately foresaw how many industry leaders would misread the situation and lose control of their market share.
"Let's say you work at IBM or Xerox, so you make a better copier or printer, and what?"
You have a monopoly on the market, so the company does not become more successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, so [these are the types of people] who end up running companies, and the people who make the product are pushed out of the decision-making arena.
The product genius that led to this monopoly position is being supplanted by people who have no idea of the difference between good and bad products - the skill required.
This is what happened to Xerox...
Xerox could take over the entire information technology industry.
It could be ten times bigger, it could be Microsoft of the 1990s...
They were defeated by a victory.
On innovation as an art form:
"What separates a great idea from a great product is a great amount of skilled labor... when you promote a great idea, it changes and grows."
You learn a lot about its subtleties.
There are trade-offs you have to make - some things you can't make electrons, glass, robots, or factories do.
You need to keep 5,000 ideas - these concepts - in your head, bringing them all together...
Ultimately it comes down to taste - it comes down to trying to express yourself in the best way that people have ever produced, and later trying to bring it into what you do.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal.
We have always been ashamed of stealing great ideas.
Part of what made Mackintosh famous was that the people who worked on him were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians who happened to be the best information technology specialists in the world.
If it were not for information technology, they would be doing amazing things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas dine with opponents of health-care law as court hears case
On a day when the Supreme Court met behind closed doors to discuss the politically contentious question of whether it would hear President Obama's health-care challenge, two of its justices, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were honored at a dinner sponsored by a law firm that will challenge the case before the high court.
The incident happened last Thursday, when all nine judges met to discuss the petitions.
One case on the agenda was a motion backed by 26 states challenging a sweeping health-care overhaul passed by Congress last year, a law that united conservative activists across the nation.
The judges agreed to consider the trial; indeed, a pivotal 5 1 / 2-hour debate is expected in March 2012, and the outcome is likely to be a nuisance in the presidential race, which will be in full swing by the time the judgment is read out.
The lawyer who will stand before the court and argue that the health-care law should be repealed is likely to be Paul Clement, who was deputy attorney general during George W. Bush's presidency.
Clement's law firm, Bancroft PLC, was one of nearly two dozen firms that helped sponsor the annual lunch of the Federalist Society, a long-established group that has consistently championed conservative legal principles.
Another firm that sponsored the lunch represents one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Businesses.
Another sponsor was pharmaceutical giant Pflizer Inc, which has a huge financial stake in the outcome of the lawsuit.
The lunch was held at a Washington hotel hours after the hearing in the case.
Among those in attendance was Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader in the Senate and a prominent opponent of the health care law.
Guests of honor at the dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
Nothing new: Two judges have been attending Federalist Society events for years.
This is not at all unethical.
In effect, judges are exempt from the Code of Conduct, which governs the actions of lower federal judges.
Had they complied, they might have been subject to Principle 4C of the Code, which states: "A judge may attend charitable events of legal and other organizations, although a judge may not be a speaker, guest of honor, or mentioned in the program of such an event."
Nonetheless, Scalia and Thomas "apparent closeness to the two law firms in this case, as well as to a company with large financial interests, was enough to send a signal to ethics activists in government.
"This stunning breach of ethics and indifference to the code contradicts claims by some judges that the court remains committed to the same rules that apply to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause.
"The judges had drinks and dined at an official fundraising event with the lawyers whose cases are now before the court."
Their appearance and helping to raise money for the event undermines all claims of impartiality and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas hardly pay attention to critics who say they are only too happy to confuse the court's cases with those of groups like the Federalist Society.
Thomas's wife, Ginny, is a prominent conservative activist.
Moreover, conservatives argue that this raises an ethical question for Justice Elena Kagan, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was the chief legal officer in the Obama administration when the first legal challenges to the law were filed at the first-instance court level.
Her critics demanded that Kagan drop the case because she was too involved in defending the law then to be impartial now.
Kagan has not indicated that she intends to do so.
Boeing receives record $18 billion order for planes
Emirates is ordering 50 wide-body Boeing 777 airliners and may order another 20.
Boeing is also selling six Boeing Dreamliners to Oman Air, a deal worth more than $1 billion.
It is hardly news that a company receives an order for 50 of its products.
But this is an important development when the company is an aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co., and the list price for all 50 aircraft is $18 billion.
Equally important is where Boeing received the order: the Middle East, the growing golden thread of future aircraft orders.
In a forecast released Monday, the Chicago-based company estimates that the Middle East will need 2,520 planes worth $450 billion over the next 20 years.
Boeing announced this weekend its largest dollar-equivalent order for commercial aircraft - 50 Boeing 777 double-aisle planes.
The incredible order came from Emirates airline in Dubai.
The airline also has the option to buy another 20 planes, which will raise the total list price to $26 billion, Boeing said at the Dubai Airshow 2011.
Later on Monday, Boeing said Oman Air had ordered six Boeing 787-8s, the so-called Dreamliner, which boast significantly better fuel economy and passenger comfort.
The list price for the six aircraft will be more than $1 billion.
"It's really good for Boeing," said Morningstar analyst Neil Diora.
"The quality of these particular buyers is quite high."
Many Middle Eastern airlines are owned by oil-producing countries.
Accordingly, not only do they have the money to pay for planes, but the rise in fuel prices, which usually hurts airlines because it is one of their biggest outlays, is not so damaging because the country makes money from high oil prices.
This is important because they are less likely than other airlines to cancel planes when prices rise, Diora said.
"They have natural defenses," he said.
The Emirates order strengthens Boeing's leadership in the wide-flux aircraft market and helps prevent rival Airbus SAS from encroaching on its dominance with its A350 airliner.
Boeing's victory at the airshow comes four months after Airbus said it would postpone the debut of the largest A350, which competes with the 777-300ER.
It delayed the debut to increase axial load after buyers demanded an increase in carrying capacity and range.
Boeing Co shares rose 1.5% to $67.94.
Mexican president's sister apparently loses Michoacan election
Luisa Maria Calderón claims that drug traffickers helped the PRI's opponent Fausto Vallejo in the electoral race.
President Felipe Calderón's sister appears to have failed in her bid for governor of Michoacan in a bitter state election, and she said Monday that drug traffickers helped tilt the race in favor of one of her opponents.
According to preliminary results, Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, is the frontrunner in the race for governor of the western state.
"The interference of organized crime throughout the electoral process, and especially yesterday, is alarming, not only for Michoacan, but for the whole country," Luisa Maria Calderón said in a radio interview the day after Sunday's vote.
"They intimidated our candidates, our election workers... They grabbed ballot boxes, put obstacles in the way... and forced people to vote" for the PRI.
The PRI governed Mexico for seven decades until it lost the presidency in 2000.
She is preparing a comeback, and victory in Michoacán is an important step in that effort.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo appears to have only slightly overtaken Calderón, who topped the polls until election day.
Calderón, the candidate of the National Action Party, or PAN, led by her brother, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the candidate of the leftist Democratic Revolutionary Party, or DRP, which now holds the governorship, came in third - a major defeat for the divided and unlucky left ahead of the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to accept the preliminary results.
Vallejo, a former mayor of the state capital of Morella, denied links to drug traffickers and called on other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacán has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin, and methamphetamines.
This is President Calderón's home state, and he chose Michoacan to launch a military operation against drug traffickers in December 2006.
The violence is still ongoing.
The MHP mayor was killed a week before the election while campaigning for Luisa Maria Calderón, and several candidates withdrew from the local race out of fear.
For the PRI, however dire the Michoacan election may look, a victory would give the party a boost.
The man who is supposed to represent the PRI in the presidential race, Enrique Pena Nieto, speaking from Washington, congratulated Vallejo and said, "I think this victory should be very encouraging in the run-up to next year."
ADB Convinces Asia to Help Save the Eurozone
The Asian Development Bank has committed India and China to stand ready to help rescue the eurozone from the European debt crisis in order to avoid a long-term downturn that would stall Asian growth.
Rajat Nag, managing director of the ADB's Manila office, said the two fastest-growing major economies should "do everything they can" to accelerate the currency bloc's recovery, either through the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He warned that the BRIC countries were looking at Europe's difficulties "even-handedly," and said that Asian financial assistance alongside European leadership and resources could help avoid a long-term downturn in the global economy.
"All of us are affected by this."
"So anyone who can help Europe out of the crisis is useful," he told the Financial Times in an interview during the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia may be protected to some extent, but it cannot be invulnerable."
"So if China and India can help, it must be done."
The European Monetary Union has been badly undermined by the European debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy's borrowing costs have skyrocketed, and the prime ministers of both Italy and Greece have resigned.
Europe's unfolding debt crisis has raised fears that it could push the global economy back into recession, and has led to calls for major emerging economies to come together to help the eurozone find a solution.
Mr Nag predicted that any Asian aid would be channelled through the IMF, but said bilateral cooperation - such as buying bonds from the EU's bailout fund, funds to ensure financial stability in Europe - provided enormous bargaining power to Europe's Asian partners.
Anand Sharma, India's trade minister, said that "India will do whatever it can" to help the eurozone, as its own economy is now experiencing a decline in exports and a decline in foreign capital inflows.
"Nobody wants the eurozone to remain unstable and unsettled," he said.
"We have enormous challenges, and we must maintain a high level of growth."
"This is not an option, it is a must, because where we will find jobs for tens of millions of our young men and women."
Others argue that it makes no sense for emerging economies like India to help rich Europeans when they face their own deep economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshni, a professor at Brown University in the US, said it would be politically difficult to help Europe for India's 1.2 billion people, some 800 million of whom live on $2 a day or less.
"At some point they will find out that Greeks retire at 50 and go on holidays to the sea, and that will not be well received," he said.
Lee Howell, managing director of the World Economic Forum, also questioned why India's reserves should be used to keep Greece's many well-paid public-sector workers employed in poorly organized, loss-making enterprises like railways.
Mr Nag said the eurozone crisis threatened "significant direct consequences" across Asia.
The ADB's forecast of 7.5% growth in Asia in 2011 / 12 now faces "downside risks" from the threat from Europe.
Vulnerable emerging markets, he said, need to draw up "contingency plans" to protect themselves from recession and large capital outflows from their economies.
Pentagon's Scary Warnings of Potential Defense Cuts
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta inflamed tensions Monday in Congress by warning that expected automatic budget cuts would undermine national security and trigger a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon corridors to the battlefields of Afghanistan on the line and to the civilian assembly.
The Pentagon is already coming to terms with $450 billion in cuts over the coming decade, but now fears that additional cuts of $600 billion or more may be inevitable if Congress fails to agree on spending.
"The consequences of these cuts would be devastating for the department," Panetta said in a letter to Senators John McCain, R-Ariz., and Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina.
He said the failure of Congress to pass a budget agreement and the resulting so-called sequester would trigger a 23% across-the-board cut and halt many new projects.
"Such a deep cut, applied so recklessly, would make most of our shipbuilding and construction projects unfeasible -- you cannot buy three-quarters of a ship or building -- and would seriously damage other modernization efforts," Panetta wrote to senators.
"We will also have to lay off many of our full-time employees and, because the cuts will be made so quickly, we will almost certainly have to lay off full-time employees to achieve the goal."
"These changes will undermine the confidence of those who support our army and cause serious damage to combat readiness."
The cuts will ultimately affect military units, Panetta said.
"Although military funding for Overseas Emergency Operations is not directly affected by the sequester, military achievements will be severely affected by a severe disruption in core budgets," Panetta warned.
"Contractual personnel will be reduced, ending with the cancellation of contracts and the supervision contract that supports the troops."
"Staff will be cut, resulting in delays in payments to military suppliers, and legal and political support will be disrupted."
Two senators wrote to Panetta 10 days ago asking for details of the possible consequences of automatic cuts at the Defense Department.
"The consequences of sequestration at the Department of Defense would be the rapid decline of the United States as the world's leading military power."
"We stand firm against these draconian actions," the senators said in a joint statement Monday night when they released Panetta's letter.
"This is not an exit we can live with, and it is not an exit we should impose on ourselves."
"Sequestration is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and it must not be allowed to happen."
Whether Panetta's letter or the senators "latest warnings will lead to a budget compromise or intensify calls to exempt the Pentagon from cuts remains to be seen.
Panetta has been remarkably candid about possible cuts, even though he took the Pentagon leadership job after years of congressional and White House budget reviews and realizing that he faces tough choices.
At a press conference last week, the defense secretary painted a bleak picture of what might come next -- troops with shells but no nucleus.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a squad without bullets."
"It's a wing of an airplane without enough trained pilots."
"It's a paper tiger, an army with barracks, buildings, and bombs without enough trained soldiers to do the job," Panetta said in his opening remarks at the Pentagon.
"It is a force that suffers from unstable morale, poor preparedness, and is incapable of fighting potential enemies."
"In essence, it encourages aggression."
In an annex to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta offered new details on how the cuts "create significant operational risks: slow responses to crises, conflicts, and disasters; severely limit our ability to be the first in deployment and response anywhere in the world; and lead to unacceptable risks in future combat operations."
And Panetta said some of the biggest defense projects could face obstacles, including those that have already passed the tests, and some only in the early stages of planning.
The list includes a single F-35 strike fighter, a planned new bomber, a next-generation ballistic submarine, a new coastal warship, and a new ground combat vehicle that the Army and Marines need to replace the hummer.
Ending further development and testing of the F-35 could save $80 billion over 10 years, but its proponents say it is a vital next step to improve and counter potential threats from China and other adversaries.
How to Catch a Lie
A quick glance at the recent headlines shows how serious and pervasive deception and lies are in daily life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy challenging sexual harassment allegations from several women; each side accuses the other of lying.
University of Pennsylvania administrators have been charged with perjury for allegedly covering up that a retired football coach raped boys.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was caught telling US President Barack Obama, with his microphone on, that Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu was a liar.
Lies destroy careers and shake countries.
New York Congressman and Internet exhibitionist Anthony Weiner portrayed himself as a fool by denying his antics, which was quickly contradicted by incontrovertible evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards has been charged with campaign finance fraud for concealing extramarital affairs.
Again, no one who lived at the time will ever forget the media circus with President Bill Clinton caught lying about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky during his second term in office.
Stories of exam fraud at school and college are commonplace.
There have been cases where teachers have given students answers to tests in order to have a good assessment of their own performance.
The mentors who are supposed to teach the opposite are sending the message that lies and fraud are acceptable.
How many lies do we face?
In one day, studies show that you can be lied to 10 to 200 times.
Much of this, it is now assumed, is a lie of salvation.
Another study found that strangers lied three times in the first 10 minutes of getting to know each other.
Detecting or exposing lies is a necessary skill for both personal and professional purposes.
Unlike a room game like, say, charades, where one should exclaim "Caught!," lie-detecting is a serious field of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades at prestigious universities engaged in comprehensive research projects, especially in psychology and physiology.
One result of the study is that most of the old myths about lies have been debunked.
Liars look in their eyes.
They don't always stutter, stutter, blush or hustle.
It should not be inferred from this that liars are difficult to detect and difficult to expose.
An experienced lie-detector can get to the truth by observing the structure of statements, facial expressions, question structures, and temporal characteristics.
I have spent several years researching scientific discoveries in a vast and growing segment of knowledge about lies, and it is clear that spotting lies is a modern skill that is easy to learn and that helps navigate our complex world -- especially if your professional responsibilities include recruiting, interviewing, negotiating, or managing.
Good liars are excellent at reading others, making them feel at ease, controlling their own emotions, and intuitively feeling how others perceive them.
We know from research that extroverts lie more often than introverts, that men lie more about themselves and women lie more about others, usually to protect someone's feelings that married people lie less to their partners than unmarried people do (but the lies they tell are often brazen).
We also know that if you are perceived as a cheat, others will feel less guilty about deceiving you.
How do you know if someone is lying?
First, observe the normal behavior of your object.
This is called "baseline definition."
This helps to provide a starting point for assessing change further.
Observe the posture, laughter, and vocal characteristics of your object.
It would be good for you to know if a person is constantly tapping his or her feet in a normal state, then you won't make unfair accusations when you see him or her tapping his or her feet in the middle of a meeting.
Then look for groups of deceptive verbal and non-verbal acts.
Treat these groups as red flags, not proof of deception.
Deceivers can fix their upper body when they try to recall their story, they can put their feet toward the door, lean toward the exit, change their posture in a certain way, or display "relief after the interview" -- that exaggerated sigh of relief and a change of posture when all the hard questions are behind them.
Investigators often falsify an end-of-interview signal just to look at the relief after an interview.
So, pay attention to your subject's speech.
Scott Peterson is known to have stumbled and used the past to claim that his murdered wife was alive, leading to searches across the country for her.
Vulnerable people can also use distancing themselves in a speech: "I didn't have sex with that woman... Miss Lewinsky," or repeat a complex question in full.
The most typical verbal indicators are barely perceptible.
One may use "qualifying language" when answering a difficult question: "Well... to be honest... as far as I know... as far as I know."
This makes the response emotional rather than factual, and is often a red flag.
There is no magic bullet to uncover lies, but learning to detect deception is possible.
These skills will increase everyone's chances of not falling victim to skillful swindlers in their professional and personal lives.
Controversial oil pipeline plan needs revision after US threatens to delay approval
Days after the Obama administration threatened to delay approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico -- angering unions but appeasing environmentalists -- the company behind the pipeline says it will willingly revise the project to resume work on it.
TransCanada said Monday night that it would remove the planned pipeline from the environmentally sensitive Sandhills area of Nebraska and was confident that the project would still win approval.
The company announced the decision at a news conference at the Nebraska State Capitol.
TransCanada spokesman Alex Purbas says the company remains confident that it will eventually get approval for the pipeline, albeit with a different route.
It comes after the State Department said last week that it would delay a federal decision on the project until it examines possible new routes that do not affect the Nebraska Sandhills and the Ogalala Aqueduct, a huge underground reservoir.
"This is a real step forward," Congressman Lee Terry, Republican of Nebraska, told Fox News.
A new environmental assessment commissioned by the State Department is likely to delay a decision until 2013, after next year's election, though officials denied that politics was involved.
Obama, in a written statement last week, called the decision a call by the State Department, and expressed support for it.
The 1,700-mile pipeline would stretch from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It is to ship 700,000 barrels per day from Alberta to refineries in Texas.
To do that, he needs to cross six states.
It is hated by environmentalists, but loved by unions, which hope for an estimated 20,000 jobs linked to the pipeline.
But Nebraska lawmakers opposed to the plan are considering legislation to speed up the relocation from the Sandhills area and Ogallala Aqueduct, a major source of drinking water and irrigation.
The State Department's current environmental impact study found that the project would have only a limited negative impact on the environment, but an energy industry source said the department's auditor had ordered a separate review of the review process, focusing on two issues.
One is whether the lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was an adviser to Hillary Clinton's 2008 campaign, represents a conflict of interest for the program.
Another is whether the firm that was hired to carry out the original study was inappropriate because it was associated with TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle sued for allegedly causing child's nausea with fear
A New York family claims disco diva Patti LaBelle went on a rampage in the lobby of their Manhattan home, scaring their young daughter to such an extent that she was terrified.
The Lady Marmalade singer's tirade scared 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so much that she suffered a "personality change, sleep disturbance" and "severe fear of strangers," her family said in Manhattan Supreme Court.
It happened on November 10 last year, when stage worker Kevin Monk, his wife, a kindergarten teacher, Rosanna, and Genevieve were about to embark on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk was catching the car, Rosanna Monk went down to the lobby of the Riverside Boulevard building with their luggage, carrying Genevieve.
Roseanne Monk said she stopped by the door and lowered her daughter to the floor for a minute.
"Someone came up to me from behind and said," Do you know what your daughter is doing? "I said yes and went to pick her up," she said.
LaBelle angrily reprimanded the pregnant woman.
"She said aggressively," You shouldn't have left your daughter near the door, "" Rosanna Monk said.
"I told her," I don't care what you say or think. ""
She became furious and started using swear words - the C word and the F word - in elevated tones...
She had a bottle of water and started pouring bottled water on me.
She said Genevieve was hysterical.
"I said to this woman," Look what you did to my daughter, "" the child's mother said.
LaBelle attacked her mother -- who was still holding Genevieve -- and her minders had to restrain her and push her into a waiting car, Rosanna Monk said.
The little girl was crying so hard she was exhausted, she added.
The family later sent LaBelle a note demanding an apology, but received no response.
LaBelle's lawyer and representatives did not return calls for comment.
The amount of compensation for the damage is not disclosed, but the family's lawyer, Sam Davis, said he has taken on the case for free and that the family plans to donate any money they receive to charity for children with cancer.
"The goal is to hold Patti LaBelle accountable for what she did," Davis said.
"This behaviour is completely unacceptable, especially towards a kindergarten teacher with an 18-month-old child in his arms."
Climate Problems Slow the Economy
During Mario López's first year in power, unemployment and the illegal labor market increased in Sinaloa, foreign financing declined, and the economy was weakened.
2011 is the year that will go down in Sinaloa's economic history as the first year of Mario López Valdez's government, also known as the year of change, which raised great hopes for the economy, but, given the adverse climatic conditions at the beginning of the year, there was no growth, but a decline in the main economic indicators was recorded.
February's low temperatures not only caused millions in losses for the agricultural sector, but they limited the scope for growth in the state economy, causing a 3.6 percent contraction in economic activity overall in the first half of the year, thanks largely to a historic 31.16 percent decline in agriculture, which affected the dynamics of other sectors of the economy.
The main crops affected were vegetables, maize, and chickpeas, according to a report on areas affected by frost provided by Mexico's Council for Sustainable Rural Development, of which 78.03 percent were fully affected and the remaining 21.07 percent were partially affected.
According to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, the decline in economic activity caused, until November, a steady increase in unemployment in the state, with an accelerating rise in the unemployment rate during the first three quarters; from January to March, 55,053 Sinaloa residents were unemployed, with a share of 4.53 percent of the economically active population; in the second quarter, the share rose to 5.28 percent; and from July to September, it continued to rise to 6.19 percent, a share that, per person, accounts for more than 74,000 unemployed Sinaloa residents, an increase of 18,969 from the first half.
Declining liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa has been discussed for a year by many factors, and for the economist Gerardo López Cervantes, Director of the Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences of the Autonomous University (UAS), the rise in unemployment can be attributed indirectly to public policies.
"What we are seeing now is an increase in unemployment, which is due to several factors, including the loss of liquidity in the market to limit resources imposed by the anti-money laundering law passed in Congress, because it is not easy for people who are illegally in possession of dollars to work with them, invest and use them in something," he said.
Stopped Immigration
Lopez Cervantes said there is also a demographic factor to the rise in unemployment.
"The number of people leaving the state in search of work abroad has been limited in the US, first because of the difficulty of entry, and second because once they enter, they already face so many difficulties in finding work, so a group of people are staying and demanding jobs here in the state, and the unemployment rate is rising as a result," he said.
Violation of formal requirements
The analysis of the Sinaloa labor market is made worse by the large number of violations that prevail in working conditions. According to INEGI, 60.38% of the state's active population works without being mentioned as workers in any social security institution.
In addition to unemployment and irregularities in paperwork, another reminder of state employment is represented by low wages; the state has the lowest wages in the country, according to records from the Mexican Social Security Institute and the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare.
Until September, the average monthly income of Sinaloa workers was 5,352 pesos, well below the national average of 7,375 pesos.
Declining FDI
In addition to the downturn in economic activity and high unemployment, 2011 recorded the largest outflow of foreign direct investment in 10 years, according to the Treasury Department, with state FDI totaling $630,697 from January to July, down 87.74 percent from $5,143,312 during the same period last year.
For its part, the state government's Ministry of Economic Development recorded only 17,280,000 pesos of investment during the year, mostly in service companies.
Debt
Against the backdrop of the economic downturn, the state government asked the state Congress in July for approval of a loan of 3 billion pesos to be used to invest in infrastructure projects in 18 municipalities to revive the economy, only 2,600 million pesos were approved at the local level, and no sector of the state economy was expected to benefit from the debt until November.
Reactions
For business, Mario López Valdez's first year in office demonstrates the government's lack of capacity.
Miguel Loredo López, president of the National Chamber of Manufacturing, said that during 2011 there had been a lack of coordination of the wishes of various sectors, including the state government itself.
"The performance of the Sinaloa economy this year has been really poor, we have to work hard to regain the ground we lost this year, in 2012 we have to redouble our efforts, we have not been able to coordinate the efforts of everyone and, above all, the good and synchronized work of the new government team, we hope that next year will be much better," he said.
The Economic Slowdown
López Loredo said events such as the early frosts this year have stalled the state's economy and its efficiency and growth have been limited.
"The low volume of the economy is the result of several events, including frost, one of the main effects was a slow economy that is not getting fast enough to create an economic dynamic that allows for an acceptable level of processes, goods and services and therefore we are closing below our expectations at the end of the year," he said.
Re-routing
Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Confederation of Employers of the Mexican Republic in Sinaloa, said the state needs to continue its most dynamic manufacturing activity.
"By and large, we found that we were working on it, we believe that we need to develop a long-term program that will redefine the direction and economic direction of the state, we need to mobilize all the material and human resources that Sinaloa has," he said.
Work to be undertaken
The President of Coparmex stressed the importance of determining the future direction in order to better guide the government's efforts.
"In general, I would say that the government is trying to be successful in various areas, in terms of economic development there is little progress, but it is important to develop a long-term program," he said.
He noted that the current administration had demonstrated progress in its own way of conducting public policy.
"There are facts that allow us to say that the government is starting to get involved and that I can say that some work has been done and I think the government is aware that there is still a lot to do," he said.
He is sentenced for 8 kilograms of marijuana
Five years in prison and a 100-day fine for possession of eight kilograms of marijuana.
The Attorney General's Office said the convicted drug trafficker is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, who was convicted of a crime against health, in this case possession of marijuana with intent to distribute.
According to AP / SIN / CLN / 687 / 2010 / MI, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by Mexican soldiers on June 7, 2010, while patrolling Cipriano Valdez Street, in front of post No. 80 in El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug trafficker was driving a white pickup truck in which he was carrying a black bag in a box in the car and a small backpack in the passenger seat, where soldiers found eight kilograms and 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, the seizure was handed over to the Second District Court, and the accused remains a prisoner at the Centre for the Legal Consequences of Crime.
Contributions must be made to the work
Public works related to programs like Homeland, Save Public Spaces, and 3x1 for migrants risk being incomplete or long delayed due to a lack of funds, said Miguel Angel Lopez Miranda.
The Director of Municipal Social Development pointed out that, although work programmes had been developed so far, they were in danger because the state government was unable to make the necessary contributions, which amounted to more than 11 million pesos for all three programmes.
He noted that the total funding for all three programs is about 50 million pesos, of which the state must contribute 25 percent, and that, so far, only the Federation and the Municipality have provided the resources for the work, so there may still be a delay in their completion.
"They have to put in almost $12 million, and even though the year is over, they didn't give us a penny when they had to give us a part from the beginning of July," he said, "so as not to delay, we started work and they are very advanced, but we need the money."
He mentioned that last year, during the administration of Jesus Aguilar Padilla, the state did not make the contributions that it had to make, so that at the beginning of the administration the municipality had to borrow money to cover more than 7 million, an amount that was not provided in that case by the state administration.
"It happened to us in the previous administration because the state didn't have the financial capacity to participate and the programs continued to evolve, and this year to get access to those programs, we need to find the resources to cover what the state owes," he explained.
Although state authorities have an obligation to deliver these resources, he says the request was made to the secretary of administration and finance, Armando Villareal, to increase efforts so that the interest related to them would come as soon as possible.
"They have to contribute almost 12 million, and even though the year is over, they haven't given us a penny."
Court to approve Mexico's "digital TV transition" in 2015
The replacement of analog signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes that the world has experienced in recent years.
The Supreme Court (SC) has rejected constitutional challenges brought by the Senate and the House of Representatives against a presidential decree that moves the so-called "digital transition" from 2021 to 2015, because it did not receive the eight votes needed to overturn it.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón had not overstepped his authority by issuing a decree detailing the steps to be taken to move to digital terrestrial television.
As a result, the constitutional challenges filed by the Senate were rejected because of the lack of a qualified majority of eight votes required for the court to rule on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree, and it remains in force.
A draft statement prepared by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero proposed declaring the decree unconstitutional, because the regulation of the radio and television program is a right granted by law to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in violation of the principles of hierarchical subordination and legislative reserve.
Only Salvídar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna, and Sánchez Cordero voted in favor of the project.
On this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies held two constitutional debates to refute the decree and uphold the complaints, and Minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all the actions mentioned therein regarding the transition to digital broadcasting.
The ministerial meeting also decided to reject the Chamber of Deputies' demand without entering into a debate on the draft, again under the responsibility of Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his speech, the Prime Minister said that he did not agree with the arguments of the draft, in the sense that the federal executive could not determine by general rules the measures for which the public administration should prepare.
"I also do not believe that if this were to happen, it would affect the autonomy of the regulator," and recalled that the planning of public policy in strategic areas, such as the telecommunications sector, is relevant to the federal executive, which has a constitutional mandate to administer the state.
The replacement of analog signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes that has occurred in recent years, resulting in better use of the radio-electric spectrum, better signal quality, and more channels.
Delaying the transition, he said, would mean postponing the benefits of digitization, which includes meeting societal needs that have more than a technical dimension, "because it covers economic, social, political, and national security issues."
These issues, he said, "require the work of an entire system formed on the principle of state economic management, comprising a group of powers that the Constitution unites into a state executive."
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world had already completed the transition to digital broadcasting, and had done so with the help of the executive branch, despite the existence of highly specialized technical institutions.
It cannot be inferred from this that the Government, by adopting the decree under discussion, which in any case affects the competence of Congress, ensures, in the administrative sphere, compliance with the laws passed by the Legislative Assembly, he said.
Michoacán analyzes vote-by-vote count
The difference between first and second place in the gubernatorial election is only 27 percent, even without counting 879 votes out of a total of 6,074.
The possibility of a vote-by-vote count is real for this year's electoral process in Michoacán, where, according to the Preliminary Results Program (PPRV), the difference between first and second place in gubernatorial elections is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes, which account for 879 out of a total of 6,074.
In this light, the Chair of the General Council of the Michoacán Electoral Institute (IVM), María de Los Angeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, on November 9, the electorate approved a set of principles to harmonize local rules with federal electoral reform.
It should be recalled that Michoacán did not adopt the Constitution or the State Electoral Code or the Voting Rights Act, because the State Congress approved the reforms shortly before the legal deadline for their entry into force in this electoral process, and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel did not include their publication within the deadline set by law in the State Official Gazette, stating that he had some objections.
On the same day, November 9, the Supreme Court of Justice (HJC) ruled on a constitutional challenge brought by the local legislature and called the vote of the state's constitutional reform representative "null and void and illegitimate" because he had no right to "permit or support them."
In an interview about the possibility of "vote after vote," María de los Angeles Llanderal argued that, with the adoption of the relevant principles by the General Council of the IMS, it would be possible for the local electoral authority to submit a partial or full count of votes.
Thus, a partial recount of one or more ballot boxes may be carried out if: the results of the protocols do not match; there is no protocol for voting and counting the documents in the ballot box or it is not in the possession of the president; or there are obvious errors or corrections in the protocol.
In addition, a total recount of all ballot boxes in an election may occur when there is an indication that the difference between the alleged winner of the election in question and the runner-up is less than or equal to one per cent, provided that there is a request at the beginning of the session from a representative of the party and / or coalition that nominated the latter candidate.
A total recount will also be carried out if, at the end of the normal count, it is established that the difference between the winner and the runner-up is less than or equal to one percentage point, provided that there is a request from the political party whose candidate came in second place, in the event that the ballot boxes that were counted in the partial recount are excluded.
It is worth noting that this is the case in Morelia, where, according to the PRI, the difference between first and second place is only 0.16 percentage points, not even counting 129 votes out of a total of 923.
His Last Will
His ashes will be scattered in the mountains of Zapalinam, the family confirms.
The remains of pilot Felipe Basio Cortez arrived in Saltillo, his hometown, on Sunday evening; a post-mortem examination and funeral mass were held on Monday.
According to the family, the lieutenant colonel's last wish was to have his ashes scattered in the Sapaliname mountains.
After accepting condolences along with others who died in the crash, the Basio Cortez family returned to the capital of Coahuila aboard a Mexican Air Force plane, the closest people to them attending the ceremony in Campo Marta.
At noon, the lieutenant colonel's ashes arrived at a chapel on Nazario Ortiz Garcia Boulevard, where family and friends were arriving.
At 5: 30 p.m., he was examined by the Technological Institute of Santillo, organized by his former high school classmates and the football team of which Felipe Basio was a member during his high school years.
"His wish was to return to Saltillo, and to have his ashes scattered in the mountains of Zapaliname, he always told his family and friends," Sandra Cortez Basio, the pilot's sister, said.
In her opinion, the lieutenant colonel fulfilled all his dreams, she believes that he was at the peak of his life, "he was a successful man, an incredible father, son and loving brother, devoted to his family."
Felipe Cortez Basio left the city of Saltillo very young to attend the Zapopan Aviation College in Jalisco.
Some didn't believe him, they said he was dizzy even in a truck, but he always wanted to fulfill his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Davila Basio remembers him as a very good man, "as soon as he arrived in Saltillo, the whole family wanted to greet him, as when he brought Martha Sahagun to Saltillo."
The young man recalls that even when he was seven years old, he traveled to Sapopan to attend his relative's graduation ceremony, so he knows that his uncle died doing what he loved most in life: driving an airplane.
He is being led away for the last time
Gun shots were fired in honor of Lieutenant Colonel Felipe Cortez Basio of the Mexican Air Force, headed by Governor Jorge Torres López, people from the village and state government, the Mexican Army, from the Sixth Military Zone, the Mexican Air Force itself, managers and students of the Technological High School in Saltillo, where he attended in 1985 and made progress both in education and in sports, took him on his last journey.
Basio Cortez died recently when the helicopter he was driving crashed, along with the provincial secretary of government, José Francisco Blake Mora, and six others, all representatives of that ministry.
At 6: 05 p.m., the remains of Basio Cortez (cremated), a resident of Saltillo, arrived to be handed over by the funeral home to members of the Mexican Air Force led by Major James Martínez, on the esplanade of the training school, where his family, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, her mother, brothers and other relatives, students and teachers, were already waiting for him.
Three bodies found abandoned on NL Cadereit farm
Hours before the discovery, the military authorities showed to the media eleven people who had been arrested in the same municipality for organized crime.
Three men were found shot to death in different parts of the body with a gunshot at an abandoned farm in the municipality of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The find was found 1.5 kilometers from the Cadereyta highway toward Santiago, on a hill in a commune known as El Castillo.
Several passers-by noticed that the gates to the village house, whose walls are painted beige and brown, were unlocked.
When they looked inside, just three metres away, they found the bodies of three people and immediately alerted the relevant authorities.
One of the men was wearing a yellow t-shirt with black jeans, no shoes, and next to him was another man in a white T-shirt.
Almost one metre away was the body of another man, wearing a red shirt and blue jeans.
All three were lying face down.
According to the evidence gathered there, three people were killed elsewhere because there were no shell casings at the scene.
There are signs on the fence of the village house addressed by one organized criminal group to another, and there are several bullet holes in the fence and in the gate.
11 caught in Cadereit
The Ministry of National Security has presented 11 individuals, including a minor, who were part of a criminal gang operating mainly in the municipality of Cadereit and who are accused of kidnapping, murder, "fraud" and clandestine graves.
According to published information, eight people were initially detained in the Los Alvero colony on 11 November, and one person who was being held hostage was rescued.
They were provided with three houses and a telephone, demanding to become members of a criminal gang called "Los Zetas."
In another development, on 12 November, at 6: 00 am, military personnel were on patrol in the village of Old Ranch in Kadereit when they saw an unmarked car with two men inside.
After stopping them and inspecting them, the soldiers found a rifle, a round of ammunition and 18 rounds of ammunition.
Later, following these statements, at 2pm on 13 November, one of their accomplices was stopped on the public land of La Pravda and tried to escape when he saw the soldiers.
He is accused of clandestine graves in the municipalities of General Terán, Hina and Cadereyta.
A new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday
The prime minister-designate, Mario Monti, will meet Italy's president tomorrow to present a new government facing a crisis that has brought the country to the brink of economic disaster.
The Italian prime minister-designate, Mario Monti, will meet with Italy's president on Wednesday to present a new government that will face a crisis that has brought Italy to the brink of economic disaster and damaged the entire eurozone.
A statement from the presidential palace said Monti, appointed on Sunday, would meet Wednesday with the president, Giorgio Napolitano, to confirm that he could form a government.
He is expected to present a cabinet composed largely of technocrats, though it is unclear when the new executive will take office.
Monti has said he will present the results of his talks with the political parties to the president in his attempt to form a government.
"I want to reaffirm my full confidence in our country's ability to get out of this difficult period," the former European Commissioner told reporters.
Monti did not say outright that he had been able to form a government, but the tone of his comments showed that obstacles had been overcome.
"The structure is now well defined," he said.
Monti completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, far less than usual, as Italy struggled with a political and financial crisis that brought its debt to a critical level.
The administration, led by former European Commissioner Monti, must approve the austerity package demanded by European leaders to restore Italy's credibility.
Underlying the pressure on Monti to hurry, volatile markets have set Italy's 10-year BTP bond yield above 7 percent, the level at which Greece and Ireland had to be bailed out.
Emma Marcegalia, leader of the Italian Employers Federation, told reporters after meeting Monti: "We said we would actively support this government."
We believe that this government is Italy's last chance to get out of this critical situation.
Monti's chances of success were largely based on the support of Silvio Berlusconi's LDP party, which was forced to resign on Saturday over the crisis.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts should lead to a good outcome," Angelino Alfano, secretary of the center-right party, told reporters.
Support for the LDP, Italy's largest party, matters, because so far many of its members have resisted Monti's technocratic government majority.
Parliamentary support
Monti's new government must have strong parliamentary support for reforms that are likely to be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blocking or suspension of these efforts could lead to a new and devastating attack on financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks has ratcheted up the pressure, warning that Monti's failure could be a disaster.
Monti began his consultations on Monday with political parties, unions and business groups, as well as youth and women's organizations.
He will end his run on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed Sunday by Napolitano, who allowed an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief respite late last week, when it became clear that Berlusconi would step down, the cost of Italy's debt has now reached critical levels amid uncertainty about whether the new prime minister will succeed.
Saving Italy, with €1.8 billion in public debt, would be too much for today's eurozone financial guardians.
Monti has said that his government will last until the next election, scheduled for 2013, despite widespread predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement reforms before calling new elections.
Monti has said that he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the main parties insist that it should be made up only of technical experts, a sign of their dissatisfaction with the process being affected by the financial situation.
Political sources reported that mutual distrust and disagreement among the parties complicates the attempt to include political figures.
Spaniards have more playing experience than Ticos
Of the 22 players announced in Spain, ten have already played 50 international matches.
On the Costa Rican side, only one of the 22 announced players has played 50 matches.
A slight contrast with Costa Rica when compared to the 22 players called up by both countries for today's friendly match at 3: 05 p.m. at the National Stadium in San Jose.
While the world and European champions, number one in FIFA's monthly rankings, have a whole list of Class A qualifiers, the Tricolor have only defender Michael Umana as the only one to have played 50 international games.
That figure was reached last Friday in a game against Panama (0-2) at Rommel Fernandez Stadium.
Spanish players, who play in the All-Star League and English Premier League clubs, have been very active in the league and domestic cup competitions this year, and they are high-level players in the European Cups and Champions League.
Add to that the experience of Spain's furies in difficult qualification for the Euro or World Cup.
Ticos players, however, have limited international experience in an area like CONCACAF, which is considered the lowest level in FIFA.
We see that Iker Casillas tops the list in the Spanish team, who last Sunday against England (a match lost 0-1 in London) repeated the record of ex-goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international matches.
Casillas will play today against Tricolor and set a new record of 127 international matches for Spain.
Xavi Hernandez, a Barcelona player, has 106 matches.
Casillas and Xavi were voted the best last week by UEFA, along with another Iberian player, Subisarreta, with 126 matches and Schalke striker Raúl Gonzalez with 102.
Almost close to Carles Puyol's hundred with 97 games to go.
Xavi Alonso follows with 91, Fernando Torres with 90, David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81, Andres Iniesta with 62, Cesc Fabregas with 61 and David Silva with 53.
Costa Rica's side are alongside Michael Humana, left-back Junior Diaz with 48 matches and goalscorer Bryan Ruiz with 45.
Further, only five have broken the 30-game mark: Keylor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernandez with 36 and Jose Luis Lopez with 35.
Remainers.
Gerard Pique (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Alvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31) have more than 30 matches in Spain.
In a team with fewer than 30 outings on the field, there is Roy Miller with 26 games, Winston Parkes with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Murray with 23.
The rest didn't even make it to 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games, Jordi Alba has two, Victor Bolivar has only one in Costa Rica, Olman Vargas and Nelson Edder have yet to make their debuts.
Spain's David Villa leads the way with 50 goals, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Brian Ruiz was the one who scored more points, twice as many as Carlos Hernandez and three times as many as Roy Murray and Parkes.
Quintet take country on tour to mark 20th career anniversary
Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true '.
In an exclusive interview with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam said the band is ready to give one of its best concerts next Sunday at the National Stadium.
There has been more than 20 years of waiting, but the band says it is also a dream come true for them to play in this country.
This was the claim of bassist and founder, Jeff Ament, who gave an exclusive interview to Viva from Brazil last week.
The band is in South America as part of a twentieth anniversary tour, and on Sunday, 20th, it will make its only stop in Central America.
On this day, they will perform at the National Stadium starting at 7: 30 p.m., along with the Los Angeles band The X and the local band Las Robertas.
This is an excerpt from the conversation, the full transcript of which is available online at The Nation.
Is it a dream come true for your Costa Rican fans that Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica? Do you know what your fans are experiencing?
A trip to Costa Rica is a dream come true for us, too.
This is only our second visit to South and Central America, and so far everything is going well.
I've only been to Costa Rica once - on holiday, it's a beautiful country and I think we'll be able to stay there for a few days.
That's why we're very happy to bring our music there.
I ask because there is some devotion to the band; the fans live under pressure in the days leading up to the concert.
What would you say to your most loyal fans?
Thank you for being with us all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica, thank you for waiting so long, and we regret it took us so long to get here.
Some people, waiting for your concert, treat it as the biggest show of the year.
Does this add a bit of tension to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we've played in the last 21 years have been in the last two weeks.
We put on some great shows in Sao Paulo and hopefully that got us in shape for this concert in Costa Rica.
We really want to play here.
We love this country, we love surfing and the jungle, in terms of these two things, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you learn about Costa Rica and its surf waves?
We have a lot of surfer friends and I have a good friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves here are incredible.
My friends always go surfing in Costa Rica and Nicaragua and Mexico, these are great places to surf, that's how we learned from people who love surfing.
Looking at the tour, you could say you've done a great show with a lot of songs.
What do you plan to do in Costa Rica?
Since we have never played there before, we have no restrictions on what we can do.
We will try to make the best possible show with the most diverse songs; we will try to play a few songs from each album and introduce our fans to a wide variety of repertoire.
You never repeat a repertoire.
How does this work?
I think it's partly because we have nine records and we can play more than 120 songs and everyone likes different songs, so it's hard to choose which songs to play every night.
When we have two or three songs that we haven't played for a while, it keeps us on our toes and surprises us because it reminds us of the reasons why we loved those songs and what we could forget.
It makes the show more interesting for us and so I think it makes it more interesting for people.
With this tour you are celebrating 20 years of your career.
Looking back, it's hard to believe everything you did?
Yes, of course.
First of all, I think none of us ever imagined that we would be in a rock band and the fact that we've been doing this for more than 20 years makes it look like a dream.
We rejoice in our success and we are very excited that we can continue to make music together.
We all love each other and love making music.
We're happy to go to places in the world where we've always wanted to go.
Everything is going very well for us.
What does it mean for you to be a significant part of the heyday of grunge?
It has always been an honor to be part of this group of great teams.
We're good friends with the guys from Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It's great when a movement grows out of a group of friends, and that's unusual.
From time to time, one group from the same city appears, but it is much more strange when five or ten groups appear at the same time in the same city.
We are proud and honored to be part of a group from Seattle.
I still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year we were at the festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on their tour, so we're happy to be friends with all of them and we're honored to be part of the Seattle sound that turned out.
It is also very strange that a band like yours stays together and in the same line-up for such a long time.
Yes, the four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which is much longer in itself than many groups do.
First, I think we are lucky that we are still alive, and second, we care for others.
We are all very close friends and, thanks to this, musical paths have also been opened that give everyone the freedom to experiment.
We trust each other's music and things couldn't be better.
Your attitude to the word fame has not been easy; but your success has enabled you to do what you wanted to do.
How do you find the balance?
As we grew up, it became easier to find a balance.
We take care not to be on tour too long because it's easy to get into this game with big crowds and people who love your music.
As long as you remember that people are here for music's sake, it reminds you that you have to respect music and what it has done without deciding to be famous and be a rock star, things that none of us care about seriously.
How do you remember your other project, Manother Love Bone?
I think we write really good songs and at the beginning it was great.
We were a band for almost three years and didn't release a single album until Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
There were a lot of disappointments because it lasted so long and the most important thing is that we are still close friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who started with us in the band and when I hear a song or see a picture, I think of the incredible person that Andy was and how he made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to go to work, laugh, talk about music and football and so much more.
He was a wonderful man and we miss him.
Local band Las Roberto will be responsible for opening the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you are familiar with her work, especially Eddie Vedder's, and so you chose her to open it?
Yes, the producers sent us some video offers and it was the band we liked the most, so we can't wait to see what Las Robertas has to offer live and it should be very exciting.
Why do you constantly change the words in Yellow Ledbetter at concerts?
It's a question to Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don't know.
He sings it and I think he uses the first thing that comes to his mind.
Who influenced you as a bassist?
There are so many of them.
Among the first to come to mind are Heather Butler, John Entwistle, CJ Ramon, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many of them that I can talk all day about the bassists I love.
How did Pearl Jam succeed in keeping grunge current, even though it is no longer in fashion?
I think we all feel a bit detached from the word grunge.
When I think of him, he reminds me of the bands I mentioned earlier, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and everyone who came along at the same time, and if it's important now, I think it's wonderful because it's music worth listening to, and teams like Mudhoney are making music better than ever.
At first, your music was gloomier, but now it is more positive.
How do you explain this change?
It's interesting because I think there are a few songs on the album that might seem easier, but there are songs like The End or Just Breathe that are considered very dark, although they might sound a bit positive.
From both of them, when Ed played them, I cried when I listened to them, these songs are very dark.
I think when you grow up and you've had some trauma in your life and you've lost a family member or a friend, these events start to affect your creativity and your music, and these two songs certainly reflect that for me.
So I think you can be a happy person and still be able to make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori readmitted to hospital for medical examination
Ex-President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized Tuesday at a public hospital to be evaluated for the loss of muscle strength in his legs, his family doctor said.
Fujimori, 72, who was sentenced to 25 years in prison for human rights violations committed during his rule (1990-2000), suffers from several illnesses, including tongue cancer, for which he has undergone four surgeries and is under observation.
Congressman Alejandro Aguinaga, who is his personal doctor, told Channel N television that Fujimori would be examined in three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the cause of pain and loss of strength in his lower limbs.
Aguinaga said he believed Fujimori should be a candidate for clemency on humanitarian grounds; however, he said he did not want it because he knew he was innocent.
He had undergone four surgeries for tongue cancer, lost 18 kilograms in weight, and other ailments were added, such as severe erosive gastritis, pancreatic cysts, kidney stones, high blood pressure and circulatory problems in his legs, the doctor listed.
Fujimori has been in prison since September 2007, at the Police National Directorate of Special Operations.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the murder of 25 people by the army's destruction squad, which operated in secret during the early years of his rule.
Mujica heads to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official delegation, led by Uruguayan President José Mujica and composed of several ministers and businessmen, will visit Mexico this Tuesday to expand trade between the two countries and to begin talks on the region's political problems.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with his Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderón, the most important item in a broad plan of meetings with political, commercial and community leaders in Mexico, according to a schedule released by Uruguay's leadership.
The meeting of the two presidents in Guadalajara will be "conducive to the exchange of information on political relations between the two nations," as the South American country's leadership posted on its website.
According to local media, Mujica is seeking Calderón's support for Uruguay in an incident with France that occurred when French President Nicolas Sarkozy listed the South American country as a tax haven at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to expel from the international community those countries that remain tax havens, a statement that prompted a protest from Uruguay and the recall of his ambassador to the European country for consultations.
Mexico has been chairing the G20 since November, a group made up of the most advanced and developing countries, and has essentially had a tax information exchange agreement with the South American country since January to avoid double taxation.
Uruguay's government has tried in recent years to speed up the conclusion of tax-exchange agreements in order to move beyond the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's "grey list" of countries that do not benefit from international standards of tax cooperation.
As for the trade plan, Mexico and Uruguay have had a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) in force since 2004, which has increased trade between the two countries.
The plumber will be 3D-printed with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario fought tirelessly for more than 25 years to save Princess Peach from Bowser's evil paws, but never before has he done so in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land," he will fight for the love of a girl in stereoscopic technology.
The edition, which will hit stores around the world this month, was created with Nintendo's 3DS handheld console in mind, allowing it to play in three dimensions without the need for glasses.
"Mario is the hero who has to tell how the stereoscopy will work without glasses," said Nintendo's head of press in Spain, Omar Álvarez, during the presentation of the game in Madrid.
Álvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "Nintendo's first video game specifically designed for this platform," because so far successful products like "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D" have been adaptations of existing games.
A spokesman for Nintendo said that, despite being in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is an "affordable" video game that allows you to enjoy a fast and mobile game.
Álvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" to attract less experienced users.
Once started, most experts will go "round two" to levels of the game that are more challenging this time around.
In addition, users can choose in real time between a "D aggressive" or one that affects only the depth of the action, but that needs to be played in three dimensions to overcome various obstacles and "avoid optical illusions."
This three-dimensional foray by Super Mario also marks the hero's return to the portable console, something that hasn't happened since 2005.
In this game, Nintendo winks at the fans of the series and repeats the successful formula from previous games, a plumber with a moustache has to walk on dangerous booby-trapped platforms to free Princess Peach.

Colom Assures Portillo's Extradition to the United States
President Alvaro Colom said Tuesday that the extradition process for Alfonso Portillo has begun so that he can face charges in the United States for a $70 million money-laundering plot.
Thus ends the process by which Guatemala responded to a request from a northern country that sought Portillo's extradition to stand trial there.
At a press conference, Colom said his decision was related to the independence of the judiciary and the executive, given that the court of first instance had already signed the extradition.
He claimed that, during his mandate, he had not "put his hands up" on legal decisions and accepted every extradition procedure he had ever known.
Together with Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will be extradited for murder and grievous bodily harm, as well as Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
What Colom did shows the executive process after all legal and constitutional courts had been exhausted to prosecute the ex-head of state from 2000 to 2004.
In accordance with the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo will be extradited once, with a decision on his legal situation in Guatemala and a guarantee of his human rights.
Portillo was found not guilty of embezzlement of Q120 million in the Ministry of Defense during the presidential term, a process that preceded extradition, but the Ministry of Public Relations appealed and reopened the case.
Trinijove helped 6,000 at-risk young people
The organization was created to prevent the marginalization of young people without education
The results of the first 25 years of social support organization Trinijove are important: 6,000 young people at risk of social exclusion have helped to overcome difficult situations during this quarter-century.
Add to that more than a hundred jobs created for this social group.
The anniversary served as an occasion for celebration at a ceremony held in the old Fabra I Coats factory, where more than 300 people came.
Trinijove was born near Trinitat Vella in 1986 with the aim of helping young people with a lack of education, unemployment and drug problems, or who are vulnerable to marginalization.
Yesterday's celebration in Sant'Andreu brought together a large number of responsible organizations and institutions that have cooperated with the association in these 25 years.
The different political presentations during the election revealed the unified character of the work done by Trinijove.
After the President of the Generalitat, Arthur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, the ceremony was attended by an ex-consultant of the Socialist Education, Ernest Maragal, and an ex-lieutenant of the mayor and current eco-socialist, Councillor Ricard Goma.
Also appearing at Fabra I Coats are the current social welfare and family consultant, Josep Lewis Cleris, and the CEO of social work at La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
He said Trinijove came into being at a very difficult time and that the current period was also difficult, but added that the work done so far "is a good base."
The Chairman cited Trinijove as an example of fighting against bad circumstances and bringing hope to people in difficulty.
"The crisis is not new to the organization and the work she has done," he said.
Occupied building where mass parties were held has been evacuated
The occupiers occupied 11 of the 13 floors of the building at 51 Balmes Street.
The 12 occupants left the building at noon yesterday without a struggle
It seems that the nightmare experienced by the neighbors who live at 51 Balmes Street has come to an end.
Twelve people left voluntarily yesterday afternoon the building they had illegally occupied and where they had organised mass parties that irritated neighbours, by court order, without police intervention.
When the operation was over, the lock on the door was changed to prevent a recurrence.
"From now on, there will be access control here," the manager said.
The squatters, who took over 11 of the 13 floors of the building, occupied the rest, appropriated all of the electricity and some of the water, painted the walls, and left traces of all sorts, especially cans of alcoholic beverages.
The first three floors were the setting for mass parties that lasted up to two days and irritated the owners.
Just behind the building is a nightclub, Balmes 51, which also suffered damage.
The owner, Maria Pantinat, told Europa Press that her income had fallen by 80% since the building was occupied.
The club owner says the occupants of the building got her into an unfair competition because they were selling drinks for three euros, compared to 10 euros at the club.
In addition, the owner of the discotheque had to respond to neighbors "complaints about the noise, although, as she noted, the noise was caused not by visitors to the club, but by residents of squat and, above all, by those who attended parties that were organized there, the frequency and intensity of which increased, according to angry neighbors.
The club owner said the inconvenience was so great that she even reached an agreement with the property's owner, who has been 'forgiving' her rent for nine months.
The Metropolitan Police also confirmed it had received more complaints from neighbours about the situation in recent weeks.
The chairman of the PP municipal group, Councillor Alberto Fernando Diaz, demanded last week that "the building be evacuated immediately in order to address the problems of coexistence and community spirit among the neighbours and the degradation in this area."
The popular leader explained that until the summer, only one floor of the building had been occupied, but in the last few months squatters had invaded all floors and virtually every room, and that some had been broken into.
In this sense, he added, "it is necessary to put an end to impunity and to stand firm against the lack of culture that is taking place in the building."
So yesterday, police evacuated a building in Noe Barris.
At 3: 30 p.m., police went to 35 Montral Street after receiving a call from a neighbor who noticed four people entering the building.
Four were arrested immediately.
Park or Mountain?
Architects agree to bid after bickering over fees
Municipal 16-door competition reignites debate over Colserola's role in Barcelona
In the mid-1980s, on the rise of the now defunct Barcelona Metropolitan Corporation (CMC), this administration printed promo leaflets for Colcerola.
The leaflet described the mountain as a large park in the capital of Barcelona.
Moreover, it was accompanied by comparisons in the pictures with New York's Central Park.
With the death of the SBC, in 1987, the park regained its place in the minds of many as the pinnacle of Barcelona as the capital of Catalonia, one of the few that is not oriented north-south, but up (mountain) -down (sea).
The positioning of Colserola as a natural park contradicts this idea.
The prototype was not Central Park, but Yellowstone, with a wild boar as a Yogi bear.
That was until, in September, the council announced a huge competition consisting of 16 competitions for a host of other gates to Colserola.
Under the gate is the idea of the park, no doubt.
Either that or someone wants to put a gate on the pitch.
The question is this: Colserola? A park or a mountain?
Competitions, and their organisational aspects and their impact on the city, are a topic of discussion for all of Barcelona's architects.
It is almost a recurring theme, discussed when two members of this select clan recognize each other in an elevator.
And this fact leads to just one of the few coincidences between what the three Barcelona architects and the scholars who were present say.
Miguel Roldan, Daniel Modolo and Mara Bayona: the competition is appropriate
For Roldan, after reaching the coastline, it becomes "necessary" to discuss the "front side of the mountain" when Ildefon Cerda's proposal, a mountain with green apples, has not been implemented.
"You have to admit that Barcelona's biggest park is the beach.
Among other things, thanks to its excellent accessibility.
Colserola is more complex, "says the architect, for whom the title" Colserola Gate "contains a" verbal trap ": we should not think of it" as an entrance to the park, but as a restriction on certain areas where we must operate. "
Modolo, like Roldan and Bayona with experience in urban construction, called the proposal an "intellectual challenge" with "some dangers."
Risks arising from the "uncertainty of forecasting public space" after the experience of the 1980s, which ended at the Forum with "its swan song."
The first fear is the actual limitation of where one can build.
"Limiting something is preparing the next step," he said.
"We need to think about new urban planning tools, because the current ones [for the Capital Master Plan (CMP)] could lead to real disaster."
Closer to home, Modolo believes that simplifying the Colserola Valley "can be understood as a park, Barcelona, not" as a purely topographical issue.
Modolo recalls that there is already work done outside Calserola that "should not be overlooked," although he is grateful for the opportunity that the mayor's office offers his profession to join the project "from the beginning."
Moreover, he understands that the mountain's proximity to the city is a pass that allows architects to enter the debate, but "he doubts" whether this technical profile is what should guide the interdisciplinary teams ("success," he argues) that were to be created: "Architects should only be tools."
Bayona hints that the answer to the question posed by the title of this piece is complicated because the rules of the competition lack the general appearance of Colserola: "There were 16 intersecting competitions," he says, "in the sense of the sea-mountain, but there is no longitudinal reading here to see and understand the region as a whole."
This leads, at least in his case, to the decision to participate in 16 competitions.
On the other hand, a project for one gate may overlap programmatically and definitively with an architect's project for an adjacent gate.
From your point of view, the council should ensure that the strip directly above the Rhonda de Dalt should provide in its entirety an area equipped to create a smooth transition between the city and the greenery.
Casino forgives Jonas Larrazabal and he will be released
After 72 days of settlement, Red Casino's legal representative pardoned the brother of the mayor of Monterrey in a lawsuit against him for extortion.
After 72 days in prison, Manuel Jonas Larrazabal will be free after the legal representative of Red Casino granted him a pardon before the Second Criminal District Court, which is conducting an extortion trial against the brother of the mayor of Monterrey.
After the bombing of Casino Royale, the owner of Red Casino, Sergio Gil Garcia, published a series of photos and videos in which Manuel Jonas allegedly demanded an economic contribution from him in order for the Monterrey authorities to authorize a clandestine operation at the casino.
Following his public conviction, the State Attorney-General opened a criminal case against the mayor's brother and, on 2 September, he was arrested and imprisoned for 30 days.
After four hours in front of an agent of the State Ministry of Inheritance Crimes, he was sent to a temporary prison located in the old part of the state capital.
He remained there for 49 days, following a second travel ban after the prosecutor ruled out bribery and organized crime.
On October 19, he was transferred to Cadereyta for allegedly extorting half a million pesos from the owner of Red Casino, but spent only a few hours in a medium-security prison because he received death threats.
The authorities allowed him to continue serving his sentence at the San Nicolás Municipal Prison in Garza.
On October 25, the arrest warrant was issued by the Registrar of the Second Criminal District Court, Jorge Yanez, who said that after almost two months of investigations, the evidence against Jonas was clear enough, such as charging 1.5 million pesos to bookmakers in exchange for permission to operate.
On Monday, Red Casino's legal representative, Victor Aldo García Gómez, appeared before Judge José Luis Pesina to ask for clemency for the mayor's brother, so that he could be released in the next few hours.
During the trial, the public prosecutor attached to the court, Ramiro Arias, asked García Gómez if he had compensated for the damage and which of the partners in the gambling house would grant a pardon, though the lawyer was careful not to make his name public.
Based on record 197 / 2011, a legal pardon was granted to Jonas Larrazabal, and no statement can be made thereafter about the trial that was planned against him; nor will any reparation or punishment be required.
After a hearing by the legal representative of the bookmakers, at about 3: 50 p.m., an order was issued to release Larrazabal Breton immediately.
The court official, Jorge Yanez, went to the San Nicolás Municipal Jail in Garza to inform Jonah that he had been legally pardoned and that his case would be closed.
He will also notify him of an immediate release order signed by the judge.
Minister Dionisio Perez Jacome talks about the details of the crash that killed Interior Minister Francisco Blake and seven others.
The Ministry of Communications and Transport (MCT) reported that the results of the accident, in which Interior Minister Francisco Blake Mora and seven others were killed, showed that the helicopter hit the ground in a state of complete integrity, without the pilot attempting an emergency landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Perez Jacome, Minister of Communications and Transport, said that before the aircraft went up, the pilot determined that the weather conditions were suitable for the flight.
"The elements that seem to show that the ship had several contacts with the ground, the wings came into contact with trees 25 meters away, where the vehicle lost its flux."
He also said that the ship was intended for 19 people, so it met the necessary requirements for transporting people.
He also said studies conducted in the strike area did not report the presence of parts on the ground.
"The study reports that elsewhere there are no components of the ship, the impact occurred in a state of structural integrity.
"The helicopter was designed for 19 passengers, which met the relevant requirements for passenger transportation.
The ground in this place has a slope of seven to 30 degrees.
At this point, the secretary said, the key is to get the results as soon as possible; however, the study could take months or even a year.
Meanwhile, Gilberto Lopez Meyer, Director General of Airports and Support Services, said the presidential helicopter was being driven at cruising speed at the time of the strike and that it was on soft, rising ground.
"This information strengthens the hypothesis of a normal flight maneuver at the time of impact," he said.
At a press conference, SCT's owner, Perez Jacome, listed six important elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
According to aviation rules, the flight was operated according to the rules of visual flight, which means that the crew must have visibility during the flight and landing.
Weather conditions:
AICM reports revealed suitable takeoff conditions as the aircraft headed for the border area between Mexico City and the state of Mexico, where layers of cloud were observed at low altitudes.
Selected itineraries:
It is possible that cloudy conditions caused the team to seek a lower altitude and higher visibility area in the Cuernavaca Valley.
Place of impact.
The coordinates of the strike and the last recording from the aircraft's radar coincide, probably before the impact there was no loss of control or change of flight direction.
Scattered debris over a small area:
The information available so far indicates that the impact occurred on the front and side lines.
The dispersion of the debris suggests that the helicopter hit the ground in conditions of structural integrity.
There were no obvious signs of fire or explosion:
Unfound evidence remains in the wreckage of the ship, some kind of explosion or fire.
Recent research suggests that there may have been multiple contacts with the ground.
During the work at the site, pieces of the aircraft were found at an altitude of 9,200 feet above sea level, the ground has a slope of seven degrees to 30 degrees.
The pictures show the sequence in which it disintegrated along the way.
The information contains facts that appear to indicate that the helicopter may have had several collisions with the ground.
After careful investigation, no scattered parts of the aircraft were found over a larger area than the delineated area near the crash site, reinforcing the assumption that the strike occurred in conditions of structural integrity.
MSS Announces Obesity Gene Search Program
Social Protection Leads Study on Obesity Gene in Children and Young People, Supported by IPN
Mexico's Social Security Institute (MSSI) has announced that it is conducting a study to detect the obesity gene in children and young people, called the "Genetics of Obesity in Childhood and Adolescence" protocol, which will provide a count of the signs associated with being overweight.
In a statement, Miguel Cruz López, head of the Biochemistry Medical Research Unit at the Specialized Hospital of the 21st Century National Medical Center, explained that a multidisciplinary team of therapists, nurses, nutritionists and social workers had been assembled.
This team is supported by specialists and graduate students from the National Institute of Public Health (NIPH) and the Centre for Scientific Research and Higher Education (CINVESTAV) of the National Polytechnic Institute (NPI).
The population (registered or not) is invited to participate in the study by going to the MSSI sports centers involved in the study, in the Mexico Valley, where tests with children will be held every Saturday from 8: 00 a.m.
He stressed that the protocol was started in the sports center in Cuauhtemoc (in the western state of Mexico), and since October 8, events have been held in the sports center in Nezahualcoyotl (in the eastern state of Mexico).
After reaching the target of 500 to 600 children, the study will continue at the Independence Sports Center (south of Mexico City) and finally at the Morelos Sports Center (north of Mexico City).
He explained that the aim of the study was to understand the components and importance of genetics in the development of obesity and to establish a risk factor among children and young Mexicans to prevent the emergence of chronic degenerative diseases.
November 14 will mark World Diabetes Day, and the main goal is to collect 3,000 children and adolescents between the ages of 6 and 14, with parental permission and supervision, to complete individual nutrition questionnaires.
They will also be asked about physical activity and family history of hereditary diseases to avoid risk factors that lead to diseases such as diabetes or kidney failure.
He explained that on Saturday, anthropometric measurements of all participants (weight, height, and waist circumference), blood pressure and levels of glucose, fat, cholesterol, and insulin, and genetic analysis (to identify genes that are linked to childhood obesity) would be conducted.
Cruz Lopez said the study reflects public health experts "concern about alarming weight gain among children.
Medical studies conducted between 1999 and 2006 show that in just 6 years there has been an increase: 77% of boys were obese, 47% of girls; as far as overweight is concerned, there has also been a significant increase, "said an MSSI specialist.
He said the validity of the search for markers was based on the fact that a country's population differs from other nations in terms of its genetic history.
He reported that, on average, a Mexican is 65 percent descendant of American Indians, 30 percent descendant of Europeans, and five percent descendant of Africans, a condition that affects genes associated with diabetes and obesity.
He explained that the main consequence of the genetics of obesity is the body's inability to burn the excess energy we consume (calories), which is deposited in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the immediate benefit for the participants is a comprehensive assessment of the children, which can determine whether they are overweight or obese.
Even, he said, the presence of dark creases on the neck (acanths) and forearms means the likelihood of metabolic disorders and even pre-diabetes.
The information is treated with complete confidentiality, and doctors pass it on in writing to parents, to whom they explain all the measurements and lifestyle changes that must be made to avoid the disease.
Cruz López explained that there are three main causes of obesity, obesity, and other chronic diseases: a sedentary lifestyle, or lack of daily physical activity, spending most of the day at home in front of the television, and using transportation for short distances instead of walking.
It is also due to high calorie intake, i.e. increased consumption of sugary drinks and carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with high levels of fat and protein, and the genetic predisposition analyzed in this program.
UNAM asphalt can avoid cracks
Rafael Herrera, a researcher in the UNAM Department of Chemistry, has developed a polymer-modified bitumen to produce a mixture of the best quality that is resistant to environmental and temperature effects.
If the signals sent by the paving were taken into account, about 200,000 pits would need to be repaired each rainy season in the Mexico Valley metropolitan area, said Rafael Herrera Najera, a researcher at the UNAM Department of Chemistry, adding that if the process of building and maintaining the paved road was correct, the number of pits could be reduced or even reduced to zero.
In his lecture on the Technological View of Pits, delivered as part of the International Year of Chemistry, it is reported that the laboratory for which he is responsible is developing a polymer-modified bitumen to produce a mixture with characteristics close to bitumen but with better resistance at both high and low temperatures.
Herrera Najera said this type of modified bitumen can be used in places where the weather is extremely hot, as in some northern cities, to improve the quality of roads and thus counteract the formation of pits.
He explained that bitumen, the heaviest part of oil, is a sequence of hydrocarbon molecules, some high molecular mass, called asphaltenes, and others low molecular mass, called maltenes, which together give the road surface its characteristic viscous elastic behavior.
The viscosity-elastic behavior of bitumen is due to the fact that at high temperatures of about 180 degrees it behaves like a liquid, at 120 its viscosity is very high, and at 50 degrees Celsius it retains an almost solid state, while at very low temperatures bitumen becomes brittle, he said.
This means that the resistance of street asphalt is not constant, but varies during the day, depending on natural conditions and temperature, said the chemical engineer.
The chemist noted that Mexico City's streets are mostly covered with a flexible coating, which is made up of six layers of material, the last three of which include bitumen.
Among the uppermost layers is bitumen, composed of small stones lowered into the bitumen and then pressed.
Every stone that makes up this coating, he said, is submerged in bitumen.
When vehicles are moving and exerting effort, it helps the forces to be very well distributed on the road surface.
If it were modified asphalt, they would have been distributed even better, the chemical engineer said.
On the asphalt surface, he added, is placed a final layer, called a layer of wear, which is made of fine stone, actually sand also submerged in asphalt.
Since this is the layer that will come into contact with the wheels of the vehicle, it should have more resistance than the asphalt surface and provide road friction.
As part of the road surface that will receive and distribute these forces, the wear layer also requires an appropriate thickness, and the material from which it is made must be taken into account.
Weather, especially humidity and temperature fluctuations, are also very important factors to consider, especially water, he said, because it significantly affects the condition of the asphalt.
When the ground is damp, water penetrates the coating and is difficult to escape, causing all the coating layers to soften and thus form pits.
When pits are formed, he said, the wear layer first wears off and only then affects the bitumen, but the damage does not occur instantaneously, a process that should be addressed at the first sign of routine maintenance programs.
The member of the National System of Researchers also explained that transport load is another important factor in the formation of holes, so the thickness of each layer of coating should always be related to transport load and this requirement should be guaranteed to prevent the frequent occurrence of holes.
Rafael Herrera said there is still a lot to learn about bitumen, such as bitumen emulsions, which are already on the market in other countries and even help to fix holes with ease and without using high temperatures.
What was missing from Valle's candidacy to become the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the reasons that prevented Cerna Melina Ramírez from winning the Miss Colombia crown.
Valle was crowned Princess 14 times.
Once again, Valle del Cauca is left wanting to win the Miss Colombia crown.
This time, Melina Ramírez Cerna had to content herself with getting on the winners "podium with a silver crown and a ribbon proclaiming her the new princess of Colombia.
Based on the result achieved last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlantic won the crown and the sceptre, the department has 14 titled princesses, and Melina joins the legion of women from Valle del Cauca who were close to the crown but were declared princesses, among them Mirias Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Borrero Domínguez (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Layla Blanca (1988), Monica Evers (1989), María Zonzuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Ichabel Romero (1993), Hiseia Aljura Garcés (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stefani Garcés Aljure (2008).
The question many are now asking is this:
What was missing? Because the result is the defeat of the main favorite, who demonstrated in each performance that she has everything to become the new Miss Colombia, not just because she was elected Queen of Police and Vogue's Most Beautiful Face - titles held by queens like Tatiana Vargas or Natalia Navarro, who won the Miss Colombia crown.
The first factor that played a role in the jury's decision to award her the title of First Princess was that she could not convincingly answer the question, "Which book characterizes you and why?," posed by Martin Murillo Gómez of the Let's Honor Literature Society.
She answered the questioner:
"I read a lot, I believe in literature, I think it's a form of cultivation, and I definitely think that the book that characterizes my childhood, The Little Prince, is quite a deep book.
Today, I am reading Crime and Punishment, a masterpiece of world literature that we should all read; I am also currently reading a book by Irina Nemirovskaya, a Russian writer, a wonderful book called The Heat of Blood.
An answer that the jury did not like because of the term "culturalization" and, secondly, because it did not explain specifically how each of the cited books characterizes it.
But after the ceremony, Melina said she was calm and pleased with her result: "The universe is wise, what is about to happen is happening."
And all of you, please, read at least a little, "The Little Prince" is a great book. "
Among the hypotheses voiced is that Valle was burned by favouritism.
A Bogotá reporter suggested that, because she was preferred, she was given a standing ovation, and that she was a candidate who had won all the preliminary awards (Ostera's cooking competition, the viewers "vote for the best national costume, and the Queen Mother)," which made the other candidates jealous, caused stress to the Queen, and as a result she did not shine on stage. "
And it was noted during her first appearance in a swimsuit at the Hilton beach and during her two shows on the evening's coronation.
Although she looked confident in both, it was noticeable that she lacked the strength and energy shown by the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist for RCN's "At Home" program, said that the fact that Milena was called a princess "means that the candidate who wins the most awards during the competition does not become a queen."
Moreover, the Valle representative has recently avoided speaking to the press, and that was wrong.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury of her interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Contest.
That is why, two days before the selection, international jury member Lucy Doty said they were looking for a woman committed to the social needs of her country.
"Beauty alone is not enough for Miss Colombia, we have to look not only at appearance, but also focus on the public consciousness, before they enter the competition, they have to be involved in projects," she said.
There is also a suggestion that Valle suffered from defects on her buttocks and fibrosis, which was visible on her stomach, but this is debatable, as the jury singled out her as a candidate of "natural beauty," given her healthier body, good diet and responsible physical work.
The Queen's consultant, Jorge Hernán Orozco, notes that Melina did not have the best body, which was also better, "but the problems of fibrosis in her abdomen, which were not very noticeable to me, caused her to lose points on the last day."
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos of the magazine Cromos believes that the mistake of the representative of Valle de Cauca was that she underwent surgery.
'Surgery is good, but Valle doesn't know how to do it.
Her body was never her strength, and here she was punished for it.
As for the prize, which was presented for the first time by the organizers of the National Beauty Contest, a cruel prediction came true last night, it is said that it was a woodpecker, which Raimundo presented to Melina as compensation for the fact that she lost the pleasure of winning the crown.
Whether it is true or not, the fact is that Melina is now beginning her year in office, not as Queen, but as Princess, a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in one of the international competitions indicated directly by the organizers of the National Competition.
But she will go down in history as one of the queens who, despite her excellent performance in the Cartagena competition, found it difficult to win the crown.
This was the work of the man who identified Alfonso Cano's body.
A Cali criminologist has gone down in history as the man who confirmed Alfonso Cano's death.
The work of these employees is key.
On November 4, CTI criminologist Cali went down in history as the man who confirmed the identity of FARC head Alfonso Cano by matching his fingerprints.
Of the seven criminologists working at CTI, this week it was the turn of Elizabeth González, a Puerto Tejada man who spent 21 years in the field of forensic investigation, to be "on duty."
Early in his career, González worked in the towns of Chocó, where he often had to trek for more than five days through the jungle to reach the location of the bodies that had to be identified.
In 2000, he moved to Valle and, after completing the relevant courses, became a specialist in forensics, where he studied the friction of the skin, i.e. the palms and feet.
In the week of Elizabeth's operation to identify the man known as Alfonso Cano, he was told to keep his clothes on for no more than three days.
Something great was coming.
On Friday night, he arrived by helicopter from Cauca to Palmyra.
He knew he would have to identify two bodies, and one of them was believed to belong to the man who led the world's oldest guerrilla war, so they asked him to take ten prints of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the research team at the site of the body, he did not recognize it from its appearance; it was very different from what was shown in the media.
He was beardless, dressed like a local farmer, without glasses, and much thinner.
But the prints will not lie.
Using magnifying glass, ink, a shovel and a flashlight, Elisar matched the corpse's fingerprints with those in the images.
His eyes did not let him down: it was Alfonso Cano.
That same night, the representative of Puerto Tejada was asked to confirm to Defense Minister Juan Carlos Pinzon that he was the head of the FARC.
Finding Fingerprints
The confession made by President Juan Manuel Santos Elizabeth González at a press conference about the operation against Cano is particularly significant for the fingerprint specialist of the Sijin unit in Cali.
A lot of people don't know our work.
Dactyloscopy is a rigorous science, error-free, and can play a key role in solving crimes.
In addition to identifying the bodies, fingerprint experts are involved in investigating crimes such as theft and murder and identifying the detainees.
When apprehended, many criminals have forged identity documents or are undocumented.
We take their fingerprints and look for them in the database.
The researcher said that in case of theft, he had to take away a piece of the wall of the house because the thief was leaning on his hands to take possession of a safe full of jewellery and money.
"The walls are hard to work with because they are not comfortable surfaces for fingerprinting, but in this case we can take a picture of the whole palm and identify the perpetrator who took part in several thefts," he says.
The fingerprints also help to exclude or establish the involvement of suspects in murder cases.
A man was recently found dead with liquor bottles around him.
During the investigation, it was established that a relative might have been suspected of committing the crime and, indeed, the fingerprints on the bottle matched.
Although this does not guarantee that he was a murderer, it does prove that he was at the scene of the murder.
A fingerprint specialist from CTI explained that a chemical or physical reagent is applied to areas where there are prints.
When they show up, a blade or tape is used to remove them.
The fingerprint images are then sent to Asif, which is a database of criminals, or entered into a register.
"The problem is that we still have a lot of undocumented Colombians," the CTI expert said.
He explained that not everything is as shown in a television program about CSI.
Just as not all the gold that glitters, not everything you touch leaves its imprint.
However, if possible, comparisons are made.
"Angry People" Defy New York City Authorities
Hundreds of protesters camped out in front of Piazza Zuccotti.
Some protesters listened to the court's decision to disperse the demonstration from the square and headed to the park next door.
Members of the Occupy Wall Street movement defied New York City authorities on Tuesday as they attempted to re-enter, under court orders, Manhattan Square, from where they were evacuated at dawn as they tried to seize another Big Apple park.
Hundreds of protesters gathered outside Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to enter thanks to a court order that allowed "angry people" to camp in the square while another part of the movement responded to the crackdown by occupying a park in the north of the city, where further arrests were made.
"Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp in the square, we will break up the camp somewhere else and continue the legal fight to get back to Zuccotti and through peaceful sit-ins and demonstrations," said Mark Bray, a spokesman for the Occupy Wall Street movement.
Bray explained that the response of "angry people" to the evacuation of the tent city, ordered personally by New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, went to court, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting forced evacuations from the square and allowing demonstrators to remain in the camp.
In addition, "angry people" began to occupy the new park, located at the confluence of Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, near the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and owned by Trinity Parish Church.
They could have occupied the place for at least an hour, but then the police arrived and proceeded to arrest some of the protesters, though Bray could not give an exact number, but told Efe he saw several journalists who were also handcuffed.
The organization says several hundred people were camped out at the site where a delegation of religious leaders went to show support for the movement's members, trying to mediate with the police.
Meanwhile, Zuccotti Square, which is privately owned, remains closed pending a court hearing scheduled for this Tuesday that will consider the legality of this morning's crackdown on protesters.
Some of the protesters heading there carried and distributed copies of that court order and even gave those copies to the police guarding the square, leading to "some small clashes," said Bray, who said some police officers beat demonstrators.
The court order prohibits the authorities from evacuating Occupy Wall Street members and enforcing "laws that have been enacted since the occupation began, or prohibiting demonstrators from re-entering the park with stores and other property previously used."
Mayor Bloomberg told reporters that because of the court order, the city had suspended the opening of public space and demonstrators had been informed, but local laws prevented them from reopening tent shops and sleeping bags.
The municipal council member personally justified the pre-dawn removal of protesters from Zuccotti Square, an operation that led to some 200 arrests and was ordered because the protesters were "breaking the law."
Bloomberg said he ordered the square to be cleared because it was becoming "a place where people came not to protest, but to break the law and, in some cases, to harm other people," because "some businesses received threats" and neighbors feared "for their quality of life."
The evacuation this morning was disgusting and shows that, deep down, Bloomberg is more interested in protecting the financial interests of American workers, "added a spokesman for the movement, which condemns the mayor for" disrespecting free speech. "
Occupy Wall Street officials also indicated that they intend to organize "grand actions" on Thursday, in collaboration with civil society organizations and labor unions, to recall the last two months of protests that began on September 17.
Pamela Anderson to star as Virgin Mary in special Christmas TV show
Along with Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, she will appear on the television program "Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1.
Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant in "The Big Repair," a lifeguard in "Malibu Saviors," Bunny in "Playboy," the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee, and now the actress and model will become a Virgin Mary in a special Christmas show on Canadian television.
Private television station CTV announced today that Anderson, along with ballroom crooner Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, will appear on the television program "Russell Peters" Christmas "on December 1, in the role of a very special Maria.
CTV today released footage of a television show in which Anderson, also known for a widely shared online homemade pornographic video in which she appears with her then-husband, Mötley Crüe drummer Tommy Lee, appears dressed as a Virgin Mary holding a doll depicting Jesus in a manger.
In this scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian descent who recently appeared as the host of Charlie Sheen's "My Cruel Torpedo of Truth," appears as Joseph.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, the CTV Christmas special features Canadian singer Bublé, who married Argentine model Luciana Lopilato in Buenos Aires at the end of March and who also knows a thing or two about scandals.
Bublé recently called American Kim Kardashian a "bitch" during one of his concerts in New York
Japan Revived After Earthquake
GDP grew by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption, ending a downward spiral that began in March
Since March last year, Japan's economy has been paralyzed and is still recovering from the devastating earthquake that triggered the nuclear crisis, the worst disaster suffered by the Land of the Rising Sun since World War II.
Initial estimates by the Tokyo government put the material losses at $300,000 - a blow that, despite the dire global situation, seems to be subsiding.
After three consecutive loss-making quarters, the July-September gross domestic product data certainly helped turn the page: GDP grew by 1.5% quarter-on-quarter and by 6% year-on-year.
Registered in the second quarter - for Japanese, the fiscal year begins in March 2012 - it also represents the fastest growth rate from January to March 2010.
The resurgence can be attributed in part to a resurgence in the purchase of machinery to rebuild areas devastated by the earthquake and subsequent tsunami.
Indeed, companies increased their investment by 1.1%, compared to a 0.9% decline in capital spending from January to March, the first decline after six months of uninterrupted growth.
But the true reversal in Japan's economy is not based solely on Keynesian impulses, which call for using the crisis to strengthen - or rebuild - infrastructure, using loopholes to grow from scratch.
Japan has awakened, thanks largely to the expansion of household consumption, which now accounts for 60% of Japan's GDP.
The figure rose by 1%, driven by higher spending on cars, travel and leisure.
The Yen Stamp
Tokyo gave the domestic market, when the yen - the Japanese currency - became one of the "safe havens" chosen by investors who want to escape the euro zone debt crisis and the negative outlook for the US, a privilege that weighs on the accounts of exporting companies like a stone.
With a stronger currency, products are expensive abroad, which is a serious blow to a country whose economic course is determined by the health of big technology companies.
Toyota or Sony, for example, blame the yen for their low performance from July to September.
As markets continue to besiege the EU's peripheral countries, Yoshihiko Noda's government remains vigilant.
We must be alert to persistent risks, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of flooding in Thailand and a sharp appreciation of the yen, said Economic Policy Minister Motohisa Furukawa yesterday.
Indeed, the outlook is not encouraging.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said most member states showed clear signs of economic contraction in September.
An indicator that predicts a turnaround in the global economy has shown that underlying forces are slowing.
It then fell four-tenths to 100.4 points, from 100.8 in August.
The eurozone even fell below the 100-point average after it fell eight-tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens again gives rise to doubts
Papadimos said the adjustment would be approved, but conservatives would not sign a single written pledge
With peripheral risk premia and uncertainty in the parks, Greece continues to wander the labyrinth that leads to an exit from Europe's great debt crisis.
The perception that the "consent" of the new transitional government of Hellas is imposed more by the demands of Brussels than by the true conviction of the political forces is beginning to be confirmed by the facts.
While new Prime Minister Lucas Papadimos yesterday warned that there was no alternative to structural reforms and that the 100-day period agreed upon when he was appointed might not be sufficient to implement them, the leader of the conservative New Democracy party, Antonis Samaras, insisted that he would not support new austerity measures in any way and reiterated his demand for new elections on February 19.
The main task of this government is to implement the decisions taken at the October 26 summit, Papadimos said yesterday, opening a parliamentary debate that will culminate tomorrow in a vote of confidence in the new executive.
A package of 24 programs to boost employment, reforms to the civil servants "disciplinary code, and new measures to combat tax evasion will be the first innovations.
Samaras's message, however, leaves no doubt about his position: "We are ready to help the transitional government, but we promise nothing."
The Conservative leader went one step further in his sentiments about the EU and the IMF, the institutions that are supposed to unfreeze the 8,000 million urgently needed by Athens, and made clear that he would not endorse any letter of agreement to the treaty's requirements.
But the European Commission, still exasperated by the effect of Papandreou's all-or-nothing referendum claims, reiterated yesterday that its demands are unequivocal: it will not resume aid unless the new government and the leaders of Greece's main parties sign "a written agreement without any ambiguity and as soon as possible."
Economy Ministry spokesman Amadeu Altafai said troika inspectors could return to Athens "very soon" to discuss with the new government "what should be done to disburse the sixth tranche" of $8,000 million, though an exact date has not yet been set.
There will be enough thread in the Greek tangle for a while to come.
Mrs. Sophia: "These are tools of progress and hope"
The Queen stressed Spain's "central" position on this type of finance
Spain "has taken a prominent place in the world in the area of microfinance."
Queen Sofia recalled yesterday that, over the past two decades, the country has become the second largest donor in terms of instruments of cooperation, whose "essence," she said, is "an instrument of social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all mankind, based on faith in people."
The Queen opened the Fifth World Microcredit Summit in Valladolid yesterday with the conviction that "there is no doubt" that such action is "absolutely necessary" to achieve the United Nations Millennium Development Goals by 2015, and "especially the goal of halving the number of people living on less than one dollar a day, the level at which the poverty line is fixed."
Spain is "still working" to expand the network of recipients around the world and is taking on the task with all "responsibility," says Doña Sofia, and hopes that the efforts and achievements made during the summit, which will last until Thursday, will "ensure the creation of new abilities and better opportunities for the poorest people, and especially for women," the main recipients of these loans. "
There are "many achievements" and "many difficulties we face."
The Microcredit Summit is becoming not only a forum for debate, but also a platform that promotes "two main goals."
Her Majesty thus explained that she hoped that by the end of 2015, 175 million poor families would have benefited from these financial services, and that a hundred million of these households would have lifted themselves out of the poverty into which they were plunged.
The impetus to create a microcredit system in Spain and the rest of the world "followed the path begun years ago" by Muhammad Yunus, Ms. Sofia emphasized, as "an act of justice and recognition."
And she described the instrument's father as a "strikingly idealistic anti-poverty campaigner" whose work has been known for 15 years, since the Queen went to Bangladesh to study its lending policies first-hand.
That experience was replicated a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings, such as those held in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, and "I saw continuous development everywhere," said Her Majesty, whose connection to the project earned her the title of "head of the family" yesterday, assembled in Valladolid by the "banker of the poor."
Finally, Queen Sofia concluded by calling on those present to engage in discussions and find solutions to move forward in the fight against poverty.
The "Ethical Imperative"
Foreign Minister Trinidad Jimenez said solidarity is an "ethical imperative" for every democratic state.
In this regard, she said that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries to boom times, as it is a "permanent commitment."
Giménez concluded that microcredit implies "a serious and firm commitment to poverty eradication," and now, "more than ever," developed-country governments must work according to solidarity criteria and prevent it from falling victim to spending cuts.
For Spain, microcredit is "one of the main areas of development cooperation."
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, praised the "success" in giving "confidence" to the "dispossessed, to whom all doors are closed," while the Mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed everyone present in a city that is "opening its doors in a spirit of solidarity."
CDU proposes to elect the president of the European Commission by universal suffrage
The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) on Monday 14 November in Leipzig passed without significant problems for Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is also the chair of the Christian Democratic Party.
The future of Europe was not originally on the agenda, but emerged in the autumn itself, in part to satisfy activists who believe that the government's policies are far from being as stringent as they should be today vis-à-vis Greece and perhaps tomorrow vis-à-vis Italy....
A draft resolution on the presidency of the European Commission, tabled by the leadership, was adopted almost unanimously.
Of the 1,001 delegates, only nine voted against and ten abstained.
There was no room for doubt in the standing ovation that lasted for several minutes that Angela Merkel and a few hours later Wolfgang Schäuble, the Europhile and finance minister, deserved.
The main message of the Chancellor and the draft resolution is that the correct response to the crisis is "not less Europe, but more Europe."
Not only because Europe means peace, but because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro."
For the Chancellor, "it is time for a breakthrough in Europe."
This could mean changes to the Lisbon Treaty, making it possible for the European Union to strengthen its control over eurozone countries "fiscal policies, but it could also affect the election of the president of the European Commission by universal suffrage" to give Europe a face. "
At any rate, this is one of the proposals of the draft resolution adopted by the Congress, the idea of which obviously belongs to Wolfgang Schäuble.
Of course, twenty-seven countries are unlikely to agree quickly; the United Kingdom opposes it, and CDU leaders believe that Nicolas Sarkozy opposes it, too.
But the ground is set.
Likewise, delegates overwhelmingly rejected a proposal to weigh the vote of each member state on the board of the European Central Bank according to the size of each economy, which would have significantly increased the weight of the German economy.
In an effort to calm the mood in her party, the chancellor has increased the number of references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but she has not sought to influence the congress at the expense of "small" European countries or countries in difficulty that like to criticize "arrogant" Germany.
Although the draft resolution on Europe devotes an entire paragraph to the importance of "German-French friendship," Angela Merkel made no mention of France.
Only in passing.
Remembering that two centuries ago, Leipzig was the scene of a bloody battle.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What is sick leave fraud?
Following the cash handouts, the UMP and the government launched an offensive on sick leave.
On November 15, Nicolas Sarkozy will arrive in Bordeaux to visit the Family Allowance Fund and deliver a speech on the issue, which has been raised periodically since 2007, on the fight against welfare fraud.
And to help this offensive, which arose out of a desire to save money in a difficult situation, but is also part of the right's campaign for re-election to the presidency, most want to focus on sick leave.
First and foremost, in order to save the budget, the government intends to impose a fourth day of unpaid leave on employees of private companies before the payment of benefits.
Obviously, without the employer's special consent, the sick employee will lose a four-day salary equal to at least 15% of his / her monthly income.
A measure that threatens to spark a storm of anger, but which, according to Les Echos, will save 280 million euros.
And it will be accompanied by other measures with a more symbolic effect, namely, imposing a one-day waiting period on public employees without sick pay (public employees have so far not had to wait for benefits, as opposed to a three-day wait for private-sector workers).
Now that these issues are being discussed, most are also raising the issue of fraud again, with a view to abuses in the issuance of sick leave certificates.
Control will be tightened and, in addition, if you are caught, you will have to return all the illegal payments you received, "Xavier Bertrand warned on RTL channel on Saturday, November 13.
As in other cases, the effect of the statement was somewhat disproportionate to the actual abuse of sick leave.
Indeed, they have been subject to constant monitoring and political attacks since 2002, which are bearing fruit.
People in France are no more sick than anywhere else in Europe.
Let's first look at the figures for the country.
According to the National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM), more than €237 million in daily compensation was paid out in 2006.
According to the Institute for Health Economics Research and Documentation, the daily compensation costs in 2008, amounting to 11.3 thousand euros, accounted for 5% of total health-care spending.
Of this amount, 46% related to maternity leave and work-related accidents, and 54% to sickness benefits, amounting to 6.2 thousand euros.
And thus accounted for 2.5% of health-related expenditures.
The French spent an average of 14.5 days on sick leave in 2010, compared to 17.8 days in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting Group.
An arithmetic average that hides some deviations; another study published in 2007 by career management website Monster.com found that 75% of 40,000 French workers surveyed said they had not taken a single day of sick leave.
Another study, this time on health insurance, states that in 2010, 37% of sick days lasted less than 8 days, 15% 15 days to one month, 15% one to three months, and 11% lasted longer.
Comparing these figures with those of Europe's neighbors shows that French workers are no more likely to take sick leave than workers in any other country.
A long study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers found that between 1994 and 2001, the overall absenteeism rate in France (health or not) ranged between 10% and 11%, compared to 20-28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom, and 16-18% in the Netherlands.
The level of fraud associated with sick leave is very low compared to grey employment.
As for the level of fraud, it is very low.
The tightening of the law since 2002 has led to a systematic review of hospital stays of more than 45 days.
In 2008, out of 1.5 million verified cases, CNAM found that 13% of 285,000 reports of short-term illness were "unjustified" or "too long," accounting for 37,050 cases.
In the case of systematically audited sick leave of more than 45 days, 11% of the 1.2 million cases were "inappropriate or unjustified," or 132,000.
All told, 169,000 cases were "unwarranted" for several million workers who received sick leave.
Numbers that show very few cases compared, for example, to the numbers of "gray" employment.
According to UMP deputy Dominique Tian, author of a report on the issue in June, they amount to between 9,000 and 15,000 million euros in lost budget revenues per year, which exceeds the total cost of daily compensation, and is therefore infinitely higher than losses from fraud.
Papadimos: Greece must follow new settlement plan
Greece needs a new adjustment program to save its economy.
Prime Minister Lucas Papadimos stated this in Parliament on Monday, 14 November, adding that 100 days given to his coalition government was not enough to accomplish this task.
"In order to achieve the goal of saving the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new program of budget adjustment," declared the Prime Minister, who made his first public statement when he opened the debate on the confidence vote in Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone summit on October 27 should be the "main task" of the new government, because the country's presence in the Eurozone is "at stake," he added.
Accordingly, Papadimos forecasts a reduction in the country's budget deficit to "around 9%" of GDP by the end of the year, from 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The Right Rejects the New Government's Measures
On Monday, Antonis Samaras, the right-wing leader, voiced his support for measures already taken to try to get out of the debt crisis, but warned that his party would not support additional austerity measures.
"We will not vote for new measures," he said at a meeting with lawmakers from his New Democracy party.
He expressed his support for deficit and debt reduction and the fight against waste, but also his opposition to any course that impedes economic recovery.
Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner for Economy and Finance, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not unblock the necessary €8,000 million loan without written guarantees from all parties that they would support the planned measures, Antonio Samaras replied that his words were enough and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
Euthanasia and assisted suicide should be legalised, expert committee says
Canadians denied death, Royal Society of Canada report says
As for palliative care, the committee argues that the government, health institutes, and doctors are working together to provide the best palliative care, not including cancer cases.
Canadians are denied death.
Only 9% of Canadians agree to tell their doctor when they want to die and take steps in that direction.
This is one of the findings of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, which involved six experts from a variety of fields, including ethics, law, and medicine.
The Committee suggests that the Government amend the Penal Code to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia when the choice is imposed by circumstances and the patient can be considered competent to make such a decision.
For starters, experts cite a recent study by the Bureau of Economic Analysis that compared the quality of death in 40 countries.
Although Canada ranks 10th, the study notes that "the medicalization of death in Canada has created a culture in which people are afraid to argue about death."
Because of medication or not, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, according to experts appointed by the Royal Society of Canada.
And 68.6% of them end up dying in hospital.
The highest rate in the country is in Quebec, where 86% of deaths occur in hospital.
On the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report reach a conclusion that contradicts the position of the federal government, which has already stated that it does not wish to change anything in the penal code regarding euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Now, according to experts who have also studied the positions of all countries where such practices have been legalized or decriminalized, there is no evidence that decriminalization entails misuse, that is, carrying out assisted euthanasia or assisted suicide on people who are unable or unwilling to make such a decision.
On the contrary, Jocelyn Downey, who presented the report, confirmed during a teleconference that most of these cases occurred in countries where assisted euthanasia and assisted suicide were not legalized.
Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal.
Assisted suicide is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal, explains Jocelyn Downey.
Canadians for Euthanasia
It should be remembered that 85% of Canadians favor euthanasia because, according to a survey by Angus Reid in 2010, they believe that it will allow people to ease their suffering at the end of their lives.
And 66% believe legalizing euthanasia would not signal that the lives of the elderly or disabled are of less value.
As for people who have assisted suicide, 41% of those surveyed believe that they should not be prosecuted.
When it comes to extending or ending care, the situation is less clear-cut, the report's authors say.
They also suggest, among other recommendations, that the penal code should stipulate that a legally lawful termination of medical care is not a crime.
The Committee of Experts also requires that health professionals be trained to respect the rejection of end-of-life care without fear of criminal prosecution.
As for palliative care, the committee calls on the government, health-care institutions, and doctors to work together to develop the best palliative care possible, and not just in cancer cases.
Finally, with respect to palliative or terminal sedation, which is already widely used in Canadian health-care institutions, the committee requires that it be used when it is not intended to dull physical pain, as euthanasia is, and is subject to the same restrictions.
Comments by other experts
Some experts in health-related legislation have already commented on the findings of the Royal Society of Canada's expert report.
Metre Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health legislation, described as "extreme" the position of the experts who signed the report, because, among other things, it does not limit the use of euthanasia to deaths.
This opens the door to a situation where anyone who is tired of life and over the age of 18 can ask for help in committing suicide, says Mr Deschamps, who yesterday discussed a summary of the report.
Mr. Deschamps also emphasized that the authors of the report seem to place the independence of the individual above all other values that make up the social fabric of society.
"There are warning signs and prohibitions in society," he said.
Health law expert Margaret Somerville also "strongly disagrees with the findings of the report, which she called a" manifesto for euthanasia. "
Margaret Somerville, herself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, disputes, in particular, the report's findings of abuse in some countries where assisted euthanasia and suicide are legal, such as the Netherlands and Oregon.
Jordan's king calls on President Assad to cede power
Damascus Condemns the "Conspiracy"
Syria finds itself increasingly isolated
Supporters of Bashar al-Assad demonstrated in front of the foreign ministry yesterday.
Diplomatic pressure intensified yesterday on Syria's Bashar al-Assad, who, with Russian support, is resisting him and condemning the "plot" against his country.
Two days after Syria's suspension from the Arab League, the European Union tightened sanctions on Damascus, and Syria's neighbors Turkey and Jordan have called for President Assad's resignation.
Jordan's King Abdullah II yesterday became the first Arab leader to call on President Bashar al-Assad to cede power in Syria, where some 40 other civilians and members of the regime's armed forces have been killed.
"If the interests of his country were dear to Bashar, he would have to resign, but he would also have to create the necessary conditions for a new phase of political life," the king of Jordan, Syria's neighbor, said in an interview with the BBC.
For his part, Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoğlu expressed regret that Turkey's mediation efforts, which began earlier this year, failed.
Those in the Middle East who do not live in peace with their people and cannot satisfy their aspirations will lose power, he said, alluding to Syria, a neighboring country to which Turkey is taking an increasingly hard line.
For its part, the United States welcomes the "widening consensus against Assad and the Syrian regime's actions" following decisions by the Arab League and the European Union.
The international community, the United States, the European Union, the Arab League and countries like Turkey are taking an increasingly tough line against repression in Syria, said Mark Toner, a State Department spokesman.
Meanwhile, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime's armed forces have been killed in the Dara'a area of southern Syria, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (OSDH).
Two other residents were killed in crossfire and heavy machine gun fire in Jobar in the besieged city of Homs, according to ONG.
During a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Moallem said that the country is approaching the end of the crisis. "
He also reacted strongly to the Arab League's decision to expel Damascus, which he called a "dangerous step."
Syria will not be broken, he added, assuring that this plot against Syria will fail. "
Following its decision to expel Syria, the Arab League is currently studying a "mechanism for the protection of civilians" and is demanding the entry of 500 members of an Arab human rights organization, journalists, and military observers.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé also called for the dispatch of UN observers to help protect civilians from the repression of a regime that he said had descended into "paranoia."
A new emergency meeting of the League is scheduled for tomorrow in Rabat to discuss the implementation of the crisis-resolution plan adopted on 2 November, which includes the withdrawal of military forces from cities where fighting is taking place and the release of arrested demonstrators.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov yesterday called the Arab League's decision "wrong," while China called on Syria to implement a plan to end the crisis, but refrained from supporting possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti demands time from markets and sacrifices from Italians
The future head of Italy's government, Mario Monti, has asked the markets for a little time to assemble his team and implement a program that will require "sacrifices" to restore the creditworthiness lost in the last few months of Berlusconi's rule.
The former European Commissioner yesterday took part in a discussion with political parties ahead of today's meeting with trade unions and employers.
He will have to form a relatively moderate cabinet composed of technocrats outside parliament.
Monti spoke of the importance of a program that involved many sacrifices, said Francesco Nukara, one of the many small parliamentary groups that took part in the discussions after meeting the prime minister candidate.
The Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, said he would wait to see if Mario Monti would ask parliament by Friday for a confidence vote to ensure that the new government has enough support.
The meeting will end with Mr Monti presenting a limited list of a dozen or so ministers to head of state Giorgio Napolitano.
Mr Monti commented on the nervousness of stock markets and bondholders yesterday, asking for time.
In a democracy, "time is needed to prepare the government and the program," he said, adding that he was confident that markets would be patient and understanding.
His appointment as president was initially welcomed by markets, but concerns have resurfaced, particularly after a surprise drop in eurozone industrial production in September.
The prime minister-designate was to form a team that included, most importantly, technocrats, though he stressed that he also wanted to include "politicians."
The new government will have to act until 2013, the date of the next election, he said.
According to the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will receive a vote of confidence in parliament on Friday.
Mr Monti has guaranteed that, once in office, he will work hard to ensure that Italy once again becomes an important player in Europe.
European Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that "despite the new government, our assessment of the Italian economy has not changed."
The European Union, convinced that Rome would not meet its 2013 budget target despite the austerity plan adopted in recent months, demanded, among other things, new austerity measures.
Italian "boss of bosses" Emma Marcegaglia, who will meet him on Tuesday, also insisted on the need to restart the economy "because a country that has no growth cannot meet the deficit targets."
Mr Monti, known for his competence and independence during his time as European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents an "era change" for Italy after 17 years of "Berlusconism," a "professor" symbolising a "challenge of seriousness" and a "different Italy," according to the editorialists.
The great unknown is the longevity of his team.
President Napolitano would be happy to avoid an early election, because Italy must repay €200,000 in public debt by April 2012.
Russian scientist helped Iran's nuclear program
Russian scientist Vyacheslav Danilenko helped Iran develop a detonator suitable for use in nuclear weapons, a US agency specializing in nuclear dangers confirmed on Monday.
The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) is relying on a recent report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other UN agency documents to identify the scientist.
Last week, the IAEA expressed concern about the "possible military dimension" of Iran's nuclear program
According to ISIS, which relies heavily on IAEA documents, Mr. Danilenko was born in 1934, worked for 30 years, "beginning in the 1960s, at the Soviet military nuclear center in Chelyabinsk (Ural), and was involved in the production of synthetic diamonds."
In 1989 or 1991, he left the center to set up a company producing "nanodiamonds" in Kyiv.
His company's financial difficulties led him to contact the Iranian embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He then collaborated with the Iranian program from 1996 to 2002, before returning to Russia
In its report, the IAEA mentions "clear indications that Iran's development" of a nuclear detonator system "was facilitated by the work of a foreign expert who not only knew the technology well, but who also told the agency that he had worked most of his career on this technology as part of his home country's military nuclear program."
Anti-Muslim crime up 50%
According to FBI statistics released on Monday, anti-Muslim crimes increased by nearly 50% between 2009 and 2010, while other forms of racially and religiously motivated violence have declined or stagnated over the same period.
According to these figures, the total number of cases of violence against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, an increase of 49%, compared to a 13% increase in cases of violence against Catholics, a 4% decrease in attacks against Jews, and a 14% overall increase in religiously motivated crimes.
The total number of hate crimes, according to the FBI, increased only slightly to 6,628, of which 47.3% were motivated by racial differences and 20% by religious differences.
After declining in 2009, it is worrying that the number of these crimes is again on the rise, Human Rights First emphasizes, "the increase in violence against Muslims is particularly significant," the organization added in an official statement.
"Human Rights First has long emphasized that acts of violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, must be treated as serious violations of human rights," added one of the organisation's leaders, Paul Legendre.
"The US government can and should do more to tackle these crimes," he adds, believing that this can be done by improving police reporting of hate crimes.
"Hate crimes" in federal law are a legacy of the civil rights era.
This law was enacted in the wake of Martin Luther King's death to punish acts of violence related to race, color, religion, nationality, and, nowadays, sexual orientation.
Twitter is changing its platform and becoming like Facebook
On Monday, the microblogging site Twitter made changes to the presentation of its platform, which will allow its users, in particular, to see the activity of those they follow, making the service similar to Facebook.
The new "activities" tab and other "names" allow you to track more easily and directly the activities of other "twitters," Internet users whose posts ("tweets") you track, and those who track yours.
This makes it possible to know if they post messages, if they sign up for new accounts, if they have favorites, etc.
This new Twitter formula was tested "on a small percentage of users in August" before being made widely available across the network on Monday, Twitter spokeswoman Carolyn Penner told AFP.
Twitter, which has long been known as intuitively rather incomprehensible and as using rather vague terms (RT to re-post someone else's post, # followfriday to recommend tracking other users), mostly bringing pleasure to experienced users, is opening itself up in this way to a wider audience, introducing users to something closer to the popular social networks Facebook and Google +.
On the net, users discussed this innovation through "tweets" on the Internet.

Austria
Introducing the "golden rule" of the budget into the constitution
The leadership of Austria's grand coalition of Social Democrats and Christian Democrats decided on Tuesday to write a fiscal "golden rule" into the constitution in order to reduce the budget deficit and thus avoid a possible downgrade of Austria's triple-A sovereign credit rating by rating agencies.
Social Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann personally announced the decision at the end of a meeting of the Council of Ministers, given that Austria's public debt stands at 74.6%, well above the upper limit of 60% set by the Maastricht Treaty, but below the public debt of countries such as Italy, Greece, or Spain.
If Austria's solvency fell by just one point, from AAA to AA +, we would have to pay interest of three thousand million euros more each year, argued Christian Democratic Vice Chancellor and Foreign Minister Michael Spindelegger.
Thus, Austria complies with the demand of the eurozone summit in Brussels on October 26; heads of state and government have demanded a reduction in budget deficits by the end of 2012 and a return to balanced public accounts through a constitution or equivalent law.
The regulation adopted by the Austrian government resembles the "German model," as Germany was the first European country to adopt this "rule."
Until 2017, the structural deficit of the state budget must be reduced by 0.75% of the gross domestic product (GDP) each year, and from 2017 the structural deficit of the federal state budget must not exceed 0.35% of GDP in any year, and the Länder, like the communes, must present balanced budgets.
The goal is to bring public debt below the Maastricht Treaty's 60% mark by 2020 / 2021.
Yoshihiko Noda
threatens new intervention in the foreign exchange market
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned Tuesday that Japanese authorities would intervene further in the currency market if the value of the yen continued to rise.
We will intervene, as we did last time, if we deem the yen's exchange rate to be excessively volatile, Mr. Noda explained to the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen rose to near the historic level that prompted Japanese authorities to intervene on October 31.
On that day, Tokyo sold the yen for dollars on a large scale to lower the value of the Japanese currency, which has set a new strength record since 1945.
But the yen has risen steadily since then, driven by purchases by investors who perceive it as a "safe haven" in these tumultuous times of falling economies around the world and Europe's debt crisis.
On Tuesday, the dollar fell below 77 yen, and the euro fell below the symbolic benchmark of 105 yen, close to the level that triggered the latest intervention.
On the eve of the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was worth about 120 yen, and the euro more than 160 yen.
Japan's currency appreciation hurts Japanese exports by making Japanese products more expensive and reducing the amount of income Japanese firms receive from abroad when converting to the domestic currency.
"Japan is struggling to rebuild itself" after the March 11 earthquake and tsunami that devastated the Tohoku region (northeast), said Mr Noda, who fears that the yen's rise will kill the fragile embryo of recovery.
The world's third-largest economy resumed growth in the third quarter - 1.5% quarter-on-quarter - for the first time in a year, thanks to growth in exports and consumption by households hit by the disaster
But the prime minister feels that the yen's high price does not reflect "Japan's fundamental economic performance."
Finance Minister Jun Azumi called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which on Tuesday opened a two-day meeting of its monetary policy board, to take all necessary steps to weaken the yen.
But the institution's deputy governor, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the Bank of Japan had already taken "appropriate steps," signaling that no further easing was expected on Wednesday.
At its last meeting at the end of October, the issuer increased its purchases of Treasury bonds by ¥5,000 million (€47,000 million), raising to ¥55,000 million (€519,000) the ceiling on the amounts it allocates to the purchase of various financial instruments to saturate the securities market.
The Eurozone
Rates rise, stock markets wobble
The risk of contagion from the debt crisis undermines European indices.
Despite the appointment of new heads of state in Greece and Italy, and improved growth performance in France and Germany, rates in fragile countries continue to rise
Still concerned about the stability of the eurozone, European markets moved a little further into negative territory this Tuesday, November 15.
In Paris, the CAC 40 lost 1.4% at 10 a.m. and ended trading at 3,064 points.
Frankfurt's DAX fell 0.4% and London's DAX fell 0.1%.
Stock markets around the world continue to lose some of their recent gains, owing to new difficulties in repaying loans by struggling eurozone countries.
"Worried investors are just too worried about the risk of contagion," explains Terry Pratt, an institutional broker at IG Markets, quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange closed down 0.7%, weighed down by fresh doubts among market participants about Europe's ability to contain the debt crisis.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has its eyes on Europe, and exchanges will follow each other in a corridor of narrow change until investors have confirmation that the situation has stabilized," says Mitsushige Aquino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This renewed anxiety about the future of the eurozone is hitting the single currency, which continued to fall on Tuesday.
The euro reached its lowest point in a month and a half.
By 10 a.m., the European currency was worth $1.3570, down 0.4%.
Brokers said it fell after Chancellor Angela Merkel's CDU party congress on Monday adopted a resolution that included the possibility for a troubled country to leave the eurozone without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates well above 6%
Loan rates in Italy and Spain remain at alarming levels.
Yields on Italian 10-year bonds reached 6.85% this morning, while those on Spanish bonds with the same maturity reached 6.2%.
These interest-rate complexities in the southern countries, but also in France, continue to fuel participants "fears.
The head of Italy's future government, Mario Monti, has asked stock markets for time to recover from Italy's debt-ridden paralysis.
Greece's new prime minister, Lucas Papadimos, has confirmed that implementing the decisions taken at the eurozone summit on October 27 will be his government's "main task."
Spain has come under fire from markets ahead of parliamentary elections on Sunday.
The spread between interest rates on 10-year German and Spanish debt has reached a new historic high.
Waiting for Eurozone Growth Figures
France recorded economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, slightly better than the 0.3% expected, thanks to increased household consumption.
Insee, however, revised downward the second-quarter figures, with a drop of 0.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
And economists are most worried about the fourth quarter.
Germany, for its part, recorded 0.5% growth over the same period.
The first assessment for the entire eurozone is expected at 11am, with the European Commission warning of the danger of another recession.
Energy Policy:
Facts must prevail over dogma
If there is one issue that cannot be decided after a short discussion or emotion, it is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly affects the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It is a healthy trend that election gatherings become an occasion to reflect on the share and place occupied by nuclear power.
The dispute will not bear fruit until all the economic, social, and environmental implications of the proposed options have been examined.
France must base its opinion on objective facts and rational data.
There are now 7,000 million of us on the planet, and demographic development will mean doubling the need for electricity by 2050, unless a huge part of the world's population is deprived of vital elements.
During the same period, it will become necessary to fill the growing fossil-resource gap in order to continue to generate electricity continuously, while bearing in mind the crucial need to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions in order to combat climate imbalances - a topic that has disappeared from the environmental debate.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these factors.
That is why Germany remains alone in its decision to abandon nuclear power.
This is not the case of Belgium, which makes its decision conditional on the need to find a source that can replace nuclear power, or Switzerland, which intends to build only the most advanced reactors.
On the other hand, the United Kingdom, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, and Brazil are just a few of those resolutely pursuing their projects.
The United States decided to add one plant to its kit after Fukushima, resuming construction of the plant, which was halted after the Three Mile Island accident.
Although Germany's renewable-energy model is sometimes cited as an example, reality contradicts this argument.
Berlin's choice will result in higher electricity costs, increased energy dependency, exacerbated by increased demand for imported gas, particularly from Russia, and a jump in carbon dioxide emissions due to the construction of gas and coal plants.
In a few months, all these unpleasant effects will be palpable.
The example of Denmark should be considered.
Europe's champion in building turbines, from which it derives 30% of its electricity, is also the largest consumer of coal and gas, owing to intermittent wind, which causes carbon dioxide emissions and electricity prices to be 65% and 50% higher, respectively, than the European average.
On the other hand, thanks to the consistency of our energy policy, our neighbors pay 40% more for electricity than French households.
Because, in a globalized economy, the price of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and the maintenance of industrial equipment in the national territory, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
As a consequence, any meaningful reduction in nuclear power would lead to a large increase in the cost of electricity, which would render illusory the lofty claims of re-industrializing our country and protecting purchasing power.
A price that most French refuse to pay, all the more so because they do not object to this type of energy in principle.
It should be remembered that the country's energy policy made it possible to create an industry of 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 indirect jobs.
Strong export-oriented, it attracts a host of internationally specialized small and medium-sized enterprises and creates many jobs that cannot be relocated to another industry.
If France decided to give up nuclear power, it would have to sacrifice a large number of these facilities and lose €6,000 million a year from French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
Which electrical engineer would order an EPR designed to work for sixty years if its manufacturer were to be shut down?
To solve the energy equation, it must be recognized that there are no divine or diabolical sources of energy production.
Areva's development of low-carbon, nuclear, and renewable solutions demonstrates the complementarity of energy sources.
Maintaining the highest level of safety is undoubtedly a vital issue for nuclear power.
In France, we have a security authority that exercises uncompromising and transparent control over existing energy centres such as Flamanville.
Our teams, whose professionalism is widely recognized, are full of the same security obsession.
Over the course of 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious incidents.
Only one, Three Mile Island, occurred under normal operating conditions, but with no human or environmental impact.
In Chernobyl, reactor design and inexcusable human error led to tragedy.
In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that the accident was the result of two natural disasters of unprecedented magnitude, causing tens of thousands of deaths.
The nuclear industry will learn from this accident, as it has learned from the previous two.
The fruit of this step and the cooperation between security agencies, operators, and French and German designers, EPR, is a project to counter such phenomena.
Since it is being considered by all energy experts who want to build a reactor, halting its construction in Flamanville would be a great gift to rivals Areva and EDF, clearing the way for them to take the lead in the inevitable development of nuclear power.
It is necessary and legitimate to seek the best mix of energy sources for our country, but it would be irresponsible to allow emotions, dogmas, and partisan maneuvers to prevail in a debate that is so important to our country's economic, social, and financial situation.
Is Immigration a Burden or a Good for the Economy?
Nicolas Sarkozy's immigration policy has been criticized from a variety of angles - overburdened police, judicial, and administrative services subordinated to the politics of numbers, and its compatibility with France's self-proclaimed status as a "human rights state."
Then there was the administrative harassment of foreign students, which hit the news when the Minister of the Interior (Liberation, May 23) declared that France "does not need foreign talent, masons, and waiters."
But it is rarely analysed from an economic perspective.
The right and the left agree on much of this.
On the right, the tone was set by Jacques Chirac, who declared in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed people will not be a problem in a country with 2 million foreign workers," and on the left by Michel Rocard, who explained in 1990 that France "cannot accept the poor from all over the world."
The difference is only in the level of generosity
In 2005, fear of invasion by a horde of Polish plumbers was felt by both left and right.
Both sides see immigration as a burden on the French economy and on French society.
The only difference is the level of generosity they will be willing to give to immigrants.
In his program, François Hollande limited himself to platitudes, saying that "working together will solve our immigration problem."
This perception of immigration as a burden and a problem may offer an electoral advantage, but it is costly economically.
As the economists Ian Goldin and Jeffrey Cameron remind us in a recent book summarizing the latest data on immigration (Special People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Shaped Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pages), there is a broad consensus among experts about the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth, wages, and employment in immigrant-receiving countries.
Restricting immigration weakens growth and reduces employment.
Fears about the impact of immigrants are based on the notion that they can replace local workers, especially low-skilled ones, by driving down wages.
But experience shows that, in reality, immigrants complement rather than replace local labor by doing jobs for which local labor is scarce.
Unskilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract local labor, and the most skilled work in dynamic sectors where training is not linked to job offers.
Positive effect on wages
Just as it would be difficult for a surgeon to work in a country where there is a shortage of anesthesiologists, the complementarity between natives and immigrants means that the arrival of immigrants has a positive impact on the wages of local workers.
Giovanni Peri estimates that a 1% increase in migration leads to a 0.6-0.9% increase in real long-term wages.
This does not take into account the fact that the diversity brought about by immigrants contributes to new ideas and economic growth (US Nobel laureates include a large proportion of naturalized immigrants, and Google, Intel, Paypal, and Yahoo were all founded by immigrants).
Migrants also contribute net income to social security systems, accounting for an average of 1% of European countries "total budgets.
In Germany, for example, the World Labour Organization estimates that an immigrant who arrives at the age of 30 will generate a net profit (income minus costs) of 150,000 euros on average for the state budget over his or her lifetime.
Nicolas Sarkozy, at the beginning of his mandate, was about to pick up the slack.
These teeth, which were used to scare off immigrants, had exactly the opposite effect.
Europe invented democracy, it remains to make sense of European democracy
Democracy is a valuable asset; but it is also fragile.
The European continent should remember that, having invented it in Athens more than two thousand years ago, in the twentieth century it experienced the tragedies of World War I, totalitarian regimes, the Holocaust, the Gulag, as well as Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, and colonels in Greece.
Some thought that for democracy to finally triumph over its enemies, it was enough to organize a vote and make it as direct as possible.
Since Napoleon's Maly, it has been known that this stems from superficial thinking.
Universal suffrage, while a sine qua non of democracy, is not a sufficient condition, and may even become an "instrument of suppression," as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vachereau once put it.
No, democracy requires much more - public space, public spirit, values, organization, separation and control of power, education, Enlightenment, economic and social solidarity, and justice.
The European crisis we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but first and foremost it is a political crisis and a crisis of democracy.
In this respect, the palinosis of a truthfully false Greek referendum will have a double-edged sword, demonstrating both the need for a major policy change and the unpalatable sense of its impossibility and incoherence.
This ambivalence needs to be understood to overcome it.
The truth is that the front line of the struggle for democracy has now shifted, and many believe that Republican soldiers are now taking aim in the wrong direction.
We will gain nothing by demanding a series of national referenda, organized as necessary and in a chaotic manner.
A blank card for an absolute European monarch, or a leap with bound feet into the abyss of nationalism - what a choice for a citizen!
No, what we are dreaming of is not the guillotine blade, but the exercise - joint, clear, and continuous - of choice and democracy, this time at the pan-European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal, and it is not known how many more, because there is only one crisis - Europe's crisis.
All of Europe is subservient to the dictates of markets and rating agencies, suffering from weakness and a lack of solidarity.
All of Europe is humiliated on the international stage.
Many worry about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe, but all of Europe is gradually losing its sovereignty, and with it each of its nations.
There is an urgent need to return the management of the European project to popular sovereignty.
Because only by working together can Europeans reduce everyone's debt burden, free themselves from markets, and prepare for the future by investing in it.
Resolving the crisis will require solutions at the pan-European level, which cannot be adopted without full democratic legitimacy without leading us to disaster.
After much discussion, the Socialists and Jacques Delors are now demanding a European economic government.
Let it be.
But to imagine it without the stronger economic, political, and democratic integration that has come into being is another folly and a new impasse.
We must begin a new phase of European construction.
In order to establish a republic in France, it was necessary to "create" Republicans.
A revolution of interests would not be enough.
That lesson remains valid.
We must build a Europe that is united economically.
This can be done only by creating a more democratic Europe at the political level, genuine popular European sovereignty.
To create Europe, let us create Europeans.
Contactless chip cards are proliferating.
The World Chip Card Exhibition opens on Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, in an atmosphere of optimism.
Indeed, 2011 will end with an 11% increase in global sales of microprocessors (bank cards, phones with SIM cards), exceeding 6,000 million units, according to Eurosmart.
Most important is the contactless sector, which allows you to pay for public transport or shopping simply by holding a card over a reader.
This year, 460 million contactless chip cards will be sold worldwide, compared to 320 million the year before!
Their share will grow in 2012 (580 million units are expected) to account for almost 10% of the global chip card market (6.925 million cards).
Europe, which has long lagged behind the Asia-Pacific region, is now moving forward with contactless payments.
Some 26 million Visa cards already have this feature and 75,000 terminals accept them.
France is starting from a more modest position, with 400,000 contactless Visa cards in circulation.
But big stores are ramping up the pace.
This year, Carrefour issued 2.5 million contactless MasterCard Passes.
To move to faster speeds, banks need to equip their customers.
"Two large organizations in France have promised to systematically distribute contactless cards to their customers in the future," said Gérard Nebouy, CEO of Visa Europe France.
Banks are testing mobile phone payments.
But this is only the first stage of the development of the future means of payment, that is, the mobile phone.
So far, only a few machines are equipped with the NFC (Near Field Communication) technology needed to carry out such transactions.
'They've been put on hold.
'But they've got to really flatten out next year. '
"We expect global sales of 80 to 120 million units in 2012," explains Marc Bertin, head of Eurosmart.
But the banks are moving ahead.
Yesterday, Crédit Agricole announced an experiment from December to June next year in Cana.
The iPhones of about 200 customers and employees will be fitted with contactless payment cases.
The BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And Société Générale also said yesterday that it was preparing to launch a proposal allowing its customers to pay via mobile phones.
Terrorist front spreads from Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the Islamic Maghreb's links to Boko Haram.
Long-suspected links between the terrorist group Al Qaeda in the Muslim Maghreb (Aqmi) and Nigeria's Boko Haram sect have been confirmed.
On Sunday, Algerian Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel even said that Algerians were now confident.
"The way these two organizations operate and the intelligence reports show that they are actively cooperating," he explained, without going into detail.
Paris seems to have reached similar conclusions.
An investigation into the kidnapping of two French men in Niger in January revealed two links.
Abducted from a restaurant in Niamey by people close to Akmi, Antoine de Léocourt and Vincent Delory were apparently killed the next day, along with several of their captors, in an operation carried out by French special forces.
Among the remains of the operation, French and Niger investigators found several telephone sim cards belonging to the terrorists.
Axis of Terror
Analysis of the calls identified several interlocutors in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), investigators are particularly interested in two numbers; one points to a Niger man who has long lived in Maidiguri, a town in northern Nigeria, the cradle of Boko Haram, and the other to a man said to be close to Akmi and the sect.
"This is a step forward, but we certainly need to wait for more reliable evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram."
"But it is possible."
"It has been known for years that the sect receives financial and ideological support from outside, and that it is becoming more and more active," said Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, this support has become increasingly evident in Boko Haram's actions and claims, and in its methods, which now include the use of suicide bombers and increasingly sophisticated explosive devices of the same type as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, led by Washington, is now pressing Abuja to address the challenges posed by Boko Haram.
The fact is that the Nigerian authorities have traditionally regarded this group as a community of enlightened people of no interest.
Quick Success
Founded in 2002 in Maidiguri by the mosque, school, and fundamentalist imam Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram - which means "Western education is sin" in Hausa - preaches the establishment of an Islamic emirate in Nigeria's Muslim north.
In this poor region, the organization has achieved rapid success.
It is politicized and demands strict observance of Sharia law, and its activists have launched a struggle against an unholy central government.
It mainly targets churches, bars, and governments.
In 2009, Boko Haram militants were particularly active, carrying out numerous attacks on police stations.
Abuja's response, as usual, is uncompromising.
The army besieged the city and left 800 dead.
Mohammed Yusuf, taken alive, was killed in prison.
Now the sect is radicalizing and will move beyond its northern fiefdoms.
Last Christmas, it claimed responsibility for an attack that killed 80 people in Jos, and then another in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram staged the first suicide attack on a fortified police headquarters in Abuja.
In August, a local United Nations office will be their first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which runs from Mauritania through Nigeria to Somalia, now worries all security experts.
Today, with Aqmi entrenched in Mali and Niger, and Somalis from al-Shabaab operating in Kenya, Boko Haram poses a new threat to the continent.
Last week, in a conversation with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé warned of the dangers of Boko Haram and expressed his willingness to share all available information.
The World as the Republican Presidential Candidates See It
On China, Iran, and aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry compete in simplistic and incompetent terms.
Can a crisis-weakened America lead a complex world with simple, or rather simplistic, ideas?
If you listen to the Republican presidential candidates, voters might believe it.
For days now, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry, and others have been making loud but vague statements on foreign policy, which has traditionally been a Republican strength.
Slogans about China, Iran, and aid to Israel are often mixed up.
Mitt Romney, who has the best chance of winning the Good Old Party nomination, has threatened to take the Chinese to the WTO and accuse them of "manipulating their currency - a sensitive topic for an America exasperated by the migration of entire industries to Asia.
Worse, it would lead to a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, Obama's former ambassador to China and the only candidate with a grasp of complex foreign policy, has failed to overcome a position that panders to emotions.
He called for a firm but constructive dialogue with Beijing (Obama's current position).
But Huntsman, who remains at the bottom of the polls, went unheard.
Reagan-style
Romney has also promised military strikes on Iran if sanctions fail to stop its nuclear program.
"If I am elected, I will stop Iran," he declared.
"If Obama is re-elected, they will have a bomb."
He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing to deliver on his promises to that partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second-highest-ranked candidate, showed a disheartening lack of knowledge.
He recently called for confronting the Chinese military threat because Beijing is trying to achieve nuclear power - apparently unaware that China has already possessed it since 1964!
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants military strikes against Iran, says he is willing to use the US army in Mexico against the drug cartels.
Kaine, Perry, and candidate Michele Bachmann also recommend torture of terrorism suspects, which Obama banned in 2009.
All of this is a far cry from 2008 Republican candidate John McCain, a foreign-policy heavyweight.
Opponents of the current president respond that Reagan had simple ideas, too, and that he won the Cold War.
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur, and that he had to tone down his anti-terror stance.
They rightly insist on the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, on the premature withdrawal of the "boys" from Iraq, and on his ploys in Libya that have earned him a reputation as a weak politician.
But the offensive is not so easy.
People view as positive the national security balance under Obama, who eliminated Bin Laden.
After Iraq, it does not believe in military interventions that get bogged down in sand.
And, in arguing that America needs to rebuild economically to revive its leadership, Obama is right.
Nord Stream, the new gateway to Russian gas into Europe.
The Nord Stream gas pipeline, which connects Western Europe and Russia directly under the Baltic Sea, has been launched.
It is designed to supply the gas equivalent to 30 million households.
Gazprom, Russia's giant gas producer, wanted to celebrate with pomp.
More than 500 guests, including four heads of state and government, took part last Tuesday on the shores of the Baltic, between the orchestra's performance and gourmet snacks, in the opening of Nord Stream, a new gas pipeline that directly connects Russia and Germany underwater.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon, and his Dutch counterpart, March Rutte, have together turned the symbolic valve that controls the flow of Russian gas into the Western European grid.
The new pipeline will bring 27.5 million additional cubic meters of gas to Western Europe every year via the first 1,224-kilometre pipeline connecting Leningrad Oblast with the state of Mecklenburg-Pomerania.
The second pipeline should be ready by the end of 2012, delivering a total of 55,000 million cubic metres of gas, equivalent to France's entire consumption.
And the possibility of building a third pipeline in the same direction is already being discussed.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this huge project is a victory.
The project met fierce resistance from Poland and the Baltic states.
Nord Stream will indeed allow gas to be delivered directly to Germany, avoiding passage through a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
These two countries will lose some of their power: they will find it more difficult to influence Russia by threatening to close access to Western European markets.
At the most tense moment of the debate, Warsaw did not hesitate to compare North Stream to the new "German-Soviet Pact," hinting at an alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
This means that the issue is politically sensitive.
By supporting this Russian project, Western Europe is seeking greater security of supply.
But at the cost of depriving Europe of energy, because the project created a gap between eastern and western Europe.
Russia has managed in less than five years to achieve its understanding of a direct alliance between Russia and rich Western countries that consume large amounts of gas and whose own reserves are running out.
"This pipeline is part of the cooperation with Russia, it is a new artery that organically connects us," François Fillon argued as he opened the pipeline, demonstrating how big gas contracts matter both politically and economically.
All of this explains the broad smiles on the faces of Gazprom executives who were present in large numbers in Lubmin, the gas arrival point.
Construction of this pipeline is also a technical feat.
An underwater pipeline is made of steel encased in concrete to protect it from ship anchors.
It lies at the bottom of the sea, at an average depth of 200 metres.
To build it, one had to circumvent the minefields left over from the Second World War.
"One hundred had to be removed or destroyed as a precaution," said Jens Mueller, a spokesman for Nord Stream.
Many steps were also needed to protect fauna and flora.
The pipeline is a long metal snake with a weight equal to 242 Eiffel Towers, without ruptures along its entire length, no valves, and no service stations.
A control platform was planned in the Swedish region, but the project managers abandoned it because Sweden was not happy that a Russian state-owned company would permanently settle on its shores.
"In the event of an accident, we will cut off the flow of gas in less than a minute," says Jens Müller.
This means that in the event of a leak, the gas contained in the gas pipeline will escape into the air.
But that seems unlikely to the designers, who designed seams designed to leak only once every 100,000 years.
Control over the state of the pipeline will be carried out by an underwater robot that pulls the ship for external monitoring, as well as by a device circulating inside the pipeline.
The cigar-shaped apparatus is inserted into a 1-metre diameter pipeline and pushed forward by the flow of gas.
Arriving after 3 full days of traveling at 3 meters per second, it gives accurate information about any deformation of the metal.
The gas pipeline was designed to run for 50 years without the need for repairs.
Gas circulation is achieved only by means of gas pressure.
It is 200 bar at departure and 100 bar at arrival.
Five companies joined forces to carry out the project.
Gazprom, which holds 51% of the capital, remains the leader.
The rest are Germany's E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), the Netherlands "Gasunie and France's GDF Suez Group (9% each).
The five companies formed a joint venture called Nord Stream, which was tasked with building and operating the gas pipeline.
Its headquarters are in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favorable.
Gazprom then leased the entire volume of gas transportation to the company for twenty years, with the possibility of an extension.
"Gazprom will pay for the full volume, regardless of how much gas will actually be transported," says Jens Müller.
Financing for the construction of the pipeline was provided by 30% of shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
The total cost of the works will amount to 7.4 thousand euros for the two pipelines.
GDF Suez will invest about $240 million.
But minority shareholders are confident that they will recoup their costs, because Gazprom assumes all the risks.
The gas pipeline runs from the Baltic Sea in Lubmin to the sandy shore planted with coniferous trees.
Valves 4.5 meters high form the gas outlet terminal.
The sensors measure the pressure, temperature and specific characteristics of the gas before pumping it into German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, the terminal has been receiving one million cubic meters of gas every hour.
At full capacity it will be 3 million per hour, and in 2012 it will be 6 million.
Moleskine brand notepad
Moleskine, created by an Italian company fifteen years ago, will bring back a taste for writing.
He has the scent of adventure, the hours spent writing by candlelit light.
Moleskine notepad is easily recognized by rectangular black cover, by rubber, by yellowish-white pages, as if yellowed with time.
But the Moleskine notebook, as we know it today, was born in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decided to launch a sale of designer notebooks.
Maria Sebregondi, the company's consultant at the time, took responsibility for launching the new product.
The notepad is inspired by an old manufacturing technique, moleskin - a lacquered cotton cloth used, for example, to cover benches.
This type of notepad is said to be highly appreciated by writers and travelers.
"Moleskine brought to today's taste an old and forgotten thing that was iconic for avant-garde artists until the twentieth century," said Maria Sebregondi, who has since become a brand manager at Modo Modo.
Success came.
From 2006 to 2010, sales grew by 25% to 12.7 million units.
We are a long way from the early years, when only 3,000 notebooks were produced.
Moleskine has crossed Italy's borders and is exported to 70 countries, from France to the US.
Establishing a profile of a typical buyer is difficult, because a notepad attracts a businessman, a student, and a freelance professional alike.
Moleskine's buyers are cosmopolitan, wide-eyed, and educated.
The small Italian company, which initially had only 12 employees, now has 100 and two offices, one in Milan and the other in New York.
It distributes its notebooks in Fnac bookstores, in small town centers, and has managed to become well-known.
"We followed the spirit of the time and this new need for writing, despite the advent of e-mail," explains Maria Sebregondi.
This distinctive cultural feature accompanies the development of Moleskine; the brand recently organized an exhibition called "The Circular Way," where architects and artists demonstrated their own notebooks.
In August, he also launched leopard-print covers for the Locarno Film Festival.
Taking advantage of its success and cultural aura, Moleskine has diversified its products, which now include bags, pens, computer bags. The brand includes all kinds of support.
Success that gave rise to envy: in the fall of 2006, Modo Modo was bought by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, now Syntegra Capital, which wrote a new page in Moleskine's history.
Why is the rate of unemployment among disabled workers so high?
Approximately 19% of people with disabilities are looking for work.
The 15th week of disability employment begins today.
Despite the policy of public charity launched in 2005, the unemployment rate among the disabled is still twice as high as the average, at 19% as against 9% for the population as a whole.
Disappointing?
"No," said Eric Blanchet, CEO of Adapt, an organization that organizes Disability Employment Week.
"Significant progress has been made in 15 years."
"At that time, the unemployment rate was not 2 times, but 3 times higher."
"But there is still a lot of work to be done."
It must be said that there are still many obstacles to employment for a disabled person.
Among them there are more elderly people: 37% are older than 50 (17% on average).
Rather, they have low qualifications: 80% do not have a bachelor's degree, and of the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is very common, at 85% for the disabled, compared to 38% on average.
In short, these are all criteria that make it very difficult to return to work and that are at the heart of the problem, "according to Christian Grapen, CEO of Tremplin, an association created in 1992 to help companies hire disabled workers.
Here are some of the obstacles.
Needless to say, the mentality is changing, but too slowly.
A study commissioned by Cité by IMS-Entreprendre in April found that the managers interviewed had a low level of knowledge about disability and "imagined people in wheelchairs or mentally or intellectually disabled."
The result is that private companies with more than 20 employees are still far from the goal of having 6% of employees with disabilities set out in a law enacted in 1987.
The last known figure, dating back to 2008, is 2.6%.
"Today we are about 3% down," says Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiph, the organisation responsible for collecting tax from companies that do not comply with the law.
Evidence: the number of "taxable" organizations, as well as the amounts paid, fell between 2007 and 2011 from 59,000 to 46,000 organizations (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 law that raised the tax created a lot of pressure on companies," explains Pierre Blanc. "
"But this improvement also reflects an increase in awareness, particularly in large enterprises."
According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59% of organizations with 20 to 49 employees have workers with disabilities, compared to 82% of organizations with 100 to 199 employees.
Azar: "What Happiness"
Ahead of their clash with the Blues on Tuesday night (8.45pm), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens made no secret of the pleasure they derived from this friendly match.
We will not go so far as to claim that there was collusion between them, but the picture is symbolic.
Sitting next to each other in the stands of the Stade de France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard reconciled.
Five months on from his striker's antics against Turkey, the Belgian coach can only praise him.
'I'm very happy with Eden, his progress and the fact he's Belgian. '
"I want to go further," the Lille player insists.
As for the contrast between his achievements at club and national team, it's one thing, 'he said.
"I am in Lille all year round, but I am not in Belgium."
"I have to earn points."
Left out in the build-up to this match against France, in the game against Romania on Friday night, Azhar arrived in Saint-Denis to finally shine.
Not forgetting, however, the concept of "pleasure."
He has supported the Blues since the age of seven and the victorious campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
"I have always supported them," he confirms.
This, of course, also adds to the special nature of this match.
Especially with Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) on the other side, "he recalls.
"Our roads just crossed."
"To be able to play against them is pure happiness!"
Leekens recalled good-naturedly about "pride."
"Proud" to play in a "celebratory match."
"Pride" also claimed as a "neighbour" that France had "become a very high-level team again" just a year after the injury in Naisna.
"Laurent Blanc was like a bolt of thunder," he enthuses.
Now that Belgium will miss the next Euro, the technical athlete will fly in the same plane as the Blues' management... to Brazil in 2014.
"Our little Belgians are growing up," he said.
'We're building something, the players are ambitious, they're hungry. '
'You'll see that in future matches, including this one against France. '
Portugal are very confident
Portugal's Paulo Bento starts his return match against Bosnia (10 p.m.) this Tuesday in Lisbon with great optimism.
Along the way, both teams seemed to lose their sense of reality.
'By the end of those 90 minutes, we'll be a happy team and, most importantly, a happy country. '
Paulo Bento already sees himself in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no doubt that the national team, at the helm of which he has been since September 2010, qualified for Euro 2012.
Portugal are just 90 minutes away from happiness.
But there is a match to play and Bosnia to win.
Given the 0-0 draw at Zenica on Friday, it is clear that the game is not over.
Although Portugal dominated the match for more than an hour, it failed to achieve the cherished goal that would have reassured them.
"This is a good result, but it carries risks."
But at home, in their brightly lit De la Luz stadium in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they will take place in front of a crowd that should be ecstatic, although the match will be very intense, "said an optimistic but prudent Bento.
"We expect a very tight match, but we are confident we can win," said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have a 50% chance of being at Euro 2012," said successor Carlos Queiroz.
Friday's draw against Bosnia requires the Portuguese to win.
A draw might suit the Bosnians.
"This is a good result, but there is some risk," Bentu said.
"We will play against a team that has a lot of technical qualities and whose players have a lot of individual qualities," he added.
As was the case in Zenica, the Portuguese are going to put maximum pressure on the Bosnians from the start, "not to give them time to think."
A good idea, if only this time it turns out to be realistic.
