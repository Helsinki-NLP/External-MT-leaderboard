Munich 1856: Four maps that will change your view of the city
This is a place where today’s young people are going to meet.
A tomb chapel where the S-Bahn tunnel is now being excavated.
Small gardens are managing the former cause of farmers.
The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories to date.
It’s annoying when maps are not up-to-date.
This is known to anyone who had to get upset because the car-navi indicated a green lawn instead of a circumference road.
The historical maps of the digital Bavarian Atlas, an offer of the Bavarian Geoportal of the state government, are all other than current - but precisely for this reason very informative.
Especially if you compare them with current online maps.
Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities in the Munich Mercury area have changed since the 19th century.
The digital Bayern Atlas is a flick carpet that is not recognized as such.
For cities and municipalities, more detailed maps, so-called old position sheets, were incorporated into the large overview map.
These were created between 1810 and 1864, according to the Bavarian measurement administration, and originate from the first Bavarian measurement.
The author is Napoleon.
The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied land and ordered a topographic recording of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.
Although the French troops eventually withdrew with the Peace of Lunéville of 9 February 1801, it was the neighbors of today who created the idea of a comprehensive Bavarian map.
Courtyard Max IV Joseph further advanced the project, establishing the "Topographical Bureau" - and thus the Bavarian Survey Administration.
The Urpositionsblatt for Munich dates back to 1856 and can be found on the website of the Bavarian Landesbibliothek.
The comparison between the past and the present is the most impressive in the example of the state capital.
The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.
An example of this is Untersendling, which still appears relatively isolated on the map of 1856.
Sendling was incorporated into the Munich district 21 years after the map was created, i.e. in 1877.
Today it is located in the middle of the city.
The houses of Untersendling are concentrated around 1856 along the present-day Plinganserstraße, named only in 1878 after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the Bavarian peasant uprising against Austria in 1705.
Where the West Park is today, you can see nothing but fields - at first glance: when you zoom in, a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers appears: handwritten numbered pieces of the so-called "original recording", from which the land tax was derived.
There are no longer farmers in small plots, but small gardeners from the "Land in Sun" plant.
A large green area stands to the north of Untersendling.
The Theresienwiese, since 1810 the scene of the Oktoberfest, was actually still a lawn in the 19th century – not a concrete desert.
On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.
In the Urpositionsblatt, in the area of today's Au-Haidhausen district, one reads not only the street name "am Gasteig" or from the height "Auf der Lüften" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt".
Yes, here on Auerfeldstraße people were once locked up with delusions.
In 1858/59 the Münchner Kreis-Irrenanstalt "Auf der Auer Lüften" was founded.
Beginning in 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden headed the institution - the psychiatrist who is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.
“He was progressive for his time and, for example, ended the questionnaire of the so-called fools.
In addition, he has prohibited personnel from using violence against the occupants,” says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen Museum, who has been engaged in an exhibition with the facility.
Initially there was room for 280 patients, but later it was expanded to 500 seats.
At some point, this capacity was also no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the district railway plant in Haar in 1905.
Since 2006 there is the Isar-Amper-Klinikum München-Ost, one of the largest psychiatric clinics in Germany.
In the area of the former Auer Anstalt, young people now meet in the Salesianum in Munich.
The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and turned it into a youth home with training establishments.
To the west is the TSV Munich Ost football court, to the east residential houses from the 1980s.
In 2015, the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" was built - in architectural reminiscence of the original building of the Madness Institute, which had been destroyed in bombings during World War II.
The Marienplatz was listed as the "Hauptplatz" around 1856 and the Kaufingerstraße was called the "Kaufinger Gasse".
A decisive change brought the Second World War also in the heart of Munich.
The Allied bombs crushed many holes in the city centre in December 1944.
One remained to this day - at the Marienhof.
The English Institute, small business houses and a medieval tomb chapel once stood at the Marienhof, where these days the preparations and on 5 April 2017 the spatenstich for the second S-Bahn main line take place.
The slider can be used to compare the old Munich map with today's air image - and fill the hole at Marienhof.
Citizens’ Rights Group Releases Travel Warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Promotion of Color has issued a warning for colored people traveling to Missouri due to the state’s discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
“The NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri, which will take effect by August 28, 2017, urges African-American travelers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention and extreme caution when traveling through the state as a series of questionable, race-based incidents have recently occurred across the state and are recorded here,” the group said in a statement.
A recently passed Missouri law that makes it harder for people to win discrimination lawsuits, as well as the state’s law enforcement agencies disproportionately targeting minorities, prompted the group to issue the travel warning, the NAACP said.
“They have violations of civil rights that happen to people.
They’re being stopped because of their skin color, they’re beaten or killed,” Missouri NAACP president Rod Chapel told Kansas City Star.
"We hear complaints with such frequency that we haven't heard before."
It is the first such warning the organization has issued for a state in the United States.
The group cited incidents such as racist crimes against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in questionable circumstances earlier this year after he had no more gasoline while traveling through the state and was arrested by Missouri police without being charged with a crime.
The Council also points out a recent report from the Office of the Missouri Attorney General showing that black drivers in the state are 75 percent more likely to be stopped than whites.
“The recommendation is that people be aware and inform their families, friends and employees about what could happen in Missouri,” Chapel said.
“People need to be prepared whether they bring deposit money or let relatives know they’re traveling through the state.”
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI’s hate crime reporting program, which ranked the state 16th in the country in terms of the number of such violations.
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it harder to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination.
Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after states had passed immigration laws requiring local law enforcement agencies to arrest people for immigration violations, which, according to the ACLU, will contribute to further racial profiling.
Travel alerts are typically issued by the State Department for other countries, but recently stakeholders have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the U.S.
Weidezaun project is elementary
The Fischerbacher Weidezaun project is a successful project and will continue in the coming year.
The CDU Bundestag MPs Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac have made a picture of themselves on the spot.
At the Rechtgrabenhof of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the Fischerbacher CDU local association met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies.
Markus Schwendemann first gave insights into his plant, in which he manages 55 hectares of lawns and 40 hectares of forest, supplies 40 dairy cows and the same number of young animals, and hosts holiday guests in five apartments.
The "Black Forest milk" is for him the alternative marketing route for the milk of his cows, according to Schwendemann.
On the table of the holiday guests comes exclusively regional.
Since he is also the BLHV chairman of Fischerbach, he described the Weidezaun project as "elementarily important".
I can’t profit from such steep areas.
The green land area provides a lot of work, a lot must be processed with the motor sensing.
"We have to struggle here with the conditions and with the topography," Schwendemann stressed.
In 2003, he took over the parent’s farm and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even though he did not run an organic farm.
For Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear: "The municipality has recognized the importance of the pasture garden project and is pleased with the Leader support."
In the case of costs of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, farmers would have to be supported.
It is hoped that with this, the deforestation of the areas could be pulled out for a long time.
“The greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and are thinking about how to keep their farms going,” he said.
Farmers are often criticized for subsidies
In 2013, a total of 25 parcels of eleven participants were fenced through the pasture promotion.
The open area is 40 hectares, which may not be forested until at least 2023.
Of the total costs of 71,500 euros, half was funded through Leader, a quarter was borne by the municipality of Fischerbach.
Thus, the farmers were left with 12,610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of pastures.
"The great advantage is the longevity of the fences," explained Schwendemann.
Kordula Kovac emphasized: “You are doing a really good job, without farmers and farm women it can’t be done.”
Peter Weiß also stated: “Here the best foods are produced.”
The landscape management directive (LPR) in Baden-Württemberg enables state support for pastures.
The aim is to open up the Black Forest.
A prerequisite is the presence of a support setting designated by the LPR.
In addition, the enclosure area must not be tractor-managed (tension above 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by reforestation.
For the Fischerbacher Weidezaun project 2018 the application is currently running from eight participants with 24 plots who want to build 16 kilometers of fence.
The open area is equivalent to 35 hectares, the calculated cost is more than 112 000 euros.
Is nothing holy anymore?
Trump's White House takes over the Statue of Liberty
The most sure sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.
Americans appreciate this as much as any other – hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein on Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump regime, knew what he was doing when he took a symbolic ax in a fierce dispute with CNN’s Jim Acosta over the president’s proposals to drastically limit legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty.
To be fair, Miller did not attack the statue himself.
A horde of boat owners and Liberty imitators would have licked him if he had done so.
But he attacked their significance, and in particular the significance attributed to it when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus was added to its base in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument.
As Miller insulted Acosta, "I don't want to go into a whole thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.
The poem you are referring to was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty."
Miller is objectively right, but as he himself put it, it’s not really about history.
It is about the contemporary resonance to the shaking words of Lazarus, the only in which a state invites not only any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "Your tired, your poor, / your oppressed masses longing to breathe freely, / the miserable waste of your rich coasts."
There has never been a time when the “unfortunate waste” was better seen on our screens.
Miller did not engage in literary criticism – he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump’s USA.
This conflict over the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural debate: it is in fact a conflict over the importance of America.
Lazarus - and their friends who were committed to putting their words on the base after their death - knew very well that they were carrying out a highly political act.
The sculpture was intended to show the connections between French and American republicanism by depicting the female embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classical pictorial representation.
Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.
And she gives herself a very different name: Mother of the Exiles.
The association of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the people of the right wing had long wanted to reverse it.
The big screamer Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for Trump’s arrival, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty is not inviting anyone, but rather an early neo-conservative who brings the American flame into the midnight world: “Lady Liberty is moving forward.
It is meant to carry the lightning of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch should not illuminate the way to the United States.”
Very unusual, Limbaugh has come across something here.
The significance of the statue is entirely a matter of perception.
The great fantasy act of Lazarus was to see it as it was seen by the exhausted, miserable but hopeful people after long and often terrible trips on the deck of ships.
In the true sense, it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and an opportunity to improve their lives.
Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they need to hear.
And, of course, this is not the perspective that Miller and Trump would ever want to acknowledge.
Their torch is not to illuminate the way, but to ignite hatred, which is their only source of power.
World Cup 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish team members of the UK
Eilidh Doyle recalls a time when only two Scots were part of the UK team
UK athletics performance director Neil Black says the 16-member Scottish contingent in the World Cup framework will “be making a massive contribution to the team.”
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for London 2017, which starts on Friday.
Black believes that “something special is developing in Scotland” and the UK athletics need to learn from it.
“We welcome it, and we’re trying to understand it, and we’re going to keep it going until we find out,” Black said.
“I’m talking to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they’ve done.
The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they did.
British athletics: It has something to do with what they did.
Also with the guy on the street.
Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it’s absolutely brilliant.”
Several of the Scottish athletes are medal-winning, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000m track, while Eilidh Doyle was chosen by the team to be team captain.
“Eilidh is quite modest.
Her captain’s speech was incredible,” says Black.
"A number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they lived or trained, left the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.
The passion and real feeling that Eilidh brought naturally was great.”
The Commonwealth silver medal winner, who will compete in the 400m obstacles at her fifth World Cup, says it’s “incredible” that there are 16 Scots in the British team.
Scotland's best total number of athletes to date at the World Cup was seven, which were reached in 1983 and 2015.
The mid-range runner Muir leads this path and last year set five British and two European records.
She will participate in the 1500m and the 5000m runs.
Chris O'Hare, running 1,500 meters, is another Scottish to watch after a great season that included winning the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers her first World Championships when the only other Scottish in the team was Lee McConnell.
The team captain says she is "enormously proud" of the fact that many of her countrymen will not only be part of the team, but in some cases will also participate in medals and finals.
"The special thing about being a team captain is that she was elected by the other members of the team, so it was a great honor anyway, but knowing that my teammates voted for me and voted for me makes it something very special for me," she added.
"Obviously, I am very proud of all the Scots that are part of the team.
It only shows how far we have come.
And they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to climb the podium.
What about my role as a captain?
Yes, I think she went well.
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation because we have a home world championship.
So it’s really important to bet on that home support and benefit from being back in the Olympic Stadium.
I’ll get a second chance to go out there and compete and there’s going to be such a great atmosphere out there.”
Blocking Critics via Facebook: Don’t Apply for a Public Position If You Can’t Tolerate Voting
The father of our country knew something about bad press.
Americans loved George Washington, but it didn’t take long for the newspapers to beat him for everything from domestic politics to his political principles.
He blamed the criticism, of course.
But he did not silence his critics.
Because in 1783 Washington said, “Freedom of speech can be taken away – and, stupid and silent, we are led to battle like sheep.”
That brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who must work to be more like Washington.
Hogan’s staff blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who expressed their opinions on his official Facebook page.
The American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit against him earlier this week.
The governor’s staff dismissed the lawsuit as frivol, and the online comment was full of a counter-reaction with “Well, and?” .
“It’s just Facebook,” many people said.
But it is important.
And it’s especially important if it’s a guy like Hogan.
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelmingly democratic state that is amazingly popular.
It has the second highest approval of the nation’s 50 governors.
Hogan is not a reactionary hothead.
He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to the principles.
He was also very skilled in using Facebook as the primary means of connecting with his voters and playing his hairless head after chemotherapy to debut on his side.
Therefore, blocking people coming to the side of the governor – which is a public forum called official and by employees paid with public tax dollars – is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan’s spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor’s actions, arguing that blocking the comments was nothing more than moderation.
But it’s too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hate-filled people swinging the whistle online.
The post spoke to some of the real people blocked by Hogan.
And these are just real people speaking to their chosen leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a pastor, not trolls.
They all said their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan’s Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hated, but she asked about hate crimes.
"I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other recent news," she wrote in the comment section of the news program "The Post".
“I also do not appreciate this idea, if a number of people take a position on the same topic, then they are disregarded by some as a so-called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of concerned citizens.”
What the governor’s employees referred to as “centric spam attack,” others would probably call “pronouncement.”
The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a post by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It’s much cleaner than in earlier times, if you’d done the same, that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorial articles, or arrest and silence protesters.
This is exactly what is happening digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticized for insulting Facebook and other social media sites.
President Trump is sued by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed.
One of the first milestones on this issue fell last week in Virginia.
The chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County violated the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banned a voter from her Facebook page.
And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU for his use of Facebook and Twitter.
It should not be so difficult.
At Washington’s time, the era of affordable ports had a similar effect to the Internet.
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous correspondents struck his lead.
Even then, Washington had anonymous trolls.
The people who used pseudonyms such as “Juricola”, “Valerius”, “Belisarius” and “Portius” wrote all letters to newspapers that undermined Washington’s decisions.
Petitions criticizing his position on the Treaty of Amity, Trade and Shipping with Britain overwhelmed his office, according to historical documents collected by the George Washington Project’s online papers.
But he did not silence her.
Freedom of speech, dissent and discourse are the foundations of our nation.
And true leadership means accepting it.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for home comfort at Renaissance Club
Former No. 1 European Ronan Rafferty will be hoping for home comfort over the next three days as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
The Nordire, who led to the final round next to Archerfield Links last year before losing to Paul Eales, is linked to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador on behalf of club founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
"I've seen how the Renaissance club was built, and we're seeing how it reaches its fame with this event," Rafferty said.
“The players will see this course from its best side, it’s in a great condition.
Jerry did a great job when he set up this place.
He is an avid advocate of this game and is proud of his performance here.
This is a great window for this course.”
The Englishman Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time, despite having won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
“It really feels special,” said the Southport-based player.
“I was unable to defend the Extremadura Open because it was removed from the program the year after I won it.
Getting back to this part of the world is magical.
It is a wonderful place to play golf.
The memories of last year are coming back, and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon to win here last year.
It was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate.”
Gary Orr, who came to the European Senior Tour earlier this year after his 50th birthday, is returning to action at home.
This event will be his first Scottish appearance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"It always means a little more when you play at home," said Orr, the man from Helensburgh.
“You want to do it well, but you also feel that extra pressure.
I really playing again and I played a solid golf.
I am pleased with how it has gone so far.”
With the trio on the field are former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and Senior Major Champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six Scots on the pitch, the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Entrance is free, parking costs £5 per car with one passenger and £10 per car with two or more passengers.

Less deaths from lung cancer due to passive smoking
Over the past two decades, fewer and fewer people have died of lung cancer due to passive smoking.
To this conclusion come scientists of the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) in a study.
"According to our estimates, 167 lung cancer deaths per year are due to passive smoking," said study leader Heiko Becher.
As a comparison, he drew his own study on this subject from 1994.
At that time, there were 400 lung cancer deaths per year due to passive smoking in Germany.
The new study has been published in the International Journal of Public Health.
Housing connections are very complex
The construction work in the Villinger Straße is in full progress and "is somewhat in time," according to the head of the Bauhof Fred Heinze.
In the area of housing connections, the situation is more complicated than thought, as much is hidden in the underground, which is not mentioned in the plans.
Traffic, which repeatedly hampers construction work, is a major problem for the construction group of the company Stumpp.
“The car drivers’ ignorance of red lamps and barricades is already enormous,” reports Heinze.
The road is closed and only buses are allowed to pass through.
Angelo Caruso, Marvin Kostorz and Tim Kostorz from Stumpp have been working on the bridge for weeks.
“The hot days have been quite exhausting.
But fortunately, we were supplied with cool mineral water by our friend Fritz Matt,” says Marvin Kostorz.
Poverty and Death in Indonesia
When Bardina Degei is cooking dinner, she doesn’t use a stove.
She rarely uses a pot.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of the Paniai Regenthood in the turbulent Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually puts a sweet potato – locally referred to as “nota” – right into the fireplace.
After half an hour, the carbonated knot is taken with eager, unwashed hands and swallowed.
Degei sits on the clay floor — she has no furniture — where she also performs her daily work, such as washing clothes with dull water from the nearby swamp.
A bowl in a roofless room serves as a latrine.
As the youngest of her husband’s four wives, no fields were assigned to her.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: most villagers are unemployed, and many drink hard, and there are the soldiers here.
“No one dares to run around the village after 5 p.m.,” she says.
It is a rare insight into everyday life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was admitted to Indonesia in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia, when only 1,026 elders were to vote through a public hand lift before the occupying troops.
An existing movement that revolted for independence against Dutch rule quickly turned against the government of Jakarta, whichins control of the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers from it.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, with the independent part of Papua New Guinea comprising the eastern part of the island.
The trip includes a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital of Jayapura to Nabire and then a morning 5-hour drive by rental car.
There is no public transportation.
The city, with about 19,000 inhabitants, consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, and wooden roofs converted by rust into various yellow-brown tones.
Very few Indonesians have made their trip here, let alone journalists and virtually no foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Papuans worshipped a god called Uga Tamee.
There were other changes as well.
“We weren’t used to wearing those clothes,” says Degei, pointing to her vibrant, hand-woven turban, her dark shirt, and her light coat.
“In the past, we only had leaves on our bodies.”
Papua is Indonesia’s poorest province, with 28% of people living below the poverty line and having some of the worst child mortality and literacy rates in Asia.
It is also Indonesia’s gold country.
The world’s largest and most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, owned by the Phoenix-based Freeport McMoran, is just 60 miles from Paniai, a New Jersey-sized highland province with 153,000 inhabitants.
In 2015 alone, Freeport mined $3.1 billion in gold and copper.
In addition, Papua has timber resources worth an estimated $78 billion.
However, these wealths are a source of misery for Papua, which ensures that Indonesia’s powerful militaryins a suffocating presence.
A 2005 investigation in the New York Times that Freeport paid local military personnel and units $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 to a single officer.
Papuan demands for greater autonomy threaten these golden goats and are treated mercilessly.
According to activists, more than 500,000 Papua have been killed and thousands have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969.
Mass killings in Papua’s tribal homeland in the 1970s were classified as genocide, according to the Asian Human Rights Commission.
In the region alone, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters last year.
“We’ll lose everything,” Brisbane Archdiocese’s 2016 report says, which includes reports of last year’s atrocities, such as illegal executions and torture – rape and electrocution are popular, according to another report – and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations.
“It’s hard to count the number of victims as incidents happen every week,” says Andreas Harsono, an Indonesian researcher for Human Rights Watch.
The screws have intensified as Papua’s resources bring an influx of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
The province’s population of 3.5 million is 83% Christian, but demographic developments change as Muslim economic migrants come from the populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese warung cantines sell fried chicken and gado-gado, a mixed vegetable served with peanut sauce.
Local people are fighting to stay here.
“The migrants have begun selling chickens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local Papua,” explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old Paniai native who moved to the provincial capital of Jayapura to work.
"It has cost the native Papua - the mom-mama [the women] of Papua - their market."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, pledged to address inequalities and violations of laws in Papua during his 2014 election campaign.
The former carpenter secured 27 of Papua’s 29 districts – including Paniai – on his way to the presidential palace in Jakarta.
But little has changed in Papua, and today the locals feel deceived.
“Our hearts are broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014, with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored,” says You.
In fact, Paniai suffered a low point only two months after Jokowi’s inauguration in October.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children were outside singing Christmas songs in front of a camp fire in Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the dark on a motorcycle.
The frightened children told them to turn on their lights.
One of the soldiers took a blow to their tone and later returned with four soldiers, according to local pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers who had drunk hunted and struck the group with their rifle pins, said victims and witnesses.
Then one of the soldiers shot the group of children.
One child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was hit so badly that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and things escalated the next day.
Around 1,000 young Papua men, women and children gathered on a football court outside the local police station and military command center to demand justice.
They wore ceremonial hunting bowls and performed the Waita dance - running in a circle and imitating a bird singing - by Papuas Mee Pago tribe.
Some protesters started throwing stones at police and military posts.
When the mood was heated up, the soldiers were sent a command via an internal radio: "If the masses resist more than three times, they will shoot them dead," it says in an official TIME document, which was not released to local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the head of the Kego Koto district of Enarotali, saw the imminent danger and called for calm, urging the crowd to return home.
No one was in the mood to listen.
"As I turned around, I was suddenly shot in my left wrist," he told TIME on the veranda of his colorfully painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn’t know who fired, but says the bullet came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered here.
“It was overcrowded, many shots were fired,” he added.
The local man Alfius Youw was hit three times, so his cousin, who witnessed the shootings.
"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was," Yohanes, who, like many Indonesians, only carries one name, told TIME in a dark mood.
“I saw that he was dead...I kissed him.”
Papuan police chief inspector Yotje Mende told reporters that his officers just wanted to “safe” their station because it was being attacked.
“We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us,” Papua police spokesman Pudjo Sulistiyo said in 2015.
“It is about life and death.”
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many more wounded.
The news of the killings came to Jakarta only the following day.
For three weeks, Jokowi delivered a passionate speech in Jayapura in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and vowed to address the historic misfortunes in Papua.
“I want this case to be resolved immediately so that it won’t happen again in the future,” he said.
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he was setting up an out-of-court mechanism to resolve historic human rights violations.
But the excuses started almost immediately.
Most injuries occurred a long time ago.
Some were in the 90s and early 2000s.
The point is that we have committed ourselves to addressing these violations, but there are processes that need to go through,” he said.
Then Wiranto withdrew when he spoke to TIME in Jakarta on June 5 and said he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, “everything is regulated by law,” he said.
Wiranto, accused by the UN of "crimes against humanity" that claimed more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor's bloody 1999 independence referendum, said 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua have already been resolved, including the Paniai incident.
Families of the Paniai victims accepted such claims with fierce unbelief.
“I’ve been interviewed four times over the past three years, but there’s been no progress,” says Yohanes.
“I am tired.”
He says he still lives in fear years later.
“I am afraid,” he says.
“I’m afraid to be arrested by the military, I’m afraid to be shot.”
His brother Yacobus repeated the view that people in Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He says he was beaten by the military after helping to bury four of the victims.
“After I buried the bodies, the military sought me,” he says.
The shootings did not stop.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police fired at villagers in the neighborhood of Paniai Deiyai.
During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company who refused to bring an unconscious man to the hospital, one person died and 17 others were injured, including children.
The man, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on the way to the hospital.
Anxious villagers protested in front of the company’s office.
Police said villagers threw stones at officers who responded by firing warning shots.
But locals say the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) began shooting at the crowd and killed one.
"We were so panicked, we fear there will be revenge," said the 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the wounded were delivered here quickly, according to TIME.
“I have been hiding in my house for two days.”
The Deiyai Parliament has called for accountability of the officers involved and the withdrawal of the mobile police brigade from the area.
Paniai has always been a disturbance for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development strengthens the dissatisfaction of the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes who live in the green highlands of Papua.
Many joined the "Free Papua Movement" (OPM), the rebel army that claims to defend Papua's rights by inciting sporadic attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders come from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response, thousands of people have been arrested and arbitrarily detained in Paniai in recent years under the pretext of “securing national sovereignty.”
Some never appear again.
Among the people of Papua, Paniai is known as “a tragic, forgotten place.”
Poverty increases dissatisfaction.
The little rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
The bread is out of reach.
The people here grow everything they eat: nota and fruit and leafy vegetables in particular.
Agriculture is the task of women, who can each process four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
They keep most of the harvest for the family, while the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten pieces of note cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities have grown between the native Papua and the new migrants, who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new air routes to Nabire Airport.
The few jobs that exist in the region tend to go to the better educated and wealthier migrants.
Papua rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to run their own competitively.
“The young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there are no jobs or money here,” says John Gobai, chairman of the tribal council of Paniai.
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua.
In addition, restrictions on the reporting of international media remain tense.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua for lack of coordination with related institutions, despite being given the rare permission to film.
According to Phelim Kine, Human Rights Watch’s Asia Deputy Director, Jokowi’s campaign promises to lift restrictions on reporting in order to promote transparency and development have not been fulfilled.
"There are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report about Indonesia's restless eastmost provinces of Papua and West Papua: visa denial and a blacklist," he said in a statement.
The lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely limited to Papua’s immediate neighbors.
In March, six Pacific states – Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands – called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the “various and widespread injuries” in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.
The same countries have historically supported the OPM.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir rejected the group’s allegations and told journalists in Jakarta: “Indonesia still has a democratic system and there are free media, so it’s difficult to hide evidence of human rights cases.”
The local people want more foreign governments to be aware of this.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on May 4, locals broke their silence and pressured him “We want freedom,” according to a source who also attended the meeting but wanted to remain anonymous.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but the Papua people say they are unlikely to vote for Jokowi again.
"Jokowi is a man who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Paniai shootings," says Gobai, the chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people, besides living under the constant threat of a predatory military, are in poor education and health services.
Gobai says the Paniai people, like others in Papua, see their vote for Jokowi as a “debt” he has to pay back.
“They don’t need money, they just want justice,” he said.
Despite the threats and intimidation, the families of the victims of the Paniai shooting carried out a final symbolic act of contempt: the body of a victim was buried on a site opposite the police and military station.
They know they may never get justice, but at least they don’t let those responsible for their crimes forget.
“A member of our family was killed,” Yacobus says with his head down.
“What else can we do?”
Fire catches Dubai's 'Torch' skyscraper for the second time
A fire hit one of the world’s tallest residential towers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to flee the 337-meter-high, 79-story building.
It is the second fire to sweep through the high-rise building in just two years, which is accidentally called the Torch Tower.
The building was evacuated, no injuries were, and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame.
“We slept and we woke up at the fire alarm and people’s screams.
We ran down the stairs and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor,” a resident who named him George told Reuters.
Dubai's civil protection authorities said firefighting units extinguished the fire and cooled the building around 4 a.m. local time (00.00 GMT).
The government said it is working on providing accommodation for those affected.
The incident may revive questions about the safety of materials used in the outdoors of high-rise buildings around the world.
An investigation by the management of the torch building after its fire in 2015 found that the majority of the damage came from the clothing, the outer clothing to decoration or insulation.
In the UK, police said they believe the system of insulation and disguise plates at London’s Grenfell Tower may have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in June that killed about 80 people.
No Davis Cup Reform: Next Best of Five
The president of the International Tennis Federation (ITF) has failed at the general assembly with his big Davis Cup cup.
At the meeting in Ho Chi Minh City, the revolutionary proposal for this sport to play Davis Cup individual on only two winning sets was not supported by the required two-thirds majority.
Though often very long, but also very appreciated five-set classics are therefore retained by the traditional competition.
63.54 percent of member countries voted in favour of the reform, so the goal of ITF President David Haggerty was hardly missed.
“We respect this decision, but we are disappointed that our member nations have not adopted the entire Davis Cup and Fed Cup reform package.
We need a change to secure the long-term future of these iconic and historic competitions,” Haggerty said.
We will continue to work to improve applications.
Not until the vote, after many objections, the proposal had already come before the final was held in a neutral place.
New from 2018 are only comparatively smaller details: Thus, the finalists in the Davis Cup and Fed Cup will have the host right in the first round in the following year.
To reduce the cost for the organizers, the requirements for training spaces, etc. will be eased and players will have to complete fewer official media dates before the Davis Cup.
More than 1 in 5 U.S. travellers bring banned items onto the plane, finds a survey
A survey of air passengers found that more than 20 percent consciously or unconsciously smuggled banned items through U.S. Transportation Security Administration checkpoints, including at least 6 percent who entered the aircraft while accidentally carrying banned knives or other objects with blades.
Less than 1 percent said they had discovered late that they had mistakenly travelled with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
The survey of more than 1,000 people – conducted by a jet charter service, Stratos Jet Charters Inc. – also found that younger travellers were more likely to disregard the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted that they deliberately tried to fly with something that was banned by the TSA, 19.7 percent were millennials, compared with less than 15 percent who were members of Generation X.
The most common items deliberately passed by TSA agents were food and liquids.
More than 3 percent admitted that they deliberately carried items with clothes through the safety check, while 2.2 percent of female respondents and 3.7 percent of male respondents also confirmed that they deliberately brought illegal drugs onto the plane.
The company said it surveyed travellers across the country to find out how many accidentally brought smuggled goods through airport security and how many did it intentionally.
It’s no surprise that the people who were most likely to smuggle – consciously or unconsciously – through security were the ones who were most likely to fly.
However, the company points out that the TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People are often unsure what fluids they are allowed to take or how much of it.
So it’s no surprise that the largest amount of items seized by the TSA are prohibited liquids.
For a while, people thought the TSA could see books as smuggling.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
Elon Musk says tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel orders
Elon Musk is pleased with the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla "Model 3".
So far, it has failed to say that some customers have already withdrawn their non-binding reservation.
In addition to the ever-triumphant figures on sales increases and even gigantic sales targets, Tesla CEO Elon Musk revealed another, less brilliant number at the announcement of the latest quarterly balance sheet for the first time: that of cancellations in the new mass market Model 3.
Musk has frequently advertised over the past few months with the more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car, whose delivery is just beginning.
According to Musk, 63,000 of the 518,000 pre-orders have already been withdrawn.
Critics have repeatedly pointed out that these are merely non-binding reservations.
In case of cancellation, Tesla will refund the $1,000 ($1,000 in the U.S. and £1,000 in the UK) reservation fee in full.
At present, there are 455,000 such non-binding reservations, Musk admitted in a telephone conference with analysts.
That cancellation of about twelve percent of all orders so far could be a problem, however, the Tesla CEO does not believe.
His argument: The challenge with the ambitious growth goals lies not in demand, but on the production side.
Last year, Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.
In 2018, all models combined are expected to be 500,000, in 2020 one million.
The demand for this is obviously there.
According to Musk, there are currently 1,800 reservations per day.
Anyone who orders a “Model 3” today can expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 – if Tesla manages to drive its brand new, never in practice tested production routes without major interruptions with maximum utilization.
Many experts doubt that this is possible.
But if there are major delays, then the non-binding of reservations could become a problem for Tesla.
Because then the company can not prevent dissatisfied customers from running away in crowds.
EPA chief Pruitt resigns due to delaying Obama-era rules to reduce emissions
One day after being sued by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, withdrew his previous decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era rules to reduce emissions of smog-causing air pollutants.
Pruitt presented the change as his agency proved to be more responsive to the needs of state environmental authorities than previous administrations.
He did not mention the lawsuit brought against his previous position in a Federal Court of Appeal.
This is a deadline that expired on 1 October for countries to comply with the 2015 standards for ground ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay compliance by one year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid “interfering in local decisions or hindering economic growth.”
Pruitt, who served as Oklahoma prosecutor before being appointed by President Donald Trump, has long been a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations.
Since his arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly switched to blocking or delaying regulations that the chemical industry and the fossil fuel industry resist.
The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the latest legal downturn for Pruit’s regulatory rollback agenda.
Last month, a federal appeal court in Washington ruled that the EPA administrator exceeded his authority when he attempted to delay the implementation of an Obama administration rule that required oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement released on Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that his reversal of ozone standards simply reinforces the EPA’s willingness to cooperate with states through the complex process of meeting new standards in a timely manner.
“Under previous administrations, the EPA has often failed to comply with the deadlines for implementation and then waited to be accused by activist groups and others, and in an agreement to set the deadline for implementation,” said Pruitt, who sued the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job.
“We don’t believe in judicial regulation, and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take the law and the authority we have seriously.”
Nevertheless, the EPA’s statement said Pruitt would at some point use his “power to delay and all other legally available powers” to ensure that the regulations are “based on a robust policy and the best available information.”
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive revision of ozone rules.
A bill passed last month is intended to delay the implementation of 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been put to vote in the Senate.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who headed the coalition of states that sued the EPA this week, said the group intends to maintain legal pressure.
“The reversal of the EPA – according to our lawsuits – is a major gain for the health and safety of those 6.7 million New Yorkers and the over 115 million Americans directly affected by the smog flowing into their communities,” Schneiderman said.
New York joined in this case California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington and the District of Columbia.
Ground ozone is created when pollutants from cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight.
The emerging smog can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive groups of people and contribute to thousands of premature deaths each year.
Representatives of public health and environmentalists cheered over Pruit’s surprising change of course.
"It's worrying how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step from the person responsible for protecting the air we breathe," said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
“We must continue to fight against the Trump administration’s ideological crusade, worshiping polluters and their special interests.”
Tumlingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hilarius Church
750 years of St. Hilarius Church: On the occasion of the anniversary of the Church of the Mountain, the old cemetery area in Tumlingen will be invited to a serenade on Sunday, July 16, at 16.30.
Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historic St. Hilarius complex is a popular place to stay.
Visitors to the sixth Benefiz Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.
The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village has made Tumlingens’ friends and supporters a concern.
Walter Martini emphasizes: “It’s a unique small village town.”
In 1267 the St. Hilariuskapelle was first documentally mentioned in the Württembergische Urkundenbuch: Count Hermann von Sulz sold "the mountain with the parish church in Tumlingen along with the Vogtei" to Magister Eberhard von Horb and to his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver.
According to the text of the document, on the Tumlinger Mountain, in addition to the former parish church, there was also a ruling court, to which the church or the patronage right belonged, and not vice versa.
There were also people living there.
As is apparent from the description of the Freudenstadt Oberamt of 1858, besides the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which are now recognizable in the landscape of Tumlingen, the "Berg" was the third, the imperial settlement core of the village.
Ancient maps from around the year 1600 support these historical circumstances.
The right of patronage arose from the early medieval own church law.
A lord who built, equipped and occupied a church with a priest continued to own this church and could also inherit this own church.
This was associated with the right to appoint a priest or to propose a new priest to the bishop.
There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.
The largest of the two broke up on Christmas 1673.
The newly purchased bell then ringed for the first time in 1692, but had to be delivered later in the Second World War in 1942.
During the Thirty Years' War (1616–1648) the windows were stolen and the bell ropes stolen.
The roof was empty.
In 1796, French troops camped near the church.
They broke out the chest and church chairs and used them as firewood.
The remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.
Until 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius Cemetery also served as the last resting place for the dead of Hörschweiler.
In 1823 the cemetery was expanded and the Hilariuskirche demolished.
Only the church tower was stopped.
On the New Year’s Eve of 1834, a storm divided the church tower and half collapsed.
In order to prevent an accident, the tower was demolished.
Only the tower, which still exists today, has survived as a witness to the 750-year history of the church.
Today, Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem from the "Schaffige Pensioners" are the successors of Dieter Dockhorn to the Hilarius plant.
As organizers, the friends and supporters of Tumling invite on Sunday, July 16, for the sixth Serenade to the old cemetery of St. Hilariuskapelle.
It is designed by the combo of the Kepler-Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with contributions by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.
Chairman Hartmut Romann has the final word.
The program starts at 16.30.
Entrance is from 15.30.
In order to celebrate the Serenade, there is a drunkenness in front of the cemetery.
"Enjoy a summer evening in the shade of old trees and with the wide view over lawns towards the forest," the organizers highlight the fantastic view.
The serenade takes place only in dry weather.
The organizers hope to have many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hilarius facility, which is of importance to tumblers and listeners.
Tumlingen’s friends and supporters feel a special commitment to home care, as confirmed by Serenade organizer Walter Martini.
The association wants to have wind turbines approved.
"Boisheim defends itself" sees no legal prerequisite for the construction and has therefore turned to the council.
The association "Boisheim defends itself" has requested Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheimer Nette.
It was done illegally.
The association argues that at the time of the approval on 30 December 2016, no wind turbines could have been approved in the Boisheimer Nette at all, since at that time in Viersen there was only a wind power concentration zone on the city border with Schwalmtal.
Within this concentration zone, the construction and operation of wind power plants is possible in principle, but at the same time the concentration zone excludes the use of wind energy for the rest of the city area.
Such zones are intended to prevent a “saving” of the landscape.
The city of Viersen had decided a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette a few days earlier through a change in the land use plan, but the district government of Düsseldorf had not approved it because of a shape error.
"Because of the lack of the planning legal prerequisite, the granted approval notice remains unlawful and therefore also to be withdrawn," said Christoph Erkens, Chairman of Boisheim Defends.
Current state of affairs: The city council has once again decided on the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette before the summer break; an approval from the district government is still pending.
Recognize: "Therefore, at this point, the issuance of a permit for the construction of wind power plants is excluded from the planning law."
The circle confirms the entry of the invitation.
"The corresponding letters have been received from the district of Viersen since last week," a spokesman said.
The circle takes them as an occasion to re-examine the matter.
However, it is not expected that the process will be stopped.
In view of the ongoing proceedings before the Administrative Court, the district did not want to comment on the content of the argument of the association "Boisheim defends itself".
NEW Re, a subsidiary of NEW, plans to build four windshields, each 200 meters high, on an area on the Boisheimer Nette.
Already last year, the company, in which the city of Viersen is indirectly involved, had signed lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65-hectare land.
With the construction of the four wind turbines, the electricity needs of approximately 11,400 households can be covered – which corresponds to about one-fifth of the electricity needs of all Quierzen households.
The New Re plans to invest around 20 million euros.
Last summer, Viersens city council gave green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the wind farm Linnich near Aachen as well as a participation in a wind turbine in Übach-Palenberg in the Heinsberg district.
Car and tractor crashes: woman dies in terrible accident
A terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning around 10 a.m. on the L 333 between Niederwallmenach and Bogel (Rhein-Lahn-Kreis).
One woman was deadly injured.
Two others were slightly injured.
The road was closed for hours.
According to police data, a 17-year-old woman from Bornich drove the L 333 in the direction of Bogel in her car as part of the accompanying driving with her 53-year-old mother.
City and merchants plan "home-shoppen" weekend
Bad Langensalzaer and people from the region are expected to rediscover the shopping opportunities in the city centre in September.
The trade association and the city administration intend to use the weekend on September 8 and 9 to lure residents to shop in the city centre.
As announced by the chairman of the trade association, Christian König, the “home-shoppen” weekend is intended to raise awareness among customers about what offers the city offers apart from the usual supermarket goods.
Therefore, a market with regional providers is planned, similar to the weekly market.
In addition, local companies should present themselves with their training places.
In addition, the shops in the center of the city are invited to the "Midnight Shopping".
The action is aimed not only at the inhabitants of the city and the nearby region.
In preparation are advertisements on the radio, an internet video and printed bags that point to the action weekend, according to Christian König.
The city administration and trade association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
Thus, the trade association and the city are entering another phase of the project "Attractive Downtown".
These include new offers such as the first "Active Day" for the Fountain Festival, as well as a Sunday open for sale, talks with all businessmen and hosts to move them to active participation.
Attractive offers on Saturday and the waiver of parking fees on that day are also part of the concept.
In addition, customers’ potential should be reopened or reopened.
These include tourists and tourists.
But many locals also lost sight of the city centre while shopping.
In the end, everyone would have to contribute to revitalizing the city centre – up to tenants, the of the whole city and clubs.
It was necessary to overcome the lethargy, which has spread in part, with a network, King had said in the spring.
Birgit Streich, head of the IHK-Center in Mühlhausen, said that for the third "Heimat-Shoppen" day in Germany, five Thüringer cities will participate for the first time.
In addition to Bad Langensalza, these are Weimar, Sömmerda, Heiligenstadt and Bleicherode.
The day should promote the appreciation of local trade and highlight its importance for the common good of our cities,” Streich said.
The action, led by IHK and with many partners, also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his or her immediate environment with his or her purchasing behavior.
Two dead and several injured in explosion at US school
During the construction work, a gas explosion occurred in the school building.
More new people were injured.
A gas explosion in the U.S. city of Minneapolis has killed two people and wounded nine others, some of them seriously.
According to the fire department, one injured was in critical condition on Wednesday.
One person died when part of a school building collapsed in the explosion.
One missing man was later rescued.
The dead were school employees.
As a cause of the accident, the authorities suspected work on a gas pipeline.
During the holiday season, only a few people stayed in the building of the Minnehaha Academy.
Trump puts Mexico under pressure for border wall payment after leaked transcripts of phone calls
Transcripts of phone calls between U.S. President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia have been published by the Washington Post.
On January 27, Trump called on Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to stop publicly saying he would not pay for a planned border wall.
The U.S. President insulted him for publicly denouncing the wall andly told him, “You can’t tell the press that.”
Trump started his presidential campaign with a promise to build a wall on the southern border of the United States, and vowed to get Mexico to pay for the project.
Transcripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also released, revealing a tense exchange.
Mr. Trump told Mr. Turnbull that a deal for the U.S. to accept refugees who emigrated to Australia was “ridiculous”, “mis” and “stupid” and that insisting on the trade mediated by the Obama administration would make him look like a “depp” after he had proposed a ban on relocating refugees to the U.S.
Mr. Trump ended the call after telling Mr. Turnbull, “This is the most unpleasant call of the whole day.”
Moore’s Ford Massacre: Activists Reveal Racist Lynch Act as a Call for Justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury drove through a group of spectators in rural Monroe, Georgia, and rolled toward Moore's Ford Bridge.
Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, could reach the bridge, a group of white men with guns came out to block its way.
The leader of the mob - a middle-aged man in a needle strip suit - took a long train on his cigar and looked examining through the windshield.
Inside, the inmates floated in fear.
“We want this n----r Roger!” cried the man.
“Take him out of the car!”
Crying broke the silence when a young black man was dragged from the passenger seat.
Fortunately, this terrible scene, which was played on July 22, is just a remake.
But when a snare is thrown around Roger’s neck, almost everyone in the audience breaks out very real suckers.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have returned to Moore's Ford Bridge to mimic the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lynched by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
No one has ever been charged with the murder.
“It’s really unthinkable that in all these years, no one has been arrested—although we see them in our communities, even though we know who they are,” said Tyrone Brooks, who helps organize the relocation.
“It’s a dirt spot on a story, but it’s a burden on our souls.”
Brooks is a 71-year-old former congressman of the state of Georgia and a lifelong civil rights activist.
For him, the repeat serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder to the Monroe community that an error has never been corrected.
"We want prosecution, we want the end, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we have to get justice," he said.
“We cannot reach healing and reconciliation until we receive justice.”
A forensic practitioner puts a bowl over the body of one of the victims of the Moore-Ford Lynch on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI files received from NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected in the Lynch trial.
But no one has ever been accused.
Although the suspects have been on the lookout for decades, civil rights activists say the double motivation for the Lynch actions has always been known throughout the city: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a decision by the Supreme Court allowed black citizens in Georgia to vote for the first time in the summer pre-election campaign.
About the same time as the election, according to the FBI, black farmer Roger Malcom stabbed a white landowner, Barnett Hester, during a fight - allegedly because of a woman.
Brooks said the rumor in the city was that Hester had slept with Malcom's wife Dorothy and that the baby she wore wasn't from her husband.
On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid $600 to free Malcom from prison, according to the FBI.
He was accompanied to prison by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
But as they then moved away from the prison and approached Moore's Ford Bridge, a lynchmob surrounded the car.
"As it turns out, it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the killings," the FBI said.
"It is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between state and local prosecution, which was not only involved in the murders, removing evidence and concealing the identities of witnesses."
Brooks makes it even more precise.
“It was a massacre of electoral rights,” he said.
"They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community: 'If you get registered and if you vote, then this will happen to you here.'
For a decade, Cassandra Greene has led the annual revision of the Moore Ford Bridge Lynch murders.
Their portrayal is vivid, engaging, and is based on a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe no longer exists in America.
It’s hard to look at, and even harder to look away, but Greene said that’s the point.
“We don’t want to talk about the Lynch because we’re then confronted with its ugliness within us all,” she said.
“But I can’t build a relationship with you if you don’t want to listen to me or hear what I’ve gone through.”
The trials for this year’s production began in June, and on the first day, 30 actors — a dozen white and the rest black — pushed into a room and listened as Greene started a well-recorded overview of the play.
Wade Marbaugh is Green’s co-director.
He has been playing the role of the chief clan member for years, but he said the role will never be easier.
“I feel dirty because I’m not like that,” Marbaugh said.
“But I think it’s very important to keep this story alive because we don’t want to go back to those times.”
On the other side of the room, the actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who played Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, tried their lines.
The play begins with Malcom shouting horses and pressing him, angry that he slept with his wife Dorothy.
"I said, n --- he, disappear from my property!"
Rascona responds to the fire.
There is a break.
And then everyone (at least all black actors) breaks out in laughter.
Greene laughed the loudest.
“What?” asked Rascona.
He is alarmed and confused.
Was I too hard?
“No,” Greene said, still kidding.
"I just don't think white people said 'n--he' at the time."
“But,” joked one of the other black actors.
“You just have to hit the hard ‘R.’”
And that’s where the energy shifts in the room, a feeling of comradeship replaces the discomfort.
Everyone is busy getting this right, not only because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four people killed.
The scene begins again.
This time, when Rascona says the N-word, he says it sharply and with emphasis.
Absolutely no one laughs.
This repetition ends violently and quickly.
There are screams, shootings and then silence.
A woman dressed in a mourning dress stands over the bodies of the actors and performs Billie Holidays mourning lobby "Strange Fruit".
His voice breaks with every second word.
Around a hundred meters behind it, a group of about four dozen spectators wipes sweat and tears from their eyes.
The audience is divided almost evenly between black and white.
A couple have come from Ithaca, New York, to see the show, many just come down the street.
They’ve all experienced Georgia’s overwhelming moisture for almost eight hours as Brooks leads them on a pilgrimage to the graves of the Malcoms and Dorseys.
Until this point, the murders have remained an anecdote, but now, standing on the same land where the Lynch murders took place, the air feels ghostly.
When the last notes of the song are out, Greene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the corpses.
Children hook at their heads, register the false blood and silent bodies, and whisper to each other.
“You’re not really dead,” murmured a little boy, as if he wanted to remember.
After a few minutes, Greene thanks the crowd – and suddenly it’s over.
The actors throw the lynch rope away and wipe away their tears.
Bradshaw embraces Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the clan member.
Nick Rascona embraces two of his fellow actors and then breaks down in their arms crying, the emotional burden of the performance eventually breaks through on him.
“It’s okay,” one of the women whispered.
“We know that’s not in your heart.
You did it for a reason.”
Later, the audience gathered with the actors for dinner.
At a table, a white couple from Atlanta talks excitedly about their relationship with a black couple they just met.
Denise Duplinski struggled to find words for what feeling the performance left behind.
"It's hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... coming from people who look like you and who do it because they look like you," she said.
“What this really does to me makes me believe that the lynch is still going on,” she added, “today it’s just called police shooting.”
In the same room, Tyrone Brooks’s court holds at his table, he eats and reminds of civil rights.
He said he has already begun planning the show next year.
“The reflection is somehow inspiring because it describes the horror of what we’ve endured, but it’s also a moment of learning,” he said.
“It’s like if we don’t learn anything from it, it can happen again.
“He who does not study his own history, who does not know his own history, is condemned to repeat it.”
"God's Dawn" reconciled the Wagnerian in Bayreuth
Also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner’s monumental work, director Frank Castorf sets on a colourful and freely staged staging in a gigantic, six-story setting.
The stage (designed by Aleksandar Denic) shows a fuzzy street corner along with Wall Rest and Dönerbude in Berlin, a "Plaste and Elaste" logo from the GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange.
In front of the park is an open Mercedes oldtimer, in which the Rhine daughters pose as Rockergirls, or alternatively an Isetta.
Stacked oil barrels are reminiscent of Castorff’s lead motif – money, power, and greed – drawn through his “ring” staging.
The three Rhine daughters – sung by Stephanie Houtzeel, Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner – harmonize wonderfully as in the “Rheingold”.
Kess seduces Siegfried (Stefan Vinke), drags a corpse into the trunk in a Hollywood-style manner and gives the Krawallo clique.
Stephen Milling sings the wonderfully ugly hage surrounded by the aura of a heavyweight boxer.
Brutal the scene when he kills Siegfried.
Later, Gunther (Markus Eiche) has to believe it.
The audience thanked the group with loud applause.
Stormfully celebrated are Foster, Milling, Vinke and conductor Janowski, who humbly and bending hands to Merkel's roots.
There is great applause for the festival orchestra, which appears on stage for the first time - in the face of the great heat again in loose leisure clothes.
I was very excited about the performance of Frank Castorf and his team.
If in 2013 he had to have a valid pipe concert over him, five years later there was great jubilation, in which the individual "Buh" cries vanished.
Chairwoman Katharina Wagner is pleased.
"You can see that the audience has grown together with the 'ring' in a way," she said shortly before the performance to the dpa.
The public not only made a form of peace with Castorf, but it also grew an understanding of his viewpoint.
I draw a positive summary.
Max works as a volunteer.
During your volunteer year, you work in several locations.
Where everywhere ?
Quantity: Usually in Steinfurt in the furniture exchange, once a week I help out here in Greven in the furniture bridge.
I also worked at school on an open day.
What is your experience with it?
It’s a beautiful, wide spectrum I see here.
I have to deal with different people, with young people, with refugees, with young adults.
You are now 26 years old, so you are a late volunteer.
How does this come?
I have done Abitur.
And then a construction engineering study, let’s say, successfully terminated.
I realized for myself that it was wrong for me and I wanted to do something different, to work with people.
And then I wondered what you are doing.
Make a social year, there is an insight, you can see how it is on the spot, in the focal point,, really.
And was it so?
I have gathered great impressions.
I will start my social studies in the winter semester.
I will study dual, probably undertake a social worker training at the Herne Youth Office and study at the University of Applied Sciences in Hamm.
Isn’t it unusual to have several different workplaces during volunteering?
Quantity: Yes, it is very variable.
It always depends on where you make your FSJ.
It can be done from old-age homes to youth work – in all possible aspects of social work.
It was very varied with me.
I was also partly in the OGS, i.e. in the afternoon care.
For me, that was exactly what irritated me.
I was able to recognize my own strengths and see how it really goes.
Different from building engineering?
Quantity: Of course, this is not about calculating statistics.
You always have other people in your head, who each have a completely different story behind them.
Whether it’s a refugee or a teenager who has been taken out of the family – you always have to deal with it individually.
very interesting .
Did you have no fear of touch?
Question: I am not the type for that.
It is an area that gives you a lot.
Lots of love, lots of kindness.
There are negative moments, but life is like that.
Pearson cuts 3,000 more jobs and cuts dividends to revive business
British education group Pearson said on Friday it will cut 3,000 more jobs and cut its intermediate dividend by 72 percent as another restructuring program is being launched to overcome the pressure the company is facing.
The job cuts, announced by CEO John Fallon mostly for the end of 2018 and early 2019, are in addition to its previous restructuring, which already lost 4,000 jobs.
In May, in a third cost reduction program, Pearson announced a plan to cut costs by an additional £300 million ($394 million) to revive a business hit by the rapid step towards digital learning.
The company, which sold its stake in Penguin Random House to its partner Bertelsmann last month, said the outlook for the financial year remained unchanged after achieving a 1 percent increase in the first half of the year to £2.05 billion.
Convoy attack in Kabul: NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
A suicide bomber has attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and wounding several others, officials say.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, a NATO statement said.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians were also killed in the incident in Qarabagh district.
The bombing is the last violence that has hit Afghanistan this month – more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Herat on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
A NATO statement said the explosion occurred on Thursday evening when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by an "improvised explosive device carried by people."
The statement said all the wounded are in stable condition and are being treated at the U.S. military hospital at Bagram Airport.
Correspondents say the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so-called Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh is a major concern for NATO troops in nearby Bagram.
According to the United Nations, at least 1,662 civilians were killed in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, about 20% of them in the capital.
At the end of July, a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a predominantly Shiite district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they had carried out the attack.
On May 31, a massive bombing in the city center killed more than 150 people in the country’s deadliest militant attack since U.S.-led troops ousted the Taliban from power in 2001.
The violence underlines the precarious security situation in Afghanistan as U.S. President Donald Trump considers increasing the number of U.S. troops supporting the military and police in the country.
Correspondents say that the suicide attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also caused a crisis of public trust in the government, its policies, and in particular in the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA reverses decision to delay smog rule after lawsuits
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has revoked a decision to delay a regulation by the Obama administration, under which states are obliged to curb smog-causing emissions.This happened a day after 15 states sued the agency for the move.
The EPA announced late on Wednesday its decision to push forward the so-called "Ozone Regulations 2015", saying it demonstrates the agency's commitment to cooperate with states.
"We believe in dialogue with and that we respond to our state partners," EPA chief Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
Pruitt had announced in June the EPA’s intention to delay ozone regulations – which measure pollutant emissions in a part of the country to determine where cuts need to be made to meet stricter air quality standards – by one year until October 2018.
A group of 15 mostly democratic states, along with the District of Colombia, filed a lawsuit on Tuesday, saying the effort was illegal.
President Donald Trump’s administration has sought to push back a wide range of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda to boost economic growth, according to Trump.
However, the efforts have triggered the backstorm of Democrats and nature conservation groups, who are concerned about the impact of greater emissions on public health.
The EPA website says that inhaling air that contains ozone “can reduce lung function and exacerbate respiratory symptoms” such as asthma.
City Council wants community
In the end, the decision was clear: with two votes against, the municipal council of Fluorn-Winzeln decided on the establishment of a community space in the future seniors’ residential facility.
Before the discussion there is an important information: the purchase contract for the still missing part of the plot has been signed, reports Mayor Bernhard Tjaden.
Although it will still take time before the area belonging to the church community is in the ownership of the community, there is no longer a planning obstacle for the project to be chosen by a private investor.
There is a discussion about a community space.
One of the two investors still on the boat has offered to meet the community.
On the ground floor, it would provide a living area - about 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with 70 square meters of area for a special price.
The administration and the majority of the municipal council prefer to provide such a community space not only as a meeting place for the inhabitants of the elderly home, but openly into the municipality.
As an example, the word “strick cafe” made the round.
The decision, which was made prior to allocating funds for the current budget already last autumn, is sweetened by funding opportunities.
The building is in the rehabilitation area.
The establishment of a community space would be eligible, Tjaden reports, with 60 percent of 30 percent.
In order to signal the investor that there is no intention of throwing a knot between his legs in this regard, the proposed decision provides for the observation that both the seat – which is based on the surrounding structure – and the roof – which reduces the height of the roof and makes the construction more economical – would be possible.
Unnecessary, not just Wilfried Sohmer thinks, is this addition.
If it helps, he passes the board unanimously.
It is not so easy in the community.
Daniela Ruf refers to the many own buildings, with which you do not get so straight forward, for this you now lean out of the window at the community room, she says, "I do it hard with it."
Yvonne Staiger is definitely in favor of the community space - but absolutely against municipal participation.
It sees behind it a hidden subsidy to already wealthy or even foreign investors.
This is not the case, because with the acquisition of the area you do not give a subsidy, but get a real, in case of doubt marketable counter-value, is the controversy.
Staiger’s proposal to divide the proposal accordingly finds three supporters.
So it remains with two opposing votes to the original program, which Stefan Haller summarizes as follows: "If we make the decision this way, we will take a huge step to close a huge gap in our infrastructure."
Collision with car: Radler is thrown on the road
At the crossroads of the road, an 82-year-old cyclist was caught by a car in Garath on Wednesday and was seriously injured.
According to the police, the 82-year-old Langenfelder was on the road at 12.20 a.m. on his bicycle on the cycling path of the Schwarzer Weg Straße from the direction of Hilden.
The senior wanted to cross the track at the height of the street Am Buchholzer Busch.
A car driver driving in the same direction gave him priority.
When he walked out of the road, he apparently did not pay attention to the traffic.
He crashed into a car that was driving a 66-year-old woman.
The man was thrown out on the street.
He suffered serious injuries and was taken to a hospital with a rescue car.
FC Bayern Munich must give up on David Alaba and Thiago in the Super Cup against Borussia Dortmund
The Super Cup will take place without him: David Alaba has to suck the match against Dortmund.
With staff concerns, FC Bayern will travel to Dortmund for the first compulsory game of the new season.
Seven professionals are missing the title defender in the Super Cup against the cup winner.
The staff concerns at the German football record champion Bayern Munich will be bigger and bigger before the Supercup on Saturday (20:30 / ZDF and Eurosport) with the cup winner Borussia Dortmund.
Trainer Carlo Ancelotti has to give up on David Alaba in the duel with the BVB.
This was confirmed by the Italian government on Friday.
Also missing are Manuel Neuer, James, Thiago, Jerome Boateng, Arjen Robben and Juan Bernat.
For the five defeats in the last six test games, Ancelotti has blamed the physical condition and the lack of balance in the game of his team.
"We know we're not in the best physical condition," Ancelotti said, adding, "The most important point is the balance in the team.
It was not good at last.”
The 58-year-old, however, believes in an increase in performance in the first official compulsory game of the season.
“Football is also tactics, strategy, personality and motivation.
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities.
The team is ready.
We want to play intelligently,” said Ancelotti, who expects a “difficult, intense game.”
The duel between the two German heavyweight football teams has stunned fans.
The match is sold out with 81,360 spectators, the German Football League (DFL) on Friday.
Walking from star to star
In Harz will be created the first "star path" nationwide.
This is planned by the association Sternwarte Sankt Andreasberg.
There has been a planetary path in Göttingen since 2003.
A "star path" meets the information needs of many harvest visitors, it said.
It combines nature, science, movement and athletic performance.
Members want to set up tables along the planned route and inform about stars and constellations.
In a first phase until 2018, the association plans "well-reachable installations in five to six locations" in Oberharz.
St. Andreasberg, Braunlage, Hohegeiß and Sieber.
The information on the tables should be supplemented via the Internet.
Therefore, a good mobile network reception plays a role in the choice of location.
Accessibility is also a criterion.
Later, the Star Trek will be expanded by train.
“On the Star Path, viewers will learn a lot worth learning, for example, about the physics of the individual stars,” the association said.
They also learned why stars have different colors, or why one star shines more brightly than another, even though it is much further away.
It also indicates in which constellation a selected star is located and when it is best to be seen.
The association has been operating the highest-rise observatory in Northern Germany in the mountain town of St. Andreasberg since 2014.
The location in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six darkest regions in Germany, according to the Federal Office for Conservation of Nature.
Often from there, the Milky Way and even the Andromeda galaxy can be clearly seen with the naked eye.
Since 2003, on the initiative of the Göttingen Planetarium Funding Association, there has been something similar to the planned Star Wars – the Planetary Way.
Starting from Gebhards Hotel in the Goetheallee, which forms the interior of our solar system, the planetary pathway with its stems leads up to Hainberg and the Observatory - as well as a "extraterrestrial" location in Diemarden (Gemeinde Gleichen) with the planet Sedna.
The stems with the individual planets – including Pluto, degraded to a dwarf planet at the end point – are arranged exactly at a distance and scale of one to two billion.
The Earth thus shrinks to a globus of 6.5 millimeters in diameter, while the Sun, which is exactly 75 meters away, is 70 centimeters in diameter.
The total distance of the planet's path is about four kilometers.
While light from the Sun to Pluto takes about eight hours, pedestrians need a good hour to stele with Pluto.
Pedestrians are faster than light in space.
But the march to the next fixed star would take another half a year.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discussing a possible showdown
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who were supposed to stand in a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing fight in the near future under 147 pounds, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms in ESPN offices in Los Angeles until Garcia, the unbeaten World Boxing Council lightweight champion, went down the hallway to welcome Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization super skinweight champion.
Following Garcia’s victory by unanimous decision over former four-division world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday at Showtime, both fighters are members of the top five-pound-for-pound list.
Garcia stretched out his right hand and said, “How are you, champion?
I wish you good luck.”
Lomachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday evening at 19:00 on ESPN.
As the couple posed for photos, Lomachenko manager Egis Klimas noted that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the “perfect size.”
“I’m a former feather weight,” Garcia recalled.
“I got up for Broner [to 140 pounds], but I’m not that big.
I am small for 140.
I want to go down to a light weight.
And he has to move on lightweight [135 pounds] and then we fight.
That is what the fans demand.
Let us give them that.”
Lomachenko agreed.
“Boxing needs this fight.”
Klimas asked if it should be on pay-per-view, part of a strategy that Lomachenko has to fight with a £135 debut this year to agree a date with Garcia next summer (37-0, 30 knockouts) who also has interest in fighting against Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell's winner after their lightweight title battle in the forum on September 23.
"This fight could take place in pay-per-view mode because all fans have asked for it," Garcia said, later expressing himself openly to fight at the network that offers the best financial package.
We are the best.
No other name can generate this kind of attention.
Whenever you are ready...”
Garcia said he appreciates Lomachenko as "an enormous fighter", and he may be taking part in his Saturday fight.
But Lomachenko stopped at the generous praise for Garcia and said that he thinks the triple-fighting champion from Riverside looks “very slow out, sorry Mikey ... you wanted the co-out.”
Garcia said the focus was on showing punch strength, then boxing.
Both said they could feel the momentum building up for their own struggle.
“This is the fight that needs to be fought.
No other fight brings so much attention and enthusiasm.
I’m more than happy to work on it,” Garcia said.
Lomachenko said: “I’ve been waiting for the top fighters, and that’s Mikey.
It will be a great fight.”
Four injured in tire crash
In an accident on the A7 on Thursday afternoon, four people were seriously injured.
According to preliminary information, the driver of an Opel Zafira lost control of his vehicle by 16.30 a.m. shortly before the point of connection Market Breit probably after a tire placement.
The car slid to the right into the bush, where it crashed and then lay on the roof in the green strip.
The four passengers - two adults and two children - were seriously injured in the accident.
During the initial care of the injured by the rescue service, the A7 was closed north for about an hour, after which traffic on the left lane could be passed by at the accident site.
Fortuna Hoffmann: “The triangle works better”
Andre Hoffmann hopes after the 2:2 to the start of the season against Braunschweig that the optimization of the defensive formation brings points to Aue.
With the first game of the season, Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the result, too, if the two opponents had not been at 2:2 against Braunschweig.
"These were two tournaments too much, and we have to be even more careful in Aue," says the defense player of Fortuna Düsseldorf.
In the Erzgebirge, the triangle chain should also be further optimized.
And a goal after a free kick, the fortunes do not want to catch themselves anymore.
For the future, it will be that no one will stand on the line next to Michael (Rensing).
Hoffmann is convinced that even after the experience in preparation, his team will be able to cope better with the triangle than with the four-chain.
"I still don't know how we will act in Aue," says his coach Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is confident in his case, "because we have players in the semi-positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann who can build up well," Hoffmann said.
"The prerequisite is, however, that we harmonize even better and we do not allow ourselves to make so many playback mistakes in the construction."
Of course, Hoffmann also travels to Aue to win the game.
"Whether you can talk about a failed start after a draw, I don't know.
The performance could be fine,” Hoffmann said.
“But if we can stand up with four points on Sunday and focus on the cup, we will be able to talk about a good start to the season.”
The coach didn’t want to know about it.
"I only judge the start into the season after six to eight game days," said Friedhelm Funkel, who does not want to talk about an advantage over Aue, just because the game of the Saxons in Heidenheim had to be cancelled prematurely due to a storm.
"Now they can start the season almost with a home game," Funkel said, and Hoffmann believes that the players from Aue might even be a little fresher as they don't have a tough and complete game like Fortuna against an ascension favourite in the bones.
"But they don't know 100% where they are right now," Fortuna's defender said.
However, the guests from the Rhineland will be the easiest favourite on Sunday to meet in the finally (almost) finished stadium of Aue.
"That we wipe them away just because we have the claim to be among the first six is nonsense," says Funkel, whose balance is quite positive with only one defeat against Aue from nine games.
“There is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga that you have to beat from the start,” explains Fortuna’s head coach.
"To make such a statement would be arrogant and overbearing."
And so Funkel does not want to see his players on Sunday.
New results of Swedish asylum age assessment tests
Recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden who have undergone a new method of medical assessment of their age show that more than 80 percent of those tested are older than 18 years old.
The Swedish Forensic Medicine Authority (Rättsmedicinalverket) began carrying out the tests last year.
During the asylum procedure, they are to make the age assessment more accurate after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticized for mistakes in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were minors.
To date, Migrationsverket has submitted 6,880 cases for testing and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from mid-March to 31 July 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were rated 18 or older, while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency rated that the person was “possibly 18 years or older.”
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person “possibly is under 18 years old.”
The tests are carried out only in cases where the age of the person is questioned.
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results have been consistent over the past few months.
"We don't see much difference in the statistics of the past months, the figures are pretty constant," he told The Local magazine.
The high percentage of cases in which the person was judged to be over 18 does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker lied about his or her age.
In May, the agency published the results of 581 tests and said there are 442 cases that “suggest that the person being examined is 18 years old or older.”
When the Svenska Dagbladet newspaper examined the 581 published results, it found that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that he would be 18 this year.
The method of medical age assessment, in which x-rays of wisdom teeth and MRIs of knee joints are taken, which are then analyzed by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticized in some areas.
One skeptic is endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose work includes assessing the biological maturity of people to see if they went through puberty sooner or later than usual.
“I had reason to think about it, and I don’t think the type of measurement should be used.
Assessing biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can’t say it for sure, we shouldn’t pretend we could,” he told Metro.
However, Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests: “In general, you can say that the risk of misjudging a child as an adult is low.
The biggest risk is when the person is just under 18, in this case, that’s about 10 percent.”
Full of Plan
The work on the three bridges of Landstraße 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is progressing well.
On Wednesday, a seven-ton concrete part was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach.
“We are very good at the time, it’s going great,” says Reinhold Leicht, building manager at the Department of Road Management and Transport at the Freiburg government office.
In April, works began simultaneously on all three bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach.
The construction is scheduled for October and it is easy to make sure that the schedule is kept.
The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads over the Trombach.
It is a bow-bound bridge made of concrete, which is covered with red colored sandstone and has a total length of 4.80 meters.
It was built in 1900.
Like the other two bridges, it has now entered the years.
To ensure the stability and traffic safety, the three structures are now being thoroughly renovated.
The other two bridges lead over the Lauterbach.
It is made of red buntsandstone.
Both were built in 1939 and are twelve or 10.60 meters long.
The bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach has now received on Wednesday morning on the northern side a 1.30 meter wide and seven tons heavy so-called bridge cap.
This is an edge fixation, which is also used as an operating path.
On the southern part of the bridge, a 2.20-meter-wide bridge cap will be installed on Friday.
This should be the pedestrian path.
The special thing is that these are finished parts, a patent of the Schramberger company Dizwo.
The other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps.
A special sense of fingertips has required the laying of lines through the construction site in Lauterbach.
Because there is also a fiberglass cable, to which many companies are connected.
Residents were informed by handwriting about the project prior to the work.
In addition, fish and crabs had to be caught.
For the bridges between the Bauhof building and the collector in the direction of Schramberg, traffic is regulated by a lightning line.
For the construction work on the bridge at the Lauterbacher entrance, the road in the area of the bridge at the level of the hotels "Tannenhof" and "Sieben Linden" is completely closed.
The total cost of the three bridge renovations is 700,000 euros.
It is financed by the country.
AfD in Gerolstein: Bunter protest at German potato salad
It is not so common for parties to strike together, but when it comes to the Alternative for Germany (AfD), it comes together, which is otherwise difficult to put together.
The parties represented in the Circular Day (CDU, SPD, Greens, FDP, FWG, Left) belong to a broad alliance that peacefully displays the flag on that day because the AfD invites Rondell to the loud poster "great election campaign opening act" in the Gerolsteiner town hall.
And it brings well-known names to the start – such as Alice Weidel, who together with Alexander Gauland forms the top duo for the Bundestag elections on September 24, and the deputy federal chairwoman Beatrix von Storch.
But those who are already there hours before the event start, do not want to listen to the AfD learners, but to demonstrate.
The motto is “The Eifel remains colourful”.
The city picnic was originally planned under the motto “Everyone at one table” on the Fountain Square, but now takes place on the parking lot below the Rondell – and thus directly in front of those who come to the AfD event in the Town Hall.
A beautiful picture that is presented here.
And what Christa Karoli, chairman of the One World Forum and one of the leading organizers, really rejoices: “Happy how many people have gathered here.”
There is music and a lot of food, including a “German potato salad that even the AfD could easily eat,” says the woman who brought it.
The police have ordered many officials to Gerolstein, they show presence especially also at the train station, which is just a few meters from the venues.
How did the AfD get to Gerolstein?
Mario Hompes of the AfD Vulkaneifel reports that he has sought such an event and received the award.
The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf had initially requested in Daun, but there was rejected because of the already built Laurentiuskirme there were not enough parking spaces.
Now the Rondell, Hompes is pleased that "we can have such a beautiful event here".
Looking at the event in the Rondell Square, he says: "This is the good right of the people, the main thing, it remains peaceful."
This is also the case: Around 8 p.m. a band provides entertainment at the Rondell Vorplatz, in the town hall various speakers, including the Rhine-Pfalz AfD chairman Uwe Junge.
There are about 200 listeners in the hall waiting for the top candidate for the Bundestag elections, Alice Weidel, and the deputy federal president Beatrix von Storch to speak.
The police presence remains unchanged, but so far the officers have had a quiet evening.
The AfD event lasts a little more than an hour, the guests at the front square have a longer breath, but there is also the trend to clean up shortly after 21:00.
The police can break down - no special incidents.
The sound hits the trumpet
A repeat with Wolfacher Posaunist Frederic Belli is in the series of Haslacher monastery concerts tomorrow, Sunday, at 20am in the monastery church.
Together with the Bulgarian trumpeter Miroslav Petkov, he gives a concert under the motto "Black Sea meets Black Forest", or even "Balkan folklore" meets a classical German education with roots in blastic music.
Both soloists are winners and prize winners in numerous international competitions and have held solo positions in top European orchestras.
Petkov is solotrompeter at the prestigious Concertgebouw Orchestra Amsterdam and Frederic Belli is soloposaunist of the SWR Symphony Orchestra.
Both combine the desire not only to cross the boundaries on their instruments, but also to merge the boundaries of different genres.
Thus, Johann Sebastian Bach sounds in the two as if in a new suit, Daniel Schnyders “world music” unites with Bulgarian folklore, and in the piece “Exchange Suite” by the jazz prize winner Nils Wogram, classics, jazz and free play blend into a fascinating overall work of art.
This core piece of the program was launched in Freiburg this spring with enormous success.
The renowned composer Nils Wogram wrote it specifically for the two musicians and more: the Haslacher Monastery Church with its special acoustics is deliberately included in the concert.
Kristen Stewart talks about her bisexuality
“Some people love grilled cheese and will eat it for the rest of their lives.
But I want to try everything," Kristen Stewart said openly about her bisexuality.
"Once I bite in grilled cheese, I think, 'Oh that was cool, what's next?'"
Per the most famous relationship of the Hollywood star was that with her "Twilight" colleague Robert Pattinson, who eventually broke up bitterly.
The actress told Harper’s Bazaar magazine: “I was seriously in love with everyone I’ve dated.
Or do you think I played it?”
After her separation, Kristen admitted that she was bisexual: “I’ve always lived in dualism and seriously believed in it.
So it has never confused or hindered me.
I never liked being taken seriously.”
She suffered especially, according to "Bang Showbiz", but in school, when she preferred to dress like a bub: "Not all girls are typical girls.
That really hurt me.
When I was eleven, the kids told me I was going to look like a bub.
I really felt attacked, scared and ashamed.
Now I look back and think, “Girl, be proud of you!”
Especially to the public, she doesn’t like to explain her love life: “People expect you to behave in a certain way and that annoys me.
And maybe some will call me ungrateful, but I don’t like having to justify myself in front of the whole public.”
West Virginia Governor Announces He's Changing Party
The Democratic Governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced on Thursday evening at a rally with President Trump that he would change the party.
Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have moved away from me," Justice Governor said.
“Today I will tell you with many prayers and much reflection ... today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia, I can’t help you anymore if I’m a democratic governor.”
The demonstration broke out in jubilation.
"Tomorrow I will change my registration to the Republicans," Justice added.
"As a coach, I would say it's time to play a different game."
Mr. Trump previously promised a big announcement at the West Virginia Rally.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia with 42 points, and Justice did not endorse Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who according to Forbes is the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states, and he inherited a coal business from his father.
It is worth approximately $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee issued a statement on Thursday evening saying, “The change of Governor Justice’s party is another blow to a Democratic party that would rather hinder us than work to make our country great again.”
“With only 15 governments and the control of the least legislative bodies in history, the announcement of Governor Justice is just the final rejection of a party that is without leadership from top to bottom and unable to find a positive, unifying message,” RNC chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.
Coe praises "honest" Russian apology for doping scandal
World athletics chief Sebastian Coe praised on Thursday what he described as an obvious excuse from Russia for a doping scandal, but repeated that it was not the time for the country to be re-introduced into the sport.
Russia's athletics chief Dmitry Shylakhtin said during the IAAF congress on the eve of the athletics world championships that the ban of his country from the sport was correct and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said he’s sorry for “all the athletes who were stripped of gold and silver medals in competitions.”
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted to maintain the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
“I thought it was a very open response today, a very honest presentation,” IAAF President Coe told reporters.
“The entire Council and Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognized in itself that it has experienced some pretty hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is being redesigned.”
Coe said he was also " pleased" that Russia accepts the criteria for its reintroduction.
"I think it was a very constructive day, and I think progress has been made, but Congress supports the Task Force's recommendations that this is not the time to re-use Russia," Coe said.
"We need to do everything in the coming months to normalize this situation.
The guiding principle has always been that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the corrupt system," he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes will compete as neutral players at the World Athletics Championships, which begin in London on Friday, according to the strict IAAF criteria.
The head of the IAAF Task Force, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia still has to meet some of the criteria for a resumption.
Drug tests are still inadequate and banned trainers are still working freely, he told reporters in London after a lecture at the IAAF Council.
Commemoration of soldiers killed in Mali
At a funeral ceremony in Fritzlar, northern Hesse, around 1,000 people commemorated the two soldiers killed in a helicopter crash in Mali.
The ceremony took place in the cathedral on Thursday under high security precautions.
The defence minister Ursula von der Leyen (CDU) said nothing.
She described the two dead pilots as "knowers of their field."
“We bow to this highest sacrifice they have made in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany,” she said.
The 33-year-old Major and the 47-year-old Chief of Staff from North Hesse were killed on Wednesday, a week ago in West African Mali.
Their coffins were transferred to Germany and brought to the Fritzlarer Dom Sankt Peter on Thursday, accompanied by a death guard of the Bundeswehr.
At noon, only the family members of the church said goodbye.
After that, the funeral ceremony began in the circle of family, close friends, representatives of the Bundeswehr and politics.
Among them were Hessen’s Prime Minister Volker Bouffier (CDU) and Bundeswehr General Inspector Volker Wieker.
The mourning guests laid down roses, the relatives stood arm-in-arm at the baskets.
In front of the church, Fritzlarers and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas.
Defense Minister von der Leyen described the dead soldiers as "highly decorated" and operational.
The Chief of Staff had built up the flight operations of the Tiger combat helicopter in Fritzlar and was one of the first six trained Tiger pilots of his regiment.
Volker Bauersachs, commander of the regiment to which the soldiers belong, also stated: "If this crew could not prevent the crash, then no one would have been able to do so."
Minister von der Leyen did not show doubts about the UN mission in Mali: the operation is dangerous.
But it is also of great importance "for a country from which we are only separated by two states," she said.
After the funeral, the coffin was taken out of the cathedral.
When and where they will be buried, the Bundeswehr did not provide any details.
Prince Henrik doesn’t want a grave next to his wife
Danish Queen Margrethe’s husband, Prince Henrik, will not be buried next to his wife after his death.
This was announced by the Royal House on Thursday.
Traditionally, the Danish royal couple is buried in the cathedral of Roskilde.
The sculptor Bjørn Nørgaard already made a sarcophagus for the two.
The Queen agreed with her husband's decision, the statement said.
Where Prince Henrik will be buried is unclear.
He has no intention of being buried in his homeland.
Prince Henrik had never made a heal of the fact that he was not happy with his title.
After his wife Margrethe ascended to the throne in 1972, he would have wanted to become king.
In 2016, he retired and also gave up the title "Prinzgemahl".
Since Henrik did not get the title and function he wanted in Denmark, he does not see himself as equivalent to his wife - even after his death, said Lene Balleby, the chief spokeswoman for the Danish royal family.
Where the 83-year-old will eventually retire is unclear.
But he does not intend to be buried in his homeland in France, but in Denmark.
He loves the country he has worked for for the last 50 years.
The native Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, son of a French nobility, had met Margrethe in London in 1965.
He worked at the French embassy in the Thames.
While his later wife always attracted sympathy from the people, Prince Henrik had a heavy standing with the Danes in his 50-year reign.
In an autobiography, Henrik stated about his first years in Denmark: “A few months after my arrival, everything I did was criticized.
My Danish was fluctuating, I preferred wine instead of beer, silk socks instead of strands, Citroën instead of Volvo, tennis instead of football.
Even for the Gauloises, whom I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco, and who in this country had the reputation of being the brand of society-critical intellectuals, I could not hope for tolerance.
I was different.
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not to be ashamed.
It was two mistakes!”
Prime Minister wants new elections
CDU and FDP vote for majority in Lower Saxony
Lower Saxony Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) is in favour of a quick new elections to the Landtag after losing the red-green government majority, but he does not want to resign.
He voted for the dissolution of Parliament on Friday.
Previously, the surprising departure of a Greens MP from their Lower Saxony parliamentary group had plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a severe crisis.
Five months before the official date of the parliamentary elections, the red-green coalition in Hannover thus lost its scarce one-vote majority in parliament to the opposition from CDU and FDP.
The previous Greens MP Elke Twesten justified her move by not being nominated for the 2018 election in her electoral district in Rotenburg (Wümme).
“I see my political future in the CDU,” she said in Hannover on Friday.
CDU leader Björn Thümler is recommending his party to join the group.
The CDU and FDP would have 69 seats in the Lower Saxony Landtag, while the SPD and the Greens would have 68 seats.
So far, the ratio has been the opposite.
The new Landtag will be elected on the 14th of January of next year.
Thümler said the red-green government must now decide whether it can continue to rule in this situation without a majority.
Stephan Weil, however, considers it indispensable that the Landtag decides on its self-dissolution as soon as possible.
The CDU group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday.
The country’s constitution also provides for the possibility for the Landtag to withdraw the confidence of the prime minister and elect a successor.
“Our constitution offers several options.
These possibilities must be legally clearly examined,” Thümler said.
“All issues will be discussed in peace if they are legally reasonably examined.”
Thümler called Twest’s step “doch something kuri”.
She said: “I am not a traitor.
I feel very well.”
She called herself a black-green supporter.
The Greens called on the abdicating MPs to return their parliamentary mandate.
“We assume, of course, that she will return her parliamentary mandate, which she received on the green list, with immediate effect,” said Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner.
Anja Piel, the group’s leader, said: “We regret Elke Twesten’s decision.”
She has consciously decided not to conduct a debate in the group.
“Even given that there were no differences in content, we can’t understand this step.”
SPD Chancellor candidate Martin Schulz condemns the transfer of the Lower Saxony Green MP Elke Twesten to the CDU as betrayal.
“The behavior of the former Greens MPs in Lower Saxony is not only a betrayal of the voters, but also a betrayal of the Red and Green,” he wrote on Facebook.
He supports the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) to have the Landtag re-elected quickly.
The exit of Twesten costs red-green in Lower Saxony the majority.
In her wounded vanity and frustration, she puts her personal interests before the good of the country," SPD Secretary-General Hubertus Heil said.
“It is a scandal that the CDU in Lower Saxony is taking part in this dirty play of intrigue and is trying to make political capital out of it.”
Lower Saxony CDU leader Björn Thümler wants to recommend his MPs to include Elke Twesten in the CDU.
The SPD leader in the Bundestag, Thomas Oppermann, accused Twesten of falsifying the results of the 2013 parliamentary elections with personal career thoughts.
The CDU was the strongest force before the SPD at the time, but the SPD and the Greens had a thin majority of one vote in the Landtag.
Minister of Agriculture in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from poisonous eggs, Mr Schmidt?
Germany is talking about contaminated eggs.
How did the scandal happen?
How can consumers protect themselves?
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt (CSU) is speaking and answering in an interview with the editorial network Germany (RND).
How can consumers protect themselves from poisoned eggs?
I can only encourage all consumers to look closely at the eggs in their refrigerator and check the stamp.
On the consumer protection portal www.alimensmittelwarnung.de, the federal states publish the latest information on the ovum batches concerned.
Affected eggs should be destroyed or returned.
Also, if, according to everything we currently know, a health hazard is practically excluded.
Is Aldi now taking over the best possible crisis response – all the eggs out of the supply – because the central role of the educator is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture?
Food control is the responsibility of the federal states.
Nevertheless, my house immediately opened up and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since Germany became known.
All information and risk assessment are available to consumers.
Commerce, as well as manufacturers, must ensure that the products sold are safe and safe for health.
If the maximum residue content of 0.005 mg/kg is exceeded, eggs are not circulating.
However, unloaded eggs can be sold and eaten.
This time it is not the company’s fault.
Are producers and consumers in the same boat?
According to current knowledge, the production enterprises are not directly guilty.
Rather, they have to expect economic damage due to alleged illegal practices by service companies.
As always, there are too few controllers in serious cases.
Is it just a lack of staff or a lack of competence?
It was the official controls that revealed this.
The truth, however, is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be 100% ruled out.
This is precisely why a consistent investigation of such events and the handing over to prosecutors in cases where criminal offences may exist are crucial.
I have made it clear several times that I expect a complete clarification from the responsible authorities.
Is regular alarming in food scandals really necessary?
Consumers have the right to receive only safe and viable foods.
When an unapproved insecticide is used in the food industry, consumers are rightly upset.
The packed funds have put manufacturers, dealers and consumers in a situation that is absolutely unnecessary.
In principle, it must be clear: the unlawful use of the insecticide Fipronil in the keeping of food-suppliing animals is unacceptable and must be stopped immediately.
This needs to be done consistently and with high pressure at all levels.
I expect all competent authorities to clarify the matter quickly and thoroughly.
How Football’s Financial Rules Affect Neymar’s Movement to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unhindered spending by European football clubs will not interfere with Neymar’s world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to French Paris-Saint Germain.
Some consequences will still come for Paris Saint-Germain from UEFA, as the leading organization that oversees the European game has the power to ban teams from accessing the prestigious Champions League tournament.
Financial fair play rules introduced by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG must at some point prove that Neymar’s transfer was financed without major losses.
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ($262 million) to buy the Brazilian out of his contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will be several tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to France.
PSG can loosen the money for Neymar to sign and take him to a galaxy of other stars, given the team’s funding by the energy-rich ruling family of Qatar.
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on acquiring players, but must deal with legitimate sources of income that will allow them to break-even in their football-related business.
FFP was conceived by Michel Platini after his election to the presidency of UEFA in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs that had taken on huge debts in their quest for success effectively cheated and risked ruining themselves if banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, FFP moved from focusing on club debt to monitoring their losses.
The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich originally used in 2003 at Chelsea — buying a club with potential and then investing heavily to improve the team and build a global brand — would become a harder matter.
During the current three-year FFP funding period, which runs until 2018, clubs can bear losses of €30 million.
And despite Platini’s disappointment from the presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor, Aleksander Ceferin, continues to strive to deter excessive spending.
“Certainly, FFP is not dead and we will definitely tighten the rules for the future,” Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for FFP at UEFA, told The Associated Press last week.
Although PSG has paid Neymar’s buy-out clause in a flat rate, it can distribute the amount for billing over the duration of his contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so that the disbursement amount for the next five years of €44.4 million can be disclosed in the annual accounts.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 hit PSG along with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the toughest sanctions.
PSG received a fine of €60 million (then $82 million), which was later reduced to €20 million - and ordered that team members for the 2014/15 Champions League season remain limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players.
UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to override their financial oversight by inflating their revenues from companies associated with the owners of a club.
While a Qatar company could sponsor PSG if the value of the sponsorship exceeded the standard market rates, UEFA would not allow this to be considered legitimate income.
That’s exactly what happened in 2014, when UEFA decided that the value of PSA’s sponsorship was blown up by the Qatar Tourism Authority.
It has been that part of PSG payments to Neymar could come through payments from the 2022 World Cup organizing committee in Qatar.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 have denied that Neymar will become World Cup ambassador and such a manoeuvre could be easy to find out for UEFA regulators.
The previous sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be even more careful to observe any attempt to circumvent the rules.
UEFA did not have any preparatory talks with PSG about Neymar's transfer, people familiar with the situation said on Thursday.
They spoke on condition of anonymity to The Associated Press, as they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.
The latest published reports show that PSG 2015/16 has made a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of €542.4 million.
The accounts for the last fiscal year have yet to be published.
PSG expects Neymar’s arrival to be a blessing for sponsorship deals, merchandising and jersey sales.
The association expects that sales will increase by at least 30 percent after signing.
The Spanish league was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players go, and they tried to prevent Neymar from leaving by claiming that PSG would hurt the FFP.
"It's a clear case of 'financial doping' with the club and the state," La Liga president Javier Tebas told the Spanish daily AS regarding Qatar's final ownership of PSG.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports tycoon, shares La Liga’s reservations against a state funding a club.
"It's the consequence of ownership and that has completely changed the entire football landscape over the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
Once a country has a club, anything is possible.
It will be very difficult to respect financial fair play because you can go different paths or have different interests when a country has such a big player to represent a country.”
Swiss is looking for a new shoggle supplier
In recent years, Chocolat Frey has produced board chocolate for the Swiss.
Now the sweet cooperation is facing a possible end: the airline is re-writing the order.
Swiss spokeswoman Meike Fuhlrott confirmed a corresponding report by the newspaper "Nordwest Switzerland" on Friday at the request of the news agency sda.
According to current planning, the airline will sign a new contract in the first half of 2018.
The products would be reviewed every two to three years and subjected to quality control.
"We are very satisfied with the current supplier Chocolat Frey," the spokeswoman said.
Approximately 17 million small, red-and-white-packed 14-gram shuttle plates are distributed annually by flight crews to passengers before landing.
About the cost, the Swiss did not want to give any information.
Industry insiders estimate the volume of orders according to "Northwest Switzerland" at 1.5 to 2 million francs - the Migros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of around one billion francs.
But more important is the advertising effect: for a shoe manufacturer, it is a prestigious assignment.
How many applicants there are in the new tender, the Swiss does not want to reveal.
Only Swiss manufacturers are involved.
According to the newspaper report, Chocolat Frey will work to renew the contract beyond the spring of 2018.
The SDA was unable to reach the largest Swiss chocolate producer for an opinion.
The Swiss has been distributing chocolate tables on board its flights since 2006.
Before the Swiss signed a contract with the Migros subsidiary, Barry Callebaut had supplied the chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hug.
The possibility of placing the logo was introduced by Swiss two and a half years ago with the start of the collaboration with Chocolat Frey.
The airline cooperates with various Swiss chocolate producers.
On long-haul flights, customers in the First Class will be delighted with delicacies from the Confiserie Sprüngli, in the Business Class passengers will be succeeded by Schoggi from Lindt and in the Economy Class Schoggi from Chocolat Frey.
Also on the short distance, Swiss Schoggi is distributed by Chocolat Frey, both in the Business and Economy Class.
Athletics - Diskus Olympic winner Robert Harting reaches the World Cup final
The three-time world champion will fight for a medal in the final on Saturday.
His brother Christoph, the 2016 Olympic winner, failed in the national World Cup selection and could only watch the Diskus competition from the tribune.
Also with the first attempt, the Polish title defender Piotr Malachowski, who threw 65.13 meters, qualified for the final fight.
Nostalgia goes into niche in "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective"
This repeat of the story is nostalgic at the same time for the glorious days of the characters of the 80s, for the 90s grunge era (when the forerunners David Wain and Michael Showalter shot the sketch comedy "The State" for MTV), and for themselves - that is, for 2001, before their stars, such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler, and Paul Rudd went to bigger things.
As a cultural artifact, it is both a parody and an embodiment of our Facebook-enabled era of permanent memories.
But as a franchise, it feels like time is short.
"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not just because of its absurd humor (it contained an original story for a talking bowl of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).
Sticking to the core of the gage — middle-aged actors playing coveted children who are growing up — they still managed to overcome the impossibility of winning back the last part of the joke.
"Ten Years Later," with his adults now playing adults, is less emotionally rooted and his parody goes more on the cast-canned principle, including a rift to the 1990s Stalker films like "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle."
At one point, a character scrolls through an Apple powerbook, some inline scatters, and “a series of other things from 1991.”
Many of the central stories are the same.
The adorable Coop (Mr. Showalter), now a novelist, has still not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) has not lost his virginity yet.
And there’s another crazy-evil plot involving Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter) now supported by George H. W. Bush (a well-successful impression by Michael Ian Black).
As always, the excursions are the best part of the franchise.
It’s fun to see the forever young Mr. Rudd showcasing Matt Dillon’s lower lip beard from “Singles,” whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy now feels like an old cracker.
It’s the moments of random madness that could inspire this franchise like a sort of repeating “Seven Up!” series until it reaches what I assume is its logical conclusion: “Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later,” whose final scene will show the band as they attend the film premiere of “Wet Hot American Summer.”
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon, meanwhile, now reminds of a different kind of nostalgia: the revival of the Cold War of "The Americans", the film "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW" with its East-to-West ring fight iconography.
Created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, the comedy with Rhys Thomas as director claims to be a found TV series: a Romanian drama of the eighties with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest fighting for truth, atheism and the way of Marxism-Leninism.
The main roles - a hard-cut Gregor and an idealist Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, whose dialogues are synchronized in English by Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It is a genius idea.
But it is not much more than an idea.
There are some nice gags to watch (the police spend time watching chess on television, as Americans might do with football).
And the list of famous speakers—including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny—makes for a decent ‘Find the Voice’ game.
But "Comrade Detective" is so committed to the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer wearing a Reagan mask is involved - that it often plays like a single one.
With six long episodes, it pulls on, and the comedy is not fast or frequent enough.
"Comrade Detective," edited to a shorter length, could better deliver his Agitprop satire as Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the American embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two fat men swallowing a bunch of hamburgers.
The message to the imaginary communist audience is that Western culture can make anything for food for a bargain.
The fictional Romanian creators were not wrong: we even do it with our own recent history and with their own.
Drugs mafia in the country
Police have successfully struck the Italian mafia in Baden-Württemberg.
On Wednesday morning, numerous objects were searched in the Schwarzwald-Baar district, in Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, according to the public prosecutor's office of Konstanz on Friday.
Fifteen defendants aged between 25 and 77 were arrested and arrest warrants have already been issued against them.
Officials also seized large amounts of marijuana and cocaine, firearms and several hundred thousand euros.
During the raids in Italy, two people were arrested.
The two suspects were detained by German authorities.
Both are likely to be extradited to Germany.
Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the operation.
Over 300 police officers were involved.
Members of the mafia are charged with organized drug crime, serious acts of violence, attempted murder, as well as robbery and blackmail.
Since the summer of 2016, the Prosecutor’s Office of Konstanz has been investigating organized drug trafficking in the southern German region.
There was an intense exchange between the prosecutors' offices in Constance and Palermo, and the investigators of Kripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.
Therefore, the large operation on Wednesday morning was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo.
The investigations targeted Italian nationals with close ties to the Italian mafia.
Also an incident on May 27 in Hüfingen, in which several shots were fired at a restaurant early in the morning, is likely to go to the account of the gang.
Greater gaps in foreign registration
"Data of citizens who should not appear there": According to a report, the foreign register in Germany has significant shortcomings.
This leads to some serious errors in asylum procedures.
The Commissioner for Refugee Management of the Federal Government, Frank-Jürgen Weise, has pointed to large gaps in the Central Register of Foreigners.
Defects in the data registered there could lead to "partly serious misdecisions" in asylum procedures and deportations, warned Wayne in an analysis available to the "Süddeutsche Zeitung".
The register includes 10 million foreign nationals, including approximately 5.7 million from non-EU countries.
The data is managed by about 600 foreign authorities in Germany.
Because the data has not been properlyined, the data quality has not been good in some parts so far.
In individual cases, data from 1921 were found, "of people who are no longer alive, or of citizens who have become German citizens and should no longer appear in the register."
"False data entry can significantly slow back processes," the report said.
The statistics on people who are required to leave include EU citizens who would not have to leave at all.
Such erroneous assignments, however, led to "a distorted debate on the treatment of expatriates," according to the analysis.
Meanwhile, the German government has apparently begun sending refugee families with children under the age of 16 back to Italy once they have arrived from there.
This is stated in an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), reports the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung".
According to the paper, the BAMF is carrying out such procedures "with respect to families with children - with the exception of infants and toddlers - to Italy since June 1, 2017".
Since the end of 2014, this was practically impossible, according to the newspaper, citing the difficult situation on the ground.
In accordance with the Dublin Agreement, the first country to which refugees arrive is responsible.
If a migrant continues to travel to another EU country, that country may send him back to the country of entry.
In response, the office said: “In the meantime, the accommodation capacity for families with underage children in Italy has increased significantly.”
Italy has given guarantees for the accommodation and accommodation of families.
Even the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) considers these commitments sufficient.
Other EU countries would also send refugees back there under the Dublin Agreement.
Ulla Jelpke, spokeswoman for domestic politics in the Bundestag, criticized the decision: “Families with children are threatening to accept conditions that are contrary to human rights and a threat to the best interests of children because of the flaws in the Italian asylum system.”
Second best result
A total of 220 liters of blood from people living in Oberreichenbach were already made available to other people by the blood donation service.
At least of the 12 citizens who were awarded on Friday.
First of all, Jürgen Greule, who has now shared 50 liters of blood with his 100 donations.
Traditionally, at the meeting of the municipal council, the municipality recognizes the multiple willingness to donate blood.
"It is brilliant how our bodies are designed for this and we respect donors who provide their blood for strangers, even unselfishly," said Mayor Karlheinz Kistner.
"A single blood donation helps several people," explained the head of the German Red Cross (DRC), Holger Maisenbacher, because the canned beans are broken down into their components.
Three people can benefit from a blood donation.
At the same time, Maisenbacher about the actions that will be carried out in Oberreichenbach in the spring.
"This year we achieved the second best result with 114 donors," said the DRC district preparedness manager.
Evidently, the change to the theatre house a few years ago led to a higher number of participants.
Before that, Thomas Bockstadt, Susanne Reichle, Sandra Schöck, Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer were among the multiple donors and were awarded for 50 blood donations each.
Half as many were recorded by Herbert Mair and Dorothee Riexinger, while Tamara Pfrommer, Petra Schleeh, Stefanie Stoll and Uwe Vetter gave ten times each 500 milliliters of their life juice.
The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and weakening inflation have dampened speculation about a rise.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain “stable” as itins interest rates on family income amid increasing pressure.
The bank’s Monetary Committee (MPC) policymakers voted 6 to 2 in favour of keeping interest rates at 0.25%, with fewer members aiming for an increase this month as weak economic growth has weakened support for an increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7% and for 2018 to 1.6% and warned that pressures on household incomes would continue, with inflation expected to rise to just under 3% in autumn.
But she signaled that interest rate increases would be needed in the coming years to curb the inflation fueled by Brexit, and she said the cost of loans may have to rise more than expected in the financial markets.
Members also voted to withdraw part of the Mammut Conjuncture Package issued a year ago after Brexit.
It will take time for the funding plan to provide cheaper funding to banks starting next February, although it has been said that it is now expected to provide £15 billion more under this scheme - with £115 billion.
Minutes after the decision on the interest rate, the bank said: “In the central forecast of the MPC, gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak in the short term as the pressure on real household incomes continues to burden consumption.”
Regarding interest rates, she repeated that “some tightening of monetary policy” would be needed to cool down inflation and a “slightly greater” scale than the markets expect.
Markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
The bank, however, stressed that increases would be “gradually” and “limited.”
The Bank’s downward-adjusted growth forecasts for this and next year are compared to the 1.9% and 1.7% forecasts in May.
It hasined its growth forecast at 1.8% in 2018.
The pound fell after these news against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell 0.5 percent to $1.31 and fell 0.4 percent to €1.11.
The decision remains unchanged after the latest disappointing growth figures dampened rising expectations for interest rate increases and GDP increased from 0.2% in the previous three months to 0.3% in the second quarter.
Growth is expected to be 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will recover slightly by the end of the year, according to the bank.
The latest inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households affected by rising inflation and slight wage increases as the sharpening will first get worse before it will then get better.
She added that monetary policy cannot “prevent” income decline in the coming years, but added that wages will “significantly” recover at the end of her three-year forecast.
The economy will also be strengthened by rising demand for British goods, which is due to the weak pound, which will offset part of the lower consumer spending.
The decision comes a year after the interest rate was lowered to 0.25% last August following the shocking EU vote that caused the pound to drop.
The bank estimates that it will probably take four years before it fully reaches prices and the economy.
Prior to the bank’s latest ruling on interest rates, the call for an interest rate hike had risen as inflation increased the pressure on heavily pressured households, with three policy makers calling for a hike to 0.5% in July.
Inflation dropped last month from 2.9% in June to 2.6% despite the bank saying it was expected and will pull it back in the coming months.
The bank said the excess in relation to its 2% target was "entirely" attributable to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, director at Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: “Given the recent drop in swap rates, the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again as lenders loudly look for deals and want to end the year in a positive way.
The market looks good for those where existing deals expire and the new mortgages close, and many with free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular.”
NHS to prescribe controversial HIV drug to 10,000 people
Patients will be given access to "transformative" HIV prevention treatment from September after a fight before the High Court against funding the drug in the NHS.
NHS England announced that a pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) taken before sexual intercourse, which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 percent, is now being delivered by the health service through a first three-year study of an estimated 10,000 people.
He agreed to fund the process after the Court of Appeal confirmed a Supreme Court ruling last year that the NHS had the authority to pay for PrEP despite the claim that local authorities should fund it.
The chess move announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England chief Simon Stevens as an “important new intervention,” while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described it as a “decisive moment.”
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to enable people to register, and more clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced across England in April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a consequence of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission among people at risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before sexual intercourse means that just enough drugs are present in a person’s body to prevent HIV infection.
Such medications can be taken every day or so two hours before sexual intercourse.
Those eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transgender men and people with HIV-positive partners who have not been successfully treated.
Clinics will identify suitable participants who agree to the study, including men, women, transgender people and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment.
People who live in England and are registered with a general practitioner can also sign up for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic.
The program will cost £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to supply the drugs this week following an international competitive procurement.
The study aims to assess the full potential of PrEP by gathering clinical evidence on how it is targeted, captured, and implemented on a large scale.
Stevens said: “This major new intervention should complement and surpass the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in more than three decades of progress in addressing one of humanity’s biggest health challenges.”
Deborah Gold, Chief Executive at NAT (National Aids Trust), said: “This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, when targeted at needy and vulnerable people, offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic.
Starting in September, people at high risk for HIV will have access to this NHS-funded experiment in England to develop a new tool that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner, leading to the improvement of many, many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement.”
Ian Green, Chairman of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: “The priority now has to be that the study is carried out quickly across the country and that no one at risk for HIV is left behind.
Now that the PrEP test medicine has been obtained, we are on the best track to protect more than 10,000 HIV-infected people.”
Sharon Hodgson, Shadow Health Minister, said: “The start of the PrEP process is welcome and delayed after months of delays and hesitant implementation by the government.
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and stop the transmission of this life-changing infection.
This experiment brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP.
Now it is important that this study is carried out as soon as possible across the country to protect people who are infected with HIV and that it will help us get one step closer to stopping the spread of HIV in society.”
Living the Great Life: Middle Floor and Smart Designer Tricks Have Transformed This Small Earls Court Apartment Into a Generous Home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, shrunk from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment in 2014.
It’s on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace – and it’s proof of the new design that Joanne didn’t pack and sell her bags.
“That’s why I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room,” says Joanne.
"I was looking for something that was comparable to my price.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and she had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and made an offer that day."
Since the first visit, the 1,000-square-foot apartment has been completely outdated.
Originally a one-room property with a chained layout – one had to walk through the kitchen to get into the bedroom – Joanne wanted to add storage space and an intermediate floor to make the most of the generous ceiling height.
“I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.
That was my request,” she said.
For this purpose, she commissioned the architecture and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12.5 foot high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne.
The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on top of each other, so the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate floor where one could stand.
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the requirement.
“The steel plant is quite complicated,” he explains.
“We had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked over each other without having to bend.
It wasn’t just about building a simple platform, it was about putting the steel up to the right height for the top or bottom function.”
This arrangement allowed Erfan to place two rooms at full altitude above each other – with a lot of extra drama.
For the middle floor, a classic copper light window from Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area.
Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space, and light.
At both ends, a short corridor is mirrored to make it work longer.
In the kitchen, the mirror feels like a window into another room.
At the entrance, mirrored units provide room for all Joanne’s steaks and glasses.
By perceiving a more glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can shut down the kitchen when not in use.
Foldable kitchens are nothing new.
The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.
"A little engineering went in there," Erfan explains from the steel-enforced, forged MDF door.
"It's counterweight, so when you push the door up, it slips very easily."
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne was able to gain an additional 16 m2, an additional bedroom and an improved layout.
“At the end of the day, you’ll sell the base area – or how your property is estimated,” says Erfan.
"In a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the size of the land."
Here they managed to enlarge the floor area and at the same time use high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage.
“The materials are the things you touch and therefore help create an emotional bond in a home,” says Erfan.
“You don’t fall in love with the electrical sockets in the walls.
These are important, but they don’t play with your heart.”
It shows that with good design and increased square meters, an apartment can transform itself from something standard into something quite amazing.
In fact, like Joanne, you might decide not to leave them.
Brothers Fight for $500 Million Real Estate Empire
Two brothers find themselves four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, in a fight over one of Victoria's largest real estate empires worth over $500 million.
Colin De Lutis, former director of the Carlton Football Club and developer, lives in a villa in Toorak, just three doors away from his younger brother Paul.
Paul wanted to retire from the family business since 2014, but a sharp dispute over the separation is taking place in the Supreme Court.
Together with their mother Anna, the brothers own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, accumulated since the family bought a store on Smith Street, Collingwood, in 1973.
There, the Westco Jeans family founded and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores.
It was sold for $85 million in 1999.
This money was invested in real estate, and De Lutis’ portfolio now includes offices in the urban setting, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller, as well as shopping centers in the suburbs.
Following an agreement with her deceased father, Colin – described by Paul as the “main operator and dominant personality” in the De Lutis family – owns about two-thirds of the company’s assets and Paul about one-third.
A court filing states that this means Colin owns $316 million worth of property and Paul $176 million worth of property.
The distribution of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.
“The divisions proposed by Colin left him with what I thought was the best objects,” he wrote in a first affidavit in 2015.
Last Friday, after several failed negotiations, the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place.
The brothers are now also fighting for control over the existing business – which Colin, as Paul claims, has excluded him from.
Colin argues this is not true, but accuses Paul of managing some possessions incompetently.
In an early affidavit submitted by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.
“My Italian heritage states that family is the top priority,” he wrote.
The cost is rising in the case, with hundreds of pages containing affidavits, emails and reports from companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers including Allan Myers, QC, and law firms held by both sides.
Mrs. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who run milk bars and delicacies shops from the late 1950s and bought a store in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They used the security to buy the Collingwood estate where Colin opened the family’s first jeans store.
Colin says he started Westco there when he was “in my last years of high school when Paul was still a small child (about 10 years old).”
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to gently pass on their property to their sons.
"Luigi often told me that he never wanted the brothers to come to court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis company group, with Colin claiming that Mark was paid $10 million and Luke $26 million when leaving the company.
Both Luke and Mark, Paul says, “have become bitter about the conditions of their financial separation.”
Colin has been very restrained despite being a former AFL board member and, according to a 2015 biography by Eddie McGuire, the best friend of the television star.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.
Only Colin responded by SMS to say "I really can't say much" because the case is in court.
“It’s very, very sad that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and bring our family names through the courts,” he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he had tried to meet his brother’s demands.
"Our father't want Paul and me to end up in our current dispute," he said, adding that he "still hopes for a solution."
On Friday, that hope seemed to be over.
“Our case will be resolved by the courts in the near future,” Colin wrote.
Trump’s new chief of staff plans to limit the president’s media abstinence.
Others have tried and have failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.
If so, he will be the first.
Politico reports that the new White House chief of staff plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump — including news media reports — in the hope of keeping the boss on a more uniform course.
Here is a piece by reporter Josh Dawsey:
“When John F. Kelly, the new White House chief of staff, met with senior employees on his first day of work, he presented a major problem in President Donald Trump’s White House that he wanted to fix: bad information that fell into the hands of the president.
Kelly told staff that information about him should flow – whether on paper or in briefings – because the president would make better decisions if he received good information.”
Kelly’s diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet.
President Trump’s relationship with television dates back decades – and now that he is in the White House, his television advertising is still strong.
“When candidate Trump was upset by an unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received a fair reporting of posts that were convincing,” former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg told Politico in February.
Politico’s Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that “the key to keeping Trump’s Twitter habit under control, according to six former campaign officials, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise.”
and Okay.
But the idea that Trump’s Twitter habit has ever been “under control” is ridiculous.
Per these campaign officials know something we others don’t know – that Trump’s tweets would have contained even more ignition without their interventions.
We’ll probably never learn anything about the tweets that Trump didn’t send.
If his colleagues have managed to keep him away from trouble several times, then their efforts have been worthwhile.
But no one has consistently been able to prevent Trump from provoking controversy.
Part of the problem is that people in a White House consisting of competing parties are constantly trying to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that may promote their views of the world.
Politico - entirely engaged in this story - in May about the preference of consultants to provide the president with questionable information for strategic reasons.
This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
“Current and former Trump officials say Trump can react like a volcano to negative press releases, especially those with damaging leaks, and that he is struggling to find out where they come from.
That’s exactly what happened at the end of February when someone maliciously gave the president a printed copy of an article from GotNews.com, the website of Internet provocator Charles C. Johnson, accusing Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being “the source behind a bunch of leaks” in the White House.
Although Johnson has been banned permanently from Twitter for harassment or that he has not offered any concrete evidence or that he has expressed false accusations in the past and revoked them.
Trump read the article and began to question employees about Walsh.
Goldmacher added that then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and White House Secretary-General Rob Porter "tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork Trump receives."
How did it work?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later.
Maybe he will prove to be a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisors still strive for influence.
These unchanging factors make Kelly’s mission very difficult.
Most Wanted Criminals Get Post from Europol
As the address is unknown, the help of the population is sought and hoped.
Police across Europe are sending (virtual) postcards to dangerous criminals on the run this summer.
Since the addresses of the wanted serious criminals are naturally unknown, clues from the population are hoped and sought.
Europol on Friday about the action that follows the “EU Most Wanted” winter advent calendar.
Experience has shown that many refugees are hiding in vacation destinations, Europol said.
They compiled 21 postcards for wanted criminals from 21 EU countries.
Since 2016, the website www.eumostwanted has been viewed more than 2.5 million times.
Thirty-six of those sought online have been arrested so far, at least eleven of whom have been arrested on the basis of clues after they have been published on the website.
Travellers Negotiate a Grave and Return to 'Millionaire Series'
Some of the wealthiest homeowners in the West Midlands are back on war with some determined travellers who have negotiated a community-drawn pit to reclaim a field in front of their mansions.
Travellers have parked their 20 caravans on a field outside a wealthy Solihull street called the “Millionaire Series.”
They brought horses, babies, and an army of carriers after being thrown out only in May, but without being deterred by a grave excavated by the council to prevent their intrusions.
The tactful group found a gap in the defenses and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained unhindered to find a way.
Angry residents pressured the council of Solihull, who said it was “usedless to deal with the problem.”
An anonymous resident said, “They moved there on Monday evening after being sent by Bentley Heath where they threw stones on passers.
The Council must be forced into action by shame, as it has been useless in dealing with the problem.
The travellers were there in May, moved on and are now back.
More came last night, probably more today.”
She added, “The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by holding long lessons to protect their parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I’m not happy to continue paying my municipal tax if the council can’t even stop it.”
A local resident who didn’t want to be named said, “It’s ridiculous, we just saw the last round of these travellers just to be looted by another round.
The numbers have increased this time, and you have even seen a horse in the park area.”
A Solihull Council spokeswoman said: “We are aware of an unauthorized camp in the countryside beyond Streetsbrook Road and are working with the Solihulls police.
To support our evidence collection, it is very important that as many residents as possible report anti-social or criminal behavior to the police by calling 101.
This helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court has to examine when we present our case.”
From Birkenhof to Waldhotel Luise
From the former Hotel Birkenhof will become the Waldhotel Luise.
The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadts is currently being renovated and is scheduled to reopen on March 1 next year.
This is good news for the city.
Because with the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof by the then Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH on 13 April 2014, about 30 000 nights per year were lost and income from the currency tax was also lost.
In the fall of 2014, in the face of the dramatic increase in the number of refugees arriving in the district, the hotel building was offered to the council office as a collective accommodation, which caused controversial discussions.
The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by drawing up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location.
The decision was unquestionable in the city council.
But Freudenstadt’s mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel’s location and already spoke of serious stakeholders at the house.
He should keep right.
The group of Luisenhotels with Managing Director Birgit Scherer with headquarters in Bad Bergzabern has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it again a house of the three-star plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise.
The group has four houses with the happy town object.
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.
They are called Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.
In the former Hotel Birkenhof for a long time there have been construction containers in front of the entrance, and when you enter the house, it becomes clear how extensive renovations are being carried out.
The floors were ripped out, ceilings partially demolished, old baths removed from the rooms.
The entire hotel building is a single construction site.
There is a lot to do until March.
“It’s actually a nice hotel,” says Thomas Scherer in an interview with our newspaper.
Everything will be renovated in the Black Forest style.
The rooms will be equipped with large walkable shower, the entrance area will be redesigned, new windows will be installed.
Everything should later become “beautifully close to citizens,” as Thomas Scherer puts it.
“We want to make a jewelry.”
A swimming pool, a wellness area and a meeting room are part of the facilities.
One does not want to position itself on the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad, but already on a high level in the city centre, Scherer emphasizes.
The Waldhotel Luise with its approximately 60 rooms intends to be broad, Scherer further explains.
Both individual holidaymakers, groups or business people should feel comfortable in the hotel.
He has already held talks with OB Julian Osswald and tourism director Michael Krause, Scherer said.
The concept of the city is similar to that of the hotel group.
“We are on the same line.”
Asked about the amount of the investment, Thomas Scherer does not want to determine exactly.
Less than a million euros, he said.
The external installations are also being brought to the forefront, which is already clearly visible.
In a courtyard a large terrace will be created, which will be accessible from the restaurant, which is public.
Thomas Scherer is optimistic: “Freudenstadt is a good market.”
U.S. Special Investigator Applices Grand Jury
In the Russian-US affair about President Donald Trump, Special Investigator Robert Mueller is said to have appointed a so-called Grand Jury.
The panel has begun work in recent weeks, the Wall Street Journal wrote, citing people familiar with the matter.
The newspaper viewed the move as a sign that Mueller has expanded and intensified his investigations.
CNN that there were already first calls from the panel in connection with a meeting between Trump’s eldest son and a Russian lawyer.
U.S. intelligence agencies have long accused the Kremlin of intentionally interfering in the 2016 presidential election campaign.
Mueller is investigating whether there were any negotiations between Trump’s campaign team and Moscow.
The investigation focuses on several men who acted as advisors to the Republican in the election campaign.
According to reports, Mueller has also taken more and more of Trump’s private and business environment under scrutiny.
The "Washington Post" wrote a few weeks ago that the special investigator personally brought Trump into the center and is investigating whether the president may have hampered justice in the course of the affair.
The main task of the Grand Jury is to examine available evidence in potential criminal cases and to decide whether to bring charges.
The Grand Jury is also known as the Prosecution Chambers.
They are mostly turned on when it comes to larger and controversial cases.
The process is always done behind closed doors.
The panel may also be invited by the Public Prosecutor’s Office to invite persons to be heard under oath.
According to CNN, talks have already been issued about the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.
Persons attending the meeting were asked to make a statement, the report said.
They should also provide documents.
In addition to Trump Jr., Trump’s counsellor and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and his then campaign chief, Paul Manafort, were also involved in the conversation.
Legal experts said on U.S. television on Thursday evening that the appointment shows that Mueller is not intimidated in his work and that he is willing to act quickly if necessary.
But it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will eventually be called in to decide on whether to raise an indictment.
Nevertheless, the creation of the panel is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause for concern for President Trump.
In the midst of new revelations, the president used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to portray the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents.
“Russia’s history is a total invention,” Trump said.
The theme gives Democrats a way to “feel good because they have nothing else to talk about.”
His special adviser Ty Cobb said in a statement that he knew nothing about the establishment of a Grand Jury.
But this also usually works in secret, he emphasized.
The White House supports any measures that accelerate the special investigator’s work in a “fair” way.
Former FBI chief James Comey has said three times that there will be no investigation against the president.
There is no reason to believe that anything has changed, the statement continued.
However, Mueller was only employed after Trump fired Comey.
Because of this expulsion, accusations against Trump had become loud, he wanted to hinder justice.
Comey told a Senate committee in June that Trump had asked him to stop the investigation against then-national security adviser Michael Flynn.
The president is under great pressure because of the investigation.
According to U.S. media reports, the White House has gathered material against the Special Investigator and his staff.
This sparked speculation about whether Trump wants to dismiss Mueller.
Unlike an independent congressional special investigator, such as in the Watergate affair over later retired President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired by the Justice Department on the president’s urge.
Several senators from both parties, however, want to prevent such a move.
Two groups of Republican and Democratic senators on Thursday submitted bills that would prevent the Special Prosecutor from being fired so easily.
Antarctica: Giant iceberg is moving in Antarctica
In western Antarctica, a giant iceberg of almost seven times the size of Berlin has dissolved from the ice sheet.
This was by the Alfred-Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research in Bremerhaven on Wednesday.
The colossus, weighing over a trillion tons and 5800 square kilometers, is now pushing north and will probably take two or three years to melt.
With a length of 175 kilometers and a width of up to 50 kilometers, it is one of the largest ice giants that researchers have recorded in the past three decades.
There is no danger to people from him.
To what extent climate change has played a role in the breaking down of the iceberg is unclear, according to researchers.
Overall, however, there has been a series of unusual icebreakers collapse in the region for about 30 years, the U.S. Snow and Ice Research Center (NSIDC) writes in a background of facts.
According to many researchers, this may be related to global warming.
The now broken colossus was until now part of the Larsen-C-Schelfeis.
Shelfeis floats in the sea and is fed by large glaciers.
It thus grows further into the sea and breaks down regularly.
The Larsen-C shelf is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic peninsula.
To the north of this shellfish, the balance of growing and breaking was disturbed a few years ago.
A complete shellfish collapsed there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.
There is a lot of evidence that the Larsen-C shelf is also in danger, because the front edge has never retreated as far as it is now.
In addition, the ice plate is under tension and can break down if a piece breaks off at a key spot.
The melting of shellfish and icebergs does not raise sea levels, as they swim on the water and replace ice as much water as it produces after melting itself.
However, the loss of shellfish causes the glaciers to melt directly into the sea and flow much faster than before.
This could potentially raise the sea level, but only to a slight extent, writes the British research project on observing Antarctica (Midas).
The Larsen-C shelf is the fourth largest shelf in Antarctica with 50,000 square kilometers, according to AWI.
At the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the open ocean about 200 meters.
It breaks down regularly.
“Al it’s a natural occurrence and we don’t know of any direct connection to climate change, the ice sheet is now in a more vulnerable position,” said Martin O’Leary of Swansea University.
"This is the longest withdrawal since the beginning of recording," he said.
Among scientists, it is controversial whether the Larsen-C shelf will now grow again or decline in the long run and possibly collapse, said his colleague Adrian Luckman, adding: "Our models say it will be less stable."
But this development will take decades.
Although these researchers do not attribute the breakdown of this giant iceberg to climate change, in recent decades many ice sheets of the Antarctic peninsula have disintegrated.
This long tip of Antarctica extends toward South America.
According to data from the British Antarctic Survey research program, the ice surface of the Antarctic peninsula has decreased by 28,000 square kilometers since the 1950s.
The increase in temperature contributed to the decline.
The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed by around three degrees Celsius over the past 50 years, making it one of the regions where temperatures are rising the fastest.
CDU calls for tax on staff
As it becomes increasingly difficult to occupy vacant positions, the CDU is demanding to withdraw from the employers’ association in order to become more attractive.
Just before the summer break, the Circuit Day gained 41 new positions in the administration.
More than 1,100 employees and officials work for the district administration in Mettmann.
Seventeen students have already completed their first working day.
The teaching places in the circle are obviously highly sought after.
There were approximately 620 applications for the places to be awarded this year.
Nevertheless, the circle still lacks personnel to cope with the increased demands and tasks.
Currently, there are 50 unoccupied positions in the district of Mettmann.
Doctors and engineers, as well as forces of general administration are sought.
The CDU now wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG and tackle the shortage of skilled personnel in the administration.
The administration should, at the request of the parties, "elaborate a concept for recruiting and developing personnel".
The aim is not only to meet short-term needs for professionals, but also to counter the future-oriented candidate shortage.
The overall concept should be internally and externally oriented, show concrete measures for crossroads and include a training offensive, CDU, FDP and UWG demand.
This sounds like a good approach.
Because the circle is dealing with personnel problems that were not known before.
Other cities recruit good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.
We are talking about a real “concurrence of public employers.”
In addition, a large number of employees are dismissed due to illness or age.
It is time to take action so that no more positions are left unoccupied.
However, Klaus-Dieter Völker, leader of the CDU, goes with his party even beyond the joint proposal.
He recently caused a thick surprise in the circular day, when he publicly questioned the coverage of personnel costs and surprised the other parties.
Völker wants to examine all possibilities that enable a withdrawal from the local employer association.
"If we do not come to a satisfactory solution here in the short term, the district administration should seek a household rate with the unions - also in cooperation with the district cities," said Völker.
Thus, the CDU tries to pay employees and officials better than the tariff for public service actually provides.
The salaries are currently precisely prescribed, increases or more money exist only if you move to a higher level, which is oriented to professional years.
However, the tasks of the circle have increased in recent years.
Only a few weeks ago, new rooms had to be set up where employees would take care of the provisions of the new prostitute protection law.
Not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers, Landrat Thomas Hendele and District Director Martin Richter have a problem: they have too little staff.
Italy toughs tone on NGO migrants rescue boats
Italy has warned NGOs deploying rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean that they should not continue doing so unless they adhere to new rules for their operations.
"If NGOs don't sign a new code of conduct, it's hard to see how they can continue to work," Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa.
Minniti’s warning came a day after the Italian authorities seized a boat of the German aid organization ‘Jugend Rettet’ because its crew had effectively worked with traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.
The aid organization, which has only been in operation for a year, declined to comment on detailed charges by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"For us, saving human lives is and remains our top priority, so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," the organization said in a statement on social media.
"We can only assess any allegations currently being raised after we have gathered all the information and can assess the situation."
The Italian authorities had monitored the boat of 'Jugend Rettet', the Iuventa, since October.
It is suspected that his crew is taking on board slang boat migrants delivered directly to them by human traffickers, and that the smugglers can depart so that the ships can be reused.
At least one such meeting allegedly took place just 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's file, the content of which was published by Italian media.
The crew is suspected of overlooking the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, which oversees rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not for any other motives.
Under the code of conduct, boats like the Iuventa must primarily have an Italian police officer on board to oversee their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to adhere to the code: Save the Children, MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary but acceptable as they would not bring "significant changes or obstacles" to their rescue operations.
Among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel Prize-winning organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Minniti said the number of migrants arriving in Italy after the rescue has dropped sharply in recent weeks, indicating that efforts to strengthen Libyan coastguard and cooperation with local mayors have yielded fruit.
“Over the last few days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel,” the minister said.
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
Rise and Trials
Nine Weilermer bikers, the "Berliner Außenpost" and two guest drivers met in Wachenheim in the North Pfalz to enjoy trials and sights for four days.
Three guides were available.
The accommodation in the Wachenheimer Valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.
The Castle and Wine Festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.
The first tour led to hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim.
The sights followed, partly on towers, from which one could see far beyond the Pälzer Wald and the advanced levels.
Between them there were constantly longer increases, for which long trials rewarded.
On the second day we went to Bad Dürkheim for the saline and the Volksfest Wurstmarkt.
Again, point of view ranks to point of view, linked by "flowing" trials and moderate ups.
In the last two days there have been a lot of heights.
Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and retreats brought welcome breaks.
In Bad Dürkheim, cyclists inhale healing salt in the outdoor inhalatory.
Neustadt was also invaded.
After 173 kilometers and almost 4500 meters above sea level, the group had come to know the palm forest from its best side – sporting and cultural.
Console instead of lawn - Bundesliga prepares for e-sport
Will the sports stars in the future sit in front of computer consoles instead of fighting sweaty over the stadium grass in the wind and weather?
The fact is: e-sport has long become a serious industry, a lucrative business – big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gains included.
This has also been recognized by the first Bundesliga clubs, which are increasingly engaged in this area.
The start was made in 2015 by VfL Wolfsburg, later followed by FC Schalke 04 and lastly by VfB Stuttgart, which in mid-July founded an e-sport division and contracted two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17.
"We hope to encourage new young target groups for the VfB," says Jochen Röttgermann, Chairman of the Board.
He is sure that there will be a lot of clubs on this train.”
Next weekend, the FIFA World Football Federation will host the first "Interactive Club World Cup" in London, where players from different clubs will compete against each other.
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, for example, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or PSV Eindhoven qualified.
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sports.
The former coach of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen is now advising an agency for virtual football players.
"Real football has to deal with the 14 to 30 year olds in particular, that the young people will still go to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old.
And: The clubs tried to conquer all possible markets, especially the Asian ones.
With prominent e-sports players under contract, you could be online on these markets much more often than just sending the Bundesliga team to Asia once a year.
What exactly is it about?
In e-sports, computer games such as League of Legends, Dota 2, Counterstrike or the football simulation FIFA are challenged at the competitive level.
For a long time, as in normal sports, leagues have been established, in which the professionals compete against each other.
And at the 2022 Asian Games, e-sport is already part of the official program.
Is this a real sport?
For many, the idea is a need for habit.
Ingo Froböse has also been dealing with the issue for a long time.
For the professor at the German University of Sport in Cologne, e-sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that can also be found in classical sports - for example, increased heart rate, stress reactions, hormonal changes.
It also requires cognitive skills, technical and tactical understanding, and quick reaction.
Professional gamers should not only train on the console, but also their bodies and pay attention to the diet.
“A good player is a good player.”
But Froböse also sees problems: "Doping is becoming more and more a topic."
Controls are difficult to perform in online games, and the scene lacked the structures of the classical sport.
Positively, the scientist highlights the high integrative effect of e-sport.
The players are traveling internationally, which is like a large global family, as there are no intercultural barriers.
A study by business consultancy Deloitte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts rapid growth for e-sport.
In 2016, 50 million euros were generated in Germany, mainly through advertising, sponsorship and major tournaments.
In three years, sales are expected to reach 130 million.
In contrast to the almost 2.4 billion euros of the Bundesliga, that is not much.
However, e-sports “is no longer far from other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey,” the Deloitte advisors write.
Many countries are internationally involved.
Major markets are Asia and the United States, where former basketball player Shaquille O’Neal and baseball star Alex Rodriguez participate in the US team NRG eSports.
Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher is investing in eSports betting provider Unikrn.
There is also a lot going on in Europe.
In one Norwegian school, e-sport has been introduced as a teaching subject, says Froböse.
In the Netherlands and France, football clubs are now required to set up an e-sports division.
“In European comparison, Germany lags behind,” explains VfB board member Röttgermann.
Just falling into nostalgia and explaining the old days is no longer enough.
It is about preserving the tradition of the association, but at the same time bringing the company to the modern market.
“We live in a digitalized world,” says Dutt.
“You can’t hold on to the fact that in football everything remains as it has always been.”
Poison Eggs - The Egg Alternatives for Cooking and Baking
The scandal of poisonous eggs has now affected almost all federal states.
Aldi Süd and Aldi Nord have reacted and removed all eggs from sale across Germany.
Only eggs should be placed on the shelves that do not contain fipronil.
Michelle Carter sentenced for texts urging Conrad Roy to commit suicide
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years for encouraging her boyfriend to commit suicide through texts and calls.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years were suspended for imprisonment.
Carter was convicted in June of negligent killing of Conrad Roy, who committed suicide on July 13, 2014.
Roy’s father said at the hearing on Thursday, “My family is reluctant.
My son was my best friend.”
Carter was allowed to remain free until appeal.
She had faced a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr. Roy suffered from a mental illness.
Dressed in red pants and a cream-colored blouse, Carter stood there with tears in the eyes, folded hands and eyes downward when she was convicted.
“Their actions killed Conrad Roy,” the prosecutor told the court.
“She ended her life to make her own better.
She has not taken responsibility,” she said.
“She showed no regrets.”
But Carter’s lawyer said it was “a terrifying circumstance that she totally regrets.”
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz said he did not find out that “his age or maturity or even her mental illness has a significant influence on their actions.”
A prosecutor read a statement from Roy's mother, Lynn Roy, saying that "there is no day when I do not mourn the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything.I try to be there for his sisters, despite all my pain that we will bear with us for eternity.”
Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, said she was "tracked" by the realization that she would never attend her brother's wedding or be a aunt for his children.
“Not having that single person I’ve been with every day since I was born is a pain that I’ll always keep with me for the rest of my life,” she said.
The case seems to set a legal precedent, as there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to urge another to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in 2014 from carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle.
The case attracted national attention after Carter’s text messages revealed that she had encouraged him to end his life.
"Hang yourself up, jump out of a building, climb yourself up, I don't know, there are many ways," she said in several messages she sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family.
In the moments before his suicide, she wrote, "You have to do it, Conrad" and "All you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy."
Judge Moniz said Carter sought attention through Roy’s death and ordered her to benefit from the case through any press.
The case shared the legal opinion.
Amanda Knox, one of the few who defended Carter, was convicted in 2007 of murdering her British fellow resident in Italy before being released two years ago.
Ms. Knox, 30, posted a comment in the Los Angeles Times: "Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not jail."
Joshua Kimmich: Learning from FC Bayern’s new Mini-Lahm
That Joshua Kimmich was allowed to run as the captain of the Audi Cup is no coincidence.
FC Bayern trusts the Confed Cup winner a great season - extra motivation does not hurt.
Something was different there on his seat in the cabin that Joshua Kimmich immediately saw, even though the extra piece of clothing was very, very small.
But since, of course, neither Philipp Lahm nor Manuel Neuer were to be seen on the second day of the Audi Cup, he stopped the bandage assigned to him.
"The coach didn't announce it," the Confed Cup winner told him after his first game as Bayern captain.
Well, it could have been better than in the 0:2 against the SSC Naples.
But the sign from the coach could interpret Kimmich as well.
It was not the eight-year-old Arturo Vidal who had been chosen as the leader in the C-Elf, which consists of youth players, debuters and professionals just coming out of vacation, but he.
Sugar is best distributed to those you trust a lot, who you want to keep in the mood.
Those who were chosen to participate in the legacy of Lahm can only need a little extra motivation.
Kimmich said: “That’s what you want as a player: take responsibility.”
On Wednesday, the 22-year-old flashed over the field as a mini-lamm.
Right behind, that is now his position, the white bandage on the arm did her rest.
And in general, Kimmich appeared in this starting formation as the one who can best take the steering wheel in hand.
He gave instructions, tried to direct the unchecked troops.
He looked at the whole while many others were busy with themselves.
Vidal with overplaying his lack of fitness (nearly worked); Renato Sanches with coming out to the devil to connect to the achievements of the Asia trip (also worked only conditionally); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle with not being noticed negatively in their first appearance in the Bayern T-shirt.
After all, it worked very well.
Süle ran alongside Kimmich, Rudy before the defense, both acted sovereignly.
The namely occupied Napoli storm was often difficult, and Süle also tried to successfully build the game a few times.
His colleague, Rudy, admitted that the result "was not as we hoped."
He also performed well in the debut.
Game shift, pace change: "For this style I was also picked up."
How unusual this Bavarian world is still for the new entries, you saw after the game.
Rudy, for example, did not give one or two interviews in the catacombs, but six or seven.
Kimmich said goodbye after a few crazy statements in the back of his new teammates.
There he heard from Süle an interesting phrase: "What is going on here, I have already noticed.
At Bayern, you just have to win every game.”
He doesn’t have to teach the new one any more.
Alaba motivates women
David Alaba believes in the success of our ÖFB ladies
Austria's most famous footballer on Twitter shortly before the match and wished the ÖFB ladies all the best.
The Bavarian legionaire is a quasi-club colleague of ÖFB captain Schnaderbeck and feeds with our ladies.
The tweet of the Austrian Footballer of the Year and Champions League winner should be a special motivation.
The famous Bayern-Dusel may also be needed by our ladies.
Companies satisfied with the Rhineland-Pfalz Minister: Economy praises Wissing's pace
The relationship between the country and the regional economy was often irreconcilable when Eveline Lemke (Grüne) was still the Minister of Economy of Rheinland-Pfalz.
This is evident after more than a year, in which the new Minister of Economy Volker Wissing (FDP) is in office.
Chambers and companies from the region speak at T V's request of a change in economic policy - and at the same time denounce the old minister.
Frank Natus, chairman of the Trier Enterprises Association (VTU), says: “Wissing is attacking the wishes of the economy that has blocked Lemke.”
Natus sees the biggest turning point in infrastructure policy: the closure of the highway 1 between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the country’s priority list.
This year, the ministry hopes for a plan-making procedure, the construction right should be stopped by 2021.
A role in the plans of the country also plays the western circumference of Trier, which is in the urgent need of the federal roadmap.
The aim is to start operating the route in December 2020, says the ministry spokeswoman Cornelia Holtmann.
Natus sees this as a roadmap to support regional but internationally competing companies.
The Trier Chamber of Industry and Commerce (IHK) is seeking, as encouraged by Wissing, a Rheinland-Pfalz label for wine in order to increase sales in supermarkets and stop the trend of declining German wine exports for ten years.
In addition, Wissing has an open ear for people who want to start their own company, IHK praises.
The Trier Chamber of Crafts sees the new master bonus as an additional incentive for young apprentices, says Managing Director Matthias Schwalbach.
A premium of 1000 euros is provided for passing the master's exam and 2500 euros if graduates become self-employed within ten years after the master's degree.
The list of homework remains long.
With the planned road construction, facts can be quickly created, while the country lacks the necessary personnel, says Jan Glockauer, chief executive officer of IHK Trier.
Out of 56 new engineers who want to hire Wissing at the state mobility business, only 29 jobs have been occupied so far.
The IHK calls for more orders to be awarded to external offices.
CDU deputy Christian Baldauf refers to calculations by the Court of Auditors that the country will invest more than 20 million euros less in the maintenance of state roads in 2017 and 2018 than proposed.
Frank Natus also expects a concept from the country to address the shortage of skilled personnel in the region.
The current broadband expansion in the country is also alarming.
In 2016, regional companies had only rated network supply with a rating of 3.4 in an IHK survey.
They complained about tight internet connections and interruptions.
Former Economy Minister Eveline Lemke, on the other hand, is currently out of politics and still sits in the supervisory board of the wind power company Pro Wind.
The Greens left Lemke in April to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe - where they had already cleared the field again after four months due to disagreements.
Audi to replace 850,000 diesel vehicles, car manufacturers face counter-reaction
A day before Audi’s announcement, BMW said it would offer to update the software on more than 350,000 vehicles.
The chairman of BMW said the company is of the opinion that "there are smarter options than driving restrictions," referring to European cities - including Munich, where BMW is based - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.
None of the companies described the companies as recalls.
European automakers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon emission rules.
But the nitrogen oxides emitted by diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The cost for automotive manufacturers to install plants to neutralize diesel vehicle emissions is also increasing, making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of insulting powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem.
The companies are trying to avoid Volkswagen’s mistake of using so-called shut-off devices that could regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car was tested but drove back under normal driving conditions.
In the United States, several Volkswagen employees have been charged, others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics in the engine development of Audi was arrested in Germany.
The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be brought to justice in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen after authorities accused Audi of installing a system to circumvent emissions regulations in Europe, and a request focused on the United States was expanded.
Audi’s involvement in the investigation could be a heavy burden on Volkswagen: the luxury car manufacturer contributes disproportionately to Volkswagen’s profits.
This message has the flood on Saturday on the Isar
The city wants to protect the Isar.
In order for the ISAR visitors to participate, a fleet will run through Munich tomorrow Saturday, which has a special message.
If you go back to the Isar on Saturday, you will see a large bridge between Flaucher and Reichenbachbrücke.
And this is not an ordinary fleet, with Isar tourists.
But the building wants to clarify.
On the floor you can see a large infotransparent.
It shows a rubbish mountain.
The launch of a publicity campaign to appeal to the Isar visitors.
With the motto "True love is ..." is meant to sharpen the understanding of the Isar as a wild river worth protecting.
Already last summer the fleet crossed the Isar and this year there are further actions and measures to a thoughtful and environmentally conscious behavior.
Mordillo's Knob Nuts and Laughter Against Suffering
Mordillo was occasionally one of the most-published cartoon drawers, the knots of his characters are his trademark.
Even at the age of 85, the Argentinian is still drawing and working on a film.
His message: Laugh, “because there is too much suffering in the world.”
Guillermo Mordillo was born in Buenos Aires on August 4, 1932, the son of Spanish immigrants.
In his early years as an artist, he made himself known, among other things, as a drawer for congratulatory cards - which frustrated him.
"The happiest day in my professional life was the day I lost in my job," he once said.
After stations in Lima, New York and Paris, he made the breakthrough in the late 1960s: with the publication of his cartoons in "Paris Match" and then in "Star" and other leading magazines around the world.
Even in China, Mordillo had a lot of fans.
Artists are always inspired by cities.
Large, round Mordillo figures tumble together in drawings with the sliding tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London, and the Red Square in Moscow.
Early in the morning, according to his own information, he still sits at the drawing table today, working almost ten hours a day.
Through calendars, puzzles, books for large and small, t-shirts, plush animals and watches, his drolly characters continue to find a lot of spread worldwide.
For six years he has also worked on a comic book and a TV series with his characters.
The main character in the film "Crazy Island" is a giraffe - Mordillo's most popular animal in his cartoons - who has a thousand fistler as an opponent.
For the first time, his characters speak in the 3D film, which is set to come to the cinemas in 2019.
“I don’t know exactly what they’re going to say, it’s weird for me,” says Mordillo.
The script is not written by him.
Therefore, he is more likely to rely on the TV series, which, like his original drawings, is produced without words.
Lavender from Provence threatened by climate change
It has become a symbol of Provence in southern France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change.
Lavender is declining due to drought-like conditions and disease-transmitting insects, causing great headaches for scientists and farmers trying to find solutions.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the Agricultural Research Institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: “The lavender in Provence is effectively at risk because the plant has been exposed in recent years to the effects of climate change, which has brought much less rain in spring and much more in autumn.
This has an impact on the life of lavender.
There is also a small zika, a micro-bacterium that transmits dwarf zika, and in very dry weather there are very many of them."
A lot is at stake.
Lavender oil not only attracts holidaymakers, it is also in high demand for perfumes and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said, “Rather than having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.
So we have fewer parts with essential oil.”
The solutions being considered include better water distribution and slower evaporation from the soil, but also spraying the plants with a protective blend of clay and water and developing varieties that are more resistant to drought.
The town of Geisa in the Thuringia Rhön celebrates its 1200th anniversary this year.
The highlight is this Saturday and Sunday with a medieval festival.
Cremers, smugglers, merchants, vagants or a country slave camp are expected to be experienced in the city centre these days.
The murder of a journalist highlights the growing threat in Mexico
The staff of the weekly newspaper Riodoce usually meets on Wednesday to review their plans to report on the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa through organized crime, corrupt officials, and endless drug wars.
But that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.
They were told that it is important to change their routines.
Two high-ranking journalists are discussing what feels safer: take their children to the office, who were the target of a 2009 grenade attack, or leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on a board on the front of the space: Enemy, Neutral, Allied.
They ask reporters to suggest names for each column - no evidence is needed, perceptions and abdominal sensations are enough.
There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of being on the government’s payroll list or the cartels, a catalog of criminals who make Mexico’s chaos dangerous.
There is no rest from the violence, and as the bodies accumulate across the country, more and more journalists are there: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012. 589 are under federal protection after attacks and threats and so far there have been at least seven deaths in seven states this year.
Among the latter is its editor and inspiration for Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on drug-related violence.
His absence is deeply felt, although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez showing his middle finger with the word "Justice" hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building. Two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts showing his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamahut.
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and reporters discuss their shared topics, the trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor’s office was established in 2010 to deal with journalists’ cases, it has only initiated two criminal proceedings, according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists.
As with most of the thousands of murders associated with drug trafficking and organized crime every year, the murderers of journalists are rarely brought to justice.
At Riodoce, they still insist on dealing with the violence of Sinaloa, despite being reluctant and despite the terrain being even more betrayal now.
Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security is of little use, Ibarra says.
“It’s very stupid to waste my time at this workshop,” he says.
“As long as we don’t know why, we’re suspicious of everyone.”
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the state capital of Culiacan.
He only managed to drive a few blocks long before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. He was forced out of his car and shot at him 12 times, presumably because of the name of the newspaper - which translates as "Twelfth River".
The gunman ran away in his car and damaged it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left a wife and two adult children.
Rumors tend to fly around freely in Culiacan.
But about Valdez there is virtually nothing but silence.
Since Guzman’s arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the country’s bloodiest battlefields as rival factions struggle here to fill the vacuum.
It doesn’t matter that in Sinaloa one or more people are shot on the street every day or that the cemetery is full of decorated, two-storey mausoleums for drug kings that are larger than many houses for the living.
Forget for a minute that there is a state of "peace" when only a cartel has control of the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes to the United States.
Nevertheless, and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, is broken with the blame for not being able to protect his friend.
He believes two misunderstandings contributed to the murder.
First, there was the publication in February of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel factions in the war with Guzman’s sons.
This publication may have upset the sons, alleged gang members purchased every copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after the seizure of another newspaper that had published the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be there.
He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined forces with five colleagues to found Riodoce and sold $50 stakes.
In Sinaloa, “it was impossible to do journalism without encountering the drug problem,” Bojorquez said.
Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for its courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.
Reporters loved being able to publish hard-reaching investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared address.
Eight years after the founding of Riodoce, she received the prestigious “Maria Moors-Cabot Prize” for her reporting in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez won the Committee for the Protection of Journalists’ International Press Freedom Award for his courage in pursuing Mexican drug history wherever it led.
He voluntarily admitted that he was afraid.
“I want to live on,” he said at the time of the CPJ award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa "is a way of life," he said in an interview with Rompeviento TV last October.
“You have to take on the task that comes to you as a journalist – either that or you play the fool.
I don’t want to be asked, “What did you do in the face of so many dead ... why didn’t you say what was going on?”
The Riodoce team misses Valdez, the funny bird who could curse like a port worker, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trusted his routine.
He would always wear his hat.
He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit at the same table.
Now they ask: Was his love of routine his ruin?
His death has also forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their job and stay alive.
"They don't like it when you engage with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret start-up and landing tracks" to move drugs.
“These things were not allowed,” Bojorquez said.
The result is, even in the best times, a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation.
Trust their own instincts.
If it smells bad, stay away from it.
The trouble is, said the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal, that "smell is a sense that can be misled ... and then the thing happened to Javier."
The old rules, as he and others say, no longer apply in Sinaloa – just like in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero, and other states where there is a toxic mixture of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions, and corrupt government officials.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where Riodoce employees met for security training, suddenly no phones were allowed. days earlier it became known that spyware sold exclusively to governments was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two policemen sought shelter from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.
They were commissioned by the state government to protect Riodoce’s offices in a four-story building in a middle-class neighborhood of Culiacan.
Half in a joke, some of the reporters wondered if these officers were among the 50 percent of policemen the governor himself called untrustworthy.
It’s been months since reporters went to the mountainous landscape, where the drug gangs are de facto under control.
For this week’s issue, Riodoce has looked at three main stories.
There was the murder of the brother of the former famous boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had an exposition on government spending that focused on the governor’s hometown.
And there was a group who carried out a kidnapping at one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the prosecutor’s office.
There was no official word about who was abducted or how it happened, so caution was needed when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite site of drug dealers and authorities.
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who belonged to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which dominated all political levels for almost a century.
Recently, several PRI governors have been charged with high-profile cases of corruption.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this premises, including one in which a son of “El Chapo” Guzman escaped a military assault.
Just a few months earlier, readers would have seen the Valdez column as the best-informed source about the abduction.
"In the past, we would have known what happened," said Villarreal, 46, nicknamed "El Flaco" because of his thin body height.
"Now all channels of communication with our sources are broken."
Valdez’s office has been converted into a storage space for signs and stickers protesting the murders of journalists because the employees have become something they themselves would never have expected: activists in the name of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez picked up a few signs and went to the prosecutor’s office the next morning for a demonstration over another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Michoacan.
A burned body was discovered and officials say, based on DNA tests, it is his own.
Thro the country, journalists have become louder by writing "SOS Press" on walkways and buildings in organized protests.
On that day, director Bojorquez is away in Washington and is trying to gather international support for justice in the Valdez case.
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after the murder of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and letting them be killed because they told the truth.
She has since requested that she be re-assigned by the government because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity.
Valdez has repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are “enveloped” by organized crime, government officials involved in it, and an indifferent society.
In his latest book, “Narco-Journalism,” he wrote that journalists are not only killed by drug gangs, but also on the orders of politicians and security forces who were stuck under a blanket with organized crime.
The media-guard group "Articulo 19" last year attributed more than half of attacks on journalists to police and officials.
“In Mexico, you’re dying because they want you to shut your mouth,” Ramirez said.
The murders have a deterrent effect.
No one forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
Her body was found along with a note allegedly signed by the Zetas cartel: “I’m here for my reports.”
A computer keyboard and headphones were located next to her head.
Some branches have chosen to close, such as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the murder of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others continue as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the assassination of their director in 2004.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with an editorial on the front page titled "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled their home countries or even left the country.
It is a painful decision.
It’s hard to find work in exile, and they’re still watching the streets and looking for dangers.
And sometimes they are hunted, as it appears to photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after fleeing Veracruz.
For those who stay behind and continue to work, it’s a daily dance with risky decisions.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that drug trafficking scares him.
“Mexico is going to hell, and that’s why I became a reporter,” he said.
At midnight last Friday, when the last issue had already ended, the editors of Riodoce were sitting on the sidewalk in front of the office and drinking beer, when all of a sudden all their phones began to ring.
A series of shootings involving gang rivals and security forces near the resort of Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.
The war continued to escalate, as promised by a number of cartel embassies in the region.
From the brick edge, they posted the news on the Riodoce website via mobile.
The title page had to be changed the next day.
Sirens cried out nearby - another shooting in the area.
Bojorquez looked at the policemen who were guarding to see if they were ready.
If they were afraid, they didn’t show it.
Under the huge portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible to all of Sinaloa, the employees of Riodoce followed his footsteps.
"How can you even think about closing," Bojorquez said, "if on the same day that Javier was murdered, the internship asked me to send her out on the street for reporting."
Dinosaurs used masking to avoid their enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue, though scary.
Now, researchers have found that the first findings of the incredible rhinoceros of a Canadian miner were so well preserved that experts described it as the “Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs.”
It was so well preserved that they could even find out that his bald skin was red-brown – and they said she had something of a “uncomfortable past.”
The report in the journal "Current Biology" described him as "the best preserved armored dinosaur ever found, and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world."
The fossil is a newly discovered species of Nodosaurus that lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
Its incredibly well-preserved state has stunned researchers who describe it as “really remarkable.”
According to reports in National Geographic, the armored plant-eater is the best preserved fossil of its kind.
It was found by Shawn Funk when he excavated on 21 March 2011 at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada.
He stumbled upon something that seemed to be missing from the surrounding rock, and decided to look closer.
The fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
They spent the next six years discovering the wild animal within the 2,500 pound (1.100 kg) earth cluster.
After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.
“If you just blink a little with your eyes, you could almost think it’s asleep,” said lead author Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature can be seen.
"It will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs."
Researchers have found that this plant-eater, although covered with armor and resembling a walking tank, was probably threatened by meat-eating dinosaurs.
The heavily armored dinosaur used a red and white disguise to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as counter-shadowing, which is also used by many modern animals.
This would have allowed it to mix better into its surroundings and avoid its enemies, experts say, suggesting it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million-year-old creature from the Nodosaur family first made headlines in May and is now on display at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and named it Borealopelta markmitchelli after museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team who spent more than 7,000 hours carefully uncovering it.
The astonishing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of shells and armor across his body.
They discovered contrast shadowing, a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom, meaning that the top of the creature was darker than its bottom.
Although contrast shading is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds that of the animals living today.
It suggests that the dinosaur was hunted by sufficient pressure by meat-eating dinosaurs, that evolution favoured the disguise of confrontation as a means of survival.
But most contemporary animals that use the counter shadowing — think of reefs, zebras, or belt animals — are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey, signaling that this nodosaurus has been exposed to a real struggle for survival.
“Strong predator behavior on a massive, heavily armored dinosaur shows how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the Crete era must have been,” Brown said.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the dinosaur’s skin was red brown.
Scientists continue to examine the animal for evidence about his life, including his preserved intestinal content, to find out what he ate as his last meal.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, he fell into a river and was driven out into the sea, where he sank on his back to the ocean floor.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as South Florida is today, and rivers and oceans are probably much more widespread inland than they are today.
“This nodosaur is truly remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved shell skin, but also remains preserved in three dimensions and retains the original shape of the animal,” Brown said.
“The result is that the animal looks almost the same today as it was in the early Crete era.
You don’t need to use a lot of imagination to reconstruct it.If you just shake your eyes a little, you could almost think he’s asleep.”
The Crete era was a time when giant theropods, meat-eating dinosaurs standing on two legs, travelled through the earth.
Although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of his terrifying ancestors.
These include the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38-foot (11.5 m) long, six-ton monster.
The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that the Borealopelta was sunk in the ocean after death and mummified in the mud.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he excavated on March 21, 2011 at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best-preserved armored dinosaur in the world, including skin and armor, and is complete from neck to hip.
The creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1.300 kg).
It contained two 20-inch-long tips that ripped from his shoulders.
The researchers believe that the armored plant-eater was flooded through western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.
But the dinosaur's underwater burial preserved his armor in exquisite detail.
The fossilized remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the hustles still cover hollow armor plates along the dinosaur.
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is as rare as a lottery win.
The more I look at it, the more confusing it becomes.
Stoned remains of the skin still cover the hollow armor plates that carry the animal’s skull.
His right forefoot is on his side, his five fingers are spread upwards.
I can count the shells on his soles.”
In the storm: mass carambolage on the A8: many injured
Heavy accident on Thursday evening on the A8: Nearly 30 vehicles are involved in a mass carambolage.
There are numerous injured, kilometers of congestion - and gaffles.
On the Stuttgart-München motorway (A8) about 20 people were injured in a mass carambolage late Thursday afternoon.
According to the police, around 5 p.m. between Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (Aichach-Friedberg district) during a storm 30 vehicles, including probably trucks, collided.
There was no information on the exact number of injured at first.
The injuries were mild to moderate, a police spokesman said.
A large number of rescue vehicles were on the scene of the accident.
The A8 was closed to Munich.
In the direction of Munich, a roughly ten kilometres long retreat was formed.
As one AZ reporter reports, there were also massive impediments on the opposite track - due to numerous gaffles.
The fire department noted the identification marks of the vehicle drivers, who now have to expect delicate penalties.
Shortly after 18:45 a second accident occurred on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.
There was a collision between a car and a car.
A rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident site.
Deutsche Bahn to Test Comfort Check-in
It is a moment that almost everyone has experienced: you are sitting in the train and sleeping without knowing anything.
Or you’re deeply immersed in your work and you just have a genius idea.
And then puff.
Comes the creator and wakes a foolish or tears the passenger out of the workflow in the middle.
The ticket control.
But the time of interruptions is soon over.
Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the unchecked ticket control.
You simply confirm by phone that you have taken your seat and thus devaluate the ticket.
A test operation is currently underway on two routes.
“When the offer comes, we will expand it.
It is then expected to be available at the beginning of next year on many other long-distance transport routes in Germany," a railway spokesman said.
“Comfort Check-in” means the train devaluation of tickets without Schaffner.
To be able to use it, however, a number of conditions must be met: you need a smartphone or a tablet.
And you have to have booked an online ticket – which is what most passengers already do.
You must also have purchased it via the train app, the DB Navigator, which is the most convenient way to book tickets anyway.
Finally, you need a seat reservation.
Because the “comfort check-in” works like this: you get on the train, call your ticket under “My tickets”.
In the test customers then a button for electronic devaluation appears.
Train attendants receive a message on their mobile devices that Passenger X is on the train and has taken the reserved seat Y.
If the train attendant comes to place Y at the ticket check, he knows that there is a passenger sitting there with an online ticket already devalued.
So you can continue to sleep, continue to work, keep silent.
The "check-in" has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train - which in turn is intended to benefit the passengers.
"Whoever wants to travel relaxedly without ticket control through our train staff, simply check in in the DB Navigator yourself.
This allows passengers to personalize their time on the train,” says Michael Peterson, Marketing Board of DB Distance Transport.
Second plus: “And our employees have more time than today to address the individual customer needs.”
Those who frequently ride trains know that in addition to delays and missed trains, ticket checks are among the biggest annoyances.
Because often you yourself, but in any case one of the fellow travellers does not have all the documents you need to devalue online tickets.
Either the credit card or identity card or any other document that must be presented is missing.
The result is endless discussions between train attendants and passengers, which leads to poor mood in the department or large space and delays in checking your own ticket and ultimately takes the creator time to take care of other matters.
Only a small number of customers can still use the new service.
And that only on the connections ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.
Other trains on the same route have not yet been unlocked.
How did an activist learn the answer to the question: “Who’s the streets?”
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to her core.
Just a day after she arrived in New York City, the St. Louis-born was sitting on the bed of an Airbnb apartment she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone.
She stumbled over a post from someone from high school.
“The police just killed an 18-year-old boy, and he’s still lying on the street,” it said.
Confused as no one else had posted the information on her feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with the handle @TheePharoah was constantly retweeted on their timeline.
The St. Louis area rapper was about to live tweet the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old who was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo.
He posted a picture of Brown’s lifeless body stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours.
“That’s wild,” Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new for them and their community.
She laid off her phone to return to tweets about people on the Canfield drive later in the evening.
There were photos of police gangs and people screaming, and of a man claiming to be Brown’s father, who carried a sign with the inscription: “Ferguson’s police just killed my unarmed son!”
She watched a live feed in which a police officer stood in front of a group of protesters with a beating dog.
In another video, she said, another policeman seized his gun and shouted, “I’ll kill you... animals all.”
“That’s not usual,” Ferrell recalled her statement.
“That’s not the kind of murder we’ve become accustomed to and we can call typical.”
At that moment I felt frost.
I was angry and crying.”
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 23 o'clock, she picked up her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson over the next three years is the subject of a new documentary, “Who’s Streets?” in theaters from the 11th.
It is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resilience, consisting of the viewpoint of people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell drove to Ferguson with her daughter, who was wearing a flower dress and a suitable crown, the two discussed a conversation they had countless times before that morning “about the black experience and the black state.”
"Do you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe in?" she recalled what she said.
“We’re going to Ferguson now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that wasn’t right.
I couldn’t take them with me,” Ferrell said later.
“What happened today is the culmination of what happened in the past.
She must know it and see it and be raised in it.
It must be well developed, knowing not only activism and organization, but also the different layers of black experience and black constitution, and what we need to do to become free, to free ourselves.
Even though I’m lucky enough to give her an experience where she personally doesn’t experience flagrant racism, she’s no different than the next black woman’s child.
I feel like I’d do her a bad service to keep her away from it.”
The first stop when they arrived in Ferguson was on South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police station that became a campsite as activists waited for possible non-accusation of Officer Darren Wilson.
There, Ferrell and her daughter joined up with a local business owner who was making lunch.
They prepared bags and helped to hand them over to protesters.
Slowly, a new kind of activism began to take shape for Ferrell.
"My activism has completely changed after August 9," she said, noting that as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was president of the Minority Student Nurses Association, focusing on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.
“I had no experience in organizing.
Everything has come.”
Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-directors of the film, during a evening demonstration.
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to "document" what happened.
One question came to Ferrell’s mind: “Do you want to document, or are you trying to find a story you can use?”
This skepticism was fuelled by countless cases of people, often whites, in a community that benefited from their pain and resilience.
As Folayan recently explained in an interview, “We had heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson didn’t center their voices and we wanted to do it differently.”
Folayan had already worked with then-co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the field known for his activism around death row inmates.
His engagement brought Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other locals, followed the team of “Who’s Streets?” in the years after Brown’s shooting.
"This documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us, we talk," Davis said.
"That was the main thing for me, how these people are portrayed, because that is how I will be portrayed."
The goal was not to focus on Ferrell’s experience – to show that the movement “is not a Messiah leader, but a community that comes together,” Folayan said – she proved to be the most open participant in the film.
As a result, documents from “Whose Streets?” show surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell’s life as she falls in love and marries her wife.
“I felt like naked,” Ferrell said, laughing when she first saw the finished product.
"But I understood that there must be some vulnerability in this work and the humanization of black people."
Furthermore, Ferrell’s story repeats the role of black gay women in the broader Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement, who shaped the film "BlacklivesMatter" on social media after the killing of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, identify as gay.
“Black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement overall,” Ferrell said, “and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fronts.
Black, gay women have to bear the main burden of everything.”
Folayan agreed to note that “the movement is reallyined by black women and many black women.”
However, she insists that “this is not an affirmative type of action” in which Ferrell was selected as the heart of the film due to her identity.
“She was the person who shaken up that energy,” she said.
“It’s not a coincidence, though she was at the forefront because with a life at these intersections as a black, gay woman, so much is at stake.
You can feel their energy through the screen.”
Meanwhile, the news cameras in Ferguson have long since disappeared, but the racial ties between the community and the police continue.
Ferrell is jailed for two and a half years for blocking a highway during a demonstration.
She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area, which she calls her home: “A Chaos.”
Still, she clings to a song and she feels committed to that memory since she walked out on the streets in Ferguson three years ago.
“It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose except our chains.”
From “Dream” to “Grand Madness”: TV readers discuss bit gallery
The bit gallery is moving people, even though it is far from being built.
But the idea of a shopping center in the southern part of the pedestrian zone has divided the population into supporters and opponents since its first presentation in 2009.
Cold is hardly the subject.
The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg".
While some say to the bit gallery, "That would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be really cool" (Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side: "Needs no man" (Siggi Betzen) or simply: "Grand Madness!" (Lars Scholz).
While supporters rely on one gallery to attract more customers to the city, which also benefits the rest of the, opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will then bleed out.
In addition, the gallery is planned exactly on the plot where the farmers market hall stands, where 13 direct marketers offer their products.
With the start of the construction work will be completed.
The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to the Beda Square with the possibility of sitting outside.
Simone Zimmer: "We have been shopping in the farmers market hall almost weekly for many years.
Mostly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the rural women always very much liked.
We also discovered the carcass.
We would like there to be a chance to maintain this offer even during and especially after the building of the gallery.
In other cities it is also.
Especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting.”
Gerd Densing: "Whether direct marketers settle in a market hall in the gallery depends on the amount of rent.
However, it is not likely to be very low in the new project."
Eva Kilic: “Why shopping palaces in Bitburg?
Whether clothes, shoes, pharmacies or supermarkets: I find that superfluous.
There is enough of it in our city.
You can see how many shops are empty here – some for months and years.
But since there is not even an ordinary weekly market here, it is all the more important that we retain at least the market hall.
After all, the goods offered there are fresh, are mostly offered directly by the producer and are also inexpensive.
As you can see, shops in a shopping center are only rented by larger companies, because the rents there are often not affordable for a retailer.
It is a pity that there are almost no special shops, and what is left of it will probably disappear.”
Wolf Fandel: “A shopping center with a market hall doesn’t fit for me.
And the gallery does not fit into Bitburg.
First of all, where is the farmers market hall going during the construction period?
The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long run, if the bit gallery is actually coming at some point.
Or does the ghost Bit-Galerie manage to drive all the shops out of Bitburg?”
George Marquet: “It just won’t work.
And a shopping center that is empty, no one needs.
In my opinion, it would have been better to promote a real farm market rather than this gallery.
But for a peasant market hall, thanks to the insanely many - as I think - meaningless construction projects in Bitburg, there is no room anymore.
If the peasant market hall is destroyed, a piece of culture will disappear again.”
Artist Creates Portraits With Chelsea Mannings DNA
In the middle of the room at the Fridman Gallery in New York, you can see many faces - white, black and brown, almost imperceptibly identical - hanging on cables from the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from cheeks and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former intelligence analyst served a 35-year prison sentence after publishing classified diplomatic reports through the WikiLeaks website.
The new exhibition, which opened on August 2, is called A Becoming Resemblance.
It is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline combined her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transwoman and pioneering dissident whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days left in office.
Through the algorithmic analysis of the DNA extracted by Manning and created from the 30 portraits of how someone with these genomic data could look, Dewey-Hagborg has created a sharp, though somewhat intellectual commentary not only on the formability of DNA data — the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations — but also on identity.
Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward but spoke openly about identifying as a woman since her puberty, was convicted in 2013 of 20 charges, including six violations of the law on espionage, computer fraud and theft.
Her image was suppressed by the prison so much that there was only one photo — a grain, black-and-white selfie in which Manning was visibly uncomfortable sitting on a driver’s seat wearing a platinum blonde wig — with which she was associated.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg just came from the big success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.
In it, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigarette stem and chewing gum by extracting DNA from the waste to create an image of what those people might look like.
That was the moment she received an email from a newspaper magazine.
"They conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a sort of portrait to accompany this article," Dewey-Hagborg explained at a press release of the new exhibition.
And she couldn’t be visited at that time and she couldn’t be photographed, so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned muse became unequal correspondents who exchanged several letters over the course of two years.
They even created a comic "Suppressed Images" illustrated by Shoili Kanungo that predicted a future in which the president would transform Chelsea's judgment and she would be able to see the exhibition in person.
That Obama would actually demand Manning’s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas just days after the book was released was a welcome kind of happy reunion.
There is something deep and strong about the opening of the exhibition even now, as Donald Trump is waging a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new, tweetable ways to further ignite the rigid divisions he was actually supposed to fix.
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things, she said that "things happen for a certain reason."
In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning, with her over-sized signature under it (the "i" in her family name is endowed with a heart), called for an end to "the automatic fragmentation, the basis of which has been gender, race, sexuality and culture."
On the opposite wall is their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousand-foot of Cs and Gs and Ace, written in pencil.
Dewey-Hagborg hoped, by incorporating the 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the artist's highly developed scientific lexicon), to show how astonishingly similar, at least biologically, we are all.
“What people will hopefully take with it is that our genomes don’t care who we are and how open genetic data is for interpretation and how subjective they are,” said Dewey-Hagborg, whose 2007 video work, Spurious Memories, is also visible.
“DNA data can tell so many different stories, so that’s 30 of those stories.”
The last piece in the exhibition, kept in a separate room, is a page from the above-mentioned comic novel.
She shows Manning as she appears with a freelance phone in her hand from the U.S. disciplinary barracks like King-Kong.
“If they cool your speech, they’ve won,” they say.
“Never shut your mouth.”
"It came directly from a letter she wrote to me," said the artist, who greets from Philadelphia.
“I still get goose skin when I talk about it.”
Manning hasn’t seen the exhibition personally yet – as predictively predicted in the comic book – but if she does, then she’ll be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks, by her own genomic simulacres clustered together like hordes of protesters.
That was also targeted, like everything in the exhibition, up to the size (5 “2, Manning’s stature) at which their genetic haplogroups were written with a pencil.
“In the past, I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd,” Dewey-Hagborg said of the portraits.
“I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea, like the movement that was also behind their liberation.”
Northwestern University professor and Oxford University employee sought for murder
A nationwide human hunt is ongoing for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee of the University of Oxford, who are being sought as suspects after a man was struck in a luxurious Chicago apartment with fatal injuries.
On Monday, arrest warrants were issued for Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) for murder for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, as the records of Cook County District Court show.
The documents say that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several bites.
A community warning system released by the Chicago Police Department says the body was discovered on July 27.
Officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with multiple injuries to his body.
Cornell-Duranleau was still declared dead on the scene, and detectives are investigating the beating as murder, while police are actively looking for the two suspects, officials said.
Lathem has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, vice president for university relations, said in an email statement that Lathem was now in graduation leave and banned from entering the Northwestern University campus.
"This is now a criminal case being investigated by the competent authorities, and Northwestern University is cooperating in this investigation," Cubbage said.
Warren is a Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University.
A spokesman for the university and Somerville College said in an email statement that "we are in contact with the police in the UK and ready to help the U.S. investigative agencies in any way possible."
The statement added that Warren’s colleagues were shocked and wanted him to stand up.
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department, Anthony Guglielmi, said he urged the suspects to confront the authorities.
“The police have an idea of where they are, and our efforts to locate them are increasing,” Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities are helping to find the suspects.
Guglielmi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a mysterious tip saying that something had happened in apartment 1008.
Police described the scene as very cruel.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident also occurred on July 27.
It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were inside the building.
“We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship,” Guglielmi said.
The management team at Grand Plaza released a statement to the residents: “Police is currently working on the victim’s timeline and background, investigating a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident.”
"We will complete the WADA roadmap in the near future" - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it will not be long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) will be implemented.
"At a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the roadmap, RUSADA has been granted the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).
The WADA roadmap has been updated in this regard," Mutko said on Thursday.
The PM commented on the second part of the WADA Roadmap for Compliance with the Code, which describes the criteria for the resumption of RUSADA and was recently published on the organization’s website.
According to Mutko, it contains nothing that could cause Russia to worry.
“Everything has been announced, everything is being implemented.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future," he added.
However, one of the criteria on the list states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the results of the WADA-approved investigation by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren on alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sport.
Mutko said: “We are conducting the investigation because our anti-doping system has admitted an error.
All measures have been implemented.
But there were no government programs, and we will not admit anything that doesn’t exist.”
Mutko’s words coincided with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of the independent Russian anti-doping commission.
Speaking with the Russian sales company RSport at the beginning of the day, Smirnov admitted problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organizations, but then added: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one intends to accept this report unconditionally,” Smirnov added.
RUSADA was excluded from conducting doping controls in Russia in November 2015 as a result of the doping scandal.
However, she was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping (UKAD).
Following a visit to the organization’s headquarters in Moscow in July, WADA Director-General Olivier Niggli stated that RUSADA is moving “in the right direction” to be resettled.
Aldi no longer sells eggs
This was shared by the business groups.
It is a mere precautionary measure, no further health damage can be assumed, the statement said.
From now on, only eggs are expected to be delivered to Aldi, which have been negatively tested for fipronil-containing anti-lues.
Aldi wants to bring clarity and transparency to its customers.
The Startups That Will Help Your Business Not Become the Next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure her employee’s luck with her e-commerce startup, but the surveys didn’t work.
Answers were often vague, little helpful, or – worse yet – fraudulent.
And even if you promised anonymity, some workers did not trust the process.
“There was simply never consistency and objectivity,” said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-commerce hair care company Madison Reed.
She called for help from outside.
A new race of Human Resources start-ups is growing to help companies figure out how their employees feel.
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it enables companies to conduct surveys, address special groups and demographic groups, provide employees with anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases allow whistleblowers to bypass C-Suite executives and contact the board directly.
"You now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for tracking their health, but where is the Fitbit for your business?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and chief executive of Redwood City start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Errett said she gained a better insight into what her employees think and feel over the three years with Glint.
In addition to the snap surveys and surveys of specific teams, it offers a company’s heat map that shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which executives have low approval scores – so you can grasp why.
Companies come to realize that they need to stay at the forefront of workplace culture so you don’t become the next Uber to get involved in scandals since a former employee posted a blog post describing an environment of harassment where those who spoke were punished.
For start-ups like Glint, this desire for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity.
The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could be worth more than $118.7 billion in 2020, according to the financial technology website Let’s Talk Payments.
Denver, Colorado, startup Convercent, which helps companies prevent and detect bad behavior, saw a rising interest and activity earlier this year amid the Uber case in miscredit.
Convercent has 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber has recently signed up as a customer.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to send tailored “puls” surveys, collect confidential answers in real time, and view the heat maps of your problem areas.
It also provides an anonymous SMS hotline that allows employees to report bad behavior.
And if the chief executive is involved, complaints go directly to the supervisory board.
“The public opinion court has captured the regulators,” said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercent.
If a company is found to treat its employees badly or behave unethically, it can experience costly consequences from consumer boycott, employee fluctuation, and lawsuits, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations, has been using Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their company headquarters.
Previously, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company headquarters, submit a formal complaint and hope that he or she was taken seriously.
It was often a intimidating and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays’ General Counsel, who said there was no good way to track employee complaints.
Now that the company uses Convercent, problems previously hidden by executives sitting in offices in cities or states — such as discrimination, harassment, or unfair practices — can be identified and addressed faster.
“I can get closer to this holistic, 360-degree view of the experience with employment,” said Vitrano, who heads Ruby Tuesday’s Risk Management Group.
"And we protect our shareholders from employment disputes."
Companies began to take ethics, values, and employee engagement more seriously in 2002 after accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations caused by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.
But it took until the “social media came to its right” that companies realized that they couldn’t prevent their dirty laundry from going online.
“Before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy,” he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service, charging companies with recurring fees for using their products.
It is a business model and an opportunity that finds the approval of Venture Capital investors who have supported both startups.
Convercent received $10 million in funding in February from companies like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising the total capital to $47 million.
Glitzern secured $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners, bringing its total funding to $60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising, given the interconnected nature of, culture and venture capital.
There is a growing complex of research that shows that today’s employees expect more from their jobs than before.
In competitive markets like Silicon Valley, high wages and interesting projects are just bets.
Employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you are giving your time to a company with a positive mission.
“When people are happy to be in a company, feel that their voices are heard, and that the work you do is worth it, then they feel more committed to making that business succeed,” said Nina McQueen, vice president of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors return when their portfolio companies run well. companies run well when employees are committed and engaged.
If third-party analytics tools promise to increase employee engagement and engagement, it’s no wonder you’ll find support.
The data on employee engagement is important according to the workplace culture experts.
But the data is useless if the managers of a company do not take action.
In fact, when a company asks employees for your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on its way.
And if the change doesn’t come fast enough, or doesn’t come at all, it can raise disappointment and demotivate employees.
“If you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you need to be prepared to have 4,000 conversations,” said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at business management firm Kotter International, who has seen companies rely too much on gathering data.
"Because if you don't follow, employees will ask themselves, 'Have you really heard me?
Are you taking care of it?
And whoever you don’t care about, why should I?”
Madison Reed, who is now conducting monthly employee surveys, was able to take action on the same day when a problem is about Glint, according to Errett.
And after gathering feedback from frustrated employees, through the speed of decision making and the quality of communication, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and add communication training to address the problems.
At Ruby Tuesday, the company always gets new insights about employees, and it hopes that in the long run, this will lead to better employee engagement in an industry known for high sales.
“If you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency, you will lose the people,” Vitrano said.
When you lose people, you also lose customers.
If you lose customers, you will lose business.
The NCAA Eliminates the Two-Day Practice and Makes a Long Day for the Bruins
It’s approaching 23:00 as a lot of UCLA football players are chatting on one side of the team’s new training fields on campus.
Some have pulled out their sweaters and showed their back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp.
For a good part of the team, these inactive minutes represent a lunch break.
Players enrolled in the Summer Courses will return to their final exams after the three-hour practice, before returning to the Waterman Football Center at 6:30 a.m. the next morning.
"That's a real kick for the boys for the next three days," Bruins coach Jim Mora said shortly before Monday became Tuesday.
The NCAA is eliminating two-day exercises to ease the player’s burden, and it has actually extended their days – at least until the final on Friday.
That’s why the first three UCLA training sessions should start at 7:15 p.m. to meet the players’ already packed schedules.
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bruins postponed the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and performed practical exercises for the first time during Moras’ six seasons in Westwood during the summer school.
They are scheduled to hold 18 exercises over the course of August. 20 before the start of formal game preparations for their debut against Texas A & M in September.
Mora said he supports the NCAA’s rule change, even if it adds another point to the busy routes of players.
“We put this huge burden on them for three or four days, and it’s very challenging,” Mora said.
“And they just pushed it through, they keep placing, they’re great people.
I think once we get there until Saturday and we have more time, it’ll be really great.”
The UCLA will end its practices as soon as the camp is completed, which, given the clear sights of its fields from an adjacent parking lot and the adjacent Luskin Center, a high-end hotel that has already been thrown with soccer balls cleaning a protective net behind a goal post, will not be an easy task.
Bruins players are expected to occupy the hotel starting this weekend, but Mora admitted that there could be a problem once these rooms are free during the season.
“We will use our security,” Mora said.
“That’s a real problem, and it’s not far-reaching to think that people rent a room there and then set up there to record an exercise.
If you have the video tape of an exercise, it’s a pretty good deal.
But we have security forces there, and we have security forces on Parking 8.
We will do our best with what we have.
I am not too worried about this.
We have a plan.”
Facebook to Increase Fact Verification in Fight against Fake News
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with fake news to third-party facts verificators and then display their results under the original post, the world’s largest online social network said on Thursday.
The company said in a statement on its website that it will start using up-to-date machine learning methods to detect potential false messages and send them to fact-checkers, who may display results of fact-check from the original article.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news, many of which are believed to have also influenced the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe, with French voters flooded with false stories ahead of the May presidential election, and Germany supports a plan to punish social media networks if they fail to quickly remove hateful posts like before the elections there in September.
On Thursday, Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new fact-checking will be launched in the US, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
“In addition to recognizing which stories are being challenged by third-party fact-checkers, people want more context to make informed decisions about what they are reading and sharing,” said Sara Su, product manager for Facebook News in a blog post.
She added that Facebook will continue to test its feature on the “related article” and is working on other changes to its news feed to reduce fake news.
Creating a Comic Novel: A Castle in the History of England
In its more recent past, the small Scotney Castle was seen in a Squeeze music video and was a hole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his cozy seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent and has now become the inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mopshired Yorkshireman with a passion for historical documents.
“I find it so nice to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years,” he said.
"What a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand."
'A Castle in England' spans the period from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scotney. Each story was illustrated by a different, emerging British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It’s not Rhodes’ first book based on an archive: he wrote 2014’s ‘Dead Men’s Teeth and Other Stories’, a collection inspired by documents in the British Library – a project he unexpectedly found emotional.
"I just reacted to the thumbprint on the side of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700s who worked for the Jacobins," he says.
“This is his fingerprint.
Letters always smell smoke, because at that time a fire was lit because of the light.
For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect as if he was himself.
I love the archives!”
For someone so struck with old papers that he’s backed by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle for four months (“To be honest: I’ve a little overestimated my welcome greeting”) this all seems too nice to be true.
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian “new” castle, looking through the archives and studying the castle’s many treasures and curiosities, such as the mounted hyena heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries digging.
He walked through the site and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscapers, gardeners, and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.
Then, at night, he drank whiskey and began to write.
The intimate story of Scotney is relatively unknown, as the National Trust received full access only in 2006 when her last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the employees just started taking care of the archive, which he described as “hundreds of years in which aristocrats said, “Oh, throw it on the roof.”
Diaries, letters from the time of the English Empire, maps depicting who owned what: “You might think land conflicts would be boring,” Rhodes says, “but there was a birch for which two families fought.
Boys, let it all go!”
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immerse yourself in English history on a wider basis, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man leaving the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381.
"There is a record of a riot that occurred in 1380 at the castle, in this book titled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex'," says Rhodes.
“The peasant uprising began in this area and I thought an uprising was a good start.
Per the two are connected?”
Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - such as 'The Priest', which tells the story of the Jesuit father whom the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or 'The Smuggler', which depicts the 18th-century smuggler Arthur Darrell who staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery made only years later when his coffin was excavated).
The Darrells are Rhodes' favorite family of Scotney: "The gentlemen seemed to be pretty scammers, constantly making debts and spending money on things they couldn't afford.
Other generations of Darrell men solved their debt crises by marrying wealthy old women – I imagine them as a bunch of good-looking boys, with a talent to promote inheritance.”
After the end of his service at the castle, Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences.
He spent two weeks in the Finnish wilderness for a comic book about Elämänmäki, the site of a sanatorium from the early 20th century that has since been reclaimed by nature.
But Scotney has a special place for him.
“I was sad to go back,” he says.
It was like, “Oh, now I have to deal with the damn life again.”
Campaign Launched: Over 300-Year-Old Marian Chapel in Rhöndorf Hidden
With the covering of the 301 years old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf, the city of Bad Honnef on Friday launched its campaign for the introduction of a new roof mark (Roundview of Thursday).
Even until Thursday, Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz will keep the logo and slogan secret.
At the end of August, a festival will be held on the island of Grafenwerth.
“Too good for us.
Or?” ask the creators of the action since yesterday on the posters at the Rhöndorfer Chapel.
“We don’t really think that (of course!),” they wrote on their website released yesterday.
"But we use this measure to get your attention.
And to make it clear that some things are better than they seem.
Basically, we are firmly convinced that as citizens of Bad Honnefer we know very well about the beauty and attractiveness of our city.”
The action is more than “just” a logo and a slogan.
"It is necessary to formulate a unique promise, one that gives the city a distinctive characteristic of isolation."
It is in competition with other municipalities.
For an average five-digit amount, the city of Bad Honnef can cost its new rooftop and the campaign.
Military Reforms in Turkey – Erdogan’s Fear of the Army
Every year, at the beginning of August, the Supreme Military Council (YAS) in Ankara advises on retirement and promotion in the officer corps.
So this week too.
At first glance, this is a normal process.
But nothing is routine with the Turkish armed forces a year after the coup attempt.
The meeting was no longer held in the building of the General Staff, as before, but in the headquarters of the Prime Minister.
Under the leadership of the Prime Minister, the five Deputy Prime Ministers and the Ministers of Defense, Home Affairs, Justice and Foreign Affairs also took part in the discussions.
The civilians in the YAS were in surplus.
The government is pulling the ropes in the military.
Chief of Staff Hulusi Akar remains in office, but the commanders of the Army, Air Force and Navy have been removed.
Since the failed coup, President Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals.
More than 10,000 soldiers have been removed from the ranks of the army – mostly because of alleged links to the movement of exile preacher Fethullah Gülen, whom Erdogan sees as the conductor of the coup attempt.
486 people allegedly directly involved in the coup attempt have been tried in Ankara since this week.
Even the day after the coup, Erdogan described the coup as a “gift from God” because it gave him the opportunity to “completely clean up” the armed forces.
But does Erdogan really control the army?
At the end of February, the newspaper "Hürriyet" published an article entitled "Discomfort at the military headquarters".
In the General Staff there are concerns about an increasing "Islamization" of the army, which is manifested, among other things, in the abolition of the ban on the headscarf for female soldiers, the newspaper wrote.
The cleansing of the army and security forces continues.
In mid-July, Erdogan ordered the dismissal of another 7,395 civil servants, including 2,303 police officers and 546 soldiers.
It seemed as if Erdogan had shut down the military.
The generals were considered earlier than the real lords of the country.
Three times they cleaned, citing their role as guardians of the secular state order.
After his 2002 election victory, Erdogan pushed the power of the military step by step down, not least with reference to the reform requirements of the European Union.
Former officers say Erdogan is targeting the Islamization of the armed forces.
In the journal "Vocal Europe", an unnamed officer who sought asylum after the coup attempt for fear of persecution abroad warned that the Turkish army would be "filled with extremists and salafists" in a few years.
If this is true, such a development could not leave NATO cold.
Nevertheless, there are doubts in the Alliance after the cleansings about the readiness of the Turkish army.
The leadership structures and operational capabilities are “weakened,” NATO diplomats say.
Washington changes rules for green card
There will be a new U.S. immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card, President Donald Trump said, quoted by the media.
It envisages reducing the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 a year, stricter rules for obtaining visas for temporary work permits and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the President.
The bill will be discussed in both houses of Congress.
“This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers, and will do so by changing the way the U.S. issues green cards to citizens from other countries.”
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system.
“This new application procedure will benefit candidates who speak English, who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy,” Trump said.
Ministry wants to repair track for racing shuttle
Over the past few months, the future of the racing shuttle has been repeatedly discussed - now it is supposed to go very quickly.
Before the end of the year, it is planned to be built on the marode route on which the tourist railway runs.
In order to secure the future of the racing shuttle in the long run, according to the Ministry of Transportation, construction work on the track should begin this year.
“With the decision to continue ordering and repairing the Ilmenau-Rennsteig route, the country commits to this connection, which is especially important for tourism,” Transport State Secretary Klaus Sühl said in Erfurt on Friday.
The cost of repairing the route was estimated at approximately 2.5 million euros.
Of that amount, the country will take over 75 percent.
The contract, on the basis of which the shuttle will also be ordered from the country in the future, is currently being finalised, Sühl said.
The Ministry and the South Thüringen Railway as the operator have already agreed on the technical details.
"The roadmap, the vehicles used and the quality standards have been negotiated," Sühl said.
The planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be concluded for a period of eleven years.
The racing shuttle will be ordered regularly in December 2017.
The Rennsteig Shuttle is a popular railway connection between the railway stations of Ilmenau and Rennsteig.
In recent months, a pilot operation has been conducted to test whether the route is used by enough people to order it regularly again in the future.
The route is also partly hard constructed.
The rise of sex robots is real, and we should be worried
Just as you thought 2017 could not be even crazy, a new report comes about the technological developments in the field of sex robots.
Yes indeed .
Sex robots are a big deal right now.
Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) released a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharkey, emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we need to start taking their rise seriously.
Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its nipple shape, and the type of finger nail.
“People joke about them, but the companies deliver a lot of it, and we’ll see them even more often,” Mr. Sharkey said at the release of his new report.
Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicon coat that feels warm – with conscious human reactions achieved by artificial intelligence.
The user can also "adjust" his robot according to his beliefs, choosing everything from the robot's eye color to the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails.
But it’s getting even more disturbing as many robots have the “personalities” that would make a Stepford woman look progressive.
Modern sex dolls have evolved into robots with a silicone coat.
The RealBotix robot, for example, allows its users to customize their robots to the characteristics they find appealing, such as shyness.
And then there are the Roxxxy Gold sex robots developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities such as “Frigid Farrah” that conveys the impression of shyness and “Wild Wendy” with a “adventurous” personality.
“Roxxxy Gold has a personality that fits your personality as well as possible,” says the True Companion website.
So she likes what you like, and she doesn’t like what you don’t like, etc.
She also has her moods throughout the day - just like real people!
She may be tired, fixed on conversation, or she may be “in mood!”
There are many disturbing aspects of this rise of sex robots – not least because they replace real human relationships – but the submissive female traits that allude to rape when one steps to Frigid (that is, opposing) Farrah worry one most.
On his website, True Companion compared Roxxxy to a vibrator, but for men.
“If women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can’t men have Roxxxy?”
However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy.
Their emergence and increasing sophistication indicate something darker and deeper in our culture, a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition.
Most men, of course, will not hold sex robots, and while the FRR notes their rising popularity, they are still temporarily on the brink of consumer culture.
But what runs through the margins can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of the time we live in.
And many people are not strange or offensive until the free market allows them to do so.
There is some overlap that these highly advanced sex robots are emerging at a time when women’s rights are threatened worldwide, when there is a president in the White House who has rumored of sexually assaulting women.
The most frightening aspect of the TV series “The Handmaid’s Tale” are not the graphic images, the swallowed bodies and the outstretched eyes, but how realistic this vision seems.
The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it doesn’t feel like a big leap.
The goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical resemblance to actual women as realistic as technically possible (although with porn star proportions).
Their builders want them to feel human, to mimic the movement of a real body.
But, put to the point, when it comes to their “personalities,” the robots don’t represent real women.
You cannot separate from your companion or just leave.
They have no mediation or background history, nothing that suggests independence, or anything that could disrupt the imagination of total submission.
In other words, they are good slaves.
Or to express it in the speech of 2017: Maid
Trump’s great achievement?
He makes Mitt Romney an insider of common sense.
It has become an insight of the Trump era that the political divisions that have polarized the U.S. electorate have also split families in miniature.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, there were newspapers in the U.S. with advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump-elect relatives.
We all supposedly struggle to let our filter bubbles burst.
Less noticed has been the power of Trump to bring families together.
I mention this because my cousin, a leftist poet who lives in Chicago and has long been involved with the Republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York.
It reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican relative she had fought for decades for politics, is suddenly and strangely on the same side.
This is a good thing about the dining table, but I notice in another context that this also involves significant risks.
The left has been strengthened by Trump, but the disruptive effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.
When we talk about “normalization” and Trump, we refer to the frightening possibility that one day his puppies will no longer reject us.
However, there’s an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump “normalizes” right-wing Republicans, who suddenly appear to be inconspicuous in comparison to his standards.
I find myself infested these days by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney’s crazy version of the madman – the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew what his tax return looked like) – both of which compared to Trump actually appear to one as very mild crimes.
If Trump goes, the next Republican candidate just has to be mentally healthy to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.
When my cousin was in the city, we took our kids to the carousel in Central Park, the largest of the carousels in New York's park department, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city when you don't need caffeine.
The horses are enormously large, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder – all the clowns are crumbling and the animals twist to look over their own shoulders with fear – extremely dark and the climbing music conveys this in strange ways.
So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of high buildings become old, the skylines become too familiar to offer a lot of excitement, and the reality of the city will not meet the dream.
Thirty-five years later, and I’m still not quite over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage isn’t actually a Swiss Cottage — the theme pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage doesn’t count — but a big circular in north London.
However, the Central Park carousel is still a weirdly magical experience, as here two two-year-olds, an 11-year-old and two women in their 40s can go on and all have a great time.
If I could have rated the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately no one asked for it.
On the other hand, I was forced to rate my “experience” with transactions on a scale of one to five stars this week in a supermarket before I could scratch my credit card.
In the coffee house at the corner of my street, it’s the same, plus the option to match the rating with a 15% drinking fee – this to buy something over the shop table.
This not only leads to a slowdown in what should actually be a neutral exchange, but also puts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no one is needed.
The poor woman in the storehouse stood excusingly laughing while I was tired of giving her my five-star credit card.
Oscar Pistorius hospitalized in prison with chest pain
Pistorius has left prison for a second time.
Last year, he was hospitalized for treatment of cuts to his wrists, which he suffered after a fall in his cell, according to prison authorities.
Pistorius was convicted of murder following an appeal by prosecutors against a first death sentence.
He killed Steenkamp in the early morning hours of Valentine’s Day 2013 by shooting her several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed that he thought his girlfriend was a nighttime intruder hiding in the cabin.
Prosecutors have announced their intention to file this time against the six-year prison sentence of Pistorius Appell, which they say is too modest.
The National Enforcement Authority said it will appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the objection could be heard this year.
Pistorius is in danger of increasing his sentence to 15 years if the prosecutors succeed.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
When Farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
As the last of the Blumberger schools, the fourth-class students from Fützen and Epfenhofen were discharged to the holidays and further schools.
Three of the dismissed students will go to high school in the future, four to real school.
The head of the school, Angelika Sitte, welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürgerhaus Biesental in Epfenhofen on Tuesday evening.
As a symbol of school dismissal, the 29 students of the four classes, led by Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder, chose a young eagle who grows up in the chicken farm but then is released.
In addition, the munter crowd led a musical entitled "The eagle in the chicken farm up".
Farmer Arnold found a strange egg, and let it sprinkle from his chickens.
Instead of a chicken, a small eagle came out.
But the hope of turning him into a chicken broke, the eagle spread his wings on a high mountain and fled.
After that, the third and fourth classes showed a chicken dance in the study of Yvonne Frank.
The chickens danced with the young bowls, which carried cylinders to the bet.
The eagle stands for integration, said school director Angelika Sitte.
The young animal is different from the other young animals (chickens), but belongs to it.
He will never be like a chicken.
His purpose is to be free.
She wished every fourth grade student to feel accepted in his new school.
It was followed by a word of thanks to the colleagues, the former school director Michael Müller, who repeatedly jumped into class clocks, and the parents representatives.
The year is over, said class teacher Sophia Schumacher.
She dismissed her students after two years of class because it was a really great time.
Eventually, they could rely on the fourth class.
At the end of the day, all students sang a song of summer time and holiday time.
There was great joy among the children.
Eight first-class students have already signed up for the new school year.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians have been detained for illegal campsites in Greece, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said.
On the morning of August 1, in Sithonia, a group of illegal tenting people were arrested by the police, including the two Bulgarians.
They were released the same day, while an investigation is currently underway.
The Foreign Ministry bTV that the Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have tightened controls over the free campsite and impose substantial fines on anyone found staying in a place not intended for that purpose.
Controls will continue throughout the season.
The ministry said the court could impose a fine.
Software Update for Diesel Vehicles: What Affected People Need to Know Now
How exactly does the software update take place?
Do diesel drivers need to participate?
The most important questions and answers in overview.
At the diesel summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for a total of about 5.3 million cars.
They are intended to improve the emission behavior of cars of the Euro 5 and Euro 6 emission classes.
Euro 4 or worse diesel is excluded.
Anja Smetanin of ACE Auto Club Europe gives reviews:
Is the new action mandatory?
No, the negotiated software updates are voluntary.
“The mandatory updates previously applied only to vehicles that have scam software,” says Anja Smetanin.
This was ordered by the Federal Motor Transport Authority (KBA).
How and when will customers be informed about updates?
The manufacturers have announced a quick implementation in the coming months, but have not yet given a precise date.
Daimler has announced that it will address all affected persons.
If any inspection is due, it will be done within its framework.
How long will the restructuring take overall?
“It’s hard to say,” Smetanin said.
This depends on the commitment of the manufacturers as well as on political pressure.
“Because we’ve seen, car manufacturers don’t voluntarily act on environmental issues so far.”
How long does the update take?
The re-equipment itself could only take three to four hours in the workshop.
It may be time-consuming to get a date.
What do drivers do who do not drive a car from BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group?
The ACE advises to wait.
Probably foreign manufacturers would follow, according to Smetanin.
Is the price of Euro 4 cars going down?
The ACE is afraid of it.
Especially in areas where driving restrictions are in place.
In rural areas, there are no value losses for older diesel.
The ACE advises to wait with a sale.
LL Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award
The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington.
The first award ceremony under President Trump promises to become political.
One of the winners did not want to come - out of protest.
LL Cool J (49) is the first rapper to receive one of the coveted awards from the prestigious Kennedy Center.
As the cultural institution announced on Thursday, this year, singer Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68) as well as choreographer Carmen de Lavallade (86) and TV producer Norman Lear (95) are also among the honored.
The awards will be awarded at the beginning of December.
Traditionally, U.S. President Donald Trump will host a reception and attend the award with his wife Melania.
The award winner Lear, who became known for progressive TV series, has already announced that he will not participate in the gala.
He told the New York Times: “This presidency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights – even to deprive them of the funds – and that burdens me.”
Estefan, 59, stressed that she would use the conversation with Trump to clarify her point of view.
The Kennedy Center, named after former President John F. Kennedy, is the largest cultural institution in the U.S. capital.
Previous prize winners include Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, Robert De Niro, George Lucas, Tom Hanks and Sting.
Make the City Vital
Roland Wacker, Haslach’s city builder, will retire next year.
The job has already been issued, but suitable candidates are rare.
Wacker has been a city builder for 31 years.
And the work still makes him a lot of fun, as he conveyed in the press conference.
He reports of varied, but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor.
At the same time, he is surprised that no application yet meets the requirement profile.
The city is looking for an architect or construction engineer as soon as possible.
Thus, taking into account the regular termination deadlines, there should still be enough time for an introduction.
Since Haslach acts as a lower building law authority for the administrative community, the applicant must present corresponding certificates.
This is the function that the city wants to maintain.
If they could no longer fill them, citizens would have to go to Offenburg for consultation.
But close citizenship is important to the city and to it itself, says Wacker, who reports of a good working climate and good mood between authorities and citizens.
In more than 30 years in office, several significant projects have accumulated, which Wacker looks back with pride.
"We make the city worth living," he is confident about the construction office and its employees.
But also in the future, varied projects are on the agenda: the transformation of the former Hukla area and the Niederhofen parking lot, for example, has begun.
The Kinzig Bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is being renovated, and the renovation of the stadium is still a topic.
The latter alone will cost around 1.5 million euros, "if we do it right," Wacker estimates.
“All in all, great tasks await my successor.
Working here is fun.”
There is a lot of room for a city builder.
With Haslach’s own farm and gardening, you can react to a lot quite flexibly.
"You can move a lot," says Wacker, and the design of the green plants is often praised by citizens and visitors.
Since the old town as an ensemble is under monumental protection, it is important to "have an eye on what fits" when new buildings are approved, emphasizes the departing city builder.
The city manager has a great responsibility.
He says, “At the end of the day, everything runs over my table.”
When it comes to care and coordination, he can count on long-time employees: Markus Neumaier (Hochbau) has been there for ten years, Manfred Schöner (Tiefbau) has been there for 15 years.
Also, that his successor will stay for a long time, Wacker wishes: "We are looking for someone who really identifies with the place and wants to stay."
Because continuity is important not only for a good operating climate, but also for the further design of the city.
Those who wish to work for Roland Wacker should, according to the city of Haslach, be able to demonstrate completed studies as a graduate engineer or a bachelor with a specialty in architecture and have good expertise in the fields of construction planning and construction planning law.
The City Construction Office is responsible for high and low construction, construction management planning, land construction affairs, administration of urban properties, the City Farm with the Bauhof and the City Gardens, and the lower building law authority including the protection of monuments.
Bicycle thrown on lines: Southern railway route blocked
According to police, the previously unknown perpetrators threw the blue bicycle from the railway transit in the area of Leobener Straße (B116) onto the lines.
These were damaged so much that the approaching freight train had to be stopped.
Investigators are starting with two male perpetrators and have been searching for them since night hours.
Near the scene, witnesses observed a pink scooter and a bicycle driver.
“That goes well beyond a lousbubenstreich,” ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch told the APA.
The perpetrator or perpetrators would have put themselves in great danger and also endangered train traffic.
In addition to the damage to the locomotive and the facility, as well as the minutes of delay and the costs of rail replacement traffic, penalties from rail customers could also fall on the perpetrators.
This is a “significant” sum, the spokesman said.
The damage was repaired on Friday afternoon, and rail traffic on the southern railway route could be operated without impediments.
Nearly ten passenger trains were crashed on Friday morning, two of them involved long-distance traffic.
Freight trains did not stop, but they were delayed.
ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch said about 200 meters of overhead lines had to be replaced.
Isolators and masters were also damaged.
Red Meat, Milk Products, and Chocolate Could Help Relieve IBD (Inflammatory Bowel Disease)
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.
But a new study claims the exact opposite: A diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could relieve the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
The incurable condition, which affects around 1.3 million people in the U.S. and 300,000 in the UK, causes stomach cramps and bloating, recurring or bloody diarrhea, weight loss, and extreme fatigue.
While those affected are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at the University of Washington found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins helps develop immune cells that promote a tolerant gut.
The lead researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells patrol in the gut to ensure that harmful microbes hidden in food do not enter the body.
Cells that are able to trigger inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance tends too far towards inflammation, it can result in inflammatory bowel disease.
Experiments have found that a kind of tolerance-promoting immune cell occurs in mice that carry a specific bacterium in their intestines.
And the bacterium needs tryptophan – one of the building blocks of proteins – to trigger the appearance of the cells.
Professor Colonna said, “We have made a connection between a species of bacteria – Lactobacillus reuteri – which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their diet, the more of these immune cells they had.”
He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a tryptophan-rich diet would promote a more tolerant, less inflammatory gut environment, if the same system also works in humans.
Postdoctoral student Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan studied a type of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found that one group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same strain, which was housed separately, did not.
She suspected that the difference had to do with the intestinal microbiome of mice – the community of bacteria, viruses, and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The intestines of the mice were DNA sequenced and six species of bacteria were found that were present in the mice with the immune cells, but were absent in the mice.
Mice were raised in a sterile environment so they lacked an intestinal microbiome and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells were created.
To understand how the bacteria affected the immune system, the researchers allowed L. reuteri to grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid – without the bacteria – to immature immune cells isolated from the mice.
The immune cells evolved into tolerance-promoting cells.
When the active component was cleared from the liquid, it turned out to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism, known as indol-3 lactic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the feed of the mice, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when tryptophan levels were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that humans have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
She said, “The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the gut.
Potentially, high levels of tryptophan in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an expansion of this population."
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United has engaged a "genius" with Nemanja Matic
At Manchester United, Nemanja Matic has signed a “genius,” Jose Mourinho believes after the midfielder made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
Chelsea’s £40 million signature started with a 2:1 win in Dublin, the last pre-season game before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid starts on Tuesday, and impressed in the holding role as people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira advanced at will.
Matic, however, had been excluded from the preparatory Asian tour of the Blues and managed only 45 minutes, which made Mourinho admit he had to improve before the start of the Premier League season.
“He needs time, but his experience, his intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks – he thinks football,” Mourinho said.
“We’ll help him get ready sooner than later.”
In addition to Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also started at Aviva Stadium when Mourinho formed his start-XI for the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wanted three more new commitments, but he insisted that the club has already done a “fantastic job” of fulfilling three of his four priority new commitments.
"To get three out of four, I thank the club for that," he added.
"I'll be happier if they get four out of four for me, but they've done a lot of work."
Boeing ‘malt’ Dreamliner into the sky
U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the silhouette of a Dreamliner in the sky.
The pilots flew from Seattle in the U.S. state of Washington, but the drawing began in Marquette in the U.S. state of Michigan and moved in the form of a dreamliner across the U.S., which is several thousand kilometers.
The operation lasted 18 hours and one minute.
On the radar screens was the shape of a dreamliner.
It was an endurance test for new engines.
Boeing had previously made such advertisements.
So the number "787" and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky.
Martin Schulz – Hannover, we have a problem
As the wind turns: When Sigmar Gabriel was still the SPD leader, social-democratic prime ministers always looked at Berlin with some concern before elections.
Just no disturbance from the party headquarters, just no counterwind from the Bund – that was the most important wish of the electoral fighters.
Since Martin Schulz took over, this has fundamentally changed.
Since then, employees from the Willy Brandt House have been observing with growing horror the events in the SPD-ruled state capitals.
What Schulz has gotten from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described in the approach with counterwind.
It was deep strikes.
One after the other.
After the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony, the CDU sees a general signal against coalitions of SPD and Greens.
"This shows once again: Red-Green simply cannot govern reliably," CDU Secretary-General Peter Tauber told the editorial network Germany (RND).
The surprising departure of a Greens MP has plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a severe crisis.
Five months before the parliamentary elections, his red-green coalition lost its one-vote majority to the opposition from the CDU and FDP.
Greens chief executive Michael Kellner has called on the resigned Lower Saxony Greens member Elke Twesten to return her mandate.
The transition to the CDU means a clear falsification of the will of the voters.
Elke Twesten must return her mandate immediately,” said the federal chief executive and campaign leader of the Greens to the editorial network Germany (RND).
"This must not be true at all," a SPD voter whispered when the new message reached the party headquarters on Friday morning.
Stephan Weil, SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony, is there without a government majority after the transfer of the Green MP Elke Twesten to the CDU.
It is the preliminary culmination of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD national associations.
And no one knows what is next.
The misery began with the unexpectedly significant defeat in the Saarland elections in March.
A blue eye, nothing more, calmed the comrades at the time.
After the parliamentary elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia, everything will be different.
That was the case, and everything became much worse.
The defeat in Kiel caused the SPD to mourn, the Düsseldorf-Pleite left the party smooth.
Complicatedly, the comrades recalled in the weeks following.
Then, when they had just gained new courage, the G20 summit came from Hamburg.
And with him came the next blow.
Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD country leader, lost his nimbus that weekend because he was sitting in the Elbphilharmonie while his city was burning.
And because in crisis communication afterwards, he did pretty much everything wrong that can be done wrong.
Scholz has since fought for his political survival.
And then Stephan Weil.
Because of the VW exhaust affair and his role in the Supervisory Board, the Lower Saxony prime minister has long been criticized.
Survey values were added.
Nevertheless, or precisely because of this, Weil has been increasingly trying to put accents in the Bund in recent weeks.
The aspiration of the former mayor of Hannover to expand his power in Berlin did not hide from comrades in the environment of Martin Schulz.
They gave it because they promised to stabilize the party.
Now the exact opposite could happen.
Therefore, because of the party-internal dispute of the Lower Saxony Greens is basically not to blame.
But not even Schulz.
Sometimes the comrades therefore try to keep their own ranks closed.
Their anger is directed at the Greens, and here especially at the rejected parliamentarian Twesten.
“It is intolerable and democratically damaging how Mrs. Twesten puts her own career interests over the interests of everyone else,” says Matthias Miersch, head of the party links in the SPD Bundestag group, the Editorial Network Germany (RND).
Mrs. Twesten was elected to Parliament not because of her personality as a direct candidate, but through the country list of the Lower Saxony Greens, the Lower Saxony MP continued.
The logical consequence would be that she would return her mandate.
Thomas Oppermann, leader of the SPD Bundestag group, complained of an "undemocratic manoeuvre".
"The will of the voters four years ago was clear: the people made Stephan Weil prime minister," Oppermann, who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as the top candidate in the Bundestag election, told RND.
“Now, the personal career thinking of a future CDU MP distorts the election result,” Oppermann continued.
He called for clarification of the background.
I want to know if there have been more or there have been further commitments by the CDU of Lower Saxony.
Funding for Local Center III
Those who want to renovate their home in the years can soon get support from the country.
This was by Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of STEG Urban Development in Reception on Wednesday.
At the beginning of the information event, Schindler gave a look back on what has happened so far.
Since 1991 there have been recovery areas in Recepingen.
At that time, in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004, the state of Baden-Württemberg had taken over two-thirds of the funding amount.
In the rehabilitation area II from 2005 to 2016, the subsidy was still 60 percent.
For Schindler, the previous renovations are a "successful project" - after all, it is important to promote interior development as well, and not just to open up new construction areas.
On April 4, the Karlsruhe Government Bureau informed that there would be a rehabilitation area III.
The funding amounted to 833 333 euros, of which 500 000 euros came from the country, the rest from the municipality.
How is a rehabilitation area created?
One will, Schindler continued, investigate where the "real old" houses are.
However, it also plays a role whether there is any interest in repairing the planned area.
If necessary, the territorial boundaries could then be postponed again.
The STEG was represented on Wednesday evening by Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel.
Keller presented the contents of the federal-country program "Soziale Stadt", within which the renovations would then be carried out.
The core of the programme is the revitalization of inner cities, the improvement of living and working conditions and the maintenance and expansion of infrastructure.
The measures would be carried out on an object-related basis, that is, per property.
The sanitation area would then be defined as a statute.
The grant period for the funds runs from 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026.
Until September of this year, however, the inventory survey would be carried out, in the framework of which the parties involved in the sanitation area would receive a questionnaire to fill out.
The statutory decision should be made as soon as possible in November or December, so that repairs can begin next year.
Pietzschmann subsequently stated that each municipality must carry out the aforementioned preliminary investigations.
It’s about evaluating urban misconstruction and deciding when and to what extent it will be repaired.
A repair note will also be entered in the land book for the respective property.
Pietzschmann himself will come again after reception and make a picture of the situation, she promised.
Gotzel stressed that an essential success factor for the project is the participation of the stakeholders.
Therefore, there will be questionnaires that will be sent to the citizens by post in the coming weeks and can be completed until the end of the summer holidays.
The yellow questionnaire is the "building and land arch", which, among other things, deals with the construction condition and the renovation intentions.
In the grey questionnaire, the "housing and housing book", information can be made about the size, distribution and inhabitants of a living room.
The blue "operating arc" is only to be filled if business spaces are operated in the building.
However, it should be noted that Gotzel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time a request for funding.
Furthermore, new projects are not eligible.
Schindler also stressed that the distribution of funds works according to the "wind dog" principle - who comes first, grills first.
There is no way to “reserve” money for later.
Finally, photos of the project "Lotskern II" were shown in order to make a restoration "tasteful" to the attendees.
British inventor sets himself a microchip to get into home and car with one hand movement
A British inventor is the first in the country to be equipped with a microchip that allows him to open his door, enter his office, and even start his car with a hand-motion.
Steven Northam, 33, had implanted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers the service to and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company BioTeq.
He has partnered with Dr. Geoff Watson, a consulting anesthetist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure that the implant procedure is performed according to medical standards.
The technology is similar to a microchip implanted in cats and dogs and takes only 30 seconds.
Mr. Northam’s company also wants to change the locks on houses and cars to be compatible with the chip, all for an extra cost of £300 per lock.
The married father of one has now installed both at home and on his BMW Z4 technology, which starts when his hand is at the wheel.
White House advertising costs taxpayers thousands
The White House’s decision to fly a naval helicopter to South Lawn for an event highlighting U.S. manufacturing last month costs taxpayers up to $24,000, according to military data left to TIME magazine.
The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the President is on board, was the heart of the event on July 17 at the White House with American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials took a tour of products from all 50 states.
The Connecticut-made helicopter was exhibited alongside a Maine yacht, a Wisconsin fire car, and a Mississippi funnel.
The White House military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order, or FRAGO, just 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for operating the helicopter.
"I just wanted you to be aware of this because it's such an unusual event with high visibility," the commander of the HMX-1 wrote on the eve of the event to his superior, the Navy's deputy commander of aviation.
The news indicated that the helicopter arrived at the South Lawn for the event at 15 a.m. on July 17, and stayed there until the lawn was cleared between 18:00 and 21:00 that evening.
The note adds that if the departure from the White House was delayed, a second crew would be needed for the return flight due to the restriction of hours of service.
The original flight crew was with the helicopter during the event, while the unit’s security personnel remained on the ground with the aircraft during the time.
The records made available to TIME did not make it clear whether a second flight crew was ultimately needed.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
Records indicate that HMX-1 has asked if the event could violate the fate.
"One question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case," the commander wrote.
“It sounds like you’re locked up,” the deputy commander replied.
The "Made in America" event was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.
But even official events have political overtones.
At the event, the president gave a boost to the healthcare reform reform that was ongoing in the Senate, and he propagated efforts to curb government regulations.
The use of the aircraft, known as Marine One or Air Force One, for politically beneficial purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are obliged to use them for the trip.
But asking for their use only for a photo-OP is unusual.
Trump conducted an investigation in February when the presidential plane was providing taxi services against the backdrop of his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account is full of reports complaining about its predecessor’s use of the presidential plane.
“The White House is enthusiastic about the ‘Made in America’ show – showing products from all 50 states made by American workers with American materials,” said Lindsay Walters, the White House’s deputy press secretary.
HMX-1 crews frequently perform training flights in the area around Washington and South Lawn to take down the U.S. president at the White House with precise centimeters.
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 conducted 58 exercise landings at the White House.
The flight for the "Made in America" event included in the flight crew training needs for the month, a official said.
Helicopter units flew an additional 11 hours that day for “non-presidential support missions.”
The White House said taxpayers took on the burden for none of the other requests presented at the event.
A spokesman for Sikorsky said the company was not involved in displaying the helicopter on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not maintain budget records for the presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
However, according to the U.S. Department of Defense’s hourly rates for the 2017 fiscal year, the DoD reimbursement rate for the VH-3D is $24,380 per flight hour.
Unit records record the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico, Virginia.
The White House argues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is well below that rate.
"Setting the cost for taxpayers based on estimates for the refund rates is highly misleading," Walters said.
“These estimates include personnel, maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual funding.”
According to a 2015 RAND study, the reimbursement rates for DoD do not include personnel costs, but take into account costs for fuel, maintenance and contract conclusion.
At that time, former White House spokesman Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter for the event.
“The idea is to present things that are made in America this week,” Spicer said.
“And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud to contribute to our national security, and I assume that hundreds, if not even thousands of people depend on it.
And I think like most Americans, we are all proud of the helicopters and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly.
Of course, it is appropriate to emphasize this.”
It wasn’t clear whether Trump was interacting with the helicopter as he entered his tour over the South Lawn for the event, but he sat in the driver’s seat of a fire car.
In the White House, Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky and joked with the media about his own fleet of company products.
“I know Sikorsky very well,” said the president, “I have three of them.”
TC BW Neuss faces a tough task
The top rider of the Second Tennis Bundesliga plays in the table-third Suchsdorfer SV.
The TC Blau-Weiss Neuss will play tomorrow from 11 a.m. in Kiel in the table-third match for the Suchsdorfer SV.
Despite the still flawless balance after five games, the top rider of the Second Bundesliga has retained the sense of reality.
Team leader Marius Zay has respect for the opponent.
“This is a compact team that always plays in a similar formation.
Especially on the back positions, I find the team very good.”
The imports from the high north primarily ensure the class and stability of the search village SV.
“Their Danes and Finns can even refer to deals in the Davis Cup.
And they are also strong in the double," says Zay, looking at Harri Heliovaara (Finland), Andre Göransson (Sweden), Sören and Esben Olesen, Martin Pedersen and Andreas Bjerrehus (all Denmark).
“It will be difficult for us as always.
You need a good portion of luck.”
The new team for the trip to the high north is practical.
His debut for blue and white could give Maxime Janvier.
If the French player who is still active at the Challenger tournament in Biella, Italy, fails to play in the Bundesliga, Zdenek Kolar (Czech Republic), who plays at the tournament in Liberec, Czech Republic, will make his first bet this season.
The previously unbeaten Chilean Hans Podlipnik-Castillo was yesterday at the ball with the Belarusian Andrei Vasilevski at the ATP tournament in Kitzbühel.
He was supposed to be in Kiel as well as Botic Van de Zandschulp, Niels Lootsma (both Netherlands) and the Belgian Julien Cagnina.
After his two wins last Sunday against the club at the Alster, Máté Valkusz could also return to the team.
Not enough for the 18-year-old Hungarian, who in January 2016 was still number one in the world junior rankings, someone from the coach staff around Marius Zay fills up the squad.
How America can harm the OMV
Donald Trump did not seem really happy when he signed the law on tightening sanctions against Russia on Wednesday night.
"In his rush to pass the law," Congress packaged a few "unconstitutional regulations" into it, he said.
The reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected, and even Brussels foamed against the U.S. push.
After all, the draft envisages punishing European companies who help the Russians build gas pipelines to the EU.
Accordingly, concerns have since been investors of the domestic OMV, which together with other European companies co-financed the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea pipeline Nord Stream 2.
The threat is enormous.
However, it is too early to estimate the consequences, according to the official statement of the oil group.
In fact, Donald Trump himself would have to bring the sanctions to life by executive order.
There are 12 weapons to choose from.
"The press" has looked at which could repel the group and which could really hurt him.
Narcos Season 3 Trailer: Without Pablo Escobar, the Cali Cartel in the Netflix hit series will be put into the focus
Despite the second season of Narcos revealing Pablo Escobar’s killer, Netflix’s series is far from over.
The season three and four have already been confirmed by the streaming service, the first one received its first trailer and showed the latest villains of the show.
With the third season, the DEA has turned its attention to the world’s wealthiest drug trafficking organization: the Cali Cartel.
Led by four powerful paths, they operate "like a Fortune 500 company" only with more state bribery and violent actions.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is their head, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) commands the Mexican connection, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) is located in New York.
In the newly released trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, the guy who invites American and Colombian law enforcement to support the war on drugs.
Other new actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos will start on September 1.
Role backwards: The city will shut down 46 kitchen assistants
The city is organizing the lunch table itself.
With fixed contacts for the children and an assignment to the team.
In the city's children's daycare centers, the clock is turned back.
As of 1 September, the city of Krefeld will take over the food supply in the city’s children’s day facilities (Kitas).
For Sonja Pommeranz, Deputy Head of Youth Aid, this is good news: “We were all very happy.”
Cooking continues outside the house: a caterer takes over this task and delivers fresh cooked refrigerated food.
The city operates 46 day care centers in the Krefelder area, in 44 children receive a warm meal at lunchtime.
Last year there were 2,800 children sitting at the tables, and the need is growing steadily.
"In the meantime, not only children who are cared for for 45 hours a week are eating lunch in the Kita," Pommeranz explains.
"The offer also applies in the 35-hour care if children stay until 2 p.m."
46 part-time workers have kitchen service from September 1st: they heat the food supplied, supplement it with salad, raw food and fruit, portion the meal individually, give out the food, clean, rinse and clean the kitchen.
“The employees are firmly assigned to a Kita,” says Pommeranz.
The size - there are two-group as well as seven-group facilities - determines the amount of hours.
"The kitchen assistants are now part of the Kita team," says Pommeranz satisfied.
"So they are much more involved and it is easier for kit management to implement pedagogical concepts."
It is also about healthy eating and cooking lessons.
“Let the kids help prepare the food.”
The direct connection of the kitchen power to the team makes sense.
Also for the children.
"They have a well-known power in the gut, a person who is familiar to them, and not constantly changing people."
This continuity is important for children.
The cleaning of the kitchen rooms - so far also the task of the kitchen staff - will be done by special cleaning personnel in the future.
This variant – the separation of cleaning and kitchen service – has, in addition to improving the quality of the kitchen performance, also the charm that it has proved to be the most economical for the city in the cost comparison between own management and outsourcing.
And that even though 46 part-time workers will be recruited.
"But these hours do not take as much weight for around 750 people in the educational area," says Sonja Pommeranz.
Afghan democracy depends on women’s political role, says UN
Elections can only be representative if all members of society, including women, play a role, the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, current head of the United Nations mission, said hundreds of women will run for the council elections in the provinces. Three women are running for the role of vice president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
“The role of women cannot be overestimated,” he said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women are fully involved and involved in all aspects of the electoral process.
Afghan elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections will be held on April 5.
The Taliban has issued threats against an election process that coincides with the transition from international combat operations to a consultative role.
This year, for the first time, elections will pass power peacefully from one democratically elected government to the next.
Haysom said a strong role for women will further strengthen Afghanistan’s democratic success.
The Afghan Independent Electoral Commission reports that 1.2 million women are registered among the total of 3.6 million registered voters.

Man attempts to rob 13-year-old girl
Two young men aged 19 and 23 tried to rob a 13-year-old girl on Thursday.
According to police information, the men spoke to the 13-year-old, who was staying with friends on Kolpingstraße, around 14:55 a.m. because they wanted to use the girl’s mobile phone.
But the 13-year-old refused the request and went on with her friends.
Then one of the perpetrators tried to grab the girl’s cell phone and necklace, but failed.
Without the victim, the duo escaped.
The two men were later arrested by the police.
The investigations are ongoing.
GMB concerns about investment in McVitie factory in Glasgow
A trade union wants to assure managers of the biscuit manufacturer McVitie of the long-term commitment to production at their factory in Glasgow.
GMB Scotland said the company has been silent about the future of investment at Tollcross site.
More than 500 employees work in the factory, which, among other products, makes Hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies.
McVities owner Pladis said he has invested more than £5 million over the past few years.
He added that employees and trade union representatives would be “first to know” if their activities were to change.
In a letter to the company’s branch manager, GMB urged Scotland McVitie’s to “express concerns that funding for the modernization of production lines will not be advanced.”
GMB Senior Organizer Drew Duffy said: “The fact that we can’t get clarity from the general site manager about the business needs and investment plans for Tollcross’ future is deeply affecting our members.
Generations of families have worked here and the workforce is heavily focused on the local community and the large area of Glasgow, an important pillar for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social disadvantages.
Therefore, in the perspective of jobs, wages and prosperity, and in the context of Brexit, rising cost of living and chronic decline in production, the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a thriving production presence at McVitie.”
A spokeswoman for Pladis said: “Tollcross’s branch manager just received a letter from GMB Scotland yesterday, and the company will respond directly to it as we appreciate the continued engagement of employees and trade union representatives.
We had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross two months ago, where some issues were openly discussed.
We discussed with employees that, like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic environment, we are constantly reviewing our – and this applies to all our business branches and locations – in order to remain competitive.
She added: “Over the past few years, we have invested more than £5 million in our Tollcross site, in production lines and operational improvements.
We fully recognize the legacy of Tollcross as a production facility.If our operating processes at the site change, the employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to know about this."
Did Barcelona warn Neymar three years ago?
The La Liga side may regret their interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain won’t go down in her pursuit of Neymar after making an offer of £189 million to trigger his release clause, but did they warn Barcelona three years ago of the world record robbery?
The sensational approach has fueled the transfer window this summer as the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than twice the previous mark, with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United last season for £89 million.
After termination, Neymar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional athlete in the world. PSG offers salaries of more than £500,000 per week.
Barcelona is angry at the way Neymar has forced his way out, although a source close to the Catalan board insists that the club has always done its best to take care of him since he arrived from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned three years ago by the PSG president about this prospect?
When Manchester City expressed interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strict warning to any club that wanted one of PSG’s best players to sign.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we'll stand in opposition to them, we'll contact their players," Al-Khelaifi said.
“We respect all clubs.
But if they try to get one of our players to sign with them, it will have consequences.”
Barcelona seems to have crossed that line, with the Spanish club expressing interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the international from Italy to leave under any circumstances, and Barcelona could feel the consequences of that interest by losing one of their prize offers for Neymar.
Roller overturned and damaged
In the night of Friday to Saturday, an unknown perpetrator deliberately overturned a roller stationed in the Königsfelder Straße in front of property number 30 and thus inflicted material damage of more than 200 euros on the covering of the vehicle.
The police of Schramberg, phone 07422/ 27 01-0, asks for information.
For an accident on the B 215 between Stolzenau and Leese, the police are looking for witnesses.
Because a car met him on his track, the driver of a VW Touran had to evade and touched the dashboard.
On Thursday evening, the 34-year-old from Rehburg-Loccum was on the way to Leese with his VW arriving on the B 215 from Stolzenau around 19.55.
In the area of the surrounding area of Stolzenau, a car met him on his track, so he had to evade to the right.
The Touran driver touched the dashboard.
There was material damage to the car.
The driver of the encountered car, a Mercedes Benz, had overtaken a truck and continued his ride without worrying about the traffic accident.
According to the accident victim, it may be good that the Mercedes driver did not notice the accident.
The police are now asking witnesses to the incident and the driver of the polluting vehicle to contact the commissariat in Stolzenau by telephone 05761 / 92060.
Interview: "Domspatzen report relieves pope-brother Georg Ratzinger"
The Regensburg Domspatzen report on the abuse cases relieves Pope-Brother Georg Ratzinger.
This is stated by the author and historian Michael Hesemann.
The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen continues to cause discussion.
Christian Weisnder, spokesman for the reform movement "We are the Church", said after the publication to the German press agency that he expects an apology from the former Bishop of Regensburg and present-day Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from the cathedral master Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the emeritus Pope Benedict XVI.
It would be of great service to the reputation of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger expressed their deep regret for their own omissions or their wrong assessment of the events at the time.
The Vatican newspaper Osservatore Romano, on the other hand, criticized the use of "two measures" in reporting violence among the catholics.
Regarding the attacks in Regensburg, no one doubts that they are "shameful and shameful acts" that need to be punished and prevented in the future; but the "degree of media manipulation" is striking, says author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the Italian National Bioethics Committee.
“The habit of referring to the Catholic Church as the source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares the public opinion to consider it normal,” Scaraffia writes.
Also Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis said in an interview with the Bavarian broadcaster: "You like to go to church and that is a found meal."
In addition, she pointed out that in her youth, “strikes were a normal educational means” to “to deal with frightening children like I was one.”
It would be unfair to apply today’s standards to previous decades, because the world has changed.
In connection with the reports of the abuse cases, the pope-brother Georg Ratzinger also appeared frequently.
Completely wrong, writer and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote with Ratzinger the memoir "My Brother the Pope" (translated into 12 languages).
"I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protection," says Hesemann, "because all this had nothing to do with him," he evaluates the results of the final report.
What exactly is stated in the 440-page report presented by Ulrich Weber, a lawyer commissioned by the Bishop of Regensburg for the enlightenment?
A total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were sexually abused between 1945 and the early 1990s with "high plausibility" victims of assaults.
Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994, said in the final report: "In summary, it can be concluded that Domkapellmeister R. in many cases used forms of physical and psychological violence.
Especially with high emotionality, the punishment for the students could also be harsher.
Nevertheless, unlike many other accused, it is evident that many victims appreciated R.’s general humanity and therefore, in many cases, despite violence, even associate positive memories with him.”
In the interview, Hesemann explains why, in his opinion, the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen relieves Georg Ratzinger.
Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "incidents of violence against protection officers at the Regensburger Domspatzen" gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.
On the one hand, many students highlight their “humanity.”
On the other hand, he also appears as a cholerist and perfectionist, who often became hands-on when a cathedral was not musically top performance.
How do you view this final biography?
Michael Hesemann: If you make the effort and read the entire 440-page report from front to back, you must rather wonder why the name Georg Ratzinger appears in it.
Only eight pages are dedicated to him and he is clearly released from any suspicion of complicity or co-consciousness in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.
The violence in the preschool also occurred outside its sphere of influence.
In any case, you can accuse him of learning too late or of not taking the first hints seriously enough.
The Domspatz Gymnasium, where he worked, was perceived by virtually all respondents as - so literally - "salvation", "heaven" and "better world".
Thus, the vast majority of his students, Georg Ratzinger, give a very excellent testimony, describing him as “warmhearted”, “popular”, “honest”, “competent” and “comprehensible”, as an extremely kind teacher, who regularly supplied the boys with cakes, cookies and candy and was “always packed with children’s grapes.”
Only a minority complain about his perfectionism and high emotionality, which has already led to outbreaks of anger.
That he not only knocked with chairs and threw the keyband on the floor, but also distributed earrings and pulled too ugly guys to the hair or ears, he himself has already admitted years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for it.
To his honor, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the time in question, in the 1960s and 1970s, both among parents and teachers.
Do you know about such punishment methods?
Of course, I think of every one of us who was born before 1968.
I also experienced this at a secular school, a state high school.
Compared to what is actually being discussed in this report, namely the horrible sexual abuse and the excesses of violence in preschool, these are obviously minorities.
The question is whether it is not more related to his fame and his role as the brother of Benedict XVI that many media outlets have just rushed to him.
Many of the Bavarian popes, who never understood him, are still working hard on him.
But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every way!
In the media, a lot was in connection with the report on the topic of abuse in the Regensburger Domspatzen.
Is Georg Ratzinger also accused of any involvement or complicity in sexual abuse in the final report?
Michael Hesemann: Clearly not.
None of the 67 victims of sexual assault claimed to have entrusted themselves to the cathedral master.
Not even the parents were invited.
"I never dared to talk to my father or my mother about it," one affected person told the other, "I was very embarrassed."
The real problem with educating about sexual abuse was, and is, that most victims remain silent out of shame.
If they did not even trust their parents and siblings, then not a choir leader, who would have been professionally a colleague of the perpetrators.
How do the Domspatzen students assess Ratzinger’s role in the case of abuse?
Michael Hesemann: A student interviewed stated: “In terms of sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) would have had timely findings and could have stopped the perpetrator.
I find it ... also really absurd to assume that just him ... boys have opened up more intrusively or clearly than to their parents, internat leaders, trust teachers, etc.
Talking to him about sex is unthinkable.”
Thus, the report comes to the very clear conclusion: "The fact that the students concerned in advance and/or their surroundings were entrusted to him could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation."
As far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is therefore to be released from any co-consciousness.
Nor can he be accused of not preventing him or bringing him to notice.
Therefore, there is also no reason to associate his good name with these disgusting crimes, as unfortunately happened in some cases.
In the media, a lot of "violent excesses" were read at the Regensburger Domspatzen.
Former cathedral master Georg Ratzinger is accused in the report "Wegschauen".
Should he live with this accusation?
Michael Hesemann: This is the big problem, that in the reporting everything was mixed and mixed into a huge mixture of sexual abuse and violent excesses and somewhere, in the middle, Georg Ratzinger.
However, this is an abuse of the report.
There is a clear separation: between preschool and high school, between sexual abuse and excesses of violence, and, let’s say, other accusations.
In addition, the report deals with incidents from the time since 1945, i.e. also from four decades when Georg Ratzinger was not the choir leader of the Domspatzen.
All the terrible punishment pedagogy, the cases in which boys were really harassed and abused by sadistic teachers and suffered terribly, all occurred in the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions must have prevailed.
But with them the cathedral master Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he only got the boys to face when they were already at the cathedral gymnasium.
On it, as the vast majority of witnesses emphasize, the topic of "pre-school" was taboo.
One was just lucky to have escaped her and the so much better treatment and for many even "paradise" states.
What was different at the High School?
Michael Hesemann: There was discipline, but not sadistic violence.
And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, where the report concludes that "many victims appreciated R.'s general humanity and therefore in numerous cases, despite violence, even associate positive memories with him."
At the very least, the accusation remains to have looked away.
However, despite all efforts, the report was able to define only two periods during which it was about the conditions in preschool.
The first time in 1970/71, when he had just begun to establish himself, and about the events at a school where he just did not act and was responsible, (so the witness) did not want to hear anything, and then again around 1993.
Did Georg Ratzinger consistently close his ears before the circumstances?
Michael Hesemann: No, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium, which the report even reproduces.
In it, he points out that "the punishment for punishment is still practiced in preschool."
Even given the danger of negative press releases, he urged urgent intervention.
This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed, when punishment for punishment was already banned in Bavaria.
Before, they happened in a legal gray zone, as we all know.
It was also difficult for him to estimate where the affected may have exaggerated or dramatized and where the permissible limit had really been exceeded.
You can’t say that he has always looked away.
That is simply not true.
It was only in 1980 that the punishment for bullying in schools was officially abolished in Bavaria.
Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis argued that it was unfair to apply the pedagogical standards of today to the time.
How do you see it?
Michael Hesemann: We historians are talking about the “fall of anachronism,” that is, the danger of judging the past according to today’s moral standards.
The princess is right.
But, of course, this does not apply to sexual abuse, which was disgusting at all times, nor to what was broken in preschool with disgust and violence against innocent children’s souls, which goes far beyond the usual at the time.
This is all terrible and I am glad that it is finally being worked out.
But at the same time I have to protect Georg Ratzinger, because all this had nothing to do with him.
His means of discipline and punishment, i.e. pulling ears and hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.
When physical punishment was then prohibited, he also strictly adhered to it.
What image of his time in Regensburg did Georg Ratzinger reflect in the conversations with you for the book "My Brother the Pope"?
Was the issue of punishment also discussed?
Michael Hesemann: Well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, that is, Pope Benedict XVI, told from his perspective, the cathedrals played only a secondary role.
Nevertheless, I did not hide that he was leading a strict regiment there.
But this too must be said: Without this perfectionism, without the requirement of unconditional discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form a world-class institution from the until then more nationally known Regensburg cathedrals, true cultural ambassadors of Europe and its musical tradition, who went on tour in the United States twice (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).
With cookies and candy alone, you do not make rebellious boys great singers and before every success, no matter in what field, but always discipline, passion and self-conquerance.
What kind of person did you experience Georg Ratzinger in the conversations about your book?
Michael Hesemann: Through the work on the book and beyond, I really met Georg Ratzinger very well and repeatedly experienced him as a wonderful, humorous, basic, deeply believing and good-hearted person, of whom one cannot imagine that he could hurt even a fly.
I regularly get to know how many ex-dom spats still today, 23 years after his retirement, keep regular contact with him, visit him, read to him – he is almost blind – and treat him like a member of their family.
Those who did not forgive him to this day that he was once strict with them are therefore clearly in the minority.
Most cathedrals today are grateful to him for enriching their lives and bringing them closer to the world of music.
And that he was always a good, paternal teacher – a strict father, of course, that may be – but yet he was also a lovable respectful person, to whom they still look up today and whom they just adore.
And please, again very clearly: all that is blamed on him are educational methods that were on the agenda at the time.
We can be happy that we have overcome this time long ago.
But it is highly unfair to make a man, just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother, a medial sin-bock.
The evil intention behind it is just too obvious.
Because the report that has just been published relieves him.
Now the decency would rule to finally leave a 93-year-old man who has earned great merits and without those outside Bavaria and even Germany nobody would know the Regensburger Domspatzen in peace.
