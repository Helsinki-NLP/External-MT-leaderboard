28-year-old chef found dead in a San Francisco mall.
The 28-year-old chef, who recently moved to San Francisco, was found dead in a stairwell at a local mall earlier this week.
But the victim's brother said that he did not think that he could be someone who would want to harm her, adding: "In the end, things were going well for her".
The San Francisco Coroner's Office has confirmed that the body found Wednesday morning in the Westfield Mall is that of Frank Galicia, a 28-year-old San Franciscan.
The San Francisco Police Department has determined that the cause of death is murder and the investigation is ongoing.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told ABC station KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who had previously worked as a chef in Boston, had found his dream job six months ago as chef of the San Francisco Sons & Daughters.
A Sons & Daughters official said they were "confused and deeply saddened" by the death.
"We are a small team here working as a tight-knit family, and he will be greatly missed", the spokesman explained.
We would like to assure Frank's family that they are not alone in this difficult time and our prayers are with them.
Louis Galicia noted that Frank initially stayed in hostels and said, "In the end, things were going well for him".
"He rented an apartment and was dating a girl", Louis Galicia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said he didn't think you were someone who would want to harm his little brother.
He was a kind man with a big heart.
The way to connect with the family was to make us a plate for all the time, to cook for us", said Louis Galicia.
He didn't like to get into fights.
My brother, he was adaptable.
He said, "It was this uncut diamond that shone brightly every day when everything else in the world was going wrong".

Assistant doctors on strike: New work calls for slowdown
The representatives of the assistant doctors have asked their union to allow them to slow down the work in the dispute over a new contract.
The General Council of the British Medical Association (BMA) Joint Committee of Doctors (JDC) has called for more slowdown action to be supported from early September.
The JDC said that the ministers had not been able to resolve their concerns about the contract.
The assistant doctors and medical students voted no on the contract agreement with the BMA.
This was rejected by 58% of the voting members.
In a tweet Thursday night, JDC chair Ellen McCourt said the government had been "insistently silent" about the issues that led to the contract's rejection.
He said: "In light of this, the JDC Board of Directors voted to reject the proposed new contract in its entirety and called for the formal negotiations to resume on the concerns".
In response to the government's silence, the JDC management made a formal request to the BMA Board to authorize a program to increase the business slowdown from the beginning of September.
The dispute has led to the involvement of paramedics in six strikes this year, including the first total amputation in the history of the NHS.
Dr. Johann Malawana, the assistant chief physician at the BMA, resigned after being denied the contract terms proposed by the BMA.
During the meetings before the vote of 54,000 assistant doctors and medical students, the members of the BMA were told that this was a good deal that should be accepted.
Following the vote, Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said the contract would be implemented in a way that would apply to doctors in the UK.
Russia and Turkey: An 'alliance of the incompatible'?
It was a gesture to end the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and announce the official end of an eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
But as Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish counterpart in the splendid hall of the St. Petersburg Palace, I had the clear impression that Ankara was the party most in favor of this compromise.
The hand is shaken, yes.
But Mr. Putin's smile was rather feeble, and by his own limited standards, it did not seem to be radiating any warmth.
On the contrary, Recep Tayyip Erdogan has repeatedly referred to Mr. Putin as his "good friend"; according to one report, five times.
I was surprised by the number.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to the pre-crisis level, but would reach much higher levels.
The next day, a local newspaper stated that Mr. Erdoğan was acting as if nothing bad had happened.
I think his excitement was the opposite.
But Mr. Putin's cold-blooded approach has shown that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the first thing he mentioned in his opening statement was the cause of the crisis: Turkey shooting down a Russian warplane on the Syrian border.
Russia's reaction at the time was furious.
Mr. Putin, in a harsh outburst, accused Ankara of stabbing Moscow in the back.
The animosity was so much greater, the other side was supposed to be friendly.
Trust will be difficult, if not impossible, to rebuild in the true sense.
Since November, the Russian public opinion has changed.
The state-controlled media has been targeting Ankara with a shaky and aggressive manner for months.
Suddenly, the Turks are to blame for everything.
The most serious of these were allegations that senior officials had alleged that Mr. Erdogan's family was profiting from the illegal oil trade in areas of Syria allegedly controlled by the Islamic State.
He himself has firmly refused.
But the official message from St. Petersburg was that it was time to move on.
After all, the reason this meeting took place was because Mr. Putin had received the apology that he demanded from President Erdogan.
Russia may see this as a victory of sorts.
The benefits of a ceasefire for Ankara are clear.
First, Erdoğan needs friends after the failed coup that nearly toppled him last month.
The repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey also affected him a lot.
And economic reasons are also at play.
Russia's sanctions have been severe, particularly the ban on special flights that carry several million Russian tourists to Turkey's coastal areas each year.
That number has dropped by almost 90 percent.
In Russia, tour operators and charter companies were certainly relieved that flights would continue.
They're relying on the Mediterranean for their end-of-season activity.
And this week, state television predicted a drop in the price of fruits and vegetables as Turkish agricultural imports were allowed to resume.
To quote a story in the newspaper Vedemosti, "Tourists there, tomatoes here".
But the visit had a separate political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West for not finding the response to the coup attempt adequate.
Adding to his long-standing anger at the snail-like pace of the talks to join the U.S., Mr. Putin, who wants to take advantage of Turkey's disconnection from the West and the coolness in between, is stepping in.
The Russian leader certainly seems to have gained sympathy from Ankara due to his call for support for elected officials after the coup attempt.
It should be remembered that this was an inevitable attitude for Moscow, which itself had a deep-seated fear of regime change.
Held in this palatial palace on the seafront, this summit represents what one analyst described to me as a "alliance of the misfits" of Russia and Turkey: the joining of the two countries that the West has rejected and abused.
Yet despite this appearance of harmony, they are quite different.
One of the most important of these is about Syria: Moscow is presenting itself as a mediator, but Russia and Turkey are supporting different sides.
This is supported by the fact that after almost three hours of initial talks, the two presidents said that the issue was not discussed at the press conference.
While the President of Turkey avoided answering any questions about these differences, Mr. Putin chose to underline them.
There is no clear consensus on how to define common ground in Syria.
But after months of open hostility - and given the potential for absolute disaster that comes with NATO member Turkey shooting down a Russian warplane - it's certainly a good thing that the two leaders are at least starting to talk.
The Royal Bank of Scotland disappears for customers outside Scotland.
According to the CEO's statement, the RBS brand will move to the back office position.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be gone for customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank's global goals.
Eight years ago, he was almost sunk, so he had to back off and give up.
In the meantime, brand strategists have used RBS to protect other consumer finance brands.
This has been supported by millions of pounds for many sponsorships, from the Six Nations Rugby Championship to the Andy Murray Championship at Wimbledon.
But now, it was decided that it would be right for more national brands to come forward.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used by Scottish customers, but no new start-ups will be made.
All references to RBS in England and Wales will be converted to NatWest, except for references to the headquarters and stock exchange.
The Ulster Bank brand is currently used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are also smaller brands that will take on a much more dominant role for individual banking; Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
Mr McEwan was interviewed on a tour of Inverness-shire for customers and staff.
He told BBC Scotland: "As we will now be a bank with more than one brand, the RBS brand will no longer be our investment brand and the brand that our staff are employed by".
As the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I'm saying we're not global anymore, we're local.
Each of these brands will stand out a little bit differently in the community in which they're located, and our staff will work with clients under these brands.
RBS announced that it would no longer sponsor the Six Nations Championship and was raising the profile of its brands in sports sponsorship.
The CEO said, "Now it's time to move to the concept of brand banking, because (we were asking ourselves) how can we make it a better bank for customers?"
Three years ago, I would have thought it was ironic if we said we were going to be a great bank for our customers and offer these brands.
But with the work we've done and the focus on the needs of the customers, not ourselves, I think you're going to see a lot of change.
We can get these brands back online, so I think this is the right time.
Frankie Dettori has won the 3000th time with his victory at Newmarket with Predilection.
Dettori, after his double-trial victory at Newmarket, has popped champagne.
Jockey Frankie Dettori won his 3000th victory in England at Newmarket on Friday.
At the local circuit, he achieved this milestone with the Predilection, trained by John Gosden, taking his second victory of the night.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach this milestone in the unhampered race.
He is following in the footsteps of Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
"This is a special occasion", said the three-time champion jockey, who also won at Ghayyar.
I 'm so touched that my family is here .
I'm really happy that this is in Newmarket, where I started 30 years ago.
This is not a big meeting, not a Royal Ascot -- just a regular Friday night with 20,000 people.
I feel relieved and relaxed.
Dettori accepted the cheers by bringing Predilection after the victory.
Two jockeys have reached this milestone in the obstacle course: champion jockey Richard Johnson and retired jockey Sir Anthony McCoy, who won the championship 20 times and has over 4,300 victories in a record-setting career.
Lester Piggott, who won the Derby nine times, has 4493 career victories.
Frankie is one of the greatest jockeys of our time, and it's no wonder he's reached a milestone that only a few have reached before him.
A man of style and strength, but with a tactical mind that has the element of being heavier on the scales than the others.
He's a great representative of horse racing, and his excitement and charisma has drawn people to the sport for years.
A few weeks ago, I told Frankie at Epsom that if he hadn't had a jockey who only competes on the weekends and the big races, he would have had 6,000 victories.
Seriously, Frankie has spent the better part of 30 years racing in the UK winning, which is great to see.
He's got a very exciting character, which is a very good thing for British racing, but he's also a remarkable jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated this milestone with a landing gesture that became an iconic jump.
From the many moves he performed in the jumps, from the jumps on the horse to the landings, Frankie Dettori has been the symbol of British freestyle running for two decades.
It was a bumpy ride.
In 1996, despite winning many major races, including the famous 'Big Seven' at Ascot, he survived a plane crash and was banned for failing to comply with a drug ban.
Three years ago, during his return from this six-month suspension, he showed that, despite the initial difficulties, he had the strength of character needed to prove his suspects wrong and return to his best.
And it may go on for a while; Dettori had previously expressed a desire to continue competing until at least age 50.
Russian President Putin has removed his private secretary Sergei Ivanov from office.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly dismissed his personal secretary Sergei Ivanov.
Mr. Ivanov was part of Mr. Putin's trusted inner circle for many years.
The 63-year-old has now been appointed as special representative for environmental and transportation issues.
A statement from the Kremlin said Mr. Putin had "decided to terminate Ivanov's mandate as head of the Russian government", but gave no reason.
Anton Vaino, who has been acting as Mr Ivanov's representative since 2012, has been appointed to this position.
Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in 1972 in Tallinn, the capital of Estonia, she graduated from the International Relations department of the renowned Moscow State Institute (MGIMO) and served at the embassy in Tokyo.
Later, he was in charge of presidential protocol and administration of government personnel, according to the Kremlin website.
After his appointment, he told Mr. Putin, "Thank you for trusting me".
I believe the most important function of the administration is to support your activities as head of state in terms of promulgating laws and supervising the implementation of instructions.
Mr. Putin told a Russian television channel on Friday that he wanted Mr. Ivanov to step down and suggested Mr. Vaino to take his place.
Are the smiles convincing?
This is a move that has Moscow stunned.
Sergei Ivanov had long served as one of Vladimir Putin's closest allies, and like him, the Soviet security forces had served the KGB.
He was one of the most powerful men in the country, in private.
In a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast on state television, both said the private prosecutor had resigned of his own accord.
But despite the smiling poses for the cameras, few people here are convinced of this, especially as the parliamentary elections are approaching.
So, is this some sort of power struggle?
No one knows that yet.
But the official explanation that a potential president suddenly wanted to steer Russia's environmental policy was met with great suspicion.
According to the Kremlin website, Mr. Ivanov said to Mr. Putin: "In a conversation in early 2012, I asked you to trust me for four years in this difficult - even problematic - task.
Well, apparently I served as the president's personal secretary for four years, eight months.
Mr. Ivanov took over in December 2011.
He previously served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He's a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Mr. Putin, a former member of the KGB state security forces.
In the late 1990s, Mr. Putin was the head of the Federal Security Forces (FSB), which replaced the KGB, and Mr. Ivanov replaced him.
When Mr. Putin came to power, he listed Ivanov as one of his five most trusted people.
It was thought that Mr. Ivanov could become president after Mr. Putin's second term, since it was unconstitutional for Mr. Putin to run for a third term.
But that task was handed to another close ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Mr. Putin was prime minister before returning to the presidency three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds star Thomas Gibson was fired after shooting the producer.
Gibson was involved in a physical altercation on the set of the show in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, who produced the series, announced in a joint statement that he was fired.
Gibson, who plays Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, issued an apology on Tuesday, prior to the announcement of his termination.
There were differences and disagreements about creative issues in the set.
In a statement, he said, "I regret that such an event has occurred".
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios said in a statement that details of how Gibson's character would be removed from the show, which follows a group of FBI agents, would be released at a later date.
The 54-year-old, who previously appeared on the situation comedy Dharma & Greg, had been a regular on the show since its first season in 2005.
Gibson said in a statement released Friday, "I love Criminal Minds and have worked my heart and soul into it for the past 12 years".
I'd like to stay until the end, but that's not possible anymore.
I just want to thank the writers, the producers, the cast, our amazing crew, and most importantly, the best supporters a show can have.
The show is expected to return for its twelfth season on September 28.
The mystery of the fish in Banff Gardens
A resident of the Banff area has requested help identifying fish that have appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks that these 75 fish might be sandfishes that were transported by a sea hose.
Bain, who lives 500 meters from the sea, has uploaded the footage to Periscope in the hope that someone will shine a light on the emergence of the two-inch fish.
Queensferry Bridge: The bridge is now connected to Fife
The £1.35 billion project is due to be completed by May 2017.
Engineers have linked the north and the viaduct of the Queensferry Bridge, meaning the bridge is now linked to Fife.
This is the first of four closures between the "tablet fans" that are about to be completed around each of the three towers of the bridge.
The section of the bridge from Fife is 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tonnes.
It consists of 46 support cables with 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete.
The £1.35 billion project is due to be completed by May 2017.
Economy Minister Keith Brown was one of the first to walk from the land to the bridge today, visiting the facilities.
He said: "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Crossing.
We're all witnessing a truly epic scale of engineering with this project, which used over 30,000 tons of concrete to build just this part of the bridge.
Despite the extraordinary size and weight of the bridge, which closes the gap between the viaduct and the bridge plate, this is a delicate work requiring extremely delicate tolerances for fit.
Overall, with nearly 79% of the total bridge slab installed, the first section of the slab will be poured into Rosyth today, meaning the entire slab will be ready to be lifted onto the bridge.
Michael Martin, project director for Forth Gate and Bridge Contractors, said: "In all bridge projects, the first closure is always an important milestone.
In this extraordinary project, this closure represents a pioneering feat in civil engineering.
After the last road sign was put in place and connected to the North Tower level, which was expanding, we had to close the gap on the northern - or land - side.
This was accomplished by the northern viaduct being pulled south by 700 millimetres.
It was a very big, but also very delicate operation.
The reason for its size is that the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs almost 6000 tons, and has to be pulled at a gradient of about 3%.
The reason it was sensitive was that the tolerance values the team had to meet were very low, only a few millimeters on either side.
Thankfully, everything went well.
Moelfre Bay rescue team: Three men 'lucky to be alive'
Three men are "lucky to be alive" after falling off their fishing boat in Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI lifeboat station was alerted at 13:20 British Summer Time on Friday after the police saw the incident in Moelfre Bay.
The three men were trying to swim to safety as the boats continued to drift on their own.
Moelfre, the lifeguard boat inspector, said, "We saw the boat circling them and we were worried".
"Fortunately, it was kept away by the strong winds until we could see it".
Two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat, while the third, a 60-year-old man, was found exhausted and falling, clinging to a gurney without a life vest.
All were taken to the lifeboat that was headed for the shore and brought to the station
Mr. Jones said, "The three men who fell in the water were lucky to be alive and unharmed.
There was an emergency stop cable in the boat's engine, but it must have been cut off from the person who was operating the boat when it capsized.
Someone was watching these three men today.
A precious hunt for health and happiness, Pokémon Go
It's really amazing to see how the world has changed.
The fact that young people and children are no longer going out to play, preferring to spend their leisure time staring at screens, has been a matter of regret for many people over the past decade.
Pokemon Go encourages people to get off the couch and move.
The time spent looking at screens has spread from being limited to television to video games and finally to smartphones.
So it's really great to see that technology and outdoor movement are not mutually exclusive.
And of course, I'm talking about Pokémon Go, which is a character-based application that was originally created in the '90s for a video game (and then turned into a series, a deck of playing cards, and other side products).
Like so many other phenomena of popular culture, this new game was all over the map when it was released in the US, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
Later, the launch was delayed in other countries due to the intense interest that caused overloading on the servers.
Within days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
So how does it work?
In short, players can take their smartphones, go out in a GPS-tracked manner to look for Pokémon and can 'take a photo' (by taking screenshots on their phone) or 'catch' them.
A generation of younger players have joined this madness by getting off the couch to explore.
In the United States, play has led to a dramatic increase in the number of steps an average person takes each day.
Cardiogram, an app developed for Apple Watch that tracks 35,000 users, recently told the Washington Post that the percentage of people it tracked who exercised every day for 30 days rose from 45 percent to 53 percent in the first two days after the game was released.
The company doesn't know who's playing Pokémon Go; it can only see the raw data at the exercise level.
Most public health campaigns that encourage people to "take 30 minutes", "get off the couch", and "be active every day" have been ignored because most public health messages are boring and are delivered by people who seem desperate.
But the importance of exercise is understated.
People who exercise regularly are less likely to get cancer or to have depression.
Exercise, weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes, and so on, and it has a long list of benefits that I can't list here.
But the beauty of Pokémon Go is that it takes people out to do something that they enjoy.
This meets all three basic elements of health: movement, fresh air, and sunlight and entertainment.
Some people may even make new friends during the hunt.
As always, there are the cheeky game-changers looking for something to complain about.
And, of course, someone could walk in and slam the door.
What difference does it make?
A major innovation has been introduced.
Smartphone apps like Fitbit track our movement, but they don't give us a reason to exercise like this game.
The innovation will wear off and the use will diminish over time.
But because of the success of Pokémon, there will be many games that help people who go hunting to be more active, fit and healthy by combining apps and virtual reality with real-world activities.

Simone Biles won the gold medal in the women's gymnastics all-around.
Forget the press.
Forget the excitement.
Simone Biles is immune to all of this.
Dynamic with the jump.
It's comfortable on the balance machine.
It's amazing on the ground.
Perfection at the top.
And he's an Olympic champion now.
The 19-year-old American gymnast made the difference between herself and the rest of the world clear at the Olympics by finishing first in the overall classification on Thursday.
Her total of 62,198 points was well above silver medalist and fellow "Last Five" team-mate Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.
Simone Biles of the United States on Thursday performed on the balance beam in the women's artistic gymnastics all-around final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Biles became the fourth American woman in a row and the fifth overall to receive the overall evaluation award, and established her reputation as one of the best of her generation and perhaps of all time.
When the last collection was published, she was in tears, and her long journey to reach this moment was over.
This achievement puts him on a par with athletes like Michael Phelps, who can only be seen once in a generation, who have taken the sport to new heights:
Biles spent the last three years as one of the most successful in the sport, with a blend of ambition and precision that has led to 15 world championship medals, including 10 golds, and the 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton calling him "the best gymnast I have ever seen".
A final test awaited him in Brazil, a contest between Biles and himself, and the burden of high expectations, rather than between him and the other people in the field.
It would be seen as a disappointment to return to the family home in Spring, Texas, with less than a handful of gold medals.
Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman of the United States, after taking gold and silver medals respectively in the women's artistic gymnastics all-around at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday, August 8.
Biles won the first on Tuesday, when she served as a tribute to retired national team coordinator Martha Karolyi at her farewell party.
Biles insists that in his long run to the summit, he never looked ahead, but that's not entirely true.
The floor exercise routine, including the iconic fold-out passage, is set to Latin music that will perfectly match the street outside the Rio Olympic Arena.
This is no coincidence.
Adopted as a young child by her grandmother and grandfather, and discovered by Boorman's mother on a trip to a gymnasium where Aimee Boorman coached, she became a force to be reckoned with.
He hasn't lost a game in the overall standings since the summer of 2013, a winning streak that should continue for as long as Biles wants.
Mustafina took the lead in two rounds, but it was temporary.
The balance and floor exercises that Biles had won the world championship with hadn't been done yet.
He's leading the way with 15,433 on the balance beam, and he's topping it with 15,933 on the floor exercise.
Raisman gently embraced him as he waited for the final score, and tears welled up around the glowing red, white and blue eye makeup as the vision Biles once wrote in a scrapbook came true.
Raisman's performance was a rematch of a performance four years earlier, where he shared fourth but then lost the bronze medal to Mustafina.
This time, the 22-year-old team captain, whom the Americans call "the nine", was ahead.
At times, he's overcome with a seemingly suspicious comeback, where he's kissed the crowd after a practice.
For 19-year-old Biles, the much-shared tweet he made earlier this week has taken on a whole new meaning:
Police: 3 victims in serial killer case shot while listening to music in car
In Phoenix's first serial killer case in a decade, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot while talking in a car and listening to music, according to police reports released Thursday.
Authorities say Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter, Maleah, were shot in a parked car on a garage door on June 12.
The report states that the gunman fired eight shots from a handgun while standing on the passenger side of the car and then drove away in another vehicle.
Police say these three murders don't appear to be robberies because the assailant didn't take the adult victims' handbags or $2,900 in cash.
Phoenix police spokesman Deputy Commissioner Jonathan Howard said the shooting prompted investigators to look into whether it was connected to four previous attacks.
In a four-month period, seven people were killed and two were injured in nine attacks in predominantly Hispanic neighborhoods.
Howard told CBS affiliate KPHO earlier this month, "It happened in a residential area in front of a house".
Suspect is believed to have driven several vehicles, including a late 1990s brown Nissan, a late 1990s black BMW, and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators declined to discuss the evidence that led them to conclude that the attacks were linked to the same killer and carried out by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was taken to hospital with injuries and later died.
Liner and Ellis' daughter, Maleah, 31, was killed at the scene.
A witness told police it was not unusual for these people to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
Authorities also released a police report of a shooting incident that targeted an empty truck half an hour before the three murders.
Investigators found shells, removed a bullet from a seat, and found bullet particles in the engine compartment.
Mother of 6-year-old with microcephaly: "He is getting better"
Like most six-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto loves singing, his toys and, of course, his mother.
But unlike his peers, Edmund has a condition called microcephaly, a genetic disorder that his mother, Elizabeth Picciuto, was unaware of during her pregnancy.
When I first came home, my first thought was I couldn't do this.
I can't do that. I can't.
I didn't ask for this.
"That's not true, of course, and of course you want it".
He and his wife Vincent were told that Edmund might never know them and might not even survive.
Some doctors went so far as to suggest that she be put in a nursing home.
"My first reaction was to say that I didn't think people did that anymore", Picciuto explained.
Edmund, he can walk with a walker.
Edmund couldn't stand or sit or squat until he was three years old, and he still can't speak.
But he's slowly reaching some turning points.
He can walk and ride a bike with help.
Also, she likes to play games and sing with her two brothers.
Elizabeth is showing the sign language that Edmund made up to say, "Please sing to me".
Picciuto told CBS News, "We are teaching him sign language".
But this isn't sign language as we know it, it's saying that Edmund made up his own signs.
Microsephaly can be caused by a number of different conditions; a genetic condition such as Edmund may be present, and it can be caused by infections caused by viruses such as measles and Zika during pregnancy.
Symptoms and course of the disease can vary greatly.
It's too early to say how the lives of people with Zika infection will be affected.
Picciuto recalls the emotional burden of the uncertainty of his future.
I kept asking myself what was going to happen.
What's going to happen?
And he still doesn't know it.
In fact, I haven't asked a question about the course of the disease in a long time because I don't expect anyone to actually tell me.
But Picciuto is able to offer some hopeful advice for mothers of babies who are disabled due to Zika.
He's getting better and better.
You know it's better for you.
You will love your child, and your child will love you.
Heavy rains and flooding in Louisiana, Mississippi, have mobilized rescue teams.
Heavy rain and widespread flooding in Louisiana, with more rain expected through Saturday, has led the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday.
The National Weather Service reports that flooding has occurred in numerous river basins in northeast Louisiana and south of the Mississippi, posing a danger of widespread flooding following heavy rainfall.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and that support for affected neighborhoods is on the way.
Mike Steele, spokesman for the governor's Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, said requests for high-water vehicles, boats and trenches were being made.
Steele said that tons of trench markers were requested for the Tangipahoa neighborhood alone.
A flood watch will be in effect through Saturday in most of south Louisiana.
The weather service has announced that an additional 3 to 5 inches of rain will fall in the area.
In southern Alabama, a flood watch was in effect Saturday as heavy rain continued to fall in the Mobile area.
Both the Comite River near Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and the Amite River near Denham Springs, Louisiana, are expected to reach record levels over the weekend.
Forecaster Alek Krautmann said both rivers could also flood many homes in suburban areas near Baton Rouge.
He also said that the floodwaters in the Ascension neighborhood pose a threat because the full rivers will flow slowly into Lake Maurepas.
The Tickfaw River, just south of the Mississippi state line in Liverpool, Louisiana, had already reached its highest level measured at 9 a.m. on Friday.
Rescue crews continue to rescue people from flooding in the Amite and Wilkinson crashes in southwest Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson, were among those rescued near Gloucester on Friday.
Hansford, 62, said the water from Beaver Creek, which is normally 400 feet from his home, rose rapidly overnight.
He said another stepson who lived nearby had warned him.
"We woke up and the water kept coming", Hansford said.
It was as big as my waist.
His wife told Hansford that this was the highest level he had seen in the valley in the 48 years he had lived here.
Hansford stated that he and his family were disabled and that he was the only one who could swim.
Hansford said that the emergency workers rescued the three in a large, military-style truck and took them to the fire station in Gloster, where they took refuge on Friday.
Krautmann stated that the flooding was "rapidly spreading" as heavy rains continued, and that authorities were considering issuing an evacuation order.
Krautmann said an observer near Livingston reported 13.75 inches of rain from midnight to Friday morning.
Krautmann said the floor has been highly saturated since Wednesday.
Authorities said heavy rain and flooded streets have prompted rescue efforts for residents of Tangipahoa Township and school holidays in five school districts.
CBS affiliate WWL reports that a female council member in Tangipahoa said 200 homes were flooded.
Residents have been evacuated to two churches, but they are now under water.
Neighborhood watchman Robby Miller said authorities have rescued 72 people and seven pets trapped by rising waters.
Shelters have been opened in the town of Amite and the city of Hammond for evacuees.
He said, "When the waters begin to recede, they will be allowed to return home".
In the city of Hammond in the Tangipahoa Neighborhood, nearly two dozen streets were closed due to rising waters and ditches were provided for residents to take by trying to keep water away from their homes and businesses.
"The last major flood we experienced was in March", said Lacy Landrum, the city's chief executive.
This is going to be a similar case.
In Mississippi, Rupert Lacy, the emergency manager for the Harrison disaster, said that the rain was continuing steadily along the Gulf Coast.
He said that there were reports of flooding in several homes on Tuesday, but there was no such report on Friday.
Keith Townson, manager of Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has lived in this area for 40 years.
Townson said, "I've seen water where I've never seen it before", and added, "and there's still rain".
Mahaj Brown, 6 years old, survived the Philadelphia attack with a bullet hole in his body.
Police say a 6-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, the second shooting of a 6-year-old in the city this week.
For CBS Philadelphia, Mahaj Brown has been identified by his grandparents.
He said his grandparents found multiple gunshot wounds to Brown's body, including the groin area, legs, arms and abdomen, but that he was conscious when taken to the hospital.
Her grandmother, Delores Melendez, told the station, "She suffered a lot, her tiny body was riddled with bullets".
I can't believe this.
The boy was listed as critical in the hospital and underwent some surgeries.
The family told the station that he was expected to recover.
He was going to start his first year at the local elementary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in the Germantown area.
Two men, both 29, one 32, were shot.
CBS Philadelphia reports that one of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition, while the other two victims are in stable condition.
The station reported that the boy was found shot in the front seat of a car with a 29-year-old man who was in critical condition.
The other two victims were not in the car, and police are investigating whether one of the wounded was the assailant.
Detectives told CBS Philadelphia that multiple gunmen may have fired at each other.
The scene was filled with assault-style bullets from different assault weapons.
It appears to have been a prolonged conflict.
There were sheds on both sides of the street and sidewalk.
"which indicates that there are multiple gunmen and that both are active", Philadelphia Police Commissioner Anthony Ginaldi told the station.
Multiple homes and vehicles in the area were also damaged.
No arrests were made and police were reported to be examining security cameras.
Another 6-year-old girl was shot in the arm by an accidental bullet while playing outside her home in the West Oak neighborhood on Tuesday.
He's in recovery and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Simone, the reason we need Gabby and Laurie
I named this year's women's Olympic gymnastics team, and there's more than one reason for that.
First of all, I've been to every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the U.S. has never been so dominant.
And secondly, this team has three gymnasts who have inspired many girls of different ethnic backgrounds: Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez.
The structure of this team, put together by Jewish Al Raisman and Catholic Madison Kocian, makes everyone proud.
The team finally looks like America.
It also reinforces the presence of black and Latino women at the top levels of the sport.
In the past four years, the first female gymnast has always been an African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were number one and number two.
This is powerful stuff.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was a surprise Olympic champion, and America backed her.
Now the world will witness the extraordinary performances of three World Champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, who have unpredictable but skillful gymnastics routines.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American in a row to win the gold medal in the women's all-around.
And his teammate Aly Raisman won silver.
We're witnessing the glory days of this sport, but it doesn't seem to be the case in gymnasiums across the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie followed the same path Aly and Madison followed to make the Olympic team.
The reason they are the "Last Five" is that the next Olympic gymnastics team will only have four gymnasts, and this will be the last year that Marta Karolyi will be coaching.
But in reality, gymnastics is a very costly sport, and gymnasts primarily work in private gymnastics clubs that are funded by parents, which are backed by tuition, travel, uniforms, competition, hotel fees (for coaches, gymnasts, and families), and many more.
Most of these gymnastics clubs are located in affluent suburban neighborhoods that could afford these businesses.
These clubs are the only place where gymnasts can train, and they require a costly and long-term commitment from the families of the gymnasts.
Simone Biles's coach, Aimee Boorman, and Laurie Hernandez's coach, Maggie Haney, have been training these athletes since the day they started gymnastics.
We provide communities with affordable and accessible gymnastics training for the countless young girls who have been impacted by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I started my own gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
In my organizations, based in Harlem, we have provided free and low-cost gymnastics training to over 15,000 youth in the city, primarily black and Hispanic, and coached both national and international champions.
In September, we're going to expand to Detroit, where I grew up, to provide quality gymnastics education to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops the body's strength, flexibility and coordination and provides mental attributes of hard work, discipline and determination.
This combination offers long-term advantages in terms of health, success in school and at work.
This team is going to be the inspiration that's going to get thousands of young girls into gymnastics, and that's a great thing.
Participation in sports activities is very important, especially for girls.
We're going through some really exciting times.
Thank you to Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for bringing the gold medal to the Olympic team, for bringing the "Girl Power" into the open, and for motivating so many young girls from so many different backgrounds to become healthy, strong, successful young women.
After Jeremy Hunt's proposal was rejected, the doctors' assistants decided to continue the strike.
Ministers hoped that the dispute would end after the British Medical Association officials agreed to an improved contract, but 58% of the 37,000 physician assistants who took part in the vote voted against it.
In July, Mr Hunt announced plans to impose sanctions on the contract, stating that the NHS was "no one's property" and that any further delays would be detrimental to staff and patients.
The first group of physician assistants was moved to a new contract that included changes to night and weekend work practices to improve after-hours care.
Dr. Ellen McCourt, chair of the BMA's committee of physician assistants, said in her statement last night: "Physician assistants still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, especially that it will trigger the current workforce crisis and that all doctors are not treated equally".
With only eight weeks to go before the first group of doctors are transferred to the new contract, progress is needed and time is running out.
The BMA's efforts to resolve the dispute by talking have been met with a reluctance to engage and in some cases deafening silence from the government.
This is a development despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month that his door would always be open.
"Jeremy Hunt needs to act now, lift the sanction and listen to the concerns of the resident physicians".
The physician assistants are making it clear that they are prepared to increase the work-slow actions if he does not.
The latest strike, which took place at the end of April, resulted in nearly 13,000 routine surgeries and 100,000 postponed appointments, leaving nurses and counselors to take the place of doctors on the strike line.
The ministers hoped that the dispute would end after reaching an agreement on a contract with the British Medical Association officials.
The BMA wants to improve weekend pay for the 54,000 physician assistants under contract.
NHS Employers executive director Daniel Mortimer has urged doctors to refrain from any strike action.
Mr Mortimer said: "A strike doesn't solve anything, but it puts pressure on already busy teams and services, causing anxiety, discomfort and distress for patients, carers and their families".
We've been in talks with the Committee of Medical Assistants for the past two months, and we've been working with the Ministry of Health and other authorities to address their concerns about the Surveillance and Confirmation Mission in a positive manner.
Employers were hopeful that the continued positive communication on important issues - distribution, flexibility in education, further education for those who have taken a break from their careers, education costs, mutual agreement on curriculum, leave for education and the gender pay gap in medicine - was a sign of how seriously the UK Ministry of Health and Medical Education was taking the agreements reached with the BMA in November, February and May.
A drug that could eliminate the risk of heart attack for 2 pounds a day.
After authorities recommended giving it to more people over longer periods of time, thousands of heart attack patients could benefit from the drug, which costs £2 a day.
Ticagrelor, which prevents clotting, reduces the risk of recurrent seizures in people with heart disease.
The drug was given for 12 months following the heart attack and reduced the risk of stroke or another seizure.
The NHS watchdog, NICE, suggested that people should be given this for four years to further reduce their risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now the NHS watchdog, NICE, has recommended that it be given to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Every year in the UK, around 140,000 people have a heart attack, and a quarter of these have another attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by fatty substances that build up and form plaque on the walls of arteries.
If the plaque breaks, it can cause a blood clot, blocking blood flow to the heart, which can lead to a heart attack.
And if the clot gets out of its way, it'll travel through the bloodstream and block blood flow to the brain, causing paralysis.
People who have had one seizure are at a higher risk of having another.
Ticagrelor, developed by the UK firm AstraZeneca under the trade name Brilique, reduces the risk of constipation by reducing the chance of constipation.
The draft NICE guideline published today recommends that subjects receive 90 mg ticagrelor for 12 months, followed by 60 mg twice daily with aspirin for three years.
Professor Carole Longson, executive director of the NICE health technology assessment centre, said: "Despite the availability of effective secondary prevention treatments, up to a quarter of those who have a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke, often with devastating consequences".
Fear of relapse can have a very negative impact on a person's quality of life.
Evidence suggests that the use of ticagrelor with aspirin is effective in reducing the risk of recurrent heart attack and stroke in people who have had a previous heart attack.
With the temporary recommendation of Ticagrelor, we are pleased to have expanded the treatment options available to the thousands of people waiting to benefit from it.
Because of limited data on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor beyond three years, including the risk of bleeding, the draft guideline does not recommend treatment beyond this period.
The PC culture has increased voter corruption in Muslim areas.
Former Tower Hamlets mayor Lutfur Rahman was removed from office for corruption following a government report last year.
As the devastating government report presented today demonstrates, the culture of political correctness has led to a disregard for widespread voter fraud in Muslim communities.
Former Cabinet Minister Sir Eric Pickles has chastised police, election observers and the town hall for ignoring evidence of election fraud due to "excessive sensitivity to ethnicity and religion".
The former community secretary and current anti-corruption czar said that the religious pressure on voters is so bad that the police should be allowed to draw the line outside the polling booths to protect the voters who are afraid.
He suggested that voters carry their IDs with them to prove their identity while voting.
In the current situation, it's enough for the voter to give his name and address.
The report even recommends permanent fingerprinting during the voting process to prevent people from voting twice.
Sir Eric said that whistle-blowers need better protection.
He called for better access to the press on board documents and decisions of unofficial committees or working groups.
"This is not only to protect against fraud in elections, but also to protect the local government from the culture of corruption and financial fraud that goes hand in hand with it", he said.
The report was commissioned by Downing Street following the Tower Hamlets' East London vote scandal.
Last year, a special election court ruled to remove mayor Lutfur Rahman from office after repeated corruption and illegal practices.
The court found that Rahman "brazenly abused" the religious sentiments of the Muslim community and silenced his critics with accusations of racism and Islamophobia.
It was stated that Rahman "conducted his campaign on the basis that it was a religious duty for faithful Muslims to vote for him".
Up to 300 of them were suspicious or the result of using false identities, voting as someone else.
Sir Eric has stated that he has evidence of fraud being committed across the country.
He warned against corruption, particularly in postal voting - wherein senior members of the Muslim community were alleged to have exerted pressure to vote for their own candidate.
Sir Eric has made some suggestions for the organisation of the voting system, including the carrying of identity cards to prove who the person is.
The report stated: "There is evidence that some ethnic minority communities have put pressure on valued individuals, primarily women and youth, to vote in a manner consistent with the will of the elderly, particularly in Pakistan- and Bangladesh-based communities.
"There were concerns that state institutions were condoning such behavior because of 'political correctness' based on extreme sensitivity to ethnicity and religion".
Sir Eric made 50 suggestions for how to regulate the system, including preventing political activists from processing postal ballots for "vote-gathering" purposes.
The report, reviewed by Theresa May, also calls for tighter registration checks to prevent the electoral roll from being used for immigration and welfare fraud.
Consideration of the option of making voters subject to ID before voting.
Applying permanent ink to a person's fingers after they have voted to prevent any person from voting twice.
Systematic checks on the fitness of the person to vote are carried out to determine the fitness to vote.
The application of a three-year limit to requests for the use of automatic voting by mail.
Prohibition of political campaigners and activists from processing completed postal ballots and envelopes of postal ballots.
Authorizing the police to draw a line around the voting booths.
Amendment of the law to facilitate the prosecution of people for intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983.
Making it illegal to take photographs in voting booths.
The requirement that only English is spoken in the voting booths (except Galleries).
Strengthen the training of staff on the enforcement of the rule that voters should not enter the polling booth alone.
Sir Eric has harshly criticised the Police Service for not having made any allegations in the Tower Hamlets case.
"The election court has ruled that there is no room for charges against Lutfur Rahman and his representative for repeated corruption and illegal activities", he said.
He was found guilty on a number of counts beyond a reasonable doubt, on the grounds of criminal evidence.
He also criticized the ineffective "box marking controls" in the voter registration departments of the town hall.
Sir Eric said: "The Tower Hamlets court ruling last year was a wake-up call.
While our nation is proud to be the mother of parliaments, it is alarming that widespread election fraud and rejection by some institutions may be damaging to that good reputation.
Being crazy for Kate's cycling lookalike and other famous lookalike of Rio Olympics
This week, the Rio 2016 Olympic enthusiasts went wild for French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who proved to be an impressive likeness of the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympic athlete isn't the only one who has been noticed for his celebrity likeness as he battles for the gold medal this summer, at least that's what social media thinks.
So, in honor of the Rio Games and all the famous faces we've seen on our screens, FEMAIL has compiled a list of Olympic athletes who resemble Hollywood celebrities beyond their resemblance.
The hunter and the wolf: Brady Ellison (left), member of the U.S. Men's Archery Team, compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since childhood
In addition to Kate's bicycle-racing likeness, many online have shown that an archer can look as much like Leonardo DiCaprio as his twin.
U.S. Men's Archery Team member Brady Ellison has taken to Twitter after images of him posing as the star of the film The Money Hunter surfaced.
And the archer, noticing this craze on social media, admitted that since childhood he had been told that he looked like Leo.
Brady told the Huffington Post, 'I don't think there's much of a resemblance except hair and beard.'
'He's a handsome man, so I guess that's a compliment.'
One of the most popular comparisons of London 2012 and one that will undoubtedly be even more striking this year is the striking resemblance of British long-jump athlete Greg Rutherford to popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina was described as having the same look as Cuban-American artist Gloria Estefan, with her large, expressive gaze.
And in the pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh, who has been likened to Glee star Matthew Morrison for years.
This user claims that Nathan is an "athletic version" of the Genesis star.
Tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett have long been compared for their similarities in their bushy eyebrows and lips.
The Russian team's silver-medal swimmer, who has the same tan skin and blond hair as actress Annalynne McCord, says fans that Team USA's Nathan Adrian 'resembles an athletic version of Joseph Gorgon Levitt'.
Tough women: Soccer star Hope Solo (left) and Dexter star Jennifer Carpenter (right) have similar facial features and eyes
Not alone: One Twitter user was delighted that others had noticed the similarity
One theory that's been floating around: This user thinks that there might be a reason why this couple looks similar.
One Twitter user took to the site to express his happiness that "the rest of the internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are twins".
In fact, the American football star and the actress who played her in Dexter have similar facial features and eyes.
Other popular comparisons include Kerri Walsh-Jennings and actress Laura Linney's almost identical smiles, and another gold medal gymnast Gabby Douglas and the similarly large smiles of Youth Fever star Gabrielle Union.
CBC Olympics spokesperson apologizes for comment that Chinese swimmer 'died like a pig'
Byron MacDonald's analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's fourth-place finish in the 4x200m freestyle has angered those watching CBC's live broadcast of Wednesday's Olympics.
Canadian broadcaster CBC was forced to apologize for comments by one of its anchors that the 14-year-old Chinese female swimmer 'slipped away like a bad smell' and 'died like a pig' in the race.
Speaker Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was off when he began to explain his ideas in the women's 4x200m freestyle final.
MacDonald, who was added to the CBC's team of announcers to add 'color', was heard to say: 'The little 14-year-old Chinese has done a bad job, baby.'
He was too excited, he went off like a bad smell and he died like a pig.
Thanks for that.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan (14), who finished the second leg of the flag race with a time of 1:57.79, was able to close the gap between the Canadians and China, trailing behind Canadian Taylor Rack by 1.61 seconds.
Canadian audiences were stunned by the tone and language used, and then they moved quickly to action.
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted, "Did the CBC announcer just say that the 14-year-old swimmer 'died like a pig'????.
The idiot didn't know it was still on the air.
The Yanhan family of China was described in the 4 x 200m Freestyle Flag Race as "the little 14-year-old Chinese boy has screwed up, baby".
There was a very sharp and quick Twitter attack on Byron MacDonald, and many of them were self-defence.
Twitter users couldn't help but be moved by how insensitive Byron Macdonald was.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: 'Wow, #ByronMacDonald. #ByronMacDonald is a very good example of this.
You represent the CBC and Canada and make us all look like racists. #midebully
Shortly after, Scott Russell, the CBC's continuing broadcaster, apologized for MacDonald's comment, saying: "We apologize for the comment made on the air regarding the swimming competition".
These were truly unfortunate words, and we regret that such an event has occurred.'
CBC had to apologize at least 90 times more than the people who tweeted in response to the comment
Another speaker, Scott Russell, was forced to apologize on behalf of MacDonald.
The CBC then copied and pasted this apology to over 90 Twitter users who complained about MacDonald's comments.
The network quickly issued a statement apologizing.
We would like to express our sincere regret that these statements were made and that they were published.
Last night, we quickly apologized to our viewers on the air and our social media followers.
We'd like to make it clear that Byron's comments were about the swimmer's performance, not his personality.
However, these were highly inappropriate and ill-chosen words, and Byron is extremely sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized on the air and tried to defend his remarks by saying he did not mean to make a personal attack.
She said on CBC's Olympic program, "I want to apologize for a comment I made after the women's flag race last night".
'I was referring to the performance of the pilot, not his personality.'
'No need to say more, I didn't mean to be disrespectful and I'm very sorry.'
A Primark customer spits on a woman who's been called "underwear" in the middle of the store.
Customers were left wondering what to do when a woman took off her clothes to try on panties in the middle of a Primark store.
Worse, she looked at how it looked on her, took it out and put it back on the shelf.
He kept staring and then tried on four pairs of underwear at the Bouverie Place shopping mall in Folkestone.
The place where the woman tried on her panties before putting them back on the shelf was the Primark store at Bouverie Place Mall in Folkestone.
Jenny Davidson, a mother of two who was in the store at the time, testified that she tried on the underwear of the mystery woman and 'got dressed again and left the store without taking anything'.
He himself said: 'The people could not believe their eyes.'
He stopped in the middle of the store and took a pair of panties from the window, took off his pantyhose and pant legs and put them on.
'He didn't try to find a private place to do it, he just stood there with all his disrespect.'
'Everyone was looking at her as she took the panties off, 'and it was clear that she didn't like the panties because she put them back on the shelf.'
She tried three more sets of laundry until she decided she didn't like anything, and then she went out of the store and changed back into her clothes.
'She seemed to have no regard for her viewers and no thought for the next buyer of the panties she was trying on.'
'It's disgusting to think that someone would take home someone else's unwashed panties,' said Ms. Davidson, 33, of Kent.
This incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidson added, "I think the staff found the clothes and took them off the market after she left, "which is a good thing".
'It would be really bad if I went home and bought a new pair of underwear and someone else took them off and came to me without washing them.'
A Primark spokesman said: 'Primark is aware of the incident that occurred at our store in Folkestone on Tuesday, August 9.'
The product in question has been removed from sale.
How to protect yourself against armed attack with Krav Maga
The world outside is dangerous, but this video from Dailymail.com can help you stay safe.
We spoke to Rhon Mizrachi, head master of the New York-based Krav Maga Federation, to learn how to deal with armed robbers at close range.
Whether you're approached from the front or from the back, this video will show you how to turn the situation against the robber.
Mizrachi says that when you're approached from behind, the first thing you should do is turn around, see the attacker, and "clear the line of fire".
Then you'll hold the gun between your forearm and your shoulder and hit him in the face with your elbow in the air.
Then, when you kneel on his thigh, the aggressor's pain will be doubled, and at this stage you will take the weapon from his hand by turning it, and you will strike him in the face with the barrel of the weapon, with the back of the weapon up.
When the gunman approaches from the front, a similar technique is used, where you pull your body away from the line of fire, grab the gun, and turn it so that the attacker cannot fire.
At the same time, you're going to turn your weight to the weapon, punch the attacker in the chest area, take the weapon from him, and then you're going to pull the weapon towards him.
Does that sound allergic?
Check out the video to see how Mizrachi does it.
But remember, unless you're a Krav Maga master, the safest way to avoid every robbery is to give your money to the robber.
Traveller Ian Wright has his tongue in the dirtiest places in Europe for his travel guide.
The British traveller put his immune system and digestive reflex to the test by licking some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.
To prove the power of his immune system, Suffolk-born travel writer Ian Wright, 51, stuck his tongue on a Euro banknote, a Piccadily Circus stopwatch, a train toilet flush button and a landline phone in Russia.
Before he licked each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what kind of business he was in.
But the experiment, which would be turned into a movie called The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, had some surprising results.
And while the thought of licking a trendy siphon button that's used by thousands of people is downright disgusting, there are many, many more bad bacteria in the kitchen sink.
During his European tour, Mr. Wright consulted doctors and medical experts regarding the health and growth of stomach bacteria.
Fortunately, nothing he licked had any effect except the bad taste it left in his mouth.
Mr. Wright was known for traveling the world and testing the strength of his stomach by eating strange and wonderful things.
From the general stoppers at train stations to the toilet flush buttons, this mission has certainly tested the immune system.
In the film about it, he said: 'I was not a health-conscious person since childhood and I swallowed everything from dirt and worms to muddy water.'
And the film certainly proves the cause of his reputation.
The only thing he's refused is a dirty public toilet in Russia.
The sample sample showed a luminometer count of over 4,000 units.
For comparison, the number of newly washed hands should be below 60.
But there was a Russian public restroom where he refused to lick when his luminometer readings were over 4,000 units when his hands were under 60.
Mr. Wright and Finnish dairy manufacturer Valio produced a travel film called The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, which showed the number of bacteria in different places, like the bathroom.
He said in the film, "This is about as bad as any toilet I've ever smelled".
It can't get any dirtier than this!
I'm not licking anything because it's disgusting.
The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was developed in collaboration with Finnish dairy manufacturer Valio.
The company provided Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria, as well as stomach bacteria and vitamins C and D, which help strengthen the immune system.
Niko Vuorenmaa, Senior Vice President of Snacks, Fruit Juices and New Categories at Valio, said: "We wanted to offer something really new to consumers.
Something that's fascinating to watch and also explains the benefits of probiotics.
We did a lot of crazy brainstorming where we finally came up with the idea of "let's go find Ian".
They claim that the concern for gut health has become a global phenomenon.
We wanted to put the products in a much larger context than just talking about the products, the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of gut health and how it relates to the immune system.
The interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon, and with this documentary, we could have given consumers more information about this condition in an interesting way.
I also think the movie shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, the director of the film, added: "Let me tell you, if Ian had licked some of the things I wanted him to lick, like the filthy Russian toilet shown in the film, I would have lost respect for him".
Naturally, some things were easy for Ian to lick, but others were very difficult.
I'm glad we caught some of these shitty acts of licking.'
In a 2015 survey conducted by Valio, 84 percent of participants associated lactic acid bacteria with stomach health, and 58 percent stated that they used products containing lactic acid bacteria at least occasionally.
Maganda family destroyed their social housing in Saltash, Cornwall before evacuation
A family of bungalow busts left £50,000 worth of damage in the social housing they were evicted from on the grounds that they were intimidating their neighbours.
Tanya Skeldon and her husband, Shaun Trebilcock, were evicted from their home in Saltash, Cornwall, after numerous complaints.
When they were forcibly evicted, housing authority officials were surprised to find the property in such a state of disrepair.
There were large holes in the walls, the floorboards had been torn out, the floor was littered with garbage, and the walls were graffitied.
The family has now been evicted and are believed to be enjoying special accommodation options.
Donna McEvoy, the housing manager at Cornwall Housing, said she feared the situation was beyond repair.
He said: 'It's a real nightmare for the people here, and I don't think people should have to live like this.
There's a lot to take into account, because this estate will now be known as a not-so-pleasant part of Cornwall.
This family has a bad reputation, and their names have a bad reputation.
The family had three sons living in the compound, and police said the family had engaged in a variety of scary behaviors, including fighting on the street with baseball bats, intimidating nearby residents, drug use, drug dealing, and excessive yelling, arguing, and swearing.
In June, Skeldon, 47, was given an antisocial conduct order on the lease.
Old garbage found in many rooms of the house that was supposed to be demolished
The floorboards of the property where the drugs were sold were removed in the past.
Neighbors said they saw them fighting in the street and that the police were called frequently.
Cornwall Housing forcibly evicted him and his wife from the property this week after giving them an 11-week extension to move in voluntarily.
The evacuation was welcomed by relieved neighbors who said their lives had turned into a nightmare.
'They didn't care about anyone,' one person said.
We've lived with them for 20 years, and it's always been bad.
You wouldn't believe how many times we've seen cops in here.
'This morning, we could not sleep.'
We woke up because it's so quiet; we're not used to it!
They're finally gone, and everything's gonna be great.
Adam Fitzpatrick, a neighborhood enforcement officer for Cornwall Housing, testified that the family was not cooperating with local authorities.
The family had lived in the house for 20 years, and the property was frequently called to by the police.
Trash and old toys were dumped on the plant-covered side of the social housing
He added: 'It is truly shameful that the tenant has not taken any responsibility for the eviction of himself and his family; eviction has always been the last option of Cornwall Housing.
It was a very difficult case because the behavior was so extreme and the actions were so frightening that the neighbors couldn't bear witness.
I greatly appreciate the efforts of my team, the Devon and Cornwall Police Force and the community members who have courageously come forward to inform us.
I hope this development will provide some relief to the neighbors and be seen as a message that antisocial behavior will not be tolerated.
Mr. Fitzpatrick said he had three sons who lived on the property at different times, but they were all in their 20s.
A dirty bed left on the floor in one of the bedrooms of the house after the evacuation
Housing workers will have to clean up the garbage heaps surrounding the house.
In 2014, police raided the property and found over 70 grams of marijuana, scales, personal effects and £1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined after pleading guilty to possession of a Class B drug with intent to sell.
He claimed he was going to use the money to buy a headstone for his son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After becoming homeless, it was discovered that Tanya and her husband were now staying in a private residence in Plymouth.
In most rooms of the house, there were inscriptions on the walls.
Police said they will work to evict tenants who violate the rental rules.
Devon and Cornwall Police's Angela Crow said the eviction was a warning to other tenants who continue to break the rules.
He said, 'This is a message for those who think they can do whatever they want and that their actions will be unsuccessful.'
The Devon and Cornwall Police Force will continue to work with its partners to protect the community and will never tolerate crime or anti-social behaviour.
Tourists in Portugal were horrified when a military plane flew over the beach in low altitude
Tourists sunbathing in Aveiro, Portugal, had the shock of their lives
The Portuguese Air Force P-3C Orion has made a very low-altitude flight
The Air Force has said this is a training flight but has insisted there is no safety risk.
This is when the tourists start to panic as they fly over the sand with jets flying low.
Dramatic footage shows a military plane approaching sunbathers on the sand in Aveiro, northern Portugal, at almost level contact.
The tourists stood up, understandably worried about the noise of the jet engines, before they could see what was coming towards them through the clouds.
The incident occurred yesterday afternoon near Aveiro, on the Costa Nova.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the few vacationers who shared the video of the dramatic flyby on social media, said: 'Two times it really went down and at one point it looked like it was about to crash.'
Nuno Arroja added: 'I was surfing and I swear I felt like a plane was going to fall on me.'
Tourists on the beach in Aveiro were horrified when the plane emerged from the darkness and began flying at extremely low altitude
The Portuguese Air Force has today announced that the pilot of the P-3C Orion was on a training flight to identify fishing boats on the coast and had to go so low that it was the only way to control them.
He said the jet flew lower than normal because of poor visibility due to smoke from a nearby fire, but the air force insisted that no one's safety was at risk.
This summer, unrelenting wildfires have devastated parts of the Portuguese mainland, and caused the deaths of four people on Madeira Island.
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot had to fly low due to conditions that made it difficult for him to see (heavy fog and smoke from fires that could not be extinguished).
The plane was on a training flight and as part of the exercise the pilot was asked to identify the fishing boats
London schoolgirl who joined ISIS was killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIS, has reportedly died in Syria.
Lawyer Tasnime Akunjee testified that his family had received information about his death in Raqqa, Syria, a few weeks ago.
ITV News reported on Thursday that he was believed to have been killed in a Russian airstrike on the Rakka region, where the group is strong in the country.
The sultan, who was 17, died while planning to flee the war-torn country and return to Britain, according to his family.
Akunjee "We hope that this case highlights that it is really risky to go to war zones as a tombstone and a testament for others and discourages people from making this choice".
In February 2015, Sultana and two female students from east London boarded a plane to Turkey and then a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultana's family was told that she had married an ISIS fighter in Syria and was widowed within months.
Reid has indicated that if Clinton is elected, he will not give up Garland as a Supreme Court nominee.
Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid has said that he believes the Democrats will nominate Supreme Court Justice Merrick Garland if Hillary Clinton is elected president.
Senate Republicans have been blocking Garland's confirmation since President Barack Obama nominated him in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has announced that the new president will select a replacement for former Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.
Reid said in a video address Thursday that he believed Clinton would pick Garland and that "there are reasons for that".
Later, a spokesman for Reid said he had not spoken directly with Clinton about whether or not he would nominate Garland, and that he was speculating.
He praised Garland and said that the Clinton team did not want to "distort the status quo" by holding a new election.
Garland, Chief Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
Reid said that the Republicans who blocked Garland's nomination were "supporters" and "defenders" of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He said Trump was not fit for the job.
Treats stated that he was in favor of a nude calendar 'for men as well as for women'
Treats magazine is working with photographer David Bellemere to publish a calendar inspired by the 1970s Pirelli for 2017.
But instead of celebrities and nudists, they're trying to find the next generation of top models for the 2017 NU Inspired Fairies calendar.
Steve Shaw, president of Treats, stated earlier this year that the magazine, which had a high nudity rate, was different from the older Playboy because "Playboy is for men".
I do it for the women.
Apparently, he believes that the calendar is the same.
Shaw said in a press release about the calendar, "We need to return to the unfashionable, classic display of nudity so that women, like men, can look at these images of the female body with ease as a source of inspiration".
The women will want to be part of this project because it's a beautiful work of art.
Models can post photos online or attend open auditions in Los Angeles and New York.
Vinyl target: who really buy records?
Middle-aged lonely guys love the vinyl.
Before we go into the comment section to make some spectacular insults under the guise of "All Alone Middle-Aged Men", let us say that this statement is based on actual data.
According to YouGov, the return of the records, a hot topic, is not the result of a millennial looking for innovation created by a physical object, but rather a result of midlife nostalgia.
Most people who buy vinyl records these days are between the ages of 45 and 54.
In fact, the 18-24 age group is the least likely.
It's also not just the act of saving by the curious; it's an emotional importance; older vinyl buyers are generally people who like to keep their emotions to themselves (56 and 53%) and enjoy being alone (69 and 66%).
And are the YouGov results correct?
If this blog was a news story on television, the camera would have seen me walking down a crowded street in Soho in a modest gray suit, making many gestures before I stopped, and then opening my hands and clasping them together, saying something authoritative like, "Let's take a look then".
Well, let's have a look.
While downtown Soho is slowly losing its charm and quirkiness (buildings once occupied by independent dealers are now filled with hotels, Eats, Prets and Paperchases), there are still a few specialist record stores.
I would probably ask him to stop for the next part, where I would stand near different men in some of these stores and try to learn about their ages and emotional states through observation.
Stuart, 55, from Glasgow, whom I've been following on his way from Sister Ray (two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (eight middle-aged men, probably a woman in her 20s), is spending an afternoon in London for a meeting, and he's browsing the stores to fill a few free hours.
I'm asking if you're a collector.
"I guess I am", he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
The picture above, these plates (he sent me the picture by e-mail, I didn't follow him to his house) decorate the walls of the living room.
The reason he's got so many albums and singles is partly because of his disposable income, which means he can buy records that he couldn't afford to buy when they first came out, and buy back the records he sold when he was young and broke.
"Most of the stuff I buy is from the late '60s and early '70s, when I was 11 or 12 years old, and I was too young to buy", he says.
She agrees that record buyers are more likely to be introverted people who like to be alone, adding: "I don't smoke, and I don't drink too much alcohol.
That's my bad temper.
Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also thinks that most of the customers she meets match her YouGov profile.
But he also noticed that there was a new wave of hype in the media, and that people who heard that it was coming back felt the need to buy back their old records.
I've learned from interviews that people usually sell their collections in 1998 or 1999.
"Customers who used to sell vinyl to buy CDs are now selling CDs to buy records".
This may explain the increase in people of a certain age who are reviving vinyl.
What about the alleged emotional significance of the records?
It takes you a few seconds to realize that a store like Phonica has a comfortable community of record stores with similar personalities.
According to Wez, some older customers are particularly offended by the contactless payment system.
Some vinyl enthusiasts may want to take refuge in the stability of familiar record covers, which are a reminder of their youth, overwhelmed by the digital world and re-established in a calm way.
"Sometimes it's because they're filling a void", says Wez, "or they're seeing material things as a kind of comfort".
I have it, because I'm a collector myself, and I think most people have it.
It's an easy way to fill your head.
"We're like social workers", says a co-worker, who's just sprung from a pile of records.
A poll in April revealed that 50% of those who bought a vinyl record last month hadn't yet listened to it.
The survey also found that 41% owned a turntable that they had never used, and 7% bought vinyl without a turntable.
At this point in the story, I would probably be looking at a bunch of bossa nova compositions and looking very worried.
The "reward" aspect of this return is also something that Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of Universe, noticed.
"Recently, someone came to me and said, 'I don't have a record player, but I'd like to buy a Radiohead record to put on our shelves.'"
And while that's not a huge percentage, it certainly reflects the current situation.
More product, less music.
There are people who say, "I don't have a record player".
These are not old people, these are young people, in their late teens, newcomers to the subject.
When I get to Fopp, who has almost a whole floor dedicated to vinyl, I see that the audience is quite varied.
There are couples in their 70s, photo-taking tourists, young boys and middle-aged women.
The atmosphere is less tranquil than the shops mentioned above (the last part of Wild Beast) and the customers are more diverse, although sex-oriented pop is spreading instead of the soothing jazz from the speakers.
None of them seem particularly lonely, but it's hard to analyze the psychological trauma that haunts them standing next to one for more than 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been wandering around Fopp for a few minutes, looking at the discs in the sale.
Instead of spending, he just went to look at the windows.
He says he doesn't have the option of making a record collection because he doesn't make much.
It's too expensive.
It's easier to listen to music on the computer or in other ways, but the beauty of vinyl"... and he sighs away like a loved one.
I don't know how to explain it, it's really unlike anything.
My last stop is a store that's said to be the inspiration for a new generation of vinyl addicts: Urban Outfitters.
I'm watching a group of teenage girls gathered around Polaroid cameras, a little before a father and daughter's argument over buying a Crosley record player, pretending to examine jeans.
On the left, there's a stairwell filled with records by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac -- not a lot of records for an average collection; a mixture of modern and classic.
No one looks; maybe it's just that they're decorative, some are too high to touch.
This is a "artistic vinyl".
But the curiosity about these things could mean that the industry makes more money and sends fewer customers to the depths of Soho, so there's not much to complain about.
It's not surprising that a demographic with more money and time than most would spend more on more luxury items like vinyl.
But my findings show that YouGov's findings are true, at least in Soho record stores, which are over-represented, and they don't take into account female collectors and vinyl enthusiasts who are in fact in record stores or online forums.
These people are probably working very hard at school or in offices.
These are definitely not the guys who spend Thursday evenings wandering around the record stores on Berwick Street, going through the records and looking over the shoulders of middle-aged men who know nothing about it, avoiding the gaze of a 30-year-old fake TV anchor.
The Greenland shark is the longest-living vertebrate on Earth - video

French court rejects bid to demolish shops in Jungle refugee camp
A French court has rejected a proposal by Calais authorities to demolish dozens of shabby shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp, home to thousands of refugees.
In court this week, Calais officials argued that the state should demolish 72 convenience stores where people in the camp sell everything from cigarettes to energy drinks, haircuts or basic food for 50 cents (40p) a cup of tea or a few euros.
The Governor of Calais argued that these places should be demolished because they created a parallel economy that did not pay taxes and because they were a risk to fire and hygiene.
Charitable groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were vital and that the free food provided by state-sponsored organizations and other groups was not enough for the camp's growing population.
They argued that convenience stores and restaurants often provided shelter and free food to those in need.
A court in Lille said there was no legal basis for the deportation of the people who ran the 72 stores, but that the concerns of the Calais Governor were "completely understandable".
Judge Jean-François Molla said grocery stores, cafes and restaurants were taking on a much bigger role than just feeding people living in "extremely dangerous conditions".
He said these areas provided comfortable meeting points for refugees and volunteers.
One of the sites threatened with destruction, the non-profit Jungle Book Cafe for Children serves 200 meals a day, teaches English and French, and offers immigration advice to hundreds of underage refugees in the camp.
Over 170,000 people have signed a petition to protect this cafe for kids.
A letter to the Guardian said the shutdown would be "a disaster for these children, some of whom are as young as eight".
Two charities, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimated Friday that the population of the Jungle camp had risen to over 9,000, the highest number to date, after an increase in summer arrivals.
After gold in the Fiji Masters, Britain settled for silver in the Rugby Sevens Championship.
Great Britain's impressive run in the Rugby 7's Championship ended with a 43-7 defeat at the Rio Deodoro Stadium in the final against Fiji on Thursday.
Fiji mastered the grip, pass, side step, backhand, running lines and sheer force to claim the first Olympic gold medal of any color.
After their defeat, Britain took their third silver medal of the day as a consolation prize that's not too bad, and can now take pride in their efforts in the opening tournament of the Olympics where they defeated New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
Earlier today, he may have found them in the final after the South African team beat them 7-5 in the semi-finals.
But still, a Fiji in that form could have beaten a 15-man team.
It may be hard to believe, but perhaps Britain can take comfort in the thought that at least one Briton will be wearing a gold medal tomorrow: the head coach of Fiji, Ben Ryan, an Englishman from Wimbledon.
This has been a very difficult journey for Britain.
Eight years ago, when they worked with Ryan, they lost every game in the Adelaide Sevens.
This time, they only lost one.
Although this is painful, the progress is truly amazing.
Fiji had a splendid start, with the players rocking the ball through the attempts of Great Britain.
It was like running between a series of moving buses for Captain Tom Mitchell and his team, and the World Series champions, Osea Coliniso, took the lead 5-0 when they moved around the corner.
In the fourth minute, Jerry Tuwai faced another number with a false start from the right wing.
It was 12-0 and Britain had barely touched the ball.
Mitchell's brilliant intervention, like a mountain, prevented Leone Nakarawa from throwing a third, but all he did was delay Fiji's count.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua scored from the right corner and Great Britain fell behind 17 to 0.
With just one minute left in the first half, Nakarawa scored again, coming from the top.
Vatemo Ravouvou then flew to the line for the score, passing through some tough British interventions.
With that score, the score is 29-0 at halftime.
While Fiji 7 was a team formed to play in the championship, Britain was still learning the basics.
It's like this.
Great Britain made a big change in the middle of the lap and Fiji closed the dam for exactly four minutes, which was a good improvement on the first half, until Josua Tuisova came on with a perfect Fijian play.
Dan Norton had a try for Great Britain and tried to score from the left corner to make the score 36-7 but the game was in the hands of the South Sea Islanders who were singing, waving the flag and dancing.
It was really hard not to admire Fiji's cheerful approach from start to finish.
Maa Viliame also worshipped the latest additions to the Fiji game that didn't need to be embellished at the last minute.
When the whistle blew, the Fijians began to celebrate, and Britain made its way to the dressing room in disgust.
Earlier in the day, Fiji had beaten Japan 20-5 in the semi-final, and the UK faced South Africa in a tough semi-final match, with Britain leading by just one point.
Kyle Brown led the South African team in the first half, but Dan Norton led the second half with his head-spinning footwork.
With the brilliant intervention of Anthony's brother Marcus Watson, who is in the top 15 in the UK, victory and a silver medal are guaranteed.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning, inspired by their coaches' battle with cancer, raced to victory in the saddle.
There will be no more emotional gold medals at these games, and that is important.
After 220 tormenting breaths from first to last, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning realized that the moment they won gold at Estacio da Lagoa could mean so much more.
Although there were two people pulling the shovels, there were three voices on the boat, including the voice of their coach Robin Williams as they advanced to their second consecutive Olympic gold medal, the first British women to reach that level in the women's pairs this year.
Their dominance was clear, this was the 39th race in their unprecedented, undefeated streak.
Although we see two great athletes floating on the surface in swan-like elegance, this image does not exactly reflect the nature of victory.
Behind every gold medal in rowing is a dedicated team of hands that have made this difference, and none as effective as their coaches, who didn't know if they would live to see the day when they were diagnosed with cancer 30 months ago.
Like he said, they touched and left.
I had bladder cancer, a type that could be treated with surgery, and they did it.
If they don't, it's going everywhere.
That would be a pretty bad situation.
It changes your outlook on life a little bit.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio was very fortunate that he was able to start treatment in the off-season, early 2014, so I don't know if that's the right word for a situation like this, but it would minimize distraction.
I had to get paid, so I had to get better fast.
That was an encouragement to me.
I was in the hospital, and they said that a few steps was enough, but I was walking in the garden about 20 feet.
That's how it started.
Rowing is a journey in itself, but this makes it bigger.
After the victory, his mind was on Williams, who had had a tense morning, talking a little more than usual to get over his own anxiety.
Stanning, a captain in the Royal Artillery who had been to Afghanistan earlier, said, "I was emotionally devastated this week, which is a bit extreme, but it really means a lot".
It just highlights what it means to me and how hard Helen and I and Robin have worked.
I had three wonderful years with Helen and Robin.
And we wouldn't be here if it wasn't for Robin, so I just want to say thank you to him for being the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have found a better person to work with, or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning haven't lost a race in five years.
The duo has a challenging rhythm that their rivals can't match.
Stanning and Glover were still going strong in the last 500 metres, when the New Zealand and Danish teams closed the gap.
We were so caught up in the moment.
Helen was saying, "Follow the process, follow the process".
It's really important not to get caught.
We had a good start and we weren't trying to do anything incredible.
We didn't expect the fireworks to go off today, we just wanted to win the race we came out of with a good rowing, which we did.
The duo will take a year off before deciding what to do with their future.
Glover has a wedding to attend next month, his and TV adventurer Steve Backshall's.
For now, he just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say it was my last race.
That would've put too much pressure on him.
It took me six months to realize I was an Olympic champion in London.
It was very new, and I was very stressed.
Here, it took about four minutes.
It feels so much better".

Bulgaria releases inflation figures for the first time in eight months
According to national statistics, monthly inflation in Bulgaria in June was at the level of 1%.
This is the highest value seen in years (since June 2012) but the first value seen above zero since October after the positive value of 0.2% last year.
The average annual inflation measured by the CPI for the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) was -0.8% compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015).
The consumer price index in July 2016 was 101.0% compared to June 2016, i.e. monthly inflation was at 1.0%.
The difference between the inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 vs. December 2015) was -0.2%, and the difference between the monthly inflation rate from July 2016 to July 2015 was -0.2%.
In July 2016, compared to the previous month, price increases were observed in the following consumer product groups: Food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), transportation (1.8%), entertainment and culture (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), various goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell in clothing and footwear (by 2.2%), furniture, home equipment and routine care (by 0.5%) and healthcare (by 0.1%).
Alcoholic beverages and tobacco products, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels; communications and education groups remained at the same price.
Snapchat "Anime" Effect, Criticised as an Asian Cartoon
Snapchat says it was inspired by animes for this filter, but some observers say it's racially insensitive.
Snapchat allows about 150 million users to play with their identities on an absurd level, changing their reality every day with the lens tool.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog, or a character that pops out of a Roy Lichtenstein painting.
Lenses are reckless, self-modifying devices that generate over 30 million improved self-images every day.
The wrong steps are quickly etched in the public memory.
Snapchat's lens has faced accusations in the past that the app promotes black classification or presents whitened skin tones as a beauty ideal.
So, because of the lens they've been offering this week, which has users with strained eyes, broken teeth and swollen cheeks, some critics have criticized the company for being an "Asian mask" that caricatures Asians.
And they wondered if these recurring disputes were a sign of a larger problem with the company's diversity.
The news and outrage spread with news from The Verge and Motherboard on Wednesday, and a day later Snapchat announced it was removing the feature.
The company issued a statement: The lens was made with respect to anime characters, not to caricature Asians.
But for observers who have experienced racism, this lens has reminded them of painful stereotypes.
Others rejected the anime comparison in general.
Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet about the photos has been widely shared, said in an email that the lens is "painful and uncomfortable at the slightest".
"He added that the debate was difficult when it came to comparing the effects of the Bad Asian cartoon and the filter side by side.
Which means that the filter is not only an Asian mask, but it's an Asian mask at the most humiliating level.
Snapchat is not the only company that has overcome cultural triggers.
American culture, from the boardrooms of corporations to Hollywood to the gadgets we all carry in our hands, seems to be in a constant battle over diversity and inclusion in many areas.
And the broad audience that Snapchat appeals to, the racially diverse audience that Snapchat appeals to, can also be interpreted to expect higher sensitivity.
In an interview on Thursday, 25-year-old Katie Zhu said that when one of Snapchat's lenses creates a humiliating image for a user, "it's much harder to not notice these kinds of actions than it used to be".
On Thursday, Ms. Zhu, a product manager and engineer working for Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and urged everyone to do the same.
In an article for Medium and in a telephone interview, she said she believed that the conflicts over race reflected a lack of diversity in the hiring practices on Snapchat.
Ms. Zhu ended her article with a tag: #SnapchatiSilin, criticizing the company's mostly white male leadership team.
"Either they don't have enough diversity of races among the staff, or they don't feel safe or comfortable enough to talk", said Ms. Zhu, a Chinese-American.
Other observers have also expressed their views on the complaint, which Snapchat has largely left unanswered.
The company doesn't share the diversity figures of its staff, emphasizing its private corporate status.
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to share the racial origins of its staff, but according to a spokesperson, the company recently added a hiring manager to focus on underrepresented populations and increase its inclusion efforts internally.
Ms. Zhu, for her part, said she would keep her Snapchat account closed, adding, "I wonder if they need more users like us to tell them that's not true".
Congressional panel says military officials misrepresented ISIS intelligence
In a report released Thursday, a congressional panel said that U.S. Central Command officials had distorted intelligence reports to paint a more optimistic picture of events on the ground in the fight against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.
An interim report by a working group of Republican board chairs from the House Armed Services Committee, the Intelligence Committee and the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee found "widespread discontent" among Central Command intelligence analysts who said their superiors had changed their assessment of the Islamic State's American forces.
Central Command, known as Centcom, is a military headquarters located in Tampa, Fla., that oversees U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
A news release on the report states: "Intelligence results endorsed by senior Centcom leaders typically paint a more positive picture than the facts on the ground about U.S. counterterrorism efforts, and consistently outperform the analyses produced by other members of the intelligence community".
California Republican Representative Ken Calvert said, "What's happening at Centcom is unacceptable, and our combatant troops are suffering while poor analysis is being presented to higher-level decision makers".
His leadership failures at Centcom have reached the highest levels of the organization.
The 10-page report details the lasting problems in 2014 and 2015 that were part of the Central Command's explanation and analysis of the U.S. efforts to train Iraqi forces.
Although there is no definitive evidence that senior Obama administration officials ordered the reports to be altered, analysts have reportedly felt pressure from Centcom leaders to present a more optimistic view of the threat posed by the Islamic State, also known as ISIS and Daesh.
The report says that "in the first half of 2015, many Central Command press bulletins, statements and congress statements were significantly more positive than actual events".
For example, a Centcom official publicly stated that a major military offensive to retake Mosul could be launched as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, is still under the control of the Islamic State.
Republican Representative Mike Pompeo of Kansas said in a statement that "After months of investigation, this issue has been made very clear".
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the most senior intelligence leaders at the United States Central Command manipulated the commander's intelligence results to make the threat posed by ISIS in Iraq appear insignificant.
Republicans formed a working group after learning analysts had expressed concerns about the manipulation of intelligence on the Islamic State.
As the investigation continues, the report released Thursday will be followed by much more extensive findings.
There is another Centcom intelligence review being conducted by the DOD inspector general.
The Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee released their own findings on Thursday, which were included in some of the conclusions reached by the Republican working group.
Representative Adam B. Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the committee, said in a statement that "between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created a highly narrow process in its intelligence assessments of ISIS and the Iraqi Security Forces".
According to Mr. Schiff, this process "delayed the release of intelligence results", led to demoralization among analysts, and "did not allow sufficient room for conflicting opinions".
But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats have said they have found no evidence that the White House pressured Centcom analysts into making up the findings of a "pre-determined or political narrative".
The preliminary results of the congressional inquiry were announced by the Daily Beast on Tuesday.
Last August, the New York Times reported that a Pentagon inspector general review had been opened following complaints by Centcom analysts.
Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that the Department of Defense would not comment on the congressional report while the inspector general's review is ongoing.
But he said that "experts may disagree on the interpretation of complex data in certain circumstances, and that the intelligence community and the Department of Defense support healthy dialogue on these important national security issues".
The investigation will resonate beyond the question of whether the American-led bombing operation in Iraq and Syria is still going on (a claim that is being raised by more and more defense officials every day).
But accusations made last year have raised questions about how much President Obama can trust Central Command to make honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other hot spots.
Criticism of the Islamic State's intelligence coverage began when Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker wrote an article arguing that the administration of President George W. Bush had not given enough thought to the post-2003 invasion of Iraq, despite the objections of many analysts.
Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the Islamic State intelligence-related insurgency.
Officials have concluded that despite public statements to the contrary by Mr. Hooker's team last year, the airstrikes against refineries held by the Islamic State have had no significant impact on the terrorist group's financial resources, as they built makeshift refineries to sell oil on the black market.
But as The Times reported in September, the findings have not been made outside of Central Command.
The statement by General Lloyd J. Austin III, then commander of Centcom, in the Senate last year was criticized by many lawmakers as a highly positive assessment of the war.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel in the Central Command.
The U.S. women's field hockey team, preparing to face Great Britain, has won four straight.
Katie Bam scored the first two goals for the United States women's field hockey team in Thursday's 3-0 win over India, a day after she scored three goals in a 6-1 win over Japan.
Although five goals in two matches seemed to require a lasting mastery of the mind, Bam, 27, said he was not sure he had done the same thing before.
He said, "I have no idea".
I'm not one of those people who keeps track of their goals.
What he knows is that the Americans are 4-0 up in the Olympic tournament and sharing the lead with Great Britain, who are undefeated after beating Japan 2-0 on Thursday.
Great Britain and the United States will face off on Saturday in the final game of the first round.
Both teams have earned the right to go through to the quarter-finals, and the match will determine who will finish first and second in the six-team group.
The team that finishes first in the group will not face the strong Dutch team, the leader of another group, for a little longer when the quarter-finals begin.
But after Saturday's match, the Americans made a sensational improvement here after finishing last out of 12 teams at the London Olympics.
Bam was on this team.
He grew up in Blue Bell, Pa., where he first picked up a field hockey stick at age 3 (his twin sister was involved with the sport at Drexel) and made the national team at age 16, becoming the youngest player on the team.
Missed the 2008 Olympics because he didn't make the final roster.
Then came 2012, when most things didn't go well for him and his teammates.
The next year, an English coach, Craig Parnham, was brought in and things started to change.
Bam says it is "a cultural change, a mental change, a physical change".
We don't work like we do in London anymore.
We've been through a complete transformation.
Thursday night, Bam took the first number of the first half with a close-up reverse.
India had not yet won the tournament, but the team showed a surprising level of endurance and managed to keep the score 1-0 until the third quarter, when Bam came on.
He made a long run with the ball from the left side of the field and then curled up in the middle and threw the ball into the goal and led the Americans 2-0.
Melissa Gonzales scored the final touchdown late in the fourth quarter.
This was the first tournament game in which United States goalkeeper Jackie Briggs, who had allowed one goal in his first three victories, was not on the field.
He's got a shot.
So is Bam's.
Parnham said, "We're in a good place right now", but how good that place is depends on the result of Saturday's game.
The Trampoline Dinginess in the Midst of the Olympic Trials
Wherever you are, whatever the time, the Olympics are on.
The events in Rio de Janeiro represent a competition of ambition and work that seems to be endless and inescapable.
The Olympic torch itself is like a flaming baton passed from swimmer to gymnast to triathlete.
You can't watch TV, you can't read a newspaper, or you can't sit in a coffee shop and listen to your neighbor talk about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley, who's the guy.
Mr. Dooley, who is making his Olympic debut, may be one of the names on prime time television that, among sponsorships and TV commercials that advise you to feel good, is a heartbeat-soothing, like a swimmer, a gymnast, or a fencer.
But Mr. Dooley, 28, of Lake Forest, California, is fighting for the gold medal in trampoline at the Olympics.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate all events equally.
Away from the center, in the shadows, are sports that are not universally recognized: air rifle shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
The frog will always be with us, and may it be for a long time.
But to name my personal favorite, I'd like to point out the hidden magic of the trampoline.
Although trampolining has been recognized as an Olympic event since its introduction at the Sydney Games in 2000, very few people I've interviewed in the 16 years since have realized that it's an Olympic sport.
It could be regional ignorance.
The United States, although sending athletes to compete, has never won a medal in trampolining and did not have a competitor reach the finals until 2012.
The men tended to share the prizes with the Chinese and the Russians, and the women with the Chinese and the Canadians.
China's Dong Dong and Canada's Rosie MacLennan will try to defend their gold medals in London this year.
But trampoline is gaining attention as a rather humiliating activity, perhaps in part because unconscious ears think it deserves clown school instead of the Olympics.
I must confess I'm not an expert here, just interested in the subject.
It has a comic potential (like the cartoon-like shake created by the never-ending jump) but it also reflects the elegance of gymnastics and diving, two sports that it essentially combines.
The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish el trampolin, which means "trampoline".
The champion candidates jump almost 30 feet into the air on a large trampoline and are asked to perform a series of movements (burkma, pike and salto) before landing on their feet.
They are judged according to the official Olympic program on performance, difficulty and "flight time".
Thirty-two athletes, 16 men and 16 women, from 17 countries will compete in Rio.
The most common progression at the Olympics is the straight forward.
Those who hope to win a medal must go farther, faster and higher in their quest for gold, sometimes to the finish line, sometimes backwards, up and down.
They're not just chasing the finish line or the starting wall, but there's another challenging line on TV: the world or Olympic record.
This determined effort is noble, admirable and even extreme enough to drown even an audience in tears.
But that's exactly the kind of thing I find a little tiring when watching the Games.
The trampoline gives you a break from all this.
The trampoline is moving upwards.
Their goal is not forward movement.
It jumps up, looks weightless like an astronaut, goes up, goes down, and comes back up again effortlessly.
Of course, there's no competition or challenge, but there's a routine, a frantic effort to get to the end, no disappearing into the distance, just an elegant suspension of time and space, like a dream.
The more calm an Olympic event can be, the more calm it can be.
The women's qualifying round and then the final will take place on Friday afternoon at 1:00 Eastern time; the men's on Saturday at 1:00.
NBC will air the finale on both days in the afternoon block, starting at 2:00 p.m.
Right in the middle of the Olympic frenzy, they promise a quiet and wonderful moment that can be ignored in the general ardor.
And if the consciousness of the United States is to increase by presenting male athletes as the male gymnasts have recently suggested, to just look at and objectify, according to The Wall Street Journal, then we can say that Mr. Dooley is waiting for his new fans.
In Ethiopia, a longtime ally of the United States, "A Generation in Protest"
Violent Protests in Ethiopia
In Ethiopia, protesters demanding political change have been met with fierce resistance from the government.
Witnesses say a number of protesters have received fatal gunshots in clashes with police.
Ethiopia is about to fall?
Over the past decade, it had become one of Africa's most stable nations and a solid ally for the West with its rapidly growing economy.
But in recent months, anti-government protests have spread to more and more areas, shaking the country.
In the last week alone, thousands of people took to the streets demanding fundamental political change.
According to human rights groups, the government's response to this has been quite brutal.
Witnesses said that police officers shot and killed many unarmed demonstrators.
Footage of the protest, believed to be from late last year or early this year, shows security officials whipping youths who are forced to put their hands against a wall.
The top UN human rights official is now calling for a full investigation.
"It's always been difficult to keep this country together, and it's going to be much harder to move forward", said Rashid Abdi, the Somali Peninsula project director for the International Crisis Group, a research group.
Ethiopia is the second most populous nation in Africa after Nigeria, and its stability is appreciated by the West.
The US military and intelligence services are working closely with the Ethiopians to combat the regional terrorist threat, particularly Somalia, and few countries in Africa have received such Western assistance.
Ethiopia's economy is growing at an impressive rate.
Its infrastructure has been effectively improved; a new commuter train is even available in the capital Addis Ababa.
And their streets are generally quiet, safe and clean.
Although Ethiopia did not display the best example of democracy (human rights groups constantly cite the repressive attitude of the government), domestic opposition was fairly limited, with dissent effectively silenced.
Many were exiled, imprisoned, killed, or driven to the most remote corners of the wilderness.
But that may be about to change.
Seyoum Teshome, a university lecturer from central Ethiopia, said, "If you suffocate people and give them no choice but to protest, these things happen".
The youth are in full protest.
A generation in protest.
There are many complaints, from land use to the pressure that the ruling coalition is putting on power.
After last year's highly controversial election, the ruling party and its allies have taken the last opposition seat and now control 100 percent of Parliament.
At the same time, tensions are rising on the border with Eritrea, a sharp and contentious line that led to a war in June that left hundreds dead.
Analysts fear that separatist groups like the Oromo Freedom Front or the Ogaden National Freedom Front, which have been disappearing in recent years, will rearm using this turbulence.
There are several factors that explain why the bitter feelings that have been simmering beneath the surface for years are now exploding.
The first one seems innocent: smartphones.
As cheap smartphones became more common and internet service became available, only a few years ago, large numbers of Ethiopians began to communicate using social media.
Even when the government shut down access to Facebook and Twitter, as it often did during protests, most people could communicate through proxies that concealed their locations.
Several young Ethiopians said they gathered in this way for the protests.
Second, there was also increased solidarity between the Oromo and Amhara, Ethiopia's two largest ethnic groups.
The Oromo and the Amhara are not normally allies.
For a long time, the Amhara of the predominantly Christian highlands of Ethiopia had been prominent in politics and business, exploiting the Oromo, who were mostly Muslim and lived on the plains.
But that's changing, too.
"We are moving towards gathering under one umbrella and cooperating", said Mulatu Gemechu, an Oromo leader.
The largest protests were in the Amhara and Oromo regions.
Most Amhara and Oromo feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the Tigrayan ethnic group, who make up about 6 percent of the population and dominate the army, intelligence services, commerce and politics.
The third reason behind the unrest was the death of Meles Zenawi.
Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, served as Ethiopia's prime minister for 17 years until his death in 2012 from an undisclosed illness.
He was thought to be a tactical genius, seeing what no one else could see.
Analysts say he's particularly adept at detecting the first signs of anxiety and discouraging and neutralizing opponents.
Mr. Abdi, a conflict analyst, said, "The current regime does not have this basic knowledge".
Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was elected in relative uncertainty to replace Mr. Meles.
Unlike Mr. Meles, who hails from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam is from the south.
Analysts say he has failed to win the trust of the security services, which are controlled by Tigrayans.
The result was more fear and more bloodshed.
Ethiopia's most recent experience with this kind of mess was in 2005, when thousands of people protested after analysts said the government had stolen money from a rigged election.
In the ensuing measures, many protesters were killed, although less than the previous month, and this period of turmoil passed relatively quickly.
Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for visionary infrastructure planning such as the new commuter train and for their remarkable progress in fighting poverty.
But it's clear that this has not stopped the growing resentment against the Ethiopian government.
And it's getting dangerous and ethnic.
Last month, protesters in Gondar, an Amhara town, attacked businesses owned by Tigrayans, and Tigrayan hatred is also increasing on social media.
Analysts say the protests have left the United States and other Western allies in a strange position.
The U.S. government used Ethiopia as a base for unmanned aerial vehicle flights over neighboring Somalia, but it was recently reported that the base was shut down.
The West wants to support democracy openly, but it doesn't want to see its ally in a fragile region fall apart.
Mr. Abdi said, "It's like walking on a very thin rope".
Donald Trump has described Obama's claim that he founded ISIS as "mockery"
Donald J. Trump on Friday tried to defuse the latest controversy surrounding his campaign by insisting that he wasn't serious when he claimed several times in the past week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the Islamic State terror group.
This statement has raised new questions about the Republican presidential candidate's ability to communicate openly with the American people.
He also put his deputies, who had done everything in their power to defend him in this confusing process, in a strange position as they tried to explain the statement that he had implied that this was not the case.
Mr. Trump, after making this suggestion at a rally on Wednesday night, reinforced his thesis on Thursday, insisting in interviews that the president and Mrs. Clinton were actually implying that he founded ISIS.
But in a tweet early Friday morning, Mr. Trump said he was only making a sarcastic statement.
The broadcast showed Mr. Trump taking a complete step back from the day before when he said in a series of interviews that he was serious about this accusation.
When conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt tried to help Mr. Trump soften his comments by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate said he didn't believe it.
Mr. Trump's latest turmoil comes as he tries to shift the focus of his campaign after a slump in the polls.
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton made conflicting speeches about the economy this week in Michigan.
On Friday, Mr. Trump wanted to get back to this.
He also tweeted that he found Mrs. Clinton's proposal to raise taxes boring.
Mr. Trump has used the sarcastic defense before.
In late July, after facing strong criticism after the Russians appeared to be advocating the hacking of Ms. Clinton's emails, he explained his comments by saying, "Of course I said that in a derogatory way".
This approach allows Mr. Trump to push the boundaries of political discourse and to step back where necessary.
Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who has tracked the language used by both candidates, said, "It's a system that allows it to 'explain' in a way that tests how certain messages are received by its supporters, depending on the response".
But he also makes these statements knowingly, and he knows that when viewed through different lenses, they're too vague to be filtered.
After falling in the polls in recent days, Mr. Trump has taken a much more aggressive stance rather than softening the mood for the general election crowd.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll released on Friday showed Mr. Trump trailing Mrs. Clinton in North Coraline, Virginia and Colorado, and a tight race in Florida.
Although Mr. Trump usually avoids apologizing for provocative remarks, he has accused critics of misrepresenting him or misrepresenting his humor.
But Mr. Trump, who has been the subject of much scrutiny in the final months of his presidential campaign, has left his loyal supporters in a difficult position, despite his provocative jokes and comments.
Former New York City mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, one of Mr. Trump's most prominent supporters, spoke out in favor of the candidate in an interview with CNN on Thursday.
When asked about the veracity of Mr. Trump's claim that Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State, Mr. Giuliani said, "I think he's making a legitimate, political criticism".
In a sense, before Obama, ISIS was a small, unknown organization, and those who liked them were completely wrong, and that's because of the withdrawal of troops from Iraq.
Most Republicans who have come forward argue that the Obama administration, under which Mrs. Clinton served as secretary of state, failed to deal aggressively with the situation in the Middle East, and that it was the result of the growth of ISIS.
Ahead of the rallies in Pennsylvania on Friday, Trump continues to accuse the news media on Twitter of distorting his every word and biasing against him.
"They can't do that!" he said, mocking the "poor, pathetic" television experts who were trying to solve it.
Some Democrats have derided Mr. Trump's assertion that this is evidence that he is unfit to be president.
The Cafe That Never Was With Prices is Back in Greenpoint
The Verb Cafe, a cash-only, old-school place in Williamsburg, even though it didn't offer Wi-Fi, it did serve great coffee for 15 years.
Naturally, he couldn't cope with the prices at his store on Bedford Avenue.
In the summer of 2014, the store that replaced Verb sold soap in the form of soap cherries and cupcakes.
The residents of the area lamented that this was the last loss of the civilized city.
Artist Molly Crabapple tweeted, "New York is change, I know that, but I still can't believe that CBGB is gone and the Chelsea Hotel is empty and the Verb is no longer a soap store".
But New York is as much a city of change as it is of re-invention.
Last November, a newly renovated Verb Cafe opened up north of Greenpoint, less than a mile from its original location.
The new Verb Cafe has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards but retains some of its old staff and similarly simple atmosphere.
Coffee's still good.
The new Verb is led by Cisco Rodriguez, longtime employee of the old café and owner and general manager of the new location.
He joined the Verb in 2001 and stayed till the end.
When a client offered him financing for this new place, he said he'd be excited to do it.
Mr. Rodriguez, 36, left most of it the same.
Verb uses the same distributor for the cupcakes and bought an espresso machine of the same model.
Even the lights of the old Verb have been reused here.
But Mr. Rodriguez said he wanted to offer a different experience.
He added new ingredients.
Bacon-egg-and-cheese sandwiches are on the menu, and ingredients such as capers and pickled onions are also served.
They have emerald-pine mushrooms.
The cafe no longer serves beer, but it does serve fresh juices.
Nine months later, Mr. Rodriguez said he noticed that the old demons were coming back in a steady way.
He said, "A lot of our old customers couldn't handle the prices in Williamsburg".
Last Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was one of those customers.
Mrs. Oliveira, 34, lives in Williamsburg and used to come to the Verb a lot.
He didn't stop going after he moved to Greenpoint.
He said he took a coffee break for a while after Verb went down.
"I found out that what I love is the coffee and the culture in the Verb", he said.
Now he's drinking coffee again, but the other day he's opted for a new tea blend with a new additive instead of his regular iced coffee.
Another attorney, Tom Rosenthal, has been a regular at Verb since 2003.
He goes there before work and always gives the same order.
"Every day, at quarter past seven, I would walk in without hesitation and they would make my daily order of butter buns".
Mr. Rodriguez said he wanted to make some changes and add new ingredients to the menu.
Now, while Mr. Rosenthal is still getting his usual order, he sometimes adds a little variation to his daily basket order of bacon, eggs and cheese.
Mr. Rodriguez said he wasn't upset about the soap shop that replaced the old place.
In fact, the owners of Soap Cherie have offered to make a special soap for Verb using the cafe's cold brew coffee.
Mr. Rodriguez said, "I think we can still accept this offer".
And the traditional Polish residents of Greenpoint have embraced this cafe.
One of the new customers translated the menu into Polish, and Mr. Rodriguez said he'd soon find a place to display the menu so that his new neighbors could feel comfortable, too.
There are other advantages to your new position.
The local juice store wants to bottle and sell cold brew coffee.
There's a chance the cafe could be expanded to the building next door.
For most customers, it's enough to have a new Verb available to find their old favorites.
Joseph Whitt was a regular and he was very upset after the place closed.
When the new place opened, Mr. Whitt said that just going in and getting coffee made him feel at home.
"I had to smell this", he said.
"A Square Meal" is the book Depressive Food in a Time of Crisis.
In March of 1933, shortly after taking office, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down for lunch in the Oval Office.
President Roosevelt, a voracious eater, loved the fancy Fifth Avenue foods, such as goose liver paste and Maryland turtle soup.
The menu that day was much more modest: boiled eggs with tomato sauce, mashed potatoes, and, for dessert, a dry-cob pudding.
Jane Ziegelman said, "It was an act of solidarity with those who were suffering, about food".
His wife, Andrew Coe, added: "It was also a message to the American people about how they should eat".
Couple from Brooklyn Heights, food historians.
Mr. Coe's last book, "Chop Suey", was about Chinese cuisine in America, and Ms. Ziegelman's book, "97 Orchard", was about life in the Lower East Side slum through food.
Their new book, which they're working on together, and which will be published by Harper's on Tuesday, is called "A Square Meal", which tells the story of American food during the Great Depression.
They also showed solidarity with food, and met a reporter for dinner at the Eisenberg Sandwich Buffet in the Flatiron District, which has been around since 1929, the year the crisis began.
Mrs. Ziegelman (54) ordered a sandwich with cream cheese and olives, while Mr. Coe (57) preferred to have turkey, mashed potatoes and vegetables.
The couple found the reporter's meatball order appropriate for the discussion of the crisis-era meals.
"The salmon was very popular", said Miss Ziegelman.
It was peanut butter, liver butter, dry beans.
They were made of a material and a cheap material-emitting substance.
Imagine you've had enough peanuts for dinner.
Mr. Coe, he's got a little face.
"It must have settled in the stomach of a man like a bullet".
In the years before the crisis, especially in rural areas, the American table was an open-air buffet.
The women cooked meals for the men working on the farm, and freshly baked pies were served for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
Americans were sending food to Europeans who were starving to death in World War I. "A Square Meal" explains the history of how the nation coped with suddenly being no longer a center of abundance.
Mr. Coe explained why he and his wife wanted to write about it: "This was a time when food became a central, worrying issue for Americans".
The new budget regime was equally alarming: Mystery foods like sausages and stews became staples, with "stews being a great way to evaluate leftovers", Ms. Ziegelman said, so cooks could hide appetizing ingredients underneath a creamy sauce coating.
Fresh fruits were replaced by dried fruits, which were cheaper.
For years, meat, at the center of American cuisine, has become a luxury that is rationed.
Interesting blends were tried for calories and nutritional value, and the sense of satisfaction overcame taste or the general understanding of cuisine.
While Mrs. Ziegelman was researching her book of recipes, she prepared a baked onion dish with peanut butter, typical of the period.
Mr. Coe said, "This was not a welcome addition to the dinner table".
Ms. Ziegelman backed that up, "It was a real thing".
Peanut butter has nothing in common with baked onions.
It was a prominent feature of most home economics definitions.
Home economists, including Louise Stanley, the head of the Federal Home Economics Bureau, between 1923 and 1943, shaped the nation's eating habits like never before.
They published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines to encourage women to be "productive" and spread the fight to turn concoctions like carrot-cream spaghetti into delicious food.
A Square Meal is a feast of historical delicacies.
The response of the government to the hungry citizens, like President Herbert Hoover's "I'll have a cake", is extremely appetizing.
While he was celebrating the simple farming meals of his Iowa childhood, he was eating the same meals as the millionaire intellectual he had become.
Mr. Coe said, "He liked to eat European delicacies like fish in a sauce".
He ate his meals in a dining room almost entirely covered in gold, wearing jackets to match his evening meals.
It was so far from the truth.
If his wife, Eleanor, hadn't encouraged him to be an example with his stomach, President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake.
The book says that when Mrs. Roosevelt hired an assistant who had no taste for taste, the White House began to serve "not only the saddest food, but also the most dreadfully prepared dishes" ever prepared.
After the country got back on its feet, many of the crisis-era cooking methods were abandoned.
According to Ms. Ziegelman, the understanding of calorie and nutrition and the way science is applied to cooking continues.
The couple stated that while writing the book, they learned a lot from Ms. Ziegelman's mother's eating habits - for example, she could never throw away food.
Mr. Coe said, "The food was really scaring him".
Mrs. Ziegelman said of her memories, "There were times when people actually got sick".
There was a case of the cream donut.
After the plates were collected at Eisenberg, he and Mr. Coe brought out a home-made dessert: the dried-pickle dessert that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
"It's called the chopped prune", Ms. Ziegelman said, adding that the most commonly used trick was to give these humble recipes a cool name.
There was no whipped cream, just dried plum, some flour, sugar, water, and cinnamon.
Everyone hesitated and dipped their spoon in the brown glue.
Surprisingly, it wasn't too bad.
Mr. Coe took the second and third spoons.
"A little bit of chopped walnuts would be nice", he said to his wife, like a man who could save.
Gilead will receive attorney fees in the Merck-Hepatitis C patent battle.
A U.S. district judge has ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc. has won the right to receive attorneys' fees in a patent case against drugmaker Merck & Co Inc. over its hepatitis C patent.
After a U.S. judge found Merck guilty of a series of misdemeanors, including perjury and other unethical practices, Gilead was ordered in June to pay $200 million in damages for violating two Merck patents related to Gilead's breakthrough drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni.
At the hearing on Thursday, U.S. District Judge Beth Labson Freeman ruled that Gilead was entitled to compensation for the costs incurred during the defense of the case.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, the market leader, with a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can treat more than 90 percent of liver patients.
The case stems from a 2013 lawsuit between Gilead and Merck over the ownership of laboratory studies for sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in Gilead's medicines.
US-backed forces claimed that Memphis was completely taken from Islamic State control.
On Friday, a spokesman for the group said that US-backed forces had fully captured the northern city of Memphis, near the Turkish border, from the last Islamic State fighters inside the city.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) is in the process of cleaning the city after a group of militants who remained hidden in the city were also separated.
Sharfan Dervish of the Membich Military Council, which is allied with the SDG, told Reuters that they have released more than 2,000 civilian hostages held by the militants.
"The city is now completely under our control, but we are conducting cleanup operations", he told Routers.
The Clintons made $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2% in federal income taxes.
Hillary Clinton on Friday released her 2015 tax returns, which show the Democratic presidential nominee and his wife earned $10.75 million last year and paid federal taxes at the current rate of 34.2 percent.
In 2015, the Clintons contributed $1 million to charities, mostly the Clinton Foundation, former President Bill Clinton earned about $5.3 million in speaking fees, and the former secretary of state reported $3 million in Simon & Schuster book revenue for his time in the State Department.
Clinton's running mate, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, and his wife Anne Holton have released their 10-year tax returns.
They paid 20.3 percent in federal taxes in 2015.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set the standard for financial transparency", Clinton campaign official Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
In contrast, Donald Trump is hiding behind false promises to declare his tax returns and backsliding.
It is customary for US presidential candidates to make their tax returns public, even though the law does not require it.
Trump and his lawyers, a New York businessman, have stated that the reason for the denial of the statements was an audit conducted by the Internal Revenue Service.
In connection with the Democratic candidate's remarks, Clinton campaign official Ian Sams tweeted "Your turn".
On Thursday, Trump's special counsel, Michael Cohen, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to air these until the audits were complete.
The group, which criticized Trump in 2012 and included Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republicans, said the rejection raised questions about his own self-interest, his contributions to charities, his business dealings and many other connections, including with Russia.
Clinton went on the record on Friday, releasing an online video showing top Republicans pressuring Trump to declare his taxes.
He raised this issue in an economic speech in Michigan on Thursday.
He told the crowd, "For decades, he's refused to do what every presidential candidate has done, which is to publish his tax returns".
Politico reported that Trump paid almost no taxes for two years in the 1990s, and on Friday, a New York Times business columnist shared statements from a number of tax attorneys and accountants that the situation may still be that way.
Federal tax rates have become a major issue in the presidential election.
Clinton introduced a bill named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett that would tax those making over $1 million a year at least 30 percent.
President Obama is endorsing this proposal.
Last week, at a Clinton rally in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, who runs the Berkshire Hathaway group, challenged Trump to come and file his tax returns.
Buffett said he was also under IRS scrutiny and that Trump was "afraid" of the voters, not the IRS.
Clinton released his campaign tax returns up to 2007.
The Clintons, who currently live in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average federal tax rate of approximately 32 percent between 2007 and 2014, and the consolidated tax rate is approximately 40.5 percent.
The Clintons' 2015 tax returns show that, unlike most Americans, their income comes from wages of only $100.
Its principal investment is a low-cost index fund, and the Clintons have declared $109,000 in dividends and interest.

Red powder condoms, chestnut fireworks support elephant conservation in Tanzania
Conservationists in Tanzania use an unusual method to keep elephants out of human settlements - they throw condoms full of powdered red pepper at them.
The method has proven effective, and a few years ago, the Honeyguide Foundation and the U.S.-based Nature Conservation Union, which came up with the idea, stepped in to promote it, training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use the non-violent, four-step method of preserving their homes and crops without harming animals.
Before, most people used spears for self-defense.
Friday is World Elephant Day, dedicated to animal protection.
Damian Bell, managing director of Honeyguide, said in a statement, "Since we developed the set of vehicles, we have seen a change in the attitude of these communities; they are now more confident that they can keep elephants off their lands without harming them".
The first two steps involve holding the passing torch and blowing the horn.
When this is not possible, what is called a red pepper cloud is thrown.
The powdered red pepper is mixed with soil, and a condom is placed with a chestnut torch, only the tip is closed so that the flea remains open.
When it burns, the condom opens with a loud pop and sprays red pepper powder into the air.
One breath is enough to send the elephants in the opposite direction.
The last resort is to use a hand grenade that shoots a flare into the air, causing a loud, bright explosion.
Jewish filmmaker shoots down hotel in Berlin that removed Israel's phone code on "demand" of Arabs - RT News
A French filmmaker of Jewish origin caused a media sensation after he revealed that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not list the telephone code of Israel and that the employee had "requested" the "demands" of the Arab customers.
Claude Lanzmann, one of the authors of the documentary "Shoah" on the genocide, expressed his anger at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin in an open letter to the German broadcasting body FAZ.
Lanzmann tried to find Israel in the phone codes the hotel had provided him during his recent stay.
But the country was not among the states that could be called directly from the room.
How can Israel be excluded and destroyed in the capital of the new Germany, Berlin, in 2016?
It was Lanzmann.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers the ability to call Israel through its call center.
The filmmaker reported the situation to the hotel reception to get an explanation.
Lanzmann wrote that the response he received "shocked him".
The hotel secretary said that the measure was taken "by a deliberate decision of the management of Kempinski-Hotels".
The underlying reason for this move made the filmmaker even more angry.
Lanzmann notes that the employee said, "Most of our guests asked for the Arab and Israeli code to be erased".
According to the Suddeutsche Zeitung, Israel's ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, described the situation as "a great shame".
This was a shock and a surprise.
This is a real shame.
It's a far greater scandal that this happened in Germany and in a hotel chain like this.
It doesn't need to be explained.
We expect the hotel to draw the necessary conclusions from this", the official said.
The incident sparked a huge online response, with people calling it a scandal.
Some have accused the Kempinski Hotel of "bowing" to the so-called demands of its Arab customers.
Another message said "You should be ashamed" and emphasized that the hotel was located on Kurfurstendamm Street near a synagogue.
Der Spiegel reports that the hotel quickly dismissed the accusations, saying the incident was the result of "negligence" and "apologizing" to Lanzmann.
Suddeutsche Zeitung quoted one of Kempinski's representatives as saying that "there was never a direct order to not include Israel in the fast-track list".
And he said they've added the code now.
Police use pepper gas and plastic bullets against Brazilian student protesters
Students gathered in Sao Paulo, Brazil, on Thursday to protest against government reforms to the public education system, clashing with police.
Police used pepper spray and plastic bullets against the protesters.
The problem started when the security officers tried to disperse the students, which led to the police using plastic bullets and pepper spray.
Hundreds of students joined the demonstration to express their dissatisfaction with the plans.
Under the proposal of the governor of Sao Paulo, Geraldo Alckmin, fewer than 100 public schools will be closed and 300,000 students will be transferred to other schools in order to save money.
Some of the protesters were seen writing against interim President Michel Temer on the walls.
This latest protest comes just days after protesters took to the streets in droves to support ousted President Dilma Rousseff, who was voted out of office by the country's senate.
Trade between Russia and Iran rose to 71% - RT Business
According to Russia's ambassador to Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan, with the lifting of sanctions, trade turnover between Moscow and Tehran grew by 70.9 percent year-on-year.
The ambassador said that since the lifting of international sanctions against Iran, the interest of Russian companies doing business in the country has increased significantly.
While new companies are preparing to gain access to the market, Russian companies are maintaining existing ties with Iran.
Of course, further increase of trade is one of the main priorities of our bilateral cooperation with Iran", Dzhagaryan said.
In the first five months of 2016, the trade turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and reached 856 million dollars, he said.
In particular, Russia's exports to Iran increased by 91.5 percent to 697 million dollars.
Russia's imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $158 million.
This increase in trade was made possible by the machinery, ground vehicles and the materials for the weapons".
Dzhagaryan also expects a record number of Iranian tourists to visit Russia this year.
Last year, Russia's diplomatic mission in Iran issued 35,000 visas to Iranian citizens, mostly for travel.
Also, for the first time, Iran was among the top 20 countries in the number of tourists visiting Russia.
We can say that the record of Iranian tourists visiting Russia last year will be broken".
At the same time, relatively fewer Russians are visiting Iran, a theme that the ambassador hopes will change.
"I personally recommend a visit to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yezd, where the monuments of the ancient Persian civilization are preserved in good condition", he said.
Cash to FETÖ from Izmir - Economy News
Interesting details about Abdullah Kavuklar Group Chairman and Ahmet Küçükbay Chairman of the Board of Directors of Küçükbay Group, who were detained for providing financial support to FETO, began to emerge.
It was established that FETO's financial sources No. 1 and 2 in Izmir, Küçükbay and Kavuk regularly send large amounts of money to FETO/PDY leader Fethullah Gülen by courier every month.
It was found that the money sent to Gülen was not deposited through banks, but sent by courier of the organization member.
On the other hand, nine people were detained in Amasya in connection with the investigation into the FETO coup attempt, sent to court and among them the President of the Merzifon Chamber of Commerce and Industry Fatih Altınay, and seven were released on the condition of judicial control.
30 thousand lira in 10 years
The call of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to "put down the firewall" has made the banks move.
It was proposed that banks should be included in the campaign initiated by Imlak Konut and later by GYODER.
The proposal to reduce the housing loan interest rates below 1 percent, which is considered a psychological limit, was also made by President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
13 banks have lowered their mortgage rates to below 1%.
It was the public banks that started the discounting frenzy.
With the latest regulation, the consumer who uses a 10-year term housing loan will pay between 15 and 30 billion TL less interest, based on monthly interest rates that previously varied between 1.12 and 1.29 percent.
I 'm not going to lie to you .
And how much advantage will the interest rebates bring to home buyers?
A person using a 10 year term loan of 100,000 lira will benefit from the interest rate reduction of 30,000 lira.
The vast majority of mortgage borrowers choose a five- to ten-year term repayment plan.
Interest rates are expected to fall further in the coming days.
The interest rate cut will also have a positive effect on sales.
In 2015, housing sales increased by 10.6 percent compared to the previous year, to 1,289,000.
This year, sales are expected to exceed 1.5 million at a discount.
GYODER President Aziz Torun: Annual interest rate should be reduced to below 9 percent
The public banks are going for a discount.
They took our president's call and lowered the interest.
But that rate must fall below 9 percent per year.
If this discount continues, we're considering extending the 0.70 percent monthly campaign we've started for a few months.
The campaign could be extended for three months
The banks' participation in this attempt to bring vitality to the economy, which we have limited to one month, could extend the duration of this historic campaign for at least another 3-4 months.
But the interest rates on loans need to be brought down to below 9 percent on an annualized basis.
And it's just the housing sector and the positive psychology that it's going to create in the real estate market and the unprecedented solidarity that every sector is making in the housing of citizens.
Polat Holding YKB Adnan Polat: We expect full support from the banks
It's a good move for them to go on the president's call to the banks for a discount.
Apart from that, there are a number of steps being taken to revive the economy in all sectors.
The campaigns of NGOs, the decision of the Central Bank and all the steps taken in this direction for the country...
All banks need to put their hands under the stone.
We say to them, come, join this campaign, walk with us, walk with us, let's give life to the economy.
5.5 billion TL investment from Sabancı in 1.5 years
Sabancı Holding increased its net profit by 11 percent to 1 billion 353 million lira in the first six months of this year, and its sales increased by 22 percent to 17 billion 166 million lira.
Sabancı Holding's Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Zafer Kurtul said that in the first six months of the year, they invested 1.8 billion TL, and since the beginning of 2015 until today, they have invested about 5.5 billion lira.
Kurtul, "As a nation, we have successfully passed through a difficult period in recent times".
"From now on, it's time for our country to work and produce more".
Two years off from Kabataş for a boat ride
Due to the "Kabataş Square Arrangement, Transfer Center and Renewal of the Piers" project, carried out by the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality (İBB), the Kabataş steamship piers have been closed to sea traffic for about two years.
A modern transfer center will be built on the coast of Kabataş, integrating sea, rail and road transport.
Traffic will be underground, allowing uninterrupted foot traffic along the coast.
The tram and funicular systems will continue to operate for a while.
Ring drives will be launched to ensure the citizens' access to the areas of Taksim, Eminönü, Beşiktaş.
The interest rate went down, the house went up.
A friend of mine, a manager at a community bank, texted me.
It's always the same.
Interest rates are falling, house prices are going up.
Interest rates are going up, housing prices are going down.
"Look, it's happened again".
He's talking about his feelings about his work in personal loans.
He says that the contractors who entered the 0.70 percent campaign organized by Real Estate have raised prices on many housing projects.
I was looking for a little bit of truth.
There's a lack of context, there's no more sex...
I remembered a conversation with a contractor who attended a construction summit organized by our newspaper a week after the July 15 coup attempt by the Fethullahist Terrorist Organization.
The boss of a big firm...
When I heard the contractor, who I won't name, saying, "You should actually increase the prices by 10 percent", I said, "Are you going to take a double opportunity?"
After the coup attempt, the campaign led by Emlak Konut, the builders launched a large sales campaign with 0.70 percent and 120 months' maturity.
I'll admit, he put his hand under the rock before the banks, took the risk.
But we are acting in a spirit of unity and solidarity so as not to slow down the pace of Turkey.
Your one-month campaign was supported by banks with interest-free loans.
Then let no one take the chance of a raise.
And warn those of you who are workers.
President Erdoğan received Koç and Ali Koç
President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan received Koç Holding Chairman of the Board of Directors Ömer Mehmet Koç and Koç Holding Deputy Chairman of the Board of Directors and Ford Otosan Chairman of the Board of Directors Ali Koç.
Erdogan's reception, which took place behind closed doors in the Presidential Palace, lasted 40 minutes.
Call from BDDK: Complain those banks
Mehmet Ali Akben, Chairman of the Banking Regulation and Supervision Authority (BDDK), made a statement regarding President Erdoğan's warning of "credit recall" to banks.
Akben, "If banks turn the loan recall into an opportunism due to the market conditions and do it with different actions, we certainly do not allow this".
We say to those who bring such complaints and information to us, 'Refer to the BDDK complaint line by giving names in the bank and company database'.
President Tayyip Erdogan warned banks in a statement yesterday: "I say that when interest rates fall, and the credit opportunities are expanded, a new era will open for both our country and investors and our banks".
I want to announce that the banks that refuse to lend at this time in our country, with false excuses, have decided to call back the loans.
And the banks made money on this when the interest rates were 7 to 8 percent per year.
More than 500,000 Russian tourists are expected
Ali Kızıldağ, President of the Professional Hotel Managers Association (POYD), stated that Turkey-Russia relations had entered a positive path before the coup attempt on July 15, tariffed flights from Russia to Antalya had started and there was a certain revival in tourism.
"I expect very positive developments in terms of both tourism and agriculture, from food to construction to textiles", Kızıldağ said, adding that the meeting between President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Russian President Vladimir Putin has excited the tourism sector as well as the sectors that trade between the two countries.
Turkey and Russia are two very close countries, we have traditional relations based on years.
"I think that if we as sectors make very fast progress on this path that the leaders of the two countries have opened, we can close the gaps immediately and move towards the goals".
If there had been no coup attempt, the number of Russian tourists to Turkey would have exceeded 1 million, according to estimates, Kızıldağ said.
But we lost a month in what we call the peak season, so the target is going to be smaller.
I still think we'll be over 500,000 if charter flights are allowed.
And it could be the end of October or mid-November.
In this case, additional flights could be arranged for Christmas.
I suspect this positive mood will be appreciated by the Russian people as well.
They also have a longing for Turkey.
I think with this speed, hopefully we'll be able to squeeze 700 grand.
He expressed hope for the Russian market in 2017 and said that if the relations between the two countries as well as the Russian economy recover, the number of Russian tourists could rise to more than 3 million next year.
POYD President Kızıldağ stated that with the lifting of the ban on public personnel, domestic reservations started to be made little by little, "There are returns in the cancelled reservations, new reservations have also started to be taken".
"We have a hopeful expectation for the Feast of Sacrifice", he said.
He said that the lifting of the ban on the sale of tourist tickets by travel agencies by Iran after the coup attempt was a very positive development and that "it would be very good if we could bring 100-200 thousand people from Iran in 1,2-2 months".
You're the new guy with the existing credit?
First, check with your lender to see how the new interest rate conditions affect your loan.
Ask your bank to calculate the cost of using a new loan with a lower interest rate, together with the early repayment fee (up to 1.5-2% of the usual rate).
If you're still in a position to benefit after all the costs are included, you can apply for a low-interest loan.
No breathing for the lion!
The last champion Beşiktaş aims to enter the new season with morale by winning the Super Cup battle against Galatasaray.
Technical Director Shanol Guneş, who has built his plans on winning, said in his meeting with his students, "We must play fast and aggressive".
"I expect you to have a high passing rate and ball control for the full 90 minutes".
It was learned that Şenol Güneş, who did not consider putting players who missed out on sports, especially Sosa, was undecided about Adriano and Quaresma.
The experienced coach tried Necip at the stopper during the weekly practice, but if Adriano plays at left back, Tosic will be at the stopper.
The Sun, who will also be a favorite between Ricardo Quaresma and Kerim Frei, also had his students run a standing ball after a long break.
Tolga is going to be a blast - Sport News
Galatasaray President Dursun Özbek answered questions from media members at a dinner hosted by Galatasaray sponsor NEF the previous evening and supported expatriate footballer Tolga Ciğerci, whose transfer and annual fee are the subject of controversy.
I'm not going to talk about football.
Dursun Özbek, who said that the football team is in a much better situation than last year, said, "But it is not for me, but the players who have to talk about it on the field", and added: "I can't say anything".
I'll see the teams in two or three weeks, and then I can tell you our chances for the championship.
I'm expecting a blast from Tolga.
You'll see Tolga with his posture, his physique, he'll make a splash this year, everyone will be watching in awe.
Galatasaray President Mehmet Topal emphasized that they had contacted him during the transfer period but that they would take over if he did not agree with his club and said: "We did not intend to be burdened so that our opponent would increase the price".
Mehmet Topal is a gentleman, a master of sports.
If he hadn't signed with his club, we would have transferred him to Galatasaray.
The bank's stock is in the hands of Riva.
"We wanted to build a 13,000-seat hall next to the TT Arena", Özbek said.
But our president said, 'Build a hall for 15,000 people.'
We changed the project.
We'll use the money from Riva to pay off the bank's debts.
The next day, the two of us were in the car.
Galatasaray President Dursun Özbek, who expressed his belief that the team that won the Turkish Cup last season will show its quality against Beşiktaş in the Super Cup final, put his bet on the club with a slogan in yellow and red.
"Mays are ours", said president Özbek, who expressed his belief that Galatasaray will be champion again after a year's break.
The transfer ban has been lifted
The Union of Clubs Foundation has signed a historic resolution at its meeting yesterday.
The meeting, which had the July 15 coup attempt on the agenda, agreed to lift the travel ban.
From the new season onwards, the fans of the guest teams will be able to take their places in the stands in the matches between the 4 seniors and in the Beşiktaş-Bursaspor matches.

Dursun Özbek, the president of Galatasaray Club, was elected as the chairman of the divan.
Unlike previous meetings, it was noted that the table did not include club flags.
In order to emphasize the unity and solidarity of Turkey, the table was equipped with Turkish flags.
"We will be self-sufficient"
The President of the Union of Clubs Göksel Gümüşdağ said that those who tried to attack the indivisible integrity of Turkey with treachery found the great Turkish nation in front of them, "We do not have the luxury of taking the formation of FETO lightly".
"As a football family, we have to clean up our own yard".
Gümüşdağ, "Do you think of an organization under the name of 15 July Democracy Cup?" and "There is a general opinion of the friends especially about the name of the Turkish Cup".
"We will share this offer with TFF" was his phrase.
The target is 25,000 combined.
Trabzonspor will compete in the new stadium in the new season.
The President of the Borodoma residents who are counting days to move to Akyazı, Muharrem Usta, determined the prices of the combines through a poll on social media.
The fans of the red-blue team, who are aiming to sell 25,000 shirts and 100,000 uniforms in the new season, are expected to show great interest in the shirts that will be on sale.

Serdar Çakır has been removed from duty
It has been learned that Serdar Çakır, the top-class referee observer in the Turkish Football Federation (TFF), has been dismissed from his post.
The appointment of Serdar Çakır, who is currently serving as a FIFA referee for the Rio Olympics, and who is also the father of Cüneyt Çakır, sparked controversy in the refereeing community last year...
In the past few days, the Central Arbitration Board (MHK), the Arbitration Board and the representatives and observers boards were re-established in the TFF within the framework of the FETO.
The iconic laughing face from Van Persie
Just as Pereira's alleged termination of his contract was being revealed, Dutch star Robin van Persie made a fake post on his Facebook account.
Robin van Persie, who shared photos of himself from the Fenerbahçe sport, put a smile icon with a football.
This post was interpreted as "She is happy for Pereira's departure".

FETO leader Gulen's assets were seized
According to the Terror-Technical and Organized Crimes Investigation Bureau of the Republican Attorney General's Office, 17 suspects were charged in the 2nd Heavy Penal Court of Adana for the execution of the FETÖ/PDY terrorist organization by providing funding to the FETÖ/PDY terrorist organization by providing an excessive amount of value of the immovable property belonging to the persons and organizations connected with FETÖ/PDY, by making unethical changes in the building plans.
In the case of the number one defendant, Fetullah Gülen, who was tried for the crime of 'Inciting to Overthrow the Constitutional Order', the court issued an arrest warrant for the defendants Ömer Ekinci, Kemal Elibal and Cemal Soncu, who fled with Gülen.
But the court has ordered the escape of four fugitives who have not been caught and who have not appeared in court.
The Adana 2nd Serious Crimes Court has therefore decided to confiscate all the assets of Fetullah Gülen, Ömer Ekinci, Kemal Elibal and Cemal Soncu, who were in a foreign country and therefore became fugitives because they could not reach him, in order to ensure that the case against them remains without result, "in accordance with Article 278/1 of the Criminal Proceedings Act (CMK)".
With this decision, the court froze the property in Turkey, land, sea and air transportation vehicles, all kinds of rights and debts, valuable documents, shares of the company where the partner is, rented cash and bank accounts belonging to the fugitive defendants.
Hüseyin Gülerler: The fall of Gülen depends on the collapse of 3 feet
Huseyin Güler, who commented on the FETÖ coup attempt, made striking statements.
The following are excerpts from the comments of Hüseyin Güler:
I've been writing about this for the last five or six months, as I've been thinking about the coup attempt, that they can initiate but they can't do it from the chain of command.
I didn't know two things: first, that it was so widespread and deep, like the eight-year-old commanding officer of the Gendarmerie General Command and the President's yavr.
Mr. President, the most struggling person, who knows how, has taken care in choosing their yachts, but their most important feature is unprecedented secrecy.
They're such hypocrites.
One of the most important pieces of evidence that a retired preacher like FETÖ can't do this is that he's such a deep kumpas.
He's got the CIA backing him.
CIA, this guy got out early.
Mahmut Övür says in 2014 that in 1971 they met with Fetullah Gülen in the house of Vehbi Koç.
People who were most interested in these things said that this was the closest the MlT and CIA had ever been.
The US paid our armed forces personnel salaries, and then one guy walked out, and he didn't remember.
When do we learn that, in 2014?
After this article by Mr. Mahmoud, there was no explanation to deny it.
Like Adil Ötüm, who was captured at the base, right?
He's wondering who this is.
The man has been to Pennsylvania twice in the last 25 days before the coup, and he came back two days ago.
Adil Örtüz has been abroad 109 times since 2002.
When you put all of this together, it should be investigated; since March 1999, when all of those who fled now went to the United States, Fethullah Gülen, which ones went to the United States under an excuse, this should be investigated.
They must have somehow made it to Pennsylvania.
But their actual contacts with the CIA can be traced here, especially from people who had to be promoted from within the security, and many of them were sent to the United States in safety.
He's in the Wikileaks files, he's founding a laughing society, and that society is having joint meetings with the CIA.
15 years ago, there was a study to make those connections official.
I told you Fuat Avenue was an intelligence pool in Pennsylvania two years ago.
The guy who works in the Prime Minister's office works for Fuat Avni.
But the bad news is, it's been leaked to the CIA, just like it was to Pennsylvania.
The collapse of Gülen depends on the collapse of three legs; one of them we call the base, which formed a circle of friends, there are those who are in deep hypnosis, they say that even this coup attempt is still Erdogan's film.
I was saying three feet, one foot.
The theft of arms, theft, the defeat of serfdom, has shaken this base of support.
The other two legs: political support, international support.
International support is still available.
The only thing that will break the political support is the documentation that the tapes of Baykal and MHP leaders were taken by FETÖ.
After July 15th, FETO is also being used by Kılıçdaroğlu, he opened everyone's eyes.
A trickster who laughs and says, "I'm not doing it, I'm doing it around".
He says, "Oh, Mr. Hussein, these girls have very different dreams, they send me, I've banned them, because it's not right to act on them".
An audio recording was dropped, the speaker on the audio recording was Barbaros Kocakurt: My friends had a dream, our Prophet double the tweets.
One policeman was martyred in Nusaybin
According to information received, the armoured vehicle in which the police were patrolling Selahaddin Eyyubi neighborhood was fired at by terrorists with long guns.
The first fire killed a policeman, wounded a police officer.
Two terrorists were neutralized in the ensuing clash, after police responded.
The injured officer was taken to Nusaybin State Hospital.
He's running an operation in the area.
He delayed the coup. He didn't cut off the TV.
Private TV channels that played a significant role in preventing the coup attempt on the night of July 15 continued to broadcast thanks to a technical staff that heroically resisted the coup plotters in TurkSat.
This is the hero Asim Akkaya...
Akkaya, who stated that they had entered the psychology of resistance with the instruction to cut the broadcast during the reading of the manifesto on TRT, said, "I risked everything thinking that my friends were martyrs in the fire opened from the helicopter".
They put a gun to my head and asked me to cut the broadcast.
I just turned off the local TVs.
Then I told them we had to go to the dish antennas to get them away from the building.
I spent about 20 minutes in the antenna section.
"I cut some wires here, but I didn't touch the publications", he said.
When the broadcasters failed to cut the transmission on TurkSat, they brought in the specialists from the Sky TV.
These terrorists were caught by police who arrived at the scene three minutes ago.
Akkaya said that when the terrorists returned to the building, they realized that the TV broadcasts were still on after about 1 hour, and that they were close to death at that moment.
I took over his shift at 8:00 that night.
He entrusted it to us.
I had a friend who was a security guard for the e-government and the electrical system.
We were meeting for tea at about 9:00 p.m. when helicopters flew overhead in a low-level flight.
There were several other air vehicles surrounding the helicopter, again flying low and quiet.
We saw your lights.
It was probably an unmanned aerial vehicle that could take pictures.
They were flying in front of the helicopters.
I've been there 11 years, and this is the first time I've seen a plane fly this close.
Then there was a movement.
We were watching the news and found out the bridge was closed.
Meanwhile, our general manager has instructed the friends in the security cell who are not on duty at the moment to come to the building.
When we went to the police station to get information, we found out that all the TRT broadcast packages were down.
For five minutes, TRT was off the air.
I tried to reach the TRT command center, but I couldn't.
Our control station says the TRT broadcasts are back and the announcement is being read.
Our Deputy Director General Halil Yeşilçimen, asked for the immediate termination of TRT broadcasts on the instructions of the director general.
Since TRT broadcast broadcasts on channel 3, we started working to cut the broadcast.
We just heard Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım say that there is a "conflict".
Our director's order to "cut off TRT" has us into a bit of resistance psychology.
We cut off the TRT, and after a while, we heard the helicopter.
We went outside, the helicopter that came down fired everywhere, everybody scattered.
We hid in a building in the back.
There were 12 of us.
When we got to the back, the soldiers came in from the helicopter.
A few of our friends were captured by the soldiers.
We showed up to keep them occupied.
And I saw them grab our assistant general manager and bring him to his knees.
The soldiers were talking among themselves.
"Let's shoot one of them, they'll be cowards".
Then they put us all in the cell.
The commanders started yelling, 'Who's in charge here, I won't ask again.'
And when we heard the talk about 'we should kill someone', we thought: we don't know the country, but we have received an order to 'cut off TRT'.
So there's a resistance.
I felt like I was giving up my life.
I said, "I did".
I got up, not knowing what to do.
All I could think of at the time was my friends in the Army being shot at from a helicopter.
I thought about the 10 or 15 of your friends in the order, and I was relieved to think that they would kill us too.
The commander in chief said, 'You will cut off all the broadcasts except TRT.'
We have a system component that monitors local channels when they go to satellite.
We're broadcasting 80 of the 200 local channels from the room in question.
I thought of this room.
There was no national broadcast.
If I cut them off and say they're all cut off, at least until then, help will come from outside.
Or he's going to the same place he went.
We agreed that we wouldn't be able to get out.
I said, "I'm going to finish it".
I cut the antenna output of one of the local packet channels.
I've cut the power to the monitors that we can watch on national television.
So that all the screens would be blank.
I told him I had to go to the antennas to get it cut off completely.
The commander sent me with two soldiers to the antenna.
I turned on the antenna room, and one of the soldiers said, "Stop there".
He put the gun to my forehead.
'You'll cut them all down, except for TRT, and there'll be none left, and I'll kill one of you eventually, and that'll be you.'
And I said, 'You'll see when you're gone, it'll all be frozen,' because I'm dead now, and I didn't say anything else.
We entered the station, I stumbled and cut off the local broadcasts.
We're on the other set.
At that time, I had a system that would correspond to about 20 national channels.
We've lost about 20 monitors when we cut off the local channels.
Our Lord helped us so that we did not have to answer, and He kept them in their tracks.
They believed the answers we gave.
They didn't.
That's a relief.
They asked where the transformer was when it went off the antenna.
I said, 'I don't know, I'm a broadcaster.' He said, 'Do you have any electricians here?'
I said, "No electrician after the night shift, if there's a malfunction, the crew will come".
Actually, there was an electrician at the time.
I remember not cutting off the Cypriot broadcasts.
I was thinking of cutting them off to distract the soldiers.
They were relieved to think the broadcasts were off.
They couldn't even think to look at the publications.
The group has now gone on standby.
About an hour later, they turned on the TV in the waiting room and saw A News.
The soldier came in.
'My commander did not cut A Haber's broadcast.'
We've been eye to eye with the commander.
He said, 'Get up.'
I got up.
At that, one soldier said, 'We still have the publications that are going on.'
He said, 'There are channels broadcasting in Cyprus.'
I said, 'They're broadcasting from Cyprus, we can't do anything to them.'
"Then he got up and walked us all after he had a chat with someone".
The rebels fled from TurkSat in a van.
I saw the photos of the soldier who took me to the bathroom and gave me water being executed in the seat of that van.
Three shots fired at the forehead and cheek.
My friends confirmed it was the same soldier.
They called the soldier 'son' in our neighborhood.
Probably a soldier in the service.
They could have executed him to get rid of him.
According to Asım Akkaya's testimony, the first police team to TurkSat came from Gölbaşı.
When the police teams found out that the helicopters were in the area, that the guards were scanned, they went back to the county to get ammunition.
They came back after 40 minutes.
When the police teams arrived, they couldn't find anyone in the TurkSat foreign regiment.
Akkaya said that the so-called experts sent by Samanyolu TV came to the building only 3-4 minutes after the police, "They told the police teams 'they called us from inside, we are TurkSat personnel, we need to enter urgently.' "
"When the police asked for IDs, the four of them panicked and grabbed their phones and called in a 'trace'", he said.
After the recapture, the spirit of Dağkapı
The AK Party will be visiting Diyarbakir, Van and Mardin in early September with a large delegation including businessmen, artists, sportsmen and community leaders to build "heart bridges" with citizens in the region.
The party is preparing to transfer the "Winning Spirit" to Diyarbakır, which was formed with democratic seizures after the bloody coup attempt of the FETÖ/PDY junta.
The CHP and MHP mayors will be invited to the relief campaign to be carried out in the East and Southeast Anatolian regions before the Eid al-Adha.
The AK Party, which will give the message "The state and the nation are with you" to the people of the region, will deliver aid to poor families and those in need.
The last AK Party MYK meeting discussed the Gönül Bridge Project, which was implemented for the first time during Ramadan.
The positive results of the project for needy families, especially youth and children affected by terrorism in the region were evaluated and it was decided to continue the Gönül Bridge during the Eid al-Adha.
The work was started under the chairmanship of Vice President, Civil Society Public Relations, Mehmet Müezzinoğlu.
According to this, 12 provinces in the East and Southeast will be gathered in Diyarbakır, Mardin and Van.
The three counties that have been accepted as the center will hold meetings before the holiday.
Businessmen, artists, athletes and opinion leaders will also participate in the events.
At these meetings, the organization of the relief and the work will be discussed.
During the Eid of Sacrifice, the delegations of famous names will deliver the aid to the citizens themselves.
The youth and children will be given holiday allowances, and school needs will be met in this way because schools will open after the holiday.
The meat of the sacrifice will be distributed to those in need.
After July 15, the atmosphere of national unity between the AK Party, CHP and MHP against the coup will be reflected in this project.
The project will also invite the 12 CHP and MHP mayors to the organizations.
The three parties will be able to coordinate their relief efforts.
It is thought that the HDP will not be invited to the events as in Yenikapı.
The father-in-law of Adil Oyetmez has spoken
The father-in-law of Adil Öksüz, who was the number one of the July 15 coup attempt, was taken into custody along with his mother-in-law.
The father-in-law, Cevat Yıldırım, and the mother-in-law, Hatice Yıldırım, were released on the condition of judicial control and a ban on travel abroad.
Speaking at the courthouse exit, Cevat Yıldırım called for his son-in-law to surrender and said: "I am on the side of the state".
Goddamn the coup.
I know, I've known Adil Ötüz for 18 years, but I never really knew him.
I don't have a son-in-law named Adil.
I want him caught as soon as possible.
He can't live in Turkey or the world like this.
Come, you can trust the Turkish justice.
If he made a mistake, he'll pay for it.
He's giving us trouble by running away.
Too bad for the police, too bad for the state.
Police have been busy for 20-25 days.
Yıldırım said that he does not want Turkey to return to Syria, "We need work, not a coup".
We don't want Turkey to go and become like Syria.
Syria had a neighbor like Turkey.
We have a president like Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
"What do we have to do with our coup?" he said.
On the other hand, Öksüz, who was last seen on July 19 at 03.00 when he was passing through the TEM Highway Akyazı toll booths, was lost after leaving his vehicle with the 'SIR' plate in the garage of his father-in-law's house in Akyazı.
FETÖ operation to the university: 30 detentions
The button for the operation was pressed this morning as part of the investigation carried out in Izmir regarding the construction of a university by the Fethullahist terrorist organization.
In the operation carried out by the Directorate of the Department of Combating Crime in Izmir against the Katip Çelebi University, 30 of the 40 suspects were detained at their addresses.
Among the names detained in the operation carried out by the Izmir Republic General Prosecutor's Office are professors.
The names detained were questioned at the Financial Crimes Branch Directorate.
The other names are still being searched for.
Attempted suicide of prosecutor in custody
According to the information received, the teams of the Prefectural Security Directorate wanted to detain Viranşehir Prosecutor Ahmet Fishne in his office as part of the investigation.
Fişne then claimed that he would commit suicide by putting his gun to his head.
Fisheye stopped committing suicide after being persuaded by his colleagues and his wife who came to the court.
Fişne, who was taken into custody, was taken to the County Police Headquarters.
Smoking bans in parks and sports grounds
Bilecik Mayor Selim Yağcı said that they have added an article to the municipal ordinance by the decision of the Municipal Council, which prohibits smoking in parks, sports and playgrounds.
Yağcı said that they had met with all the public institutions managers to sign a protocol for the future of the new generations, wishing that the protocol would be good for children and young people.
Provincial Health Director Yasin Yilmaz also stated that the protocol is aimed at encouraging people to quit smoking and to distance young people from bad habits.
After the speeches, the protocol was signed by Mayor Yağcı, Sheikh Edebali University Rector Prof. Dr. İbrahim Taş, Fazilet Durmuş, Fazilet Durmuş, Fazilet Durmuş, Yılmaz, Ömer Balcı, Serkan Kadir Keskin, Deputy Secretary General of Public Hospitals and Hilal Savran, Deputy President of the Bilecik Branch of the Yeşilay Association.
He saw the kumpas in Ergenekon, FETO killed him
The Ankara Prosecutor's Office is investigating the role of FETÖ in the mysterious death of Special Operations Director Behçet Oktay, whose case was closed in 2009 on the grounds that he committed suicide.
The main suspect in the investigation is Ramazan Akyürek, former head of the Security Intelligence Department, who was in the same lounge as Oktay and who had heard Oktay being a Hezbollah Terrorist Organization suspect six days before his death under a false name.
It is alleged that some of the ammunition seized in the Ergenekon investigation was stolen and buried by the FETÖ team from the Special Operations Directorate, and Oktay was killed because he found this.
The death of Behçet Oktay, the head of the Special Operations Directorate, who was shot in the head in Ankara on 25 February 2009, was called "suicide".
But there were a lot of question marks.
After two years of legal wrangling with his family and his family's lawyers, and the evidence he produced, this time a murder investigation was opened.
The gun that supposedly shot Oktay, the one on the left, was in his right hand.
There were also fractures to the ribs and bruises on the body.
The case of the murder investigation was opened in May 2012.
In the murder case, only Halil Kesic, who was with him when he died and found a trace of gunpowder on his hand, was tried.
The jury acquitted him.
Nurhan Önder, who was in prison for another crime and sent a letter to the prosecutor saying that he was involved in Oktay's death, was sentenced to 6 months in prison for "assuming guilt and misleading the judicial authorities".
That 's the question .
Meanwhile, the prosecutor who called the incident "suicide" Huseyin Yalçin retired, while Mustafa Düzgün, who conducted the murder investigation, was promoted to the Supreme Court.
Oktay's family wants to investigate the autopsy prosecutor, Nihat Yildirim, along with these prosecutors.
Behçet Oktay's sister, Şule Oktay, and brother, Nezih Oktay, along with their family lawyers, made several demands during the trial.
The family, who said it was not possible that Halil Keshici killed Oktay, a specially trained person, asked for an extension of the investigation.
The family, who said that the incident was covered up, demanded that the prosecutors, Hüseyin Yalçın and Mustafa Düzgün and the police officers who wanted to close the case of Behçet Oktay as a suicide be identified and prosecuted.
While all the family's demands were rejected, it turned out that Oktay had been a member of the Hezbollah Terrorist Organization for 6 days before his death under the false name "Abdurrahman Doğru".
It was also determined that the person who made the wiretap was Ramazan Akyürek, the head of the Security Intelligence Department at the time.
The Ankara Republic Prosecution, which took up the Behçet Oktay case again, started to investigate the finger of the Fetullahist Terror Organization (FETÖ) in the murder.
The trial in the Ankara Court of Criminal Cases regarding Oktay's illegal detention will begin on September 19.
There is a fate in the future
The Oktay family, who SABAH spoke to, are hopeful about the current investigation.
Family members say that during the demonstration investigation and trial that was conducted earlier, the FETO finger in the murder was covered up.
Sister Shule Oktay said, "This murder actually came to show".
We didn't see it.
Before my brother was killed, he said, 'They'll eat me.'
I said "who".
He pointed to the FETÖ.
I thought he was going to be relieved.
I never thought about dying.
There's a FETÖ behind this, of course.
"They were in charge at the time", he said.
The young martyr called his family, joined in his prayers
After President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan addressed the citizens in the garden of the Presidential College during the last watch of the previous evening, which was interrupted by the democracy watch, the family of democracy martyr university student Ömer Canık Açgöz was also contacted by means of AK Parti Sinop MP Nazım Mavis.
"Our President joined in his prayers", said Fahrettin Açıkgöz, who said that he received a call at 1:30 a.m. when he was praying for his son.
"I told him that the health of our country and his health are important to us".
'It's important to our health'
President Erdoğan addressed citizens in front of the Presidential Palace the previous evening.
Erdogan met with some citizens in the city center after his speech, which ended at midnight.
Tayyip Erdoğan, who walked along holding the hand of an elderly aunt who had come to the democracy shift, chatted with citizens one by one, took care of children, and thanked citizens for their sacrifices.
Erdoğan then called Fahrettin Açıgöz, the father of Ömer Can Açıgöz, the martyr of July 15, through the agency of AK Party Sinop MP Nazım Maviş.
Fahrettin Aciqgöz, the father of Ömer Can, a 21-year-old student of the Faculty of Law at TOBB University who was shot in front of the Presidential College, said that President Erdoğan called him at 01.30 while he was praying for his son and the martyrs at home, "When I said that we prayed for my son, the President also joined in his prayers".
I told him that the health of our country and his health is very important to us.
"We are very pleased that our President called and prayed on the phone", he said.
The FETÖ's pyramid has been destroyed
26 FETO members were arrested in Izmir Urla.
Among those arrested is Kurtuluş Naip Hepyalç, who according to the victims' statements is considered a "representative" within the organization and a bully who threatens those who want to end their subscription to Zaman newspaper.
20 sisters who were FETÖ's donors were arrested in Uşak.
In Bursa, 24 people were taken to court, including the former Bursa Security Director Ali Osman Kahya.
The doctor is not in custody.
Aydın Tünbel, the imam of the organization in charge of doctors in Edirne, was arrested.
14 professors at the University of Pamuckalé, 30 professors at Alanya Alaaddin University of Keykubat, 19 professors at the University of Karabük, 2 professors at the University of Rize, and FETÖ colonel Hilmi Sandal were detained.
Eight judges and prosecutors, two deputy governors and two deputies were detained in Diyarbakır.
It was learned that one of the judges was detained in the courtroom.
In Batman, Deputy Governor Shener Chakal was fired.
Two police chiefs were arrested out of 465 police officers who were discharged from Istanbul Police.
Police arrested 51 in Konya, 14 in Kayseri, 14 in Malatya, 10 in Siirt and Naim S. in Adana.
He was protecting the traitorous PKK that was shooting people.
Turkey, which has been waging a relentless struggle to end the PKK terrorism for over forty years, has begun to face the day why it has not been able to destroy the PKK leaders in this struggle.
FETÖ militants who infiltrated Turkey's critical institutions, tried to tie Turkey's hands from all sides.
At the point reached today, serious doubts and evidence began to emerge that FETO was behind critical events such as the Hrant Dink murder, the Uludere incident, the downing of the Russian plane.
The threat of betrayal is too great
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's hotel in Marmaris was raided and his office was attacked.
Earlier it was established that Sönmezateş informed the terrorists about the airstrikes against the PKK while the planes were taking off.
The intelligence investigations also found that Gökhan Sönmezateş's record was a blur.
The terrorists are safe .
Besides the leaking of intelligence to the PKK, it was also revealed that the Turkish warplanes did not exactly hit the designated targets.
It was alleged that the intelligence given by MİT in Kandil about the leadership of the PKK terrorist organization was distorted by Gökhan Sönmezateş and prevented the targets from being hit.
It was determined that the coordinates were changed and the warplanes that took off to destroy the PKK's leadership cadre were hitting the places next to the targets, and the leaders of the terrorist organization were thus saved.
Intelligence analysis revealed that Sönmezateş played a key role in both diverting targets and fleeing PKK terrorists from their location before the F-16s took off.
37 thousand officers files opened
After the coup attempt of FETÖ members was thwarted by the instructions of the terrorist leader Fetullah Gülen, the process of restructuring was started in the Central Military Commission and the Ministry of National Defence.
A comprehensive cleaning process was started, especially after it was discovered that the entrance questions to military schools were stolen by FETO, and that military students who were not members of the organization were scared and sent away from the schools.
Then the excommunications will be carried out for the officers, as well as the cleaning for the generals and admirals, leaving about 37,000 officers behind from the 39,287 officers.
For this, especially in the ranks from lieutenant to colonel, promotions will be frozen.
A thorough investigation will be completed before the promotion.
The files of 37,000 officers began to be opened one by one.
A quick search will reveal the soldiers of the FETO.
Officers who are not affiliated with FETO will continue to serve.
The fight will continue until the last FETÖ member is purged from the army, while the promotion of officers will only come up after the investigation.
The investigation is being conducted by the MİT, the Security Intelligence and the State Control Board.
The officers whose files are opened are investigated as to whether they are civilians or military graduates, their ranks, promotions, places of duty and commanders.
And even if they are FETO members, they will be investigated through their schemes.
Every precaution will be taken to ensure that officers who have no connection with FETÖ are not adversely affected by the process.
If there is the slightest suspicion, that officer will be immediately discharged and brought to trial.
Any FETO connection identified, any information or documentation about them, will be immediately cut off from the military.
During all of this, promotions are frozen, and the investigation is deepened.
The necessary measures will be taken to ensure that there are no vacancies in the post-export staff.
Those who were fired from the TSK by the FETÖ and forced to retire will be able to return to their jobs in equivalent positions and with the same rights as their colleagues after passing the security investigation.
Two thousand three hundred and thirty-three witnesses were destroyed
The General Staff had announced the number of personnel of the TSK as 39 thousand 287 officers on 1 July.
The majority of the 32,289 personnel in the officer class, consisting of lieutenant, lieutenant, captain, major, lieutenant colonel and colonel, were in the ground, air and naval forces.
However, in the first wave of deportations on July 27, 1,999 officers were dismissed, including 726 in the Army, 314 in the Air Force, and 59 in the Navy.
In the decree of 31 July, 1,304 officers were dismissed from the TSK, 125 of them were from Kara, 909 from the Gendarmerie General Command.
Pehlivanoğlu: FETÖ poisoned the Turkish people
The MHP's founder and first general chairman Alparslan Pehlivanoğlu, a retired commander of the Turkish Guard, claimed that the Turkish guard was poisoned and killed by a member of the family in collaboration with the FETO.
Pehlivanoğlu, who was with Türkeş from 1977 until he died in 1997, said, "I haven't told anyone until today, but I was forced to speak after watching the video of Muhsin Yazıcıoğlu's helicopter being torn apart and seeing that the same soldier was in the darbekes who were sent to kill our President".
Here's what Turkesh's bodyguard said:
In 1997, we went to Germany.
We had a head checkup three days before we came.
"You look like an 18-year-old".
"You have nothing", he said.
And this doctor died of a heart attack a month later.
We returned to Ankara on April 3.
My head went to Amasya.
They called me on their way back and went to a target at the Ankara Hilton.
After exiting the target, the Turk driver tells Alparslan, "Open the back window".
He never opened a window.
When you open the window, it sounds like a hiccup.
First they did a cardiac massage, electro at the Çankaya Medical Center, but it was over.
We took him to the Baynar Medical Center together, but it was too late.
I think someone in the family poisoned Amasya.
There was no autopsy on Turk.
His ex-wife, Seval Turkesh, must have heard my illness and my speeches, and she came out and made statements that went to the defense, saying "Turkesh was killed" and so on.
Man makes a grave, and makes a grave.
They said it was a heart attack.
The tomb of Turk must be opened again.
Alparslan Turk was killed?
They were caught smuggling gold into Pennsylvania!
In an operation to recruit FETÖ/PDY operatives in Izmir, gold weighing 1.5 kilograms was seized during the shipment to Pennsylvania.
In a coordinated operation, searches at his workplace revealed another 30 pounds of gold, waiting to be smuggled into Pennsylvania.
Three people who were detained after gold was prepared to be sent to Pennsylvania were arrested and sent to prison in the businessman Mehmet Eldem's workplace in Eldem Kuyumculuk.
Also, during the operation in Izmir, businessmen Mustafa Özkara, Ezel Seçilmiş and Resul Seçilmiş were arrested and detained.
The operations of the teams of the Financial Crimes and Combating Branch Directorate of the Izmir Provincial Police Directorate on 29 July detained the owners of the Ege and Western Mediterranean Industry and Workers Federation (ESİDEF) Mustafa Özkara and Batınak Transit Taşımacılık Petrol and Tur Tic Ltd. Şti. (BALPET) owners, Ezel Seçilmiş and Resul Seçilmiş.
It was determined that Özkara, who was captured at the Adnan Menderes Airport in Izmir while trying to flee to Kyrgyzstan, was the son of Osman Gurbüz Özkara, who was in the first Fethullah Gulen's board of trustees, and one of the most important names in the FETÖ's Aegean region.
It was reported that the 5 petrol stations owned by Ezel and Resul Seçilmiş, other businessmen detained on the grounds that they provided financial resources to FETO, were also confiscated.
They robbed three gas stations in an hour.
The incident occurred last night in Kartal.
The two suspects, who arrived in Kartal in the vehicle they had seized, robbed a gas station on the side of the road, then another gas station 300 meters away, and then another gas station on the side of the road.
After the robberies, the Eagle Police, who were alerted, identified the suspects in a short time and started the arrest.
Police teams have traced the vehicle used by the suspects C.S. and U.A.
The suspects started to run away from the vehicle they were using from the Eagle Square administration, and shot at the police.
One of the suspects was caught red-handed on the Egemenlik Boulevard after a chase on foot.
The police arrested the second suspect in a short time, according to the information they received from the company.
The suspects were arrested and sent to prison after their activities at Kartal Asayiş Bureau.
On the other hand, the robbery was recorded by cameras.
Security cameras at the gas station show the suspect entering the gas station, making a reconnaissance, then entering the market again, wearing a mask and carrying his weapon.
The first suspect enters the market and the grocery clerk gets in a fight.
The suspect is followed by another person who enters the store with a mask and a gun.
After he disarms the suspected employees, he takes the 6,200 lire from the cash register and runs away.
During the searches, the suspects seized about 15,000 lira, an unlicensed gun and a vehicle they had also seized from 3 stations.
A 7.2 earthquake in the Great Ocean
The US Geological Survey (USGS) said the quake was recorded at a depth of 10 kilometers on the seabed, 109 kilometers east of the central base of New Caledonia Island.
A tsunami warning was issued after the earthquake, which caused no loss of life or property, but was soon canceled.
Vanuatu is a seismic hotspot in the Pacific Ring of Fire.
He prayed for martyrdom without knowing about the coup
The relatives of 38-year-old Chetin Can, who was martyred on the Boğaziçi Bridge on the night of July 15, are protecting their loved ones.
His wife Fatma Can said that when they had no news of the coup attempt that night, her husband learned about the "martyrdom prayer in the month of Shevval" in a conversation, after which he prayed the martyrdom prayer at home, and advised her to pray this prayer as well.
Fatma Can said that after the evening prayer, they watched the news on television and learned about the coup attempt:
We got ready and left together.
When we got to the bridge, there were people waiting.
As soon as we got on the bridge, the tank fired twice at us.
We took cover, then we kept walking when the tank went off.
There was a big bus stop on the bridge.
It was so crowded.
We stood there for a while, waiting.
We thought, "What are we going to do?"
The gang wanted us to go down the side lane.
When we crossed the line, I guess it was a sniper, we were a clear shot, and that's where he was shot.
He was martyred four hours after he prayed the hardest prayer.
He didn't know about the seizure.
A wisdom from Allah...
God is the giver and God is the taker.
My wife once said, "If I die, plant a tree that will bear fruit for my grave".
I fulfilled that wish by planting a fir tree on his grave.
Fatma Can also thanked President Erdoğan for visiting them and said, "May Allah be pleased with him".

It could take four months to get Rita's killer back.
It was stated that the extradition of the German hairdresser Rita Darı Winkler (39) to Turkey could take 4 months, as her suspected boyfriend, who was arrested in Germany 4 months later, was found dead in İzmit Gölcük after 34 days of disappearance in Istanbul.
Winkler arrived in Turkey on Thursday, March 3, to meet her boyfriend Ali Kemal S. (46).
Ali Kemal S. was supposed to return to Germany on Wednesday morning, March 9, after meeting him in Istanbul Pendik.
Following the investigation by the Istanbul Police into the disappearance of her family, the suspects focused on Winkler's boyfriend Ali Kemal S., who is married.
On 13 April, the TV program "Muge Anlı ile Tatlı Sert" was informed that Ali Kemal S. had excavated the workplace of his brother Hüseyin S. in Gölcük.
A job search was conducted on the tip.
Winkler's body was found buried in the floor of the workplace.
His brother Hüseyin S. (42) was arrested for allegedly helping Ali Kemal S. in connection with the murder and for making contradictory statements in the security.
Ali Kemal S. was reported missing in Germany where he lived after Winkler's body was found.
The Attorney General of Hamm reported that Ali Kemal S., who is wanted by Interpol in 190 countries, was caught walking on the street and did not resist the police.
The German prosecutor general said that they have not been able to determine where the suspect is hiding so far, and that the extradition process to Turkey could take 4 months.
It was revealed that FETÖ coup plotters fired into the mosque on the night of 15 July to silence the chanting of the sallah from the mosque near Akıncı Üssü.
SABAH has obtained footage of the attack on the TAİ TUSAŞ Mosque, the closest mosque to Akıncı Üssü, and the statement made by the imam of the mosque during the complaint "in the name of the saints".
According to the information received, the darbekis started shooting directly at the target from a distance of about 50 meters, shortly after the sala began to be read in the mosque.
One of the bullets hit the speaker rim, four of them on the head.
When the rioters couldn't hit the speaker, the central system was read to the end of the hall.
According to the crime scene, the rioters broke into the mosque with the intention of killing the imam.
Imam Mustafa Şeker said: "I was not injured, I have no complaints but I want these criminals who were able to shoot at the mosque and martyred the people of Kazan to be punished in the harshest way".

He detonated a bomb outside his wife 's house , where he lives apart .
M.Y., 41, who lives in Bursa, detonated the homemade bomb he made with his own effort and increased its impact by filling it with bilya and nails in front of the house rented by his wife, who left the house about 8-9 months ago due to severe poverty.
As the explosion occurred yesterday evening, citizens were in fear and panic, and the pieces of the bilya and nails from the structure were scattered around, causing the breaking of the windows of many houses.
Counter-terrorism teams have begun work to apprehend M.Y, who fled after the incident and is reportedly unemployed.
The neighbors said that the woman left home about a month ago because of the pressure from her husband and settled in the shelter.
Prison explosion in the Philippines: 10 dead
Senior Inspector Xavier Solda, spokesman for the Bureau of Prisons and Penology, said 10 prisoners, two of them Chinese nationals, were killed in an explosion at the Paranaque Prison in Manila, the cause of which has not yet been determined.
Solda, who said that a guard was seriously injured in the explosion, said, "Initial investigations confirmed that there was an explosion inside".
"The investigation into the cause of the explosion is ongoing".
Solda said that before the incident, the reports were examined that the prisoners wanted to talk to the guard when they learned that they would be transferred to another building, and that the investigators were investigating whether the explosion was part of an escape attempt.
Police official Jose Carumba also told the local press that the guard fired at the prisoners after hearing the sound of gunfire, which was followed by the explosion of a hand grenade nearby.
Curumba recorded how the authorities were investigating how the inmates who shot the guard brought the weapon into the prison.
The explosions in Thailand
Three people have been killed in four bombings in southern Thailand.
Authorities said three people were killed and 35 were injured in the blasts in Trang, Hua Hin, Surat Thani and Phuket, including tourists.
Police spokesman Piyapan Phingmuang said at a press conference that the bombings were not terror-related.
Phingmuang, "Thailand has no territorial or religious problems with anyone".
"We believe this is an act of internal sabotage", he said.
Junta leader Prayut Chan-ocha also told reporters that he did not want to comment on who was behind the blasts.
Oca said, "We must focus on providing calm, peace and confidence".
On August 17 last year, 20 people were killed and 120 injured in a bomb attack near the Erawan Temple in Rajprasong, the commercial center of Bangkok.
"The Sleeping Tyrant" will be executed by lethal injection.
Lonnie David Franklin, 63, nicknamed "The Grim Sleeper", was sentenced to death for at least 10 murders over the years.
Franklin, a former janitor, targeted his victims as women of substance and drug addiction.
Judge Kathleen Kennedy, who was trying Franklin, said to the suspect, "I have never seen so many monstrous and cruel criminals like you".
Franklin is said to be one of the most lethal killers in California history.
It has been learned that Franklin, who was convicted of the murder of 10 people and the attempted murder of one, will be executed by lethal injection.
Measures against FETÖ in Macedonia
State Minister of Macedonia, Furkan Çako, stated that steps were taken to bring the extensions of FETÖ in their countries to light in a legal way and to initiate the necessary investigations.
"All this is publicly known", Minister Çako said, recalling that the organization is also active in the media and business world in Macedonia.
The Turks here don't send their children to FETO schools anymore.
We're calling on our people not to send their children here anymore.
"This building, which has benefited from the hospitality and generosity of the public before, is well known by the public", he said.
The sky will be the scene of meteor showers
TÜBİTAK National Observatory researcher and Istanbul University Faculty Member of Astronomy and Space Sciences, Dr. Hasan Esenoglu, told the AA that Perseid will reach its highest level on the night of Friday, August 12 to Saturday, August 13.
Esenoglu said that thousands of fragments were formed by the sun's rays and gravity from the comet "Swift-Tuttle" and formed the Perseid meteor shower, adding that this situation would turn into a natural visual shower.
Esenoglu said that the Perseid meteorite was first discovered in 1862 and that it started to be seen again in the world from the 1990s.
Esenoglu said that the Perseid meteor shower can be observed in July and August, saying, "We should watch such a visual feast from space, we should be interested".
It's a natural visual feast.
"It will contribute to our understanding of the universe", he said.
They glow red when cold, white when hot
Esenoglu, noting that some of the fragments that fell during the hailstorm will fall to the ground in the size of a lentil, continued:
The Perseids can reach temperatures of up to 2,000 degrees Celsius.
Due to heating and friction in the atmosphere, the Perseids produce red light in their natural environment when it's cold, and white light when it's hot.
The International Meteorological Organization website has a website that lists how many meteorites have been seen.
This data is valuable because it's collected from all over the world.
It 's gonna be on all night .
Esenoglu said that the rain of hail is moving at a speed of about 60 kilometers per second and that the visual showers in the sky can be seen throughout the night from places with little light in the northeast direction.
Esenoglu said that more than 100 meteor showers occur every year, and that after the Perseid meteor shower, the Geminid meteor shower from December 4 to 17 is a natural phenomenon worth watching.
Erdoğan, a former footballer with little education.
This balance was upset by the successful alliance between the populist Islamists, led by the poorly educated former footballer Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and the highly educated followers of Fethullah Gülen, a largely religious entrepreneur, who established more than a thousand schools, dozens of universities and educational institutes from Texas to Tashkent.
The above is a translation of a sentence from an article in Foreign Policy last week.
This and similar articles, in which Erdoğan, a university graduate, is described as an undereducated former footballer, and Gülen, a primary school graduate, as a broad-minded entrepreneur, and in which Gülen's followers are openly praised, are frequently featured in the Western press.
Then on the other hand, in their articles on "Why is anti-Americanism and/or anti-Westernism rising in Turkey?" they try to explain with sentences that begin with 'Because Erdoğan...'
It is possible to think that analysts who see the anti-Western attitude in Turkey as a new situation that emerged during the period of Erdogan are ignorant of Turkish history.
In fact, statistics suggest that the first decade of the Erdoğan era can be read as a period when anti-Western sentiment in Turkey decreased or remained in the middle.
Because in that decade, we had good relations with the European Union and synchronously with the United States.
The fact that Erdogan criticized Israel with 'one-minute', that the EU failed to present a clear policy on the outbreak of civil war as a result of the massacres by the Assad regime in Syria and left Turkey alone in the refugee crisis, the rebellious attitude of some figures such as European Parliament President Schulz in the form of "Erdoğan is not our friend", the opening of a blasphemy contest against Erdogan in Britain and the fact that the then Mayor of London, now Foreign Minister of Turkey, has a poem with a racist expression that you cannot imagine, and the fact that the Turkish people have a poem with a racist expression and the fact that the PKK is the main force behind the PKK and even the PKK, while the number of PKK and PKK militants who enter Turkey from Syria is decreasing, the fact that the YPG is the arm of the S.S.S. is the YPG's special branch in Europe, and the YPG is the main force behind the YPG, the YPG, is responsible for the logistics of many militants who fight against the YPG, the YPG, the YPG, and the US are responsible for the logistics of the YPG.
Let's say that while we lost 247 people as a result of the bloody coup, we forgot that our so-called allies, the EU countries and the US, did not support our democracy until the failure of the coup was proven, that they expected Kerry to build 'peace and stability in Turkey' in his first speech on the issue, and that he did not put any emphasis on democracy and the elected government.
How can it be forgotten that many world leaders, including Turkey, participated in the protest march in Paris because 11 Charlie Hebdo employees were killed, but that no president from any Western country that is an 'allied' came to Turkey even though a month has passed since the coup attempt in which 247 people were killed resisting the tanks for democracy?
What do we say to the fact that the presidents or the high-level representatives who come several times a year for the refugee issue send low-level representatives?
How can we assess that all the EU and US ambassadors, whether they are visiting or not, will go to the Turkish Grand National Assembly, which was bombed, to make a solidarity visit because the glass of the Hurriyet newspaper was broken?
If we remember that in the first two weeks after the coup in Egypt, the EU sent a high-level representative to shake hands with the coup leader Sisi, and Kerry praised the coup administration saying that 'democracy is being rebuilt' in the post-coup visit, is it so abnormal that Western countries who refused to support Turkey in the resistance to democracy express their concern about Turkish democracy at every opportunity are not sincere in Turkey?
But even allowing Gülen, who is considered responsible for the coup by 95% of the population, to live freely in the US is enough to make the Turkish people fret.
Add to that the background I mentioned above, and I think it's clear that the rising anti-Western/American sentiment is something that can't be explained by Erdogan alone.
And Erdogan hasn't even said that he thinks the US influence is still in the coup...
So the coffin was never a tray.
Gezi geniuses who despise their own people, who say "We are a bunch of idiots" and who insult voters who don't think like them as "ignorant people who scratch their stomachs" can they still play the same tune after the night of July 15?
After seeing how these people have taken over the state and democracy, do they ask themselves, "Where did we go wrong?"
But there are so many questions to be answered.
How did the officers who had been in various ranks and given the right to use the state's weapons suddenly accept the status of "traitor" and seek refuge from foreign states?
We need to see what kind of a mind-boggling environment we live in and how these personality obsessions can lead people to behave in ways that would be termed perversion.
As for the brains-washing coup attempt...
Did those who participated in this action have any other viewpoint than to compare Turkish cities to Syrian cities?
Why would an officer bomb his own country's parliament?
We shouldn't have fallen for the fallacy of expecting reasonable behavior from minds soaked in FETO's curses.
Other people are responsible But let's know that FETO is not the only one responsible for everything.
The cadres who have made politics a profession of quarreling, hatred and hatred have also contributed to the tragedies that have been experienced.
The monks who present themselves as "enlightened" have convinced the masses that all kinds of unruly behavior and even indecency are natural.
We've seen how these people fire when they're given weapons by those who hate their own people.
The way of democracy, the way we know it
I'm saying something very simple: On the evening of July 15th, the people in Turkey gave 250 martyrs to the FETÖ's Tufeyists, Haramists, sergeants in uniform and did much more than save democracy.
But there are three periods behind July 15th, 1992-2002; 2002-2012; 2012 and beyond.
There are three changes that have been made in these three periods: economic, social, political.
Social change has produced two major phenomena: migration from the countryside to the metropolis, and the migration of these people into the center after being stuck around the cities for too long.
On Wednesday, I indicated that this transportation was by subway.
I also emphasized that the subway is the most important element of social change.
The second big change in the same direction is bridges and roads.
The road and the bridge are more easily understood as contributions to modernity.
The road, the economic and social structure change.
And in our country, it's also changed the political structure.
I've traced this date to the bridges that were built across the Straits in Istanbul since I left.
Demirel built the bridge over the Bosphorus.
This was the peak of the post-1950 peasant movement in the 1960s.
Özal continued the same progress with the second bridge, which we now rename the 15 July Martyrs Bridge.
Even their paths indicate the relationship between the environment and the center.
And that's a sign of what kind of social change is taking place.
Demirel and Özal's aim was to melt the masses in the center.
It was to embrace the ideology of the Centre.
The AK Party didn't build the third bridge for many years.
Because the migration was going full speed.
The people who came were placed in satellite cities.
A little bit of a closed system has been created in those areas.
The local governments of the AK Party gave people food, work, social status, and they voted for the AK Party.
So that the masses were not asked to melt in the center, but to acquire their political consciousness in the district and come to the center after that 'as themselves'.
This formation was related to the cover-up debates (1992-2002) that had been going on before the AK Party.
These debates have convinced the masses that the conservatives, the moderates and the rural people must stand side by side, not integrate with the center.
The AK Party, after 2002, acted in the manner I described, politicized the masses, joined politics, matured.
After all, now notice, the construction of the 3rd Bridge is the same time as the democratic struggle of July 15.
So, history and sociology overlap.
Let me add another dimension to this: the AK Party's movement, which I mentioned, is not limited to Istanbul bridges.
And something more interesting is happening: the AK Party is now integrating the peripheral cities with the central cities.
This is accomplished by means of two bridges.
One, the bridge of Osmangazi.
Two, the bridge to Çanakkale from 1915.
Add the roads to that.
Turkey will now reach Izmir from Thrace by another route.
You know what that means, Izmir will be a different city after this.
Let's say that the AK Party can't take Izmir from 'inside' and now it will take it from 'outside'.
Now Bursa, now Chanakkale, now the cities of Thrace will become other human and social geographies.
That's it!
The martyrs of July 15 are the stars of this great adventure.
Van Persie and the cheerful sport at Fenerbahce
Fenerbahce continued his preparations for the Grasshoppers match with his morning practice.
The training, which began at 10.00 am at the Can Bartu facilities under the direction of technical director Vitor Pereira, lasted a total of 1 hour and 30 minutes.
After 30 minutes of core training in the gym, the players came out on the field and did the running and warm-up moves, and the 2-for-5 ball catch and pass moves.
The practice was completed with a pair of close-quarters matches.
Fenerbahçe will continue their preparations with their practice this evening.
The one who complained about Aziz Yıldırım to Gülen...
There are new developments regarding the Shike Operation against Fenerbahce.
"A name from the sports world has told Fethullah Gülen about Aziz Yıldırım's own words", said journalist Hüseyin Güler, who participated in a program broadcast on CNN Türk and explained that this operation was carried out by FETÖ.
"One day, on a plane, this person said, 'What are you doing next to Fethullah Gülen?'"
When this person told Gülen these words, Fethullah Gülen also attacked Aziz Yıldırım.
Why did Aziz put on the lightning?
The president of the club, which has the most supporters in Turkey, thinks that if he is in this state of mind, he can harm himself.
He used the phrase "the case of the schism was to liquidate Aziz Yıldırım".
These words were followed by an explanation from Faik Işık, one of the leading lawyers of the Shike case.
Işık appeared on the program Karşıt Görüş (Confrontation) on Habertürk and described the person who complained about Aziz Yıldırım to FETÖ leader Fethullah Gülen.
Here are the words of Faik Işık:
Aziz Yıldırım is saying something to Ihsan Kalkavan about Fethullah Gülen.
On a private plane from Azerbaijan.
The saint is a man of humor, and when he criticizes someone, he says a few words of contempt.
Those puns might be a little bit corny.
Some of the sentences may be offensive.
These sentences are being put together.
Havs, himmets, so many businessmen go there as if they were going to Hajj, Umrah, it's not a tolerant thing to do.
What's he saying, he's very critical.
That's not the only problem, of course.
Oh, and they have a soccer practice.
The direct contacts of some of the players and managers from Galatasaray Club and Hakan Şükür...
Muharrem: The subject of the joke is different.
The president of Trabzonspor, Muharrem Usta, extended his hand of friendship to Fenerbahçe.
"We are on the side of this country with 79 million people", said Usta, who said that the issue of Turkey is the issue of all clubs.
We need to show a healthy posture.
If Fenerbahce has a problem with FETÖ, if there is injustice, I will stand behind Fenerbahce.
"But the issue between Trabzonspor and Fenerbahce is different", he said.
Sacrifice prices have been announced.
Karabulut said: "We have collectively set the price of a kilogram of live sacrifice at 18 lira".
"We have found the price of a camel to be 17 liras per kilogram of live cows, and the price of a live cow, which we define as second-class, to be 15 liras per kilogram of live cows", he said.
Karabulut pointed out that animals that were not to be sacrificed last year were also put up for sale, and explained what citizens should pay attention to when buying sacrifices:
Particular attention should be paid to the ear ring in animals.
And it's also very important that the animal is healthy.
So our citizens can check the vaccinations in the passport of the animal while they're taking the victim.
And from the outside, the victim must be alive and well, with no hair on him.
And your face should be clear of saliva and phlegm.
In recent years, we've seen non-sacrificial animals being offered for sale and sold.
The victim animal must be at least two years old.
We can tell that by looking at the animal's teeth.
An animal over two years old has developed what we call a 'cap' of teeth.
But younger animals don't have these teeth.
The animal may appear large, but the canines may not have emerged.
And the canines are noticeable because they're already bigger than the others.
Rize Airport to be built by sea
Rize Airport will be the second airport to be built with sea-beds in Turkey.
Rize Airport will be built on a 266 hectare area between Yeşilköy Village and Kız Kulesi position in Pazar district, on the seafront 26 to 32 meters away from the coast.
Due to the excess depth in the construction of Rize Airport, about 3 times more filling material will be used than that used in Ordu - Giresun Airport.
The project will include a runway with a 45-metre wide and 3,000-metre long runway with a capacity for 36 aircraft to take off and land per hour.
The airport is expected to serve passenger and cargo aircraft, and heavy aircraft with a take-off weight of more than 150 thousand kilograms.
For the Rize Airport project, which will be tendered by the Infrastructure Investment Directorate of the Ministry of Transport, Maritime Affairs and Communications on 8 September, the first stage will be sea-dug, runway, apron, taxiway, environmental road, safety wire, mendicant, PAT fields and environmental lighting works.
These things will cost 600 million lire.
The infrastructure works will be followed by the superstructure works covering the terminal buildings with a total investment of 150 million lira.
The construction of Rize Airport will be completed in 2 years and 9 months.
Eight cents on your engine.
The gasoline companies have increased the average price of a liter of this engine by eight cents, effective at midnight tonight.

Prices set by the distribution companies can vary slightly by company and city due to competition and liberty.
The fuel companies had raised the price of the engine by 4 cents a litre last Friday.
Here are the Galatasaray footballers in Gulen's conversation
It was revealed that Galatasaray and national football players who made their mark on Turkish football at one time, took part in the conversation of FETÖ leader Fetullah Gülen in 1996.
In the video, which was said to have been taken in 1996, Hakan Unsal, Mert Korkmaz, Okan Buruk, Arif Erdem, İsmail Demiriz, Uğur Tütüneker and Yusuf Tepekule are clearly visible among the footballers listening to Fetullah Gülen's conversation.
In the conversation, Gülen used the phrase "we scored 4 goals and won" when referring to Galatasaray.
Said Alpsoy, also known as the former football imam of FETÖ, recently told SABAH newspaper that "the team was awarded a bonus when Turkey became the third World in 2002".
Emre, Okan, Hakan Şükür, Hakan Ünsal and Arif have collected money from these bonuses.
The money raised was $250,000 or $500,000.
Arif Erdem took this money to Pennsylvania.
"Arif was praised by Gulen later", he explained.
Milli futbolcular joined the conversation of Gülen!

Robert Amsterdam has a very striking statement about FETÖ!
Robert Amsterdam, a senior attorney at the law firm Amsterdam&Partners, which legally investigates the international illegal activities of the Fetullah Terrorist Organization (FETÖ), wrote an article for the US magazine Forbes, sharing information on how FETÖ is organized.
Amsterdam said that FETÖ leader Fethullah Gülen ran the organization from his mansion in Pennsylvania, and that "a close look at how he runs about 150 charter schools in the US shows that his organization has highly developed organizational skills hidden underground".
Amsterdam said that it was commissioned by Turkey seven months ago to investigate Gülen-linked companies and schools, and that what it has found so far is "shocking".
Amsterdam, in his article, expressed the following views:
According to the information we have from the whistleblowers, the Gülen organization has a strict hierarchy of instructions.
These instructions are usually given in face-to-face meetings with Gülen in the Poconos.
There's a seven-person management group at the top.
This group passes instructions to the advisory committee.
The instructions go to the regional imams, the country imams, the regional imams in the country, the provincial imams, the regional imams in the provinces, the neighborhood imams, the imams of the student houses (light houses) and the students.
Businessmen, bureaucrats and officers work at different levels according to their positions and support within the organization.
The organization claims to have created 55,000 jobs worldwide and the largest network of charter schools in the United States, and Amsterdam says it's paying millions of dollars a year in taxes from American taxpayers to those schools.
Amsterdam wrote that the majority of this money was directed among the members of the organization and transferred to "selected" subcontractors.
Amsterdam explained this process with the following examples:
California-based Magnolia Schools was caught giving $700,000 in annual service contracts to a company with which Gülen is connected and shares the same office.
Amsterdam cited the Dove Science Academy in Oklahoma as another example.
Amsterdam noted that this school also paid an additional $3.1 million to the property owner, and that the audit found that the management of the school and the property owner company were composed of the same individuals with links to Gulen.
Amsterdam, which noted that similar cases were found in Harmony schools, which hold the largest positions in the Gülen network, said that smaller companies affiliated with FETÖ were paid money with pens, such as software licenses, purchase of curricula.
Amsterdam, underlining the mutual enrichment done within the FETÖ, said, "These examples I have given show that approximately 28 million dollars of American taxpayers' money was misused".
"And this is only the visible part of what we have found so far", he said.
Amsterdam noted that nothing has been done to prevent such incidents, and that the situation has worsened over time, and the Texas Department of Education has begun investigating the irregularities.
Amsterdam stressed that schools seem to be functioning normally, and many employees have no information about what kind of corruption is taking place.
Amsterdam, "But these schools actually work like snow machines for Gülen".
"Gulen then uses the huge amount of money for political donations to cover up his illegal activities", he said.
According to a former American teacher who worked in these schools, some employees of Gülen schools held separate meetings and gave a certain part of their salaries to the organization, and according to Amsterdam, "Gulen members in the Turkish Armed Forces are believed to work in similar jobs".
The coup plotters have been consolidating their positions over the years.
"Only in the face of the normal operation of the army, a parallel force was gathering strength behind the scenes".
Amsterdam concluded his article with:
The question marks in the minds of policymakers in the United States are of interest to July 15th, 16th and beyond, and that's to be expected.
But as the two allies address their situation at the diplomatic level, individual government officials need to wake up to the fact that Gulen's operations are in a series of violations of U.S. law.
22 members of the judiciary have escaped from Istanbul!
It was learned that 22 of the 648 judges and prosecutors who were indicted by the High Council of Judges and Prosecutors (HSYK) on August 10, 2016 and whose rights were investigated by the Ankara Republican Prosecutor General's Office on the allegation of belonging to the Fethullahist Terrorist Organization, who were serving in Istanbul, fled.
On 11 August 2016, the Istanbul Republic Prosecutor General's Office issued a detention and search order against 648 judges and 67 prosecutors who were dismissed by the HSYK.
45 members of the jury were detained after the prosecution searched their homes and businesses.
22 members of the judiciary, whose addresses were not found in the searches, were found to have fled.
It has been learned that an arrest warrant will be issued for the members of this court.
It was reported that 18 of the 45 suspects detained were referred to the Sulh Criminal Magistrate's Office with a request for their arrest following their statements in the prosecution.
The search for 22 judges and prosecutors whose addresses are unavailable continues.
11 people were arrested in Konya!
The investigation is continuing to capture those who have been detained as part of the investigation.

Zechariah Öz from Çavuşoğlu explains
Asked about the allegations that Zekeriya Öz and Adil Öksüz were arrested in Georgia, Çavuşoğlu said, "At the moment, this information is not true".
But there are conflicting reports.
All of these are being evaluated.
We're in close contact with the Georgian authorities.
"Every detail, information, tip is being scrutinized", he said.
Asked if there was any suspicion that they might be in Georgia, Cavusoglu said, "Zekeriya Öz had fled to Georgia before".
It was caught on the cameras at the customs gate.
He's got a record of traveling to Europe.
We're going through every piece of information we have, not just these two, but every other fugitive.
"Wherever they run, we'll track them down".
On the question of his meeting with his Iranian counterpart Cevad Zarif, Çavuşoğlu said, "Both issues were evaluated".
There are many issues between Iran and Turkey.
Politics, trade, transportation, energy, the fight against terrorism is our common fight.
There are regional issues.
Syria, Iraq, Yemen, the Gulf region, including Syria.
Turkey and Iran can play an important role in solving the problems of the geography we live in.
We have a lot in common.
We are also in favour of the territorial integrity of Syria, the integrity of the border and the cleansing of Syria from Daesh and other terrorist organizations, and we are in favour of the inclusion of the government.
We had a different opinion on Assad.
But we'll keep talking about it like we always do.
We agree on the ceasefire, the Geneva talks.
Consensus on many issues is meaningless unless it leads to a result.
"The important thing is to get results", he said.
"Our delegation went to Moscow for this", Çavuşoğlu said when asked about when Turkish planes would participate in operations in Syria.
"The purpose of establishing these mechanisms is to see what steps are taken in the fight against Daesh here and any incident needs to be coordinated to avoid an accident", he said.
"Iran and Turkey are two sister countries", Çavuşoğlu said when asked about gas purchases with Iran.
The arbitration should not decide, we can make a deal between us.
I had a little bit of a problem.
We should be able to make these deals without going to trial.
"We have had demands on the gas discount, on the prices".
On the question of the date of Gülen's return to the United States, Çavuşoğlu said, "A delegation will arrive from the United States on the 22nd".
The meetings will be held on August 23-24.
Our Justice Department is preparing the file.
As soon as the file is ready, it will be in the U.S. to coincide with the visit.
"We will go to Washington with our Minister of Justice, and we will both deliver the files and meet", he said.

Iranian Foreign Minister Gazi in the parliament!
Çavuşoğlu came to the TBMM with his deputy Zarif.
Çavuşoğlu and Zarif first inspected the damage from Sheref Hallü, then went to the Prime Minister's Office and inspected the damage.
After the visit, he said:
The Turkish people taking to the streets has once again proved that the will of the Turkish people and the people is superior to all forces.
The Islamic Republic of Iran has condemned the coup attempt from the first hours of the coup attempt, and has always been on the side of the Turkish people and government.
My visit to the Turkish Grand National Assembly today is a symbol of our support for the Turkish people and Turkish democracy.

We're the ones who follow this thing to the end.
One of these kids is grappling with death.
The other one is in critical condition.
He's bringing the wounded from Narince to Kahta in the trunk of a car.

Hakan Şükür and his father's assets worth 200 million have been seized.
The Sakarya Prosecutor General's Office issued a detention order against Hakan Şükür and his father Selmet Şükür, who worked as a contractor in Sakarya, as part of the FETÖ investigation.
The houses in Adapazarı and Istanbul belonging to Hakan Shukur and his father Selmet Shukur, who are in the United States, were searched.
Selmet Shukur was never found despite the search.
The police acted after they received a report that Selmet Shükür had attended Friday prayers at Salko Mosque on Adapazarı Sakarya Avenue.
The teams that went to the mosque waited for the Friday prayer to be said.
After the prayer, Selmet Şükür raised his hands in the air when he saw the police.
Selmet Şükür, who was the subject of an arrest warrant, was taken to the police station in a police vehicle.
Gökhan Şükür followed his father to the team car and went to the police headquarters.
The Sakarya Republican Prosecutor General's Office determined that Hakan Shukur and his father Selmet Shukur provided financial support to FETÖ.
The Sulh Criminal Court, which examined the prosecution's application, decided to seize the immovable property of Hakan Şükür and his father Selmet Şükür, land transport vehicles, bank accounts in banks or other financial institutions, all rights and debts with real or legal persons, valuable houses in their uhde, shares in companies, rental boxes and other property values.
The court's decision was notified to the tax departments, the police department and the tax departments within the day.
The first investigation of Hakan Şükür and his father Selmet Şükür determined that they were real estate tycoons.
It was established that Hakan Şükür and his father have apartments in Sakarya, Antalya, Bodrum, Istanbul Bakırköy, Beşiktaş, Büyükçekmece, buildings in Adapazarı and Sapanca, land in Kandıra.
Selmet Shükür has been found to have built luxury villas on a 10-acre plot in the Serdivan district of Sakarya.
It was also determined that Hakan Shukur had a classroom in Adapazari city center, which was closed by the tax inspectors of the Sakarya Group Chairman of the Tax Control Board of the Ministry of Finance, who were investigating FETÖ.
It is stated that the value of all the assets of Hakan and his father Selmet Şükür is around 200 million lira.
The fugitive police director was caught in Zaho
Ahmet Duran Bitmez, the 3rd-class security officer of the Batman Provincial Police, was released from the investigation into the FETÖ coup attempt.
Bitmez, who was issued a warrant for his arrest, has been found to be absconding.
The investigation by the teams of the Provincial Police Directorate revealed that Bitmez fled to the city of Zaho in Iraq.
Bitmez was captured in a joint operation by the security forces of both countries.
Bitmez, who was brought to Turkey, was detained in Batman.
As soon as he was done, he was sent to court after his security detail.
Security forces suspect that Bitmez fled north of Iraq to join the PKK terrorist organization.
Watch out for this habit of children
Dr. Bilgin Giray, Dean of the Faculty of Dentistry, said that children relax with this reflex, making suckling a necessity because they cannot perform the chewing procedure in early life.
Dr. Giray, who lists the causes of the habit of finger sucking in children, said, "Finger sucking is a phenomenon that is seen from birth to 3-4 years of age".
Most babies suck their thumbs.
The child sucks his finger to satisfy the need to suck in infancy, and after 1-1.5 years of age, the mother sucks her finger to satisfy the desire to suck and relax.
"He can be distracted by boredom, by finger-sucking behavior when he's sleepy, when he's nervous, and when he's away from his mother", he said.
Dr. Bilgin Giray, who emphasized that the finger sucking behavior seen in older age is based on the inadequacy of the mother-child relationship and the lack of confidence in the child, explained the effects of this behavior on dental health in the following words:
Finger sucking behavior has a negative effect on the formation of the child's dental structure.
The pressure exerted during suction pushes the upper teeth forward and the lower teeth backward.
This causes the lower jaw to be positioned back, upsetting the balance of the palate and the tooth structure.
And the physiological manifestation of this is a speech disorder and a closure that looks aesthetically bad.
Noting that if not addressed early, a much more complex treatment process may be required at the age of 6 to 7 years, when permanent teeth begin to erupt, Dr. Giray said, "We can protect our children from occlusion and joint problems before the completion of jaw development".
"That is why the mouth structure of children today needs to be controlled as well as the eyes and ears", he concluded.
A new fad in near vision therapy: Trifokal Lensers
People who have cataract surgery don't want to wear glasses.
Multifocal lenses have been used for many years to solve this problem in our patients.
The recent introduction of trifocal lenses has taken the success of treatment in this area a step further.
The difference between trifocal lenses and other lenses is that they can provide clear vision not only at distant or near distances, but also at distances defined as intermediate distances.
Treatment of distant, near or intermediate distance vision impairments
The distance between the two represents a point that we use a lot in our daily lives.
For example, the dashboard of a car, the portable computer that we hold in our lap, or the distance between us that we define as the 60-70 cm arm span.
And because the trifocal lenses also correct the distance, our patients don't need to wear glasses at all, no matter how close or far they are.
Another advantage of trifocal lenses is that they reduce nighttime complaints.
"The treatment of trifocal lens applied for any distance vision treatment is no different from the treatment of normal cataracts".
Our patients who receive trifocal therapy can easily recover their eyesight in a seven to ten minute procedure.
And the next day, our patients can go back to their normal lives.
It's an operation that improves the quality of life, especially for people who drive, use computers a lot, like to read and lead a more active life.
You may also consult your eye doctor to determine whether this procedure, which is available to all patients over the age of 18, is suitable for you.
Vascular heart surgery is not used!
Varicose veins are a disease whose frequency has increased dramatically in recent years.
In the case of heirs where genetic proximity is the primary factor, long working hours, jobs requiring long standing and long sitting lead to increased heirs complaints.
Are veins used in heart surgery?
People often ask questions like, what if I have a hereditary disease, what if I have a heart attack?
Here are the answers.
There are two types of leg artery systems:
The deep vein system in the leg is the main route that carries dirty blood to the lungs and collects the main dirty blood in the leg.
These are called the deep femoral vein and the superficial femoral vein.
Problems in these blood vessels are less common, and in these cases, the vessels cannot be closed and medications are used to keep them open.
There's a superficial collecting system in the leg that carries dirty blood to the lungs and joins the deep collateral system in the thigh.
This system is made up of two large and two small vessels called saphenous veins.
Deficiency and varicose veins can develop in all four of these veins.
The arteries that are used in heart surgery are superficial arteries called the great saphenous vein.
The absence of these vessels does no harm to the body, and therefore they can be used in heart surgery.
But for these vessels to be used in heart surgery, they need to be healthy.
Because the heart is a very important organ.
Removing the vessels by surgery or burning them with a laser also reduces the workload on the deep veins and makes the leg healthier.
A common misconception is that even if you're an heir, your blood vessels can be used as a backup.
The varicose vein is never, ever used in heart surgery!
There are other vessels that can be used in heart surgery.
The backup vascular systems that can be used in cardiac surgery are located under the rib cage, around the abdomen and in the arm.
So it's useless to wait and worry about using the aorta for the heart.
Radiology specialist Dr. Rengin Turggullar is here to help.
A meaningful message from Uzbekistan before the Super Cup
Galatasaray Sports Club President Dursun Özbek issued a statement ahead of the Super Cup Final between Galatasaray and Beşiktaş.
Dursun Özbek's words on the unity and togetherness in Turkish football:
Galatasaray, the two roots and two eyes of Turkish sports club, will face Beşiktaş on Saturday, August 13 at the Konya Büyükşehir Torku Arena for the Super Cup.
This is not the first or last match of the century-old rivalry between these two beautiful clubs.
But it's a crucial encounter in terms of timing.
As we all know, our country suffered a great loss on the night of July 15th.
The coup attempt of the FETÖ/PDY, which targeted our democracy, was overcome thanks to the unity and solidarity of all sections of society.
We paid a heavy price as a people that night.
We have martyred.
We have a lot of gas.
This painful sacrifice has once again reminded us of the virtue of democracy, the need and importance of peace, not strife, in this land.
On that night, the representatives of Turkish sports also opposed the coup with one voice and one heart; they all stood together on the side of democracy.
In these critical times, we need the unifying power of sport more than ever.
I hope that this match, which coincides with the second anniversary of the death of our valued rival, President Süleyman Seba, and the new football season named after the legendary captain of our club, Turgay Şeren, will be the beginning of the atmosphere of love and peace in Turkish sport.
I hope that whatever the score at the end of the match, which will be played in front of the stands where Galatasaray and Beşiktaş fans will share half and half, the winner will be our country and Turkish sport.

Scot Callum Skinner flying home while Britain is hoarding gold.
As the British trio defended their 2012 London titles, the Scot, Callum Skinner, triumphed last night in the men's race at the Rio racetrack.
The 23-year-old Glasgow rider took the lead from Scottish Sir Chris Hoy, and added to the legend as he triumphed home in the acclaimed New Zealand jersey.
In the event four years ago, where Hoy won five of his six Olympic golds, Britain took a shocking victory.
And even though Hoy had retired, they did it again, finishing sixth in the World Championships in London in March.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the specialist opening act, Jamie Staff.
And they did it right when Hindes showed up.
Hoy's retirement also created a void that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton have been trying to fill.
He had foreseen the potential that Scot had now realized, and the British coaches had not given up on Skinner.
Hindes, Kenny and Skinner, who had been crowned champions with Hoy four years earlier, had broken the Olympic record in the qualifying round, but New Zealand had set it again in the first round.
And the British trio, they're in the gold.
Hindes was a little behind on his own lap, but Kenny's team was ahead, and Skinner was holding on.
It was this change in strategy that was so much of the transformation that kept Kenny and especially Skinner from using Hindes as a bigger tool to slow him down.
Hoy, as the BBC's expert commentator, watched them from the sidelines and caught the eye of Skinner, Kenny and Hindes as they took the podium.
"It's an honourable comparison", said Skinner, 23, from Glasgow.
I'm just here to do my best and make my name known.
We broke the Olympic record in the final and beat the world champions.
That was really incredible.
There's no better way to earn it.
Hindes admitted to deliberately falling off the track after a poor start to the 2012 London Grand Prix with Kenny and Hoy.
He later reacted to this comment and there was no way of claiming that Britain's rivals had.
This time, there was no such problem for an incredible victory.
Hindes said: "With all the British flags on the stand, it was like being in London".
We're a team formed only three months ago.
We've lost so many worlds, so to win again at the Olympics is a really amazing feeling.
This is just one event, one medal for a nation that won seven out of 10 races in both Beijing and London.
If this is the measure of our progress in the last five months, we have five more days to make it to the race track.
Kenny's attitude shows that Hoy's dream of repeating his record of three golds in a single Olympics is not far off.
This will mean that Kenny, who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy and who was born on 23 March (the same date as Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister, a holy day in British sport history), will have won six gold medals and one silver.
That's the same level as Hoy.
Kenny will now be competing in the sprint, which starts today and will last three days.
"I'm just enjoying it right now", said the 28-year-old from Bolton.
Team events are always the best events.
You can win with your friends.
To be honest, it's lonely when you win alone.
Hindes said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be knighted".
Although this is only today's medal event, there is a lot of good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull finished first in the four-man, four-mile team race.
They finished the course in 3:51.943.
The world record for the gold medalist in London 2012 is 3:51.659.
The first round and the final (22:42) will be decided in today's second episode and Wiggins will be the center of attention.
He had a disagreement with the officials yesterday before the qualifying round when the authorities called him to measure his height.
In the women's event that continues and concludes tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie set the world record with a time of 4:13.260.
Team Great Britain is counting on a strong cycling team to take the reins and win many medals in the middle of the Olympic Games.
After the big dominance in Beijing and London, expectations in Rio have been greatly reduced.
In the background, there have been a number of bad developments, including the resignation in April of technical director Shane Sutton over allegations of sexism and bullying, and the retirement of prominent names such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
But the first night after the races on the track, it shows that Britain's legendary reputation for finishing in perfect time can be proven once again.
With the energy contract in limbo, the future of the Portland power plant is in doubt.
The future of the Portland aluminum smelter in Victoria and the jobs of hundreds of workers have been in limbo after one of the plant's owners announced the cancellation of a supply contract that would have led to the termination of all supply contracts for the power company that supplied the plant.
The move follows the Victorian government's decision earlier this year to not exceed subsidies to keep the facility running.
The 20-year fixed-rate subsidy expires in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs could be at risk at Alcoa's Portland facility.
Any one shutdown could put as many as 2,000 jobs directly or indirectly at risk.
And since the furnace consumes about 10 percent of all Victoria's electricity, there could be additional knock-on effects.
In 2014, Alcoa shut down the Point Henry Isabe mine, which led to the closure of the Anglesea power station last year.
Alcoa's Portland correctional facility is losing money and is at risk of closing.
These developments were initially due to the strengthening of the Australian dollar and more recently following years of speculation over the future of the facility based on the cost of consumption.
AGL, which sources power from the Loy Yang A power plant in the Latrobe Valley instead of the large aluminium smelter, said it expected the other three owners to move to terminate their contracts.
The vast majority of the facility is owned by a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, with smaller stakes held by China's CITIC and Japan's Marubeni Corp.
"AGL expects the Portland plant to continue operating, which means that the physical electricity demand of the furnace will continue", he said.
AGL stated that the contracts were "risk balancing contracts" that were to come into force from November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month grace period and will be completed in 2017.
"Therefore, AGL will continue to expect the contracts to contribute to the fiscal year 2017", the energy company said.
The impact that AGL could have on potential earnings for FY2018 and beyond is limited to its adoption of a strong forward contract position for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL has already said that the value of its contracts in its accounts has dropped to $187 million due to "expected retirement".
Alcoa stated that the decision to terminate the contracts 'did not affect Alcoa's ability to operate the mine or to supply the mine with electricity'.
The US company signed a 20-year contract in 2010, which was supposed to come into force in November this year, but has not yet explained why it has not withdrawn from the contract.
Analysts are alerting both the Portland lime quarry in Victoria and the Tomago facility near Newcastle to the possibility of closure due to economic difficulties in the sector.
Responding to analysts earlier this week, AGL's chief operating officer Stephen Mikkels said that Portland uses about 600 megawatts of energy each year, and Tomago uses 900 megawatts.
If both of these plants are withdrawn from the market, it will cause a significant drop in demand in the [electricity] market.
And that's not a good development for us as a producer".
Not just the star of the Kardashian TV show, Kendall is on the cover of Vogue's September issue.
Model and executive mother Kris's fourth daughter, Kendall Jenner (20), is on the cover of the highly anticipated September issue of US Vogue.
Kendall, who is an Estee Lauder brand ambassador and has shown at Milan, Paris and New York fashion weeks, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
Kendall wrote, "I cried when I looked at this cover in a room full of people I love".
Following the cover's announcement, a bizarre (or just Keeping Up with the Kardashians-specific) scripted reality video was released featuring the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (the troublemakers Rob and Caitlyn and everyone's favorite show uncle, Keeping Up producer Ryan Seacrest) in the video, with the family forgetting the cover of their sisters and then preparing a classic ending: they were actually preparing a surprise party.
While this is the cliché storyline of almost every "birthday" episode of a children's television show (Seacrest at 8 a.m. with a cartoon rabbit sincerity says, "Did you think we forgot you?"), Chris had to include the other girls in this introduction in some way.
With this development in the September issue of Vogue, we are definitely entering a new Kardashian era.
Kendall's older sister Kim may have passed her for Vogue cover (sharing the cover with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the magazine's September cover is a success in its own right.
The September issue of Vogue was the best-selling issue of the year.
The issue attracted the attention of many advertisers, with its thickness resembling a coffee table book more than a fashion magazine (Fashionista found that 615 of last year's 832-page volume contained advertising content).
The cover star's unveiling is a closely watched process; for the past two years, the magazine's images have been leaked before the official announcement.
Previously on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista, and Kate Moss.
In recent years, the cover has given more attention to "famous models" than to "famous models".
Oscar-winning Dior ambassador Jennifer Lawrence appeared on the cover in 2013, and the following year, Lady Gaga was given the honor.
But even if Ms. Jenner, described by the magazine as the "shining model" of her generation, is put in the previous category, her surroundings are still pretty good.
These aren't celebrities, relatives of celebrities, or reality TV stars, or the teenagers of today who know how to make a good Snapchat video (although Jenner is all of them).
These are all women who have legitimate talent, who have made their mark in the entertainment industry.
Beyoncé, who was on the cover of last year's issue, had one of the best moments of her career with the release of Lemonade.
Of course, not everyone is thrilled with Jenner's success.
Because of her reality show history, Jenner's standing in the fashion world will always be uncomfortable.
In June, original Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid, calling them "whores of the times".
When news broke that Jenner was going to be on the cover of Vogue, the idea was floated again.
But focusing on dissatisfaction seems inappropriate.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue.
She's literally a supermodel.
He's in the Marc Jacobs show.
You're being paid by Estee Lauder.
She and her sisters sell their paintings on paywall apps about you.
He sells pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter to LOVE magazine.
And in her spare time, she's on a reality TV show, maybe just to see her sister Kourtney and her kids.
Social justice support centers turn back 160,000 people every year.
As the industry prepares for the impact of further funding cuts on already struggling operations, over 160,000 of the nation's most vulnerable are being turned away from community legal support centers.
In Queensland, three out of five people (mostly the elderly, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and those without resources to deal with unfair eviction decisions, and so on) are turned away when seeking free legal advice and representation.
The social legal support services, having exhausted their resources, are preparing for further cuts.
As of June next year, these legal aid centers are scheduled to be deprived of more than 30 percent of federal funding.
James Farrel, Queensland Director of Community Legal Support Centres, reported that the latest Census Report of the National Association of Community Legal Support Centres found that thousands of people are turned away each year.
Mr. Farrell said that if the federal government doesn't reverse its decision, it's going to get a lot worse.
She said, "Queensland's community legal support centres are chronically underfunded, which means thousands of people are not getting the vital services they need".
People in abusive relationships, struggling with power and power-breaking, families in the process of separation, and workers unfairly fired -- all of these people are facing problems that have legal dimensions and are not getting the help they need, according to this report.
The federal government will cut funding by 30 percent from June 2017, which means thousands of vulnerable Queensland residents will be left to deal with more complex legal issues without help.
We call on the Minister of Justice and Queensland Senator George Brandis to immediately reverse these funding cuts so that people can get the support they need when faced with a legal problem.
Last year, the government fulfilled its promise to raise its legal aid funding to the national average.
Now we need to look at community legal support centers and the communities they serve and the investment that the Palaszczuk government will make in this important work.
Donald Trump's campaign team has been sued after claiming that staff members pulled guns.
New York: Donald Trump's campaign team is being sued for failing to take action after the director of North Carolina operations allegedly pulled a gun on a staffer while out in the jeep in February.
The case was unsealed Wednesday in a state court case brought by Vincent Bordini, a former software trainer on the state campaign team.
Bordini stated that he had been waiting for months for an inside job to take care of the situation, but then realized "it's not going to happen".
As Bordini's complaint states, the Director, Earl Philip, "took out a gun, put his right index finger on the trigger and held the barrel to Vincent's kneecap".
According to the complaint, Bordini complained to local and regional campaign leaders and learned that at least four others had the same experience as Phillip.
Bordini said in his complaint, "Weapons don't need to be fired to cause damage".
The lawsuit was filed two days after the Republican presidential candidate caused outrage in North Carolina by telling a crowd that "the Second Amendment people" (who are apparently gun owners and gun supporters) could take action if his opponent Hillary Clinton was elected and chose her own judges.
Trump's campaign team said the media took his words out of context and that he did not support violence.
Bordini, in his complaint, seeks damages from the campaign team for negligent surveillance and from Phillip for assault, battery and moral damages.
A message from Trump's spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, asking for comment, did not get a quick response.
Attempts to reach Phillip have been unsuccessful.
WCCB, a local news outlet in Charlotte, reported that Phillip had recently left the campaign.
A call to his consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services, didn't get a quick response either.

The "report the FETÖ" line
Following the call of President Erdoğan for FETÖ members to "not all may know intelligence, not all may know security, report" the FETÖ and the MİT established a line of information.
After the July 15 coup attempt, new applications are being launched to identify "secret congregants" who hid themselves while thousands of FETÖ members were expelled from institutions.
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan stressed the importance of citizen reports in the fight against FETÖ, saying "Friends of friends of friends from that community, I say that you should disclose them".
You have to report it to the prosecution.
It's a patriotic duty.
"All the intelligence may not know, the security may not know, or the police may not be able to catch up, but look, the men are running".
Within the framework of the work, the online whistleblowing application was launched by the Ministry of Interior, the Directorate General of Security and the National Intelligence Agency (MIT).
According to this, the citizen will be able to pass on the information about the people who serve FETO, the organization's activities that he knows, the institutions that belong to the organization thanks to this application to the police and the MIT.
The information of the persons who will report through the form provided through the links www.egm.gov.tr/pages/ihbar, www.mit.gov.tr/katkiniz will be kept confidential.
In the application for reporting provided by the Directorate General of Police, those who want to can add the document.
The same applies if the whistleblower wants to be returned.
Citizens can report their situation to the police hotline, "155", and to the prosecutor's office in the provinces and districts where they are located.
Inspired by Bodrum, they made a 'model village' in Sivas
Canköy, Kaymakamlık and the charitable businessman of Gölova County of SIVAS have been made a 'model village'.
The village, whose roads are paved and paved with cobblestones, has painted all the houses in blue and white, following the example of Mugla's Bodrum district.
The Kaymakamlığı of Gölova has prepared a model village project to improve the image and quality of life of the villages attached to the district.
Canköy, with the number 66 in the area, 12 kilometers from the district center, was chosen as the sample village.
The infrastructure and superstructure services were increased, the village's roads were paved and the sidewalks were covered with parquet stones.
The village houses with different shades of color were painted with the support of Selahattin Ayan, a businessman who owned Pelit Pastaneleri.
The whole village was painted white and blue.
I was just about to get my ass kicked.
Erkan İsa Erat, who gave information about the project, said that they prepared this project to sign a work that would be a role model for other villages: "The village's more modern appearance, the fact that all the houses were the same color was part of our project".
When we started this project, we were looking for a place to sample.
When we arrived in Bodrum, we were struck by the sight of the houses, painted white and with blue windows.
So we wanted to emulate Bodrum because of the cleanliness of white and the positive effect it has on people.
We painted all the houses in Canköy in white and blue.
This work was done with the cooperation of the government and the charity.
The project cost about 200 thousand liras.
With hard work, our Canköy in Sivas has become a small basement.
We want to continue this kind of work with our budget and with the support of our businessmen.
Abdullah Macit, 66, from Canköy Muhtarı, said that with the support of Kaymakamlı, the village has got a brand new image.
Macit expressed his satisfaction with the village and the people of the village, and thanked everyone who had made a contribution.

Seven people were detained in connection with the seized items, and a legal action was initiated against them.
FETÖ/PDY case in Adana, four people with Gülen confiscated their property
The court ruled that all the assets of Fethullah Gülen, Ömer Ekinci, Kemal Elibal and Cemal Soncu, who were tried in the 2nd Heavy Penal Court and who were fugitives, were confiscated on the grounds that they had gained by committing corruption to the Fethullahist Terrorist Organization/Parallel State Building (FETÖ/PDY) in ADANA.
In a report filed with the Adana Emniyet Directorate on May 15, 2015, it was alleged that in 2012, Deputy Mayor of the Metropolitan Municipality Zihni Aldırmaz and his administration had surrounded the housing area of Kanuni University, a land belonging to the Gulen community, despite the fact that there was no parliamentary decision, by committing construction corruption and plan forgery, and earning the community a rent amounting to 150 million liras.
Following the investigation, Zihni Aldırmaz, Ferat Yüksel, Mustafa Vural, Hasan Uzun and former President of Adana Trading Exchange Muammer Çalışkan were arrested.
Fethullah Gülen and 5 of the 17 accused, including the former Adana Mayor of Bucharest, Zihni Aldırmaz, were arrested and the case was filed with the 2nd Heavy Penalties Court for prison sentences ranging from 5 to 35 years.

The assets have been seized
The jury issued arrest warrants against Ömer Ekinci, Kemal Elibal and Cemal Soncu, who had escaped with Fethullah Gülen, the number one accused in the case.
However, the court decided to conduct fugitive proceedings for the four fugitives who were not caught and did not attend the trial.
The court's panel then decided to confiscate all the assets of Fethullah Gülen, Ömer Ekinci, Kemal Elibal and Cemal Soncu, who were in a state of absconding because they were in a foreign country and could not reach him in order to ensure that the case in their rights remained inconclusive, pursuant to Article 278/1 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CMK).
With this decision of the court, the property in Turkey belonging to the fugitive defendants, land-sea and air transport vehicles, all kinds of rights and receivables, valuable documents, company shares, rental cash registers and bank accounts were frozen.

The fund of controversy is back in commission.
The Turkish Wealth Fund, which is expected to be among the largest funds in the world, has been outlawed due to the silent objections.
Due to the lack of an audit mechanism, it was decided to review the fund, but it was reviewed in the commission without any changes.
CHP Deputy and Plan and Budget Commission Member Utku Çakırözer, who evaluated the bill on Turkey's Wealth Fund brought by the AKP to sozcu.com.tr, said, "We are absolutely against keeping this structure, which will consist of mandatory pension deductions to be taken from assets belonging to the public, the worker, the employees, from the unemployment fund collected for the unemployed, outside the Constitutional control mechanisms".
The bill on the Turkey Wealth Fund, which the government has prepared to provide long-term funding for investments and projects, was nullified on Tuesday, with the opposition saying it should be considered separately.
But today the AKP brought the proposal back to the same form to the Planning and Budget Commission.
CHP member of the TBMM Plan and Budget Commission, Eskişehir MP Utku Çakırözer told sozcu.com.tr about the concerns and worries of the CHP regarding the Varlık Fonu bill.
"When the establishment of this fund came to the Plan and Budget Commission in the bag bill, our former Finance Minister Zekeriya Temizel, who headed the CHP delegation, expressed our concerns and concerns, suggested that this be removed from the bag law and also discussed in detail", Chakrozer said.
The government, having accepted our view, withdrew the bill.
The bill came back to committee yesterday in the same form.
"The government seems to be insisting that it be expelled from the House within a week", he said.
Chakrozer said that there should be a consensus on the law of the Wealth Fund, adding that "our biggest concern in this bill is the lack of consensus".
"The assets belonging to the public, the worker, the mandatory pension cuts to be taken from the employees, the income to be made up of the unemployment fund collected for the unemployed, the income to be obtained from privatization, are being transferred to a structure that is outside the control of the Meeting and the Sayıştay and has no responsibility", he said.
"But we have a savings gap", said Çakırözer, who noted that Russia, China and the Gulf countries, where these funds are established, have oil revenues and trade surpluses and the fund is financed in this way.
So the funding will be public money, the money of the people.
A total of 100 billion in unemployment funds, 100 billion from the individual pension fund, which has been forced on the employees, 50 billion is planned to be transferred without privatization.
"So this fund, which will be entirely funded by the people, must be under public control and this money must not be spent irresponsibly", he said.
Stressing that it is unacceptable that a fund where state resources are collected, where state assets are secured in the indebtedness, is kept outside the control of the Meeting, Çakırözer expressed his concern and concerns about the Proposal for the Law on the Wealth Fund:
The collection, spending, and borrowing of such a large public asset cannot be carried out solely by the control of independent audit companies.
There must be public oversight and a transparent structure.
The bill does not contain any provisions on the constitutional oversight and transparency of the Wealth Fund.
There is no limit to how much resources can be transferred.
No one will be held accountable for how this fund is used.
The purpose of the fund is to finance large projects.
There's no need to set up an uncontrolled fund outside the budget.
Why don't you put it in the budget?
And that naturally begs the question, "Why is the Stonewall and the House avoiding oversight?"
"We are not against the transfer of the money in the Wealth Fund to investments, but we are against the fact that this is done by non-transparent, non-accountable mechanisms", said Çakırözer, "It is debatable whether there is a need for such a fund".
But if the government insists on this, then we have to ensure that the international standards that apply in other countries where such investment funds are established, apply in Turkey as well.
It's imperative that the mechanism of control and accountability is structured in a way that it's brought in.
It should be set up in such a way that there is no mischief on it, that the citizen can account for his own money until the last penny.
"We are glad that the AKP is listening to our criticism in the Parliament especially after the July 15 coup attempt", he said.
We hope that the AKP will listen to our constructive criticism in this bill.
We are against the unregulated use of national assets, the transfer of them, the irresponsibility of those who use them and the lack of public oversight.
"The Requested Asset Fund can only be useful if these concerns are addressed", he said.
It was learned that the proposed law was being worked on to reach a compromise between the AKP and the opposition.
"Our investments are an indication of our confidence in Turkey"
Speaking at a meeting in Istanbul, Ali Koç, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Ford Otomotiv, said, "The investment of 30 billion TL we have made in the last 5 years is an indicator of our confidence in the future of our country".
Deputy Chairman of the Board of Koç Holding and Chairman of the Board of Directors of Ford Otomotiv Ali Koç and the managers of numerous foreign capital firms met at a meeting organized by the Istanbul Chamber of Industry (ISO) on "Those who trust Turkey, those who produce in Turkey".
Ali Koç said, "Together with our partners, we are not just saying that we believe in our country, we are also doing it with our investments and actions".
The 30 billion TL investment we have made in the last 5 years is an indication of the confidence we have in the future of our country.
Turkey needs to be able to attract more foreign investment; a reliable and fair legal system, a democracy at international standards, a qualified workforce and an ecosystem that promotes R&D, innovation, entrepreneurship and added value.
In the last few years, our government has offered our industrialists the most comprehensive incentives in our Republic's history.
"I believe that with these incentives and holistic strategies, we can launch a new 'Refuge Movement' that we need", he said.
"We know that no matter what happens, it's not just a problem of one country, but as global players", said Hüseyin Gelis, Chairman and CEO of Siemens Industrial and Commercial Turkey.
We came to Turkey with a long-term vision.
If we are united and together, our problems will be solved.
We have brought to this land what was not possible in Turkey 160 years ago.
We will continue to be present in these areas in Turkey.
"We will build factories, but we must have a clear horizon in this area", he said.
Ahmet Erdem, President of Shell Turkey, said that Turkey is one of the 10 priority countries for Shell.
We believe in Turkey's potential and future with all our heart.
We have invested in many areas, primarily energy, and we continue to do so.
We thank our President, Prime Minister and Ministers for their efforts to support international investors.
There are studies that provide confidence for international investors.
"This will increase the competitiveness of our country", he said.
Sandoz/Novartis Turkey and Middle East Region President Dr. Altan Demirdere said, "Our Global CEO was supposed to come to Turkey on August 10".
But the trip was postponed.
We fought it.
Because the CEO's arrival was very important.
They've made requests for bulletproof cars, bodyguards.
Then he came here and saw everything was normal.
He left the guards and the car and returned to his country happily.
Investing in a country is like getting married.
First, you make a promise, and if all goes well, you get engaged and then you get married with a long-term plan.
We're married to Turkey and we have no intention of getting a divorce.
He's turned over the edge of the cliff!
Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım teleconferenced businessmen at the consultation meeting on "Those who trust Turkey, those who produce in Turkey" held by the Istanbul Chamber of Industry at the Swiss Hotel.
Prime Minister Yıldırım said that the sector that will provide Turkey's comparative advantage is the industrial sector, "We should not miss the transition process to 'Industry 4.0' in the industrial sector".
"If we want to be the locomotive of our country and achieve the 2023 targets, we have to think about the industrial revolution, together with the information and technology revolution, and achieve this too", he said.
"Those who are trying to destroy the future of our country, those who are trying to destroy its democracy, those bastards who are not afraid to bomb our Gazi Parliament, if they were successful, we would be talking about another Turkey today", Prime Minister Yıldırım added.
We were going to talk about a Turkey in the third world, where the government was taken over by the coup, national will was eliminated and the world fell out of the league of developing countries.
"Thanks to Allah, the intelligence of our people, the wisdom of our commander-in-chief, our president Mr. Recep Tayyip Erdogan and the determination of our government, we have defeated this scourge", he said.
Prime Minister Yıldırım continued: "We will get out of this incident quickly and look ahead".
It's never and never right to live with constant shock.
We have ambitious goals ahead of us.
This coup attempt did not shake the Turkish economy.
Once again, those who expected chaos and crisis were wrong.
Today, our democracy and our economy are in very good shape.
Our banking sector, our financial sector continues to function in a healthy way.
In 2015, the foreign trade deficit seems to have fallen by 25 percent.
The current account deficit ratio to national income was 5.8 percent in 2014, but has fallen to 4.5 percent in 2015.
We're aiming to get it down to four by the end of the year.
We will never change our firm stance on public finance.
Turkey's 2016 budget was also higher than the national income of 130 countries.
We have reduced the national income ratio of the budget deficit from over 11 percent to 1.3 percent in 2015, and we are working to maintain these ratios.
We're better off in public debt than the EU, than most countries in the world.
Our banking and financial sector is operating on a sound basis.
"Our central bank has not felt the need to issue currency to the market despite July 15 and there is no possibility of any reduction in our reserves, we have gross reserves of over 121 billion dollars".
"We are also making comprehensive arrangements to get rid of your burdens towards the past", said Yıldırım.
We have made and continue to make many adjustments, from stock forgiveness to cash surpluses and unpaid tax liabilities, until we can once again bring about a relaxation and a taxation.
"You continue to produce for the country, continue to trust your country, and your government will continue to remove the obstacles in your path one by one".
Hakan Şükür's father was hospitalized for high blood sugar
Sermet Shukur, the father of Hakan Shukur, who was detained in Sakarya during the operation against the FETÖ/PDY terrorist organization, was taken to the hospital after his blood sugar increased during the interrogation.
Former national football player Hakan Shukur and his father Sermet Shukur were arrested yesterday evening as part of the operation launched by the Sakarya Republican Prosecutor General's Office against the FETÖ/PDY terrorist organization after the July 15 coup attempt.
Sermet Shukur, the father of Hakan Shukur, who was detained in Adapazarı during Friday prayers, was taken to hospital after his condition worsened during the interrogation.
Sermet Şükür's treatment continues at the Sakarya Training and Research Hospital after he was hospitalized due to a rise in his sugar level.
Turkey is not breaking away from the West, it is not giving up on the European Union.
Mehmet Şimşek: Turkey is not breaking off from the West, it is not giving up on the European Union
Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Şimşek, Minister of Science, Industry and Technology Faruk Özlü, Minister of Economy Nihat Zeybekci attended the meeting on "Those who trust Turkey, those who produce in Turkey" organized by the Istanbul Industrial Chamber (ISO).
Speaking at the meeting, Minister of Science, Industry and Technology Faruk Özlü said, "I think that many good results have come from the developments that took place on the night of July 15 and after".
The most important of these is undoubtedly the spirit of unity and solidarity that all of Turkey is feeling deeply at this time.
The July 15 process showed how strong the dynamics of the Turkish economy is and how much the society internalizes democracy.
"It is clear that for a society that has reached this level in economy and democracy and democracy, the process will be better, easier and faster from now on", he said.
"Turkey needs to be saved from this situation"
Economy Minister Nihat Zeybekci said that the government has declared mobilization in this regard, saying that they are finding it difficult to explain to the world the attempted coup of July 15 that came from the podium of Faruk Özlü.
Zeybekci also mentioned the interest rate cuts that banks have started in the recent period, saying, "If 63.4% of the profit of my top five hundred real sector goes to interest, we should give up all our work and concentrate on this work".
That's why our president keeps saying it.
Turkey needs to get out of this mess with its real sector, its banking system, its government, its politics, the unity and solidarity that politics has shown after the 15 July Turkish civil democracy revolution.
We welcome the recent developments in this regard.
"We hope that in the coming period, we will support the sustainability and continuity of this competition, which started downwards like the zero percentage point nine, eight, which the banks started with the encouragement of our President", he said.
"A good passport is our right to the land".
"In the coming period, the world will win, we will be the kepçe", Nihat Zeybekci said, "Under the leadership of our president and prime minister, we will not leave a country untouched, we will not leave a door unopened".
We're not letting anyone we haven't contacted about growing our business.
"We will never, ever ignore it; we will not be one of the birds in the field as we chase after the bird in the branch".
Zeybekci also stated that in the future, exporters will be given green passports, saying, "One of the latest decisions is that its law has been issued, and we have now finished its regulation in the ministry of economy; we will give the privileged green passport representing this country to approximately 17 to 20 thousand exporters, at the behest of our exporters".
"The government must be the judge of those who are in the process of entering the society".
Speaking about the coup attempt of July 15 and the subsequent declaration of the state of emergency, Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Şimşek described the coup attempt as a 'cabus' and said, "But it was behind us, now we have to look ahead".
"Of course, those involved in this confrontation, those involved in this coup attempt, need to be purged from the state and this process is working; but more importantly, serious administrative reforms were needed to prevent such coup attempts from happening again", Şimşek said.
As a necessary climate for this administrative reform, a state of emergency was declared and so far very serious structural reforms have been carried out.
"We have acted in accordance with democratic principles and the rule of law, and we will continue to do so", he said.
Expressing that life is returning to normal in many areas, Şimşek stressed that companies and individuals who have not been involved in the financing of terrorism have no reason to worry.
"I think the foundations of democracy in Turkey have been strengthened; because when you look at the roots of the recent past problems, you will see that this network of betrayal is definitely in the works.
"So the purge of this terrorist organization from the state, the closing of this period in Turkey will strengthen Turkey's democracy", he said.
"Turkey has returned to its original agenda, there is progress in structural reforms", said Şimşek, who said that the economy's foundations are generally sound and that they have returned to their normal structural reform agenda without wasting any time.
We can't do structural reforms if we don't already have them, because populism, protectionism is increasing in the world.
"Turkey can only prepare for the future by reforming", he said.
Finally, Şimşek stressed that Turkey will not break away from the West, saying, "Turkey may sometimes disagree with our Western allies, our friends; but Turkey does not break away from the West, does not give up the European Union".
He jumped into the sea from 25 meters and...
In Antalya, 17-year-old Shamil Tayyar Bayrakci was hospitalized after he jumped from a 25-meter high cliff called 'Kartal Tepesi' into the sea.
Shamil Tayyar Bayrakçi, who was swimming with his friends in the evening hours on the Konyaaltı coast, then jumped to fish from the 25 meter high cliffs known as "Eagle Hill" under the variant.
Professional swimmer Shamil Tayyar Bayrakci injured his neck as a result of the impact with the water.
The flagship, who had difficulty navigating at sea, was escorted to shore by her fellow swimmers, who were also professional swimmers.
After the incident, health officials took Bayrakçi to Antalya Training and Research Hospital in an ambulance.
The flag bearer, who was treated, was recorded as not in danger of life.
A friend of the flagbearer who testified to the police said, "He injured his neck when he jumped from Eagle Hill to fish".
"We didn't see it coming", he said.
25 dead - The newspaper Sözcü
The settlements in the town of Sarmada, which is located in the Syrian province of Idlib, about 10 kilometers from the Cilvegözü Border Gate in Reyhanli County, Hatay, were hit by the regime's planes.
Local sources report that 25 people were killed and 40 others were injured in the attack.
The Sarmada town, which is under the control of the opposition, was attacked by regime planes in two separate attacks at noon and evening.
Local sources said the airstrikes targeted residential areas and killed 25 people.
The blasts were heard from Reyhanli, and 40 people were injured in the attack.
President Erdoğan elected Kaya to the YÖK!
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has elected H. Abdullah Kaya, Deputy Minister of Finance, as a member of the Higher Education Council (HEC).
In a statement, the Presidency said that "the members of the Council of Higher Education, which became vacant due to the resignation of Seyit Ahmet Baş, have elected the Minister of Finance, H. Abdullah Kaya, as a member of the Council of Higher Education, in accordance with the provisions of Article 6 of the Higher Education Law No. 2547".
On the other hand, President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has approved the "International Labour Law" numbered 6735.
The statement made from the Press Center of the Presidency stated that "The International Labour Law No. 6735 has been sent by the President of the Republic to the Prime Minister for publication in accordance with the first paragraph of Article 89 and the second paragraph of Article 104 of the Constitution".
Two brothers killed in gunfire in Kahta
Two brothers who were attacked in a car in Kahta County, ADIYAMAN, lost their lives.
The incident occurred on Mustafa Kemal Street in the evening.
A 39-year-old man, Ramazan Karahan, was driving to the county center when a gunman opened fire on him.
The car, which lost control of the fire, stopped after crashing into another vehicle.
Meanwhile, the man who came to the car shot Ramazan Karahan and his brother, 50-year-old Omer Karahan, in a series of gunshots.
The Karahan brothers were seriously injured, and the assailant fled the scene on a motorcycle.
Police and medical teams have been dispatched to the scene.
The Karakan brothers, who were seriously injured, were taken to Kahta State Hospital by ambulance.
Omar and Ramazan Karahan were treated in the emergency room but could not be saved despite the doctors' best efforts.
While the bodies of the two brothers were being put in the morgue for autopsy, the police, who examined the mob and security cameras in the area where the incident occurred, began work to identify and capture the fugitive assailant.
Britain must channel the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow.
Heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity not just to our local communities and London, but to the whole country.
I think this will make Heathrow very attractive, just like London 2012, where we did an incredible job of making sure that all nations and all regions could benefit from the Games.
The Olympics have brought great benefits to Stratford and the East End.
And we're going to do it again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
10,000 new internship opportunities for our local communities alone, 40,000 new jobs, and we're not going to leave any young people out of work around the airport.
As London was before 2012, there will be those who think the battle to expand Heathrow is too difficult.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the Games and that we would be the envy of the world.
The skeptics were wrong about 2012, and they'll be wrong about Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers all the questions that are asked.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for many, not just a few.
The expansion will create 180,000 new jobs and £211 billion economic growth opportunities and leave many skills and job opportunities both around the airport and across the UK.
At Heathrow, we have a great team that has put in place an infrastructure investment worth £11 billion, on time and on budget, for the world's busiest dual-runway, from T5 (which has been voted the world's best airport terminal for five years in a row) to T2.
We are now ready to offer a third runway backed by private investment of £16 billion.
The London 2012 Games were a great success for the UK, and I have no doubt that the Heathrow expansion will be too.
It's time to channel that Olympic spirit into Heathrow's expansion, to secure our commercial future and create many skills and jobs that Britain will be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton, chairman of the Heathrow board and former Commercial Secretary to the Treasury
Adblock Plus, Facebook's "cat and mouse game" on ad blocking
For companies that make money from online advertising, attempts to block adware are like a "cat-and-mouse game", according to one of the software companies.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced it would block ad blockers on its desktop site, Adblock Plus published a blog post saying that users can update their filters to block ads on the social network.
On Tuesday, Facebook said it would change the code around ads to make it harder for ad blockers to identify which part of the page is an ad.
But now Adblock says it's cracking the new codes.
In a blog post, Adblock spokesperson Ben Williams wrote that "this back-and-forth battle between the open source ad-blocking community and those who try to prevent them has been going on since ad-blocking was invented", and that Facebook may soon be producing its own solution.
The world's largest social media company's entry into this fight shows just how much concern ad blockers are creating for the industry.
Last year, a study by Pagefair and Adobe found that globally, about 200 million people use ad blocking software, which is four times the number of people who used ad blocking software in 2013.
With 1.03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook on mobile devices, mobile ads now account for 84 percent of Facebook's advertising revenue.
A spokesperson said that mobile ad blockers are not effective for Facebook's mobile apps and Instagram, so the company has been going after desktop ad blockers.
If Facebook thinks this kind of move is worth the investment, then desktop ads should still be able to generate enough revenue.
Also on Tuesday, Facebook announced that it would update its "advertising preferences" tool to better enable people to control the ads that are presented to them.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblock's new filters were worrisome, and that they would block some of the non-ad content on the site.
A Facebook spokesperson said in an email statement, "These people are not getting a good experience, and we plan to address this issue".
Ad blockers are a blind tool, so we're focused on building tools like Ad Preferences to give people control.
A woman runs into a Swiss highway in what appears to be a suicide.
The victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are looking for witnesses to a multi-car collision on the highway with the woman early Thursday morning in what appears to be a suicide.
The incident occurred just after midnight on Thursday on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud.
Police in Vaud said in a statement that the woman lay "hopelessly" on the ground in the dark of night and was struck by several vehicles.
A 49-year-old Swedish woman who was clearly trying to commit suicide was hit by several vehicles, including a truck.
He died at the scene.
The police said that they had interviewed some of the drivers involved in the incident, but that some of them could not be identified and asked them and everyone involved in the incident to contact them.
Lawyer Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Genève that "a criminal prosecution has been opened as a 'logical' step to take in such cases".
It is not yet known if the drivers involved will face any charges.
Was it possible to avoid the collision?
That's what the prosecutor has to determine", Hofstetter said.
Two similar cases in the past five years show that drivers can't be held accountable.
In both cases (both involving a person who went out on the freeway in the dark), the newspaper ruled that it was normal for drivers not to wait for a lane to cross at midnight on the freeway.
Last year, in August 2014, a police officer who killed a man on the A1 near Paynerne by crashing into him while he was asleep was found not guilty of causing death by negligence.
In court, the 22-year-old victim was drunk and fell on the road.
The court found that the police officer who was responding to an emergency call had used the vehicle reasonably and that the presence of a man on the road was "a completely exceptional and unforeseeable situation".
Anyone with information about this incident that occurred near Morges on Thursday should call the police on 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was once habitable
According to new NASA climate models, Venus once had conditions that were suitable for life.
Scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies have developed a model to explore the past of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus once hosted conditions similar to those on Earth, with a warm, waterless surface and an atmosphere full of CO2.
Scientists have in the past explained Venus's slow rotation by its thick atmosphere.
But the latest estimates suggest that Venus may have had a thin, Earth-like atmosphere and yet it may have been slowly spinning.
The model also looked at the topography of ancient Venus.
Although it has more dry land than Earth, it may have once had sufficient water and geographical variability to protect it from rapid evaporation.
Old Venus also benefited from a 30% dimmer sun.
"In the GISS model simulation", said Anthony Del Genio, a GISS scientist, "Venus's slow rotation caused the day side to face the sun for almost two months each time".
This would heat the surface and cause rain to form thick layers of clouds that act as an umbrella to protect the surface from solar heating.
As a result, the average climate was only a few degrees cooler than it is today.
The model allowed for a similar story of evolution for Venus to be constructed, which planetary scientists had previously hypothesized.
Although it once had conditions suitable for life, Venus has been subjected to too much heat and ultraviolet light over the course of a few billion years.
The oceans evaporated and the water vapor burned away with ultraviolet light.
Hydrogen was exhausted, leaving behind only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide, a deadly greenhouse gas, Venus as we know it today.
The researchers have shared the results of the new Venus climate model in the Geophysical Investigations Papers.
Patrick Roy has resigned as Avalanche's lead broadcaster.
Patrick Roy resigned as assistant coach and president of hockey operations for the Colorado Avalanche on Thursday, saying the team had no say in the decision-making process.
Colorado executive vice president/general manager Joe Sakic confirmed the development and said the club would immediately begin looking for a new coach.
"For the past three years", said Roy, 50, "I have served the Colorado Avalanche as head coach and vice president of hockey operations with energy, passion and determination".
I spent the summer thinking about how I could give this team the depth it needs to improve and take it to the next level.
To do that, the coach and the VP of hockey operations' vision must be in perfect alignment with the vision of the organization.
And he should have a say in decisions that affect his team's performance.
At present, these conditions are not met.
Sakic, who added Roy to the team on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contributions to the team.
Sakic said, "Patrick informed me of his decision today".
We thank him for all he has done for our organization and wish him luck in the future.
Roy was awarded the Jack Adams Award as the league's top coach in his first season with the Avalanche in 2013-14.
He scored 112 points and led the team to a first-place finish in the league, but Colorado lost to Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs and missed the postseason in both years.
The Avalanche surpassed their 39-39-4 mark in 2015-16 to finish five points short of the second wild card spot in the Western Conference.
Roy, a goalie on the Honor Roll, won four Stanley Cups, two for the Montreal Canadiens and two for the Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers suspended strike and continue talks
The strike was suspended due to the North Sea oil workers' wages, and the chief negotiators began discussions for a new round of talks.
The strike against the oilfield services company Wood Group is being staged on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
A joint statement said, "The Wood Group and the Unite and RMT unions have decided to restart the process for the resolution of the current dispute".
Over the next few weeks, starting next week, we're going to have a series of meetings, all day long, to try to take a fresh look at the issues.
The unions said that this protest against the salary cuts, which could reach 30%, was their first action in 25 years.
Wood Group has cut payments to its North Sea shippers by approximately 9 percent this year due to negative market pressures.
After this process of reducing the company's wages, a price reduction of 10 percent was applied to the shippers on the coast in 2014.
The company said the additional cuts would give the company the space it needs to weather the market's troubles.
Shell has laid off thousands of people as it consolidates its operations in the process of merging with British energy company BG Group and has announced plans to end oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries.
Energy companies are pressing for gold because of low crude oil prices, an economic situation that has been created by Britain's decision to leave the European Union in June.
Scottish MP Dave Anderson will meet with labour leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labour disputes in the North Sea.
As he says, the North Sea is vital to the regional economy.
In a statement, he said, "We need an economy that works for the majority, not for the minority, in the North Sea and across the country".
Despite an average investment of nearly $7 billion over the past five years, in 2016, less than $1.4 billion is expected to be invested in new projects in the North Sea.
Kepler has measured the rotation of the stars in the constellation of Ulcer.
The Kepler space telescope, with its latest mission, has helped astronomers build the most complete catalog of the rotation rates of stars in the constellation Ursa Major.
The new data is helping astronomers understand why stars in the constellation rotate at different speeds and how their rotation patterns are related to planet formation.
Luisa Rebull, a research scientist at Caltech's Center for Infrared Processing and Analysis in Pasadena, said in a news release, "We hope to learn more about the relationship between a star's mass, age, and even the solar system's history when we compare our results with those of stellar clusters".
The Ulcer constellation is 445 light-years from Earth.
Most of the stars in the constellation formed 125 million years ago and are reaching new levels of maturity.
They're spinning at the highest speed they've ever been in their lives.
At peak rotation speeds, stars in this maturation phase generate large amounts of stellar wind.
These winds cause the stars to be refracted as they move through their magnetic fields.
As a star ages, its rotational speed begins to decline.
Kepler measures the rotational speed of each star by tracking the time between the appearance of detectable star spots, such as sunspots.
The latest spin speed catalog suggests that larger stars spin faster than smaller ones.
Rebull likened the stars to dancers, stating that the larger ones performed their one-legged turns more slowly than the smaller ones.
Rebull said, "We find that the slow-spinning ones are much heavier and the fast-spinning ones are very lighter stars in the 'head' of the galaxy".
Because it is so close to the constellation of Ulster, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory for comparing stellar properties and rotation speeds.
Rebull said "the young and old Ulcer constellation provides theoretical models for stellar rotations in both directions".
There's more we want to know about how, when and why the rotation speed of stars falls, or why they leave their dancing shoes in the corner.
Rebull and colleagues have detailed their latest analysis of the rotational speeds of the Ulker constellation in three new papers soon to be published in the Journal of Astronomy.
