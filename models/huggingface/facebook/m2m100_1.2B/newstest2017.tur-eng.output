28-Year-Old Chef Found Dead in San Francisco Shopping Center
The 28-year-old chef, who had recently moved to San Francisco, was found dead on the staircase of a local shopping mall this week.
But the victim’s brother stated that he didn’t think there could be someone who wanted to hurt him, saying, “Finally, things went well for him.”
The San Francisco Forensic Medical Agency said on Wednesday morning that the body found at the Westfield Shopping Center belonged to Frank Galicia, a 28-year-old San Francisco resident.
The San Francisco Department of Security said the cause of death was found to be murder and that the investigation is ongoing.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told ABC station KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who previously worked as a chef of the kitchen department in Boston, started working as a chef of the San Francisco Sons & Daughters kitchen department six months ago, finding his dream job.
Sons & Daughters officials said the death "turned them into a mess and they are extremely saddened."
“We’re a small team working here like a tight family and we’ll miss him very much.”
We would like to point out that Frank’s family is not alone at this difficult time and our prayers are with them.
Louis Galicia noted that Frank originally stayed in hostels and said, “Finally, things went well for him.”
Louis Galicia told KGO, “He owned an apartment and went out with a girl.”
Louis Galicia said he didn’t think he might be someone who wanted to hurt his little brother.
He was a gentle man with a big heart.
The way to connect with the family was always to prepare a plate for us, to cook for us,” said Louis Galicia.
He did not like to argue.
My brother adjusted to every situation.
He said, “While everything else in the world goes dull, it is that unprocessed diamond that shines brightly every day.”
Those with the information were asked to call the SFPD News Line on the phone number 415-575-4444.
Assistant doctors on strike: new calls to slow down jobs
Representatives of the assistant doctors asked their unions to give permission to slow down work over the dispute over a new contract.
The British Association of Physicians (BMA) Assistant Physicians Committee (JDC) has called on the general council to support more work slowing action from the beginning of September.
JDC said ministers could not address concerns about the contract.
Assistant doctors and medical students voted withdrawal in their contract agreement with BMA.
This was rejected by 58% of voters.
In an article posted on Twitter on Thursday night, JDC chairwoman Ellen McCourt said the government “insisted on being silent” about the issues that caused the deal to be rejected.
He said: “In light of this, the JDC Board of Directors voted to completely reject the proposed new contract and called for formal negotiations to be restarted on concerns.”
In response to the government’s silence, the JDC management issued a formal request for the BMA Board to allow a program to increase the slowdown of business from the beginning of September.
The disagreement caused assistant doctors to participate in six strikes this year, including the interruption of the first topic in NHS history.
BMA’s assistant doctor leader, Dr. Johann Malawana, resigned after voting to withdraw from the BMA’s proposed contract terms.
During the pre-voting meetings of 54,000 doctors and medical students, assistants told BMA members that this was a good deal to be accepted.
Following the vote, Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said the agreement would be implemented in a way that would apply to doctors in the UK.
Russia and Turkey: an alliance of disadvantaged?
This is an end to the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and announce the official end of the eight-month war, which continued with words and economic sanctions.
But as Vladimir Putin greeted the Turkish leader in the spectacular hall of the St. Petersburg Palace, I got the obvious impression that Ankara was the party that most wanted this compromise.
His hand was stuck, yes.
But Mr. Putin’s smile was quite weak, and it could not be said that even against his own limited standards he emitted any heat.
On the contrary, Recep Tayyip Erdogan has repeatedly referred to his “good friend” Mr. Putin; according to one report, five times.
I was surprised by the number.
He also promised that relations with Russia will not only return to pre-crisis levels, but will reach much higher levels.
The next day, in a newspaper here, Mr. Erdoğan acted as if nothing bad had ever happened.
I think his excitement showed the opposite.
But the cold intimacy surrounded by Mr. Putin showed that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the first thing he mentioned in his statement at the opening was the cause of the crisis: Turkey’s shooting down a Russian fighter aircraft on the Syrian border.
The reaction from Russia was violent.
Putin accused Ankara of knocking Moscow by the back.
The outrage was much greater, the opposite side was thought to be a friend.
It will be difficult, impossible, to rebuild true trust.
Since November, the opinion of the Russian people has also changed.
The state-controlled media has targeted Ankara in a shocking and aggressive manner for months.
Suddenly, the culprit of everything became the Turks.
The most serious of these were the accusations by senior officials that Mr. Erdogan’s family made profits from illegal oil trade in areas under the control of the alleged Islamic State in Syria.
He definitely denied it.
But the official message from St. Petersburg was that it was time to move on.
In the end, the reason for this meeting was that Mr. Putin received the apology he demanded from President Erdogan.
Russia can see this as a victory.
The benefits of calling for a ceasefire for Ankara are clear.
First of all, Erdogan needs friends after the failed coup that took place last month and will almost lead to its overthrow.
The repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey also affected him very much.
There are also economic reasons.
The sanctions imposed by Russia have been tightened, in particular the ban on special flights that carry several million Russian tourists to Turkey’s coastal regions each year.
That number has fallen by almost 90%.
In Russia, tour operators and rental companies are also definitely relaxed with the continuation of flights.
They are closed to the end of the season in the Mediterranean.
And this week, state television predicted a decline in the prices of fruits and vegetables with the resumption of imports of Turkish agricultural products.
If we quote from the Vedemosti newspaper, “Tourists there, tomatoes here.”
But the visit had a separate political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry at the West for not finding sufficient response to the coup attempt.
When the anger that has been felt for a long time because of the rapid progress of talks on joining the United States is added, Mr. Putin, who wants to take advantage of Turkey’s rupture of ties with the West and the cold between them, comes into action.
The Russian leader appears to have gathered sympathy from Ankara due to the call for support from elected officials after the coup attempt.
It should not be forgotten that this was an inevitable attitude for Moscow, which itself carried a profound fear of regime change.
This summit, held in this spectacular palace on the shore of the sea, represents a “alliance of disadvantages” as Russia and Turkey explained to me by an analyst: it unites the forces of two countries that the West has rejected and badly treated.
Nevertheless, despite this displayed image of compromise, they are quite different from each other.
One of the most important of these is Syria: Moscow shows itself as a mediator, but Russia and Turkey support different sides.
After the first talks that lasted almost three hours, the two presidents said they did not address the issue at a press conference.
While the Turkish president clearly avoided answering a question about these differences, Mr. Putin chose to draw gold on them.
There is no clear consensus on how to establish a common ground in Syria.
But after months of clearly continuing conflict – and given the absolute potential for disaster resulting from the NATO member Turkey’s shooting down of a Russian fighter jet – it’s definitely a good development for the two leaders to at least start talking.
The Royal Bank of Scotland is dismantling for customers outside of Scotland
According to the statement of the chairman of the executive board of the bank, the RBS brand will move to the back office position.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be shut down for customers outside of Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand is linked to the bank’s global goals.
Eight years ago, when he was almost sinking, he had to retreat and give up.
During this time, brand strategy experts used 'RBS' to protect other consumer finance brands.
This was supported by millions of pounds for many sponsorships, from the Six Nations ragbi championship to Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
But now, it was decided that it would be right to take the lead of more national brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used by Scottish customers, but no new starts will be made.
All references to RBS will be replaced by NatWest, except for the case of headquarters and stock exchanges in England and Wales.
The Ulster Bank brand is already in use for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are also smaller brands that will take on a much more dominant role for individual banking; Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
Mr. McEwan gave an interview on a tour for customers and staff in Inverness-shire.
The BBC told Scotland: "From now on, we will be a bank of more brands, and the RBS brand will no longer be our investor brand and the brand in which our staff are employed."
As the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
We are no longer global but local.
Each of these brands will stand out in a slightly different way in their community, and our staff will work with customers on behalf of these brands.
RBS has said it will not continue to sponsor the Six Nations Championship and is raising the profile of different brands in terms of sports sponsorship.
The chairman of the executive board said, “Now is the time to move to the concept of brand banking because (we were asking ourselves) how can we make it a better bank for customers?”
If we had said three years ago that we would be a great bank for our customers, and that we would offer these brands, I would have found it ridiculous.
But I think you will see a lot of change with the work we do and focusing not on ourselves, but on the needs of our customers.
We can reactivate these brands, so I think this is the right time.
Frankie Dettori won Predilection for the 3000th time in Newmarket
Dettori exploded champagne after reaching his 3000th victory with double success at Newmarket
Jokey Frankie Dettori won his 3000th victory in England at Newmarket on Friday.
On the local track, he reached this milestone by winning the second victory of the night with Predilection trained by John Gosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jokey to reach this kilometre rock in a run without English.
He follows in the footsteps of Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
Jokey, who has won three championships in Ghayyar before, said: "This is a special situation."
I was very excited for my family being here.
I’m really happy to have this work in Newmarket that I started 30 years ago.
This is not an important meeting, not a Royal Ascot – just an ordinary Friday night with 20,000 people.
I feel relieved and relieved.
Dettori accepted the manifestations by bringing Predilection after the victory
There were two jokes who reached this milestone in the handicap race: champion jokey Richard Johnson and retired jokey Sir Anthony McCoy, who won 20 times the championship and won over 4,300 in a record-packed career.
Lester Piggott has 4,493 victories in his career.
Frankie is one of the best jokes of our time, and it’s not surprising that he reached a mile of rock that only a few people reached before him.
A style-owner and a strong person, but a tactical mindset with elements that allow him to push heavier than others in the game.
He is an extraordinary representative of horse racing, and has attracted people to this sport for years with his excitement and charisma on the subject.
A few weeks ago, I told Frankie at Epsom he could have achieved his 6000th victory if he wasn’t just a jokey competing on weekends and big races.
Seriously speaking, Frankie has spent most of his 30 years racing in the UK winning that’s great to see.
He has a pretty exciting character and this is a very good feature for British races but beyond that is an outstanding jokey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated this milestone with the kicking movement of jumping and throwing it into a symbol
With many movements, from the race he finished by jumping, to the jumping by jumping to the landing, Frankie Dettori has been the symbol of British unobstructed runs for twenty years.
It was a road full of landings.
In 1996, he survived an airplane crash while winning many major races, including his famous "Big Seven" victory at Ascot, and was banned due to non-compliance with a drug ban.
Three years ago, he had trouble getting back from this six-month eviction process at first, but he showed that he had a strong character as needed to dismiss those who suspect him and get back to his best.
And it could continue for a while; Dettori had previously stated that he wanted to continue to compete until at least 50 years old.
Russian President Vladimir Putin resigns private pen Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly removed his private pen Sergei Ivanov from office.
Mr. Ivanov has been part of a close circle that Mr. Putin has trusted for many years.
The 63-year-old was now appointed as a special representative for environmental and transport issues.
In a statement from the Kremlin, Mr. Putin said he had "decided to terminate Ivanov's position as the head of the Russian administration", but no reason was given.
Anton Vaino has been appointed deputy to Mr. Ivanov since 2012.
Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in the capital of Estonia, Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the Department of International Relations of the renowned Moscow State Institute (MGIMO) and served at the embassy in Tokyo.
He was later interested in the presidential protocol and administration of government personnel; statements on the Kremlin website are in this form (Russian).
After his appointment, he told Mr. Putin, “Thank you for trusting me.”
I think the most important task of the administration is to support your activities as the head of the state in terms of enforcing laws and supervising the implementation of instructions.
On Friday, Putin told Russian television that he wanted Mr. Ivanov to resign and suggested Mr. Vaino to replace him.
Are the smiles convincing?
This is a move that amazed Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long served as one of Vladimir Putin’s closest allies and, like him, served the Soviet security forces of the KGB.
As a private pen, he was one of the most powerful people in the country.
During a meeting with President Putin and broadcast on state television, both of them stated that the private pen was resigned at their own will.
But despite the smiling poses given to the cameras, very few people here are convinced of this, especially at this time when parliamentary elections are approaching.
Is this a result of a kind of power struggle?
No one knows this yet.
But the official statement that a person who could be president would suddenly want to direct Russia’s environmental policy was greeted with great doubts.
According to the Kremlin’s website, Mr. Ivanov addressed Mr. Putin with the following words: “In a conversation at the beginning of 2012, I would like you to trust me for four years for this challenging – you might even call it problematic – task.
Well, apparently I served as a presidential private pen for four years, eight months.
Mr. Ivanov took over this task in December 2011.
He had previously served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the KGB state security forces like Mr. Putin.
At the end of the 1990s, while Mr. Putin was in charge of the Federal Security Forces (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Mr. Ivanov appointed him.
When Mr. Putin came to power, he described Ivanov as one of the five people he most trusted.
Since it was unconstitutional that Mr. Putin would be president for a third term, Mr. Ivanov was thought to be president after Mr. Putin's second term.
But this task was handed over to another close ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Mr. Putin became Prime Minister three and a half years later before he returned to the presidency.
Criminal Minds star Thomas Gibson fired after shooting producer
Gibson was involved in a physical fight on the set of the series in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produced the series, announced in a joint statement that he was fired.
Gibson, who plays private agent Aaron Hotchner, issued an apology on Tuesday before the announcement of his resignation.
There were differences and disagreements on seven creative topics.
In a statement, he said, “I am saddened that such an event has occurred.”
In a statement from ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, details of how Gibson's character could be removed from a group of FBI agents watching the show will be released in the future.
The 54-year-old actor, who previously starred in the situation comedy called Dharma & Greg, had been on the show since the first season in 2005.
In a statement released Friday, Gibson said, “I love Criminal Minds and have worked to give it my heart and soul for the past twelve years.”
I would like to stay until the end, but it is no longer possible.
I just want to thank the writers, the producers, the actors, our great team and, most importantly, the best supporters a program can have.
The show is expected to return to the screens on September 28.
The Mystery of the Fish in Banff Garden
A man living in the Banff district has sought help to identify the fish that appeared in the garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks these 75 fish could be sandfish carried by sea hose.
Living 500 meters from the sea, Bain posted his images on Periscope, hoping that someone would shed light on the appearance of two-inch-long fish.
Queensferry Pass: Bridge Now Connected to Fife
The £1.35 billion project needs to be completed by May 2017.
Engineers united the north and wing of the Queensferry Passage, meaning the bridge is now connected to the Fife.
This is the first of four closures between the "plane fans" to be completed around each of the three towers of the bridge.
The section of the bridge from the Fife is 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It consists of 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 support cables.
The £1.35 billion project should be completed by May 2017.
Economy Minister Keith Brown became one of the first people to walk from land to bridge to visit the facilities today.
He said: “This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Passage.
We are all witnessing engineering on a truly massive scale with this project using more than 30,000 tons of concrete for the construction of just this part of the bridge.
Despite the extraordinary size and weight of the bridge that closes the gap between the viaducts and the bridge drawing, this is a delicate work that requires extremely sensitive tolerances for this fit.
Overall, almost 79 percent of the total bridge layout is settled, the concrete casting of the first section of the bridge will take place today in Rosyth, meaning that the entire bridge will be ready to be lifted on the bridge.
Michael Martin, director of the Forth Passage and Bridge Contractors project, said: “In all bridge projects, the first closure is always a significant milestone.
In this outstanding project, this closure represents the lead in construction engineering.
After the final road map was also placed and connected to the level of the expanding North Tower, we had to close the gap on the north - or land - side.
This was achieved by pulling the northern viaduct to 700 millimeters south.
It was a very large but at the same time very sensitive process.
The reason for its size was that it was 222 meters long, weighed 6,000 tons, and had to be pulled at about 3 percent of the slope.
The reason for its sensitivity was that the tolerance values the team had to adhere to were very low, up to just a few millimeters on both sides.
Fortunately everything went well.
Moelfre Bay Rescue Team: Three Men 'Luckily Alive'
Three men are "lucky to survive" after falling from a fishing boat in Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station issued an alarm on Friday at 13:20 p.m. with English summer time after seeing the incident in the Moelfre Bay.
Three men were trying to swim to a safe area as their boats continued their own way.
Moelfre, the controller of the rescue ship, said, “We saw the boat drawing the right apartments for them and we were worried.”
He said, “We had gone away with strong winds until they were guided.”
Two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat, while the third man, 60 years old, fell tired and was found being held in a lighthouse without a helmet.
They were all taken to the rescue ship that was heading to the coast and brought to the rescue ship station.
Mr. Jones said: "The three men who fell into the water were lucky that they were alive and never injured.
The boat engine had an emergency stop cable, but it must have somehow broken off from the person who was operating the boat when the boat was on the ground.
Someone was watching them today.
A valuable type of hunting for health and happiness, Pokémon Go
It’s really amazing to see how the world has changed.
The fact that teenagers and children no longer go out to play games, preferring to spend their free time watching screens, has been a situation that most people have grieved over the past decade.
Pokemon Go encourages people to get up from the couch.
The time spent looking at the screens was first limited to television and eventually spread to video games and finally to smartphones.
Therefore, it’s really great to see that technology and outdoor movement are not mutually exclusive elements.
Of course, I’m talking about Pokémon Go, an app based on characters that was originally created for video games in the 1990s (later turned into cartoons, game cards and other by-products).
Like many other phenomena in popular culture, this new game came out in the US, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
Subsequently, presentations in other countries were postponed due to intense interest that caused overload on servers.
Within days, Pokémon Go has reached more than Tinder and almost the same number of users as Twitter.
How does it work?
To put it briefly, players take their smartphones, go out to search for Pokémon traced by GPS, and they can 'take a picture' of what they find (taking a screenshot on the phone) or 'catch them'.
He joined this madness by getting out of the couch to look for a generation that played the game at a younger age.
In the U.S., gambling produced a remarkable increase in the number of steps a “average” person takes every day.
Cardiogram, an app developed for the Apple Watch and tracking 35,000 users, recently that among those who followed the game in the two days after it was introduced to the Washington Post, the percentage of people who exercise for 30 days every day rose from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company doesn’t know who’s playing Pokémon Go; it can only see raw data at the exercise level.
Most public health campaigns that encourage people to “give 30 minutes of time”, “rise up from the couch” and “be active every day” have been ignored because most public health messages are boring and transmitted by people who seem disastrous.
But no matter how important the exercise is, it is not important.
Those who exercise regularly are less likely to develop cancer or depression.
Exercise helps with issues like weight control, high blood pressure and diabetes, and it has a long list of benefits that cannot be listed here.
But the beauty of Pokémon Go is that it takes people out to do something they enjoy.
In this way, three basic elements of health are met: movement, fresh air and entertainment with sunlight.
Some people can even make new friends during hunting.
As usual, there are also unsuspecting gamers looking for something to complain about.
And, of course, someone can knock on the door while walking.
What does it matter?
A great innovation was introduced.
While smart phone apps like Fitbit followed our moves, they did not give us a reason to exercise like this game.
The effect of innovation will pass and use will also decrease over time.
However, due to the success of Pokémon, many games will be released that will help people who are out there become more active, fit and healthy by combining apps and virtual reality with real-world activities.

Simone Biles wins gold medal in general assessment of female gymnastics
Forget the pressure.
Forget the excitement.
Simone Biles is immune to this.
Dynamics of jumping.
Comfortably in the machine.
Surprising on the ground.
Perfection at the beginning.
He is an Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast also completed the overall assessment first on Thursday, clearly showing the difference between himself and the rest of the world at the Olympics.
He scored a total of 62,198 points, much above the silver medalist and teammate of the "Last Five" Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.
Simone Biles from the United States performed in the balance instrument in the final of the general assessment of female artistic gymnastics at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Summer Olympics held in Brazil on Thursday.
Biles became the fourth and overall fifth American woman to receive the overall rating award back-to-back, announcing her name as the best of her generation and the best of all time.
He drowned in tears when the last volume was released, and the long journey he had set out to reach this main ended.
This achievement brought the sport to the same level as athletes like Michael Phelps, who could be seen once in every generation that brought the sport to new levels:
Biles has spent his last three years as one of the sport’s most successful, with a blend of ambition and precision that has allowed 15 world championship medals including 10 gold and 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton to call him “the best gymnast I’ve ever seen.”
A final test in Brazil awaited him; this competition was between him and the burden of high expectations, rather than between Biles and others in the field.
He would be disappointed to return to his family home in Spring, Texas, with less than a handful of gold medals.
Simone Biles, from the United States, left, and Aly Raisman, after receiving gold and silver medals respectively in the overall assessment of artistic gymnastics women at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Summer Olympics, held in Brazil, Thursday, August.
Biles won his first on Tuesday when he served as a celebration at the farewell party of retired national team coordinator Martha Karolyi.
Even if Biles insists on not looking forward at this long run to the summit, this is not exactly true.
The part, which also includes the emblematic transition of the ground exercise routine, is prepared with Latin music that will perfectly fit the street just outside the Rio Olympic Arena.
This is not a coincidence.
The girl, who was adopted by her grandmother and grandfather as a younger child and discovered by Boorman’s mother on a trip to a gym where Aimee Boorman coached her, became a force.
No one has lost any of the overall ratings since the summer of 2013; this is a series of wins that should continue as long as Biles wants.
If Mustafina took the lead in two rotates, it was temporary.
The balance instruments and field exercises that Biles took over the world championship had not yet been done.
He went ahead with 15,433 points in the balance instrument and crowned it with 15,933 points in the field exercise.
Raisman graciously embraced him while waiting for his final score, and as the vision that Biles once wrote in a blacklist came true, tears appeared around the glowing red, white, and blue eye makeup.
Raisman’s performance resembled a four-year performance where he shared the fourth place but later lost the bronze medal to Mustafina.
This time, the 22-year-old captain of the team, whom the Americans called "Nine", went ahead.
He overcame the place he overcame with a seemingly suspicious return from time to time, sending a kiss to the crowd after the exercise.
For 19-year-old Biles, the much-shared tweet he posted earlier this week now has a completely new meaning:
Three killed in car shooting while listening to music
In Phoenix's first serial killer case in a decade, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot while talking in a car and listening to music, according to police reports released on Thursday.
Officials said Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah was shot in a car parked on a garage road on June 12.
The report says the gunman shot eight hands while standing on the passenger side of the car and fled with another vehicle.
Police say the three murders did not appear to be robbery purposes because the assailant did not take adult victims’ handbags or $2,900 in cash.
Phoenix police spokesman Jonathan Howard, deputy commissioner, said the investigator was directed to investigate whether it was linked to the previous four attacks.
In nine attacks in neighborhoods of predominantly Spanish origin over a four-month period, a total of seven people were killed and two injured.
Earlier this month, Howard spoke to KPHO in the CBS business in a statement, “This happened in the settlement area in front of a house.”
The suspect is believed to have used several vehicles, including a brown Nissan in a model from the late 1990s, a black BMW in a model from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to disclose evidence that led them to conclude that the attacks were related to the same murderer and were carried out by the same murderer.
Ellis (33) was taken to the hospital due to her injuries and later died.
Liner (31) and Ellis's daughter Maleah died on the scene.
A witness told police that it was not unusual for them to listen to music sitting in a parked car.
Authorities also released a police report about the shooting at an empty truck half an hour before the three killings.
The researchers found the bullets, removed a bullet from a seat, and also detected the bullet particles in the engine compartment.
Mother of 6-Year-Old Microcephaly Patient: "It's Getting Better"
Like most six-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto loves singing, his toys and, of course, his mother.
But unlike her peers, Edmund has a microsophaly disorder, a genetic disorder that her mother Elizabeth Picciuto was unaware of during her pregnancy.
When I first came home, my first thought was I couldn’t do it.
I cannot do this.
I did not want it.
That’s not true, of course, but you want it.”
He and his wife Vincent were told that Edmund may never recognize them, or even survive.
Some doctors went too far to offer it to be placed in a care home.
Picciuto said: “My first reaction was to say that people don’t think I’m doing it anymore.
Edmund can walk with the help of a pedestrian.
Edmund could not sit or retire until he was three years old and still could not speak.
But he is slowly reaching some turning points.
He can walk and ride a bicycle.
She also loves playing and singing with her two brothers.
Elizabeth shows the sign language that Edmund invented to say, "Please sing to me."
Picciuto told CBS News, “We’re teaching her sign language.”
But this, as we know, says that it is not sign language, but that Edmund simulated his own signage.
Microcephaly can occur due to a number of different conditions; a genetic condition such as Edmund may be present and may be caused by infections created by viruses such as rubella and Zika during pregnancy.
Symptoms and the course of the disease can vary greatly.
It is too early to say how the lives of people with Zika infection will be affected by this condition.
Picciuto remembers the emotional burden created by the uncertainty of his future.
I was constantly asking what would happen.
What will be?
And he himself still does not know that.
In fact, I haven’t asked a question about the course of the disease for a long time since I didn’t expect anyone to really tell me.
But Picciuto is able to offer hopeful advice to mothers of babies with birth defects due to Zika.
He gets something better.
You know it will be better for you.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Louisiana rescues from heavy rain and water in Mississippi
Heavy rains and widespread flooding in Louisiana prompted the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday, with more rains expected until Saturday.
The National Weather Service that flooding occurred in countless rivers in the northeast of Louisiana and southern Mississippi, posing a threat of widespread water pressure following a heavy rainy stream.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said government officials were constantly in contact with local authorities and that support was on the way to neighborhoods affected by the situation.
Mike Steele, spokesman for the government’s Office for Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, said requests were made for high-water vehicles, boats and equipment.
Steele stated that only tons of straw were requested for the Tangipahoa neighborhood.
Up until Saturday, a majority of southern Louisiana will be under water pressure.
Weather services said in a statement that there could be up to 3 to 5 inches of rain in addition to the area.
In southern Alabama, there was a water pressure alert on Saturday as rain continued in the Mobile area.
Both are expected to hit record levels over the week on the Comite River near Baton Rouge in Louisiana and the Amite River near Denham Springs.
Predictor Alek Krautmann said both rivers could also underwater many houses in suburban areas near Baton Rouge.
He also noted that the water pressure flow in the Ascension neighborhood posed a threat because the flow of full rivers to Lake Maurepas would be slow.
Tickfaw River, located just south of the Mississippi state border in Liverpool, Louisiana, had already reached its highest level measured at 9 a.m. on Friday.
Rescue teams continue to rescue people from the floods in the Amite and Wilkinson accidents in southwestern Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and son-in-law were among those rescued near Gloster on Friday.
Hansford, 62, said the waters from Beaver Valley, normally 400 feet from home, rose rapidly during the night.
Another servant who was sitting nearby said he warned her.
Hansford said, “We woke up and the water continued to come.”
It came to me.
His wife told Hansford that this was the highest level he had seen on the skin in the 48 years he lived here.
Hansford said he and his family were handicapped and he was the only person who could swim.
Hansford said the three emergency workers were rescued by a large, military-style truck and taken to a fire station in Gloster where they were sheltered on Friday.
Krautmann said that as heavy rains continued, the flooding was "quickly spreading" and that authorities were considering issuing evacuation orders.
Krautmann said an observer near Livingston 13.75 inches of rain from midnight to Friday morning.
Krautmann said the soil had been saturated at high levels since Wednesday.
Authorities said the streets under heavy rains and water pressure are causing the need to rescue residents in the Tangipahoa neighborhood and shut down schools in five school districts.
CBS-based WWL that a female council member in Tangipahoa said 200 homes were under water pressure.
The calmers were evacuated and taken to two churches, but these are now under water.
Neighborhood chief Robby Miller said authorities have rescued 72 people and seven pets trapped due to rising waters.
Refugees were opened in the town of Amite and in the city of Hammond.

In the city of Hammond, Tangipahoa neighborhood, two dozen streets were closed due to rising waters, and offerings were offered to be taken by residents trying to keep water away from their homes and.
Lacy Landrum, the city’s chief administrative officer, said: “The last major water storm we’ve experienced was in March.”
It will be a similar event.
In Mississippi, Harrison Accident Emergency Manager Rupert Lacy said the rain continued steadily on the Gulf Coast.
He said there were reports of water pressures in several houses on Tuesday, but no reports have been made so far for Friday.
Keith Townson, director of Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has lived in the area for 40 years.
Townson said, “I’ve seen water where I’ve never seen water before,” and added, “and there’s still rain.”
Six-Year-Old Mahaj Brown Survived Philadelphia Attack
Police said a 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, the second incident in the city this week in which a 6-year-old boy was shot.
Mahaj Brown for CBS Philadelphia was diagnosed by his grandmother and grandfather.
His grandmother and grandfather said Brown had several gunshot wounds in the body, including the jaw, leg, arm, and stomach, but was conscious when he was taken to the hospital.
His grandmother, Delores Melendez, told the station, “She suffered too much, her little body was filled with bullets.”
I cannot believe it.
The boy was listed among those who kept his child in a critical condition in the hospital and underwent several surgeries.
The family told the station that he was expected to recover.

Several houses and vehicles in the area were damaged.
No arrests took place and policely examined the security cameras.
A six-year-old girl was shot in her arm by an accident while playing in front of her home in the West Oak neighborhood on Tuesday.
He is recovering and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
I’ve given this name to this year’s Women’s Olympic Gymnastics team and there’s more than one reason for this.
First, I have participated in all the Summer Olympics since 1984, and the United States has never been so dominant before.
Secondly: This team has three gymnasts who inspire many girls of different ethnic backgrounds: Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas, and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez.
The structure of this team, brought together by the Jewish Aly Raisman and Catholic Madison Kocian, makes everyone proud.
The team finally shows a similar look to America.
It also reinforces the presence of black and Latin women at the top levels of this sport.
In the last four years, the first female gymnast was always an African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were ranked 1 and 2.
This is a strong thing.
In recent Olympics, Gabby Douglas was a surprise Olympic champion and America backed him.
Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, who are three world champions, can now witness the extraordinary performance of their unexpected but skillful gymnastic routines.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth backward American to win a gold medal in the overall rating of women.
And his teammate Aly Raisman also won a silver medal.
We are introducing the best times of this sport, but this is not the case in gymnastics courses across the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie followed the same path as Aly and Madison in order to participate in the Olympic teams.
The reason they are the "Last Five" is that there will be only four gymnasts in the next Olympic gymnastics team, and this is the last year Marta Karolyi will coach.
But in reality gymnastics is a fairly expensive sport, and gymnasts work in private gymnastics clubs primarily supported by education, travel, form, competition, hotel fees (for coaches, gymnasts and families) and more, paid by parents.
Most of these gymnastics clubs are located in wealthy suburban neighborhoods that can outline these.
These clubs are the only place where gymnasts can get training and require a costly and long-term commitment to their families.
Simone Biles’ coach Aimee Boorman and Laurie Hernandez’s coach Maggie Haney have been training these athletes since the day they started gymnastics.
For the countless young girls affected by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, we do not offer communities more affordable and accessible gymnastics training opportunities.
I started my own gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
In my institutions, we have provided free and low-cost gymnastics training to over 15,000 youths (primarily black and Hispanic) in the city, based in Harlem, and have coached both national and international champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (where I grew up) to offer quality gymnastics training to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and take advantage of this wonderful Olympic sport.
Gymnastics improves the strength, flexibility and coordination of the body and provides features of mentally rigorous work, discipline and determination.
This combination offers long-term benefits in terms of health, school and job success.
It will be the inspiration this team will give, which will lead thousands of young girls to gymnastics, and that’s a great thing.
Participation in sports activities is very important, especially for girls.
We are going through really exciting times.
Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison are grateful for clearly demonstrating “The Power of Girls” by bringing the gold medal to their Olympic team and motivating many young girls from different backgrounds to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
After Jeremy Hunt's offer was rejected, assistant doctors decided to continue strikes
The ministers hoped that the dispute would end after an agreement was reached on the improved contract with the British Medical Association officials, but 58 percent of the 37,000 doctors who attended the vote voted against.
In July, Mr. Hunt announced plans to impose sanctions on the contract, stating that the NHS “is not owned by anyone” and that further delays would harm staff and patients.
The first group of assistant doctors was transferred to a new contract that included changes in working practices at night and on weekends to improve care outside of normal hours.
Dr. Ellen McCourt, chairman of the BMA’s Assistant Doctors Committee, said in a statement last night: “Assistant doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract; in particular, they think it will trigger the current workforce crisis and not adopt equal treatment for all doctors.”
The first group of doctors has only eight weeks to move into a new contract to make progress in this process and the time is about to expire.
BMA’s efforts to resolve the dispute by speaking were met with the government’s reluctance to intervene and, in some cases, its deafening silence.
This is an improvement seen despite Jeremy Hunt’s statement that last month’s door would always be open.
"Jeremy Hunt needs to act immediately, lift sanctions, and listen to the concerns of assistant doctors."
Assistant doctors clearly state that they are prepared to increase work slowing actions if they do not.
In the last strike that took place in late April, 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments were postponed, and nurses and consultants were forced to take care of the doctors on the strike line.
The ministers hoped that the dispute would end after the agreement on the improved contract was reached with the British Conservative Union officials.
BMA wants to improve week-end salaries for the contract-subject 54,000 assistant doctors.
NHS Employers Executive Board Chairman Daniel Mortimer urged assistant doctors not to go on any strike.
Mr. Mortimer said: “Stress does not solve anything, but it creates pressure on the team and services that are already busy, causing worry, discomfort and trouble for patients, caregivers and their families.”
Over the past two months, we have been holding talks with the Assistant Doctors Committee and, together with the Ministry of Health and other officials, have approached their concerns about the Observation Mission and Disclosure in a positive way.
Employers were hopeful that the continuation of positive communication on important issues such as distribution, educational flexibility, additional training for those who interrupt their careers, educational costs, mutual agreement on curriculum, educational-induced leave and gender pay gap in medicine, and acting in line with the agreements reached with BMA in November, February and May were a sign of how seriously it was taken by the UK Department of Medical Education and Health.
Drug That Could Eliminate Heart Attack Risk for £2 a Day
After authorities recommend giving it to more people for longer periods of time, thousands of heart attack patients could benefit from the drug costing £2 a day.
Preventing clotting, ticagrelor reduces the risk of recurring crises for people with heart disease.
The drug was administered for 12 months following the heart attack and reduced the risk of a stroke or other crisis.
The NHS observer, NICE, recommended giving it to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now the NHS observer, NICE, has suggested giving it to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Every year, around 140,000 people in the UK experience a heart attack, and a quarter of them experience another attack or stroke.
The cause of heart attacks and strokes is the accumulation of fatty substances and the formation of plaque on the arterial walls.
If the plaque breaks, it can cause a blood clot and cause a heart attack by preventing blood from flowing to the heart.
And if it gets out of the place of the scarring, the stroke occurs when it progresses in the bloodstream and blocks the blood flow to the brain.
Those who have had a crisis before are more likely to have another.
Created by the UK company AstraZeneca under the Brilique trade name, Ticagrelor reduces this risk by reducing the likelihood of scarring.
The draft NICE guide, published today, recommends that individuals be given 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months and then 60 mg of aspirin twice a day for three years.
Professor Carole Longson, executive at the NICE Health Technology Assessment Center, said: “Despite the availability of secondary preventive treatments, a quarter of those who have had a heart attack experience another heart attack or stroke, and the consequences are often devastating.”
Fear of recurrence can have a quite negative impact on a person’s quality of life.
Evidence suggests that the use of ticagrelor in conjunction with aspirin is effective in reducing the risk of recurrent heart attacks and strokes in people who have had a previous heart attack.
With the temporary recommendation of Ticagrelor, we are pleased to have increased the treatment options offered to thousands of people waiting to benefit from it.
Because there is limited information about the effectiveness and safety of Ticagrelor for more than three years, including the risk of bleeding, the draft guidance does not recommend treatment after this period.
PC Culture Increases Voting Corruption in Muslim Regions
Former mayor of Tower Hamlets, Lutfur Rahman, was removed from office last year following a government report on corruption
As the devastating government report presented today shows, the culture of political correctness has caused widespread voting corruption in Muslim communities to be ignored.
Former Cabinet Secretary Sir Eric Pickles dismissed police, election observers and the municipal palace due to "excessive sensitivity about ethnic origin and religion" because of ignoring evidence of election abuse.
The former community secretary and today’s anti-corruption tsar said voters’ digestion on religious grounds was so bad that police needed to be allowed to pull stripes out of voting cabins to protect fearful voters.
He suggested that voters carry their identities with them to prove their identity when they are voting.
In the present case, it is enough for the voter to say his name and address.
The report even suggests permanent ink on the finger during the voting process to prevent people from voting twice.
Sir Eric said those who were should be better protected.
He called for better access to the Bureau regarding board documents and decisions of unofficial committees or working groups.
"This is aimed not only to protect against electoral fraud, but also to protect the local government from the culture of corruption and financial fraud that deals with it," he said.
The report was prepared on the instructions of Downing Street following the Tower Hamlets poll scandal in East London.
Last year, a special election court ruled that Mayor Lutfur Rahman should be removed from office following repeated corruption and illegal practices.
The court found that Rahman had "inexorably abused the religious feelings of the Muslim community" and silenced those who criticized him with accusations of racism and Islamophobia.
“Rahman conducted his campaign on the basis that voting for him by believing Muslims was a religious duty.”
Up to 300 of the games were suspicious or the result of using a fake ID, that is, voting like someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud across the country.
He warned of corruption in voting, by mail – where the Muslim community allegedly pressured elderly individuals to vote on the island they chose.
Sir Eric made some suggestions to regulate the voting system, including having an identity card with them to prove who they are.
The report included the following statements: “There has been evidence that certain ethnic minority communities are being pressured to vote for valuable individuals, primarily women and young people, in accordance with the will of the elderly, especially in communities of Pakistan and Bangladesh.
“There were concerns that state institutions were ignoring such behaviors due to excessive sensitivity to ethnic or religious origin based on ‘political justice.’”
Sir Eric submitted 50 proposals to regulate the system, including preventing political activists from processing their voting papers by mail for the purpose of “gathering” votes.
The report, reviewed by Theresa May, also calls for tighter registration checks to prevent the use of voting money for immigration and social assistance corruption.
Consideration of the option that voters are required to demonstrate identity before voting.
Permanent ink on the fingers after voting to prevent any person from voting twice.
Performing systematic checks on the compliance of the person to determine the eligibility to vote.
A three-year limit applies to requests for voting by automated mail.
Prohibiting political campaign officials and activists from processing votes sent by completed mail and envelopes of votes sent by mail.
The police are given the authority to draw stripes around the polling stations.
Amendment of the law under the People's Representation Act of 1983 to facilitate the accusation of intimidation of people.
It is illegal to take photos in the polling stations.
The voting cabin (except for Wales) must only be spoken in English.
Strengthening staff training to enforce the rule of voters entering the cabinet alone.
Sir Eric brutally criticized the Police Department, saying it was “interesting” that no charges were made in the Tower Hamlets case.
“The electoral court has ruled that there is no place for Lutfur Rahman and his representatives to be charged with repeated corruption and illegal activities.”
He was found guilty for a number of reasons beyond reasonable suspicion – according to the nature of criminal evidence.
He also criticized the ineffective “blade marking controls” in the municipality’s electoral registry departments.
Sir Eric said: "Tower Hamlets' court ruling last year was a warning alarm.
While our nation has the pride of creating the mother of parliaments, the spread and rejection by some institutions of these disturbing and covert electoral corruptions can cause this good reputation to wane.
Becoming crazy for Kate's cyclist-like and other famous analogues of Rio Olympians
This week, Rio 2016 Olympic enthusiasts turned crazy for French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who proved to be impressively similar to the Duke of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympic athlete is not the only athlete to be noticed by his resemblance to celebrities while fighting for the gold medal this summer; at least the social media thinks so.
Therefore, in honour of the Rio Games and all the famous sims we see on our screens, FEMAIL has prepared a list of Olympic athletes that resemble Hollywood celebrities beyond resembling them.
The Hunter and the Wolf: Brady Ellison (left), a member of the U.S. Men's Artillery Team, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since his childhood
In addition to Kate’s similarity on the bike track, many people in the online environment have shown that a sniper can be as similar as a twin to Leonardo DiCaprio.
Brady Ellison, a member of the U.S. Men's Armoring Team, shook Twitter after photos showing her resemblance to the star of the Money Hunter movie appeared.
And the sniper also acknowledged this madness on social media, admitting that since childhood he has been told he resembles Leo.
Brady told the Huffington Post, “I don’t think there’s much similarity except hair and beard.”
“He’s a pretty guy, so I think that’s a compliment.”
There’s another similarity, one of London’s most popular comparisons of 2012, which will undoubtedly be even more remarkable this year: the incredible resemblance of British long jumping athlete Greg Rutherford to popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina is said to be similar to American artist Gloria Estefan of Cuban origin with large and meaningful eyes.
And in the pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been resembling Glee’s star Matthew Morrison for years.
Modification: This user indicates that Nathan is a "athletic version" of the Star of the Movie
Tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett have long been compared to each other because of the resemblance of their loud eyebrows and lips.
The Russian team’s silver medalist swimmer, actress Annalynne McCord, has the same bronze skin and yellow hair, while his fans from the U.S. team say Nathan Adrian “like the athletic version of Joseph Gorgon Levitt.”
Hard Women: Football star Hope Solo (left) and Dexter’s star Jennifer Carpenter (right) have a similar face shape and eyes
Not alone: One Twitter user was delighted that other people also noticed this similarity
A theory left in the air: This user thinks there might be a reason behind this couple being similar in appearance
One Twitter user brought to the site the joy he heard about "the rest of the internet also thinking that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are like twins."
In fact, the American football star and the actress who played in Dexter have similar facial shapes and eyes.
Other popular comparisons include Kerri Walsh-Jennings and the almost identical smile of actress Laura Linney with another golden medalist, Gabby Douglas, and the similar big smiles of the star of Youth Fire, Gabrielle Union.
CBC Olympic Speaker Apologizes for Commenting on Chinese Swimmer 'Dead Like a Pig'
Byron MacDonald’s analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan’s fourth place in the 4x200 m free race has angered those watching CBC’s live Olympic broadcast on Wednesday.
Canadian broadcaster CBC has been forced to apologize for one of its speakers’ comments that the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer was “wiped out like a bad smell” and “dead like a pig” during the competition.
Speaker Byron MacDonald thought the microphone was off when women began to explain their ideas in the 4x200m free-flag race final.
MacDonald, who was included in CBC's speaker team to add 'color', was heard to say the following: 'The 14-year-old little Chinese has a heavy bag, baby.'
He was too excited, wiped out like a bad smell and died like a pig.
Thanks for that.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan (14), finished the second leg of the flag race with a time of 1:57.79, leaving the Canadian Taylor Rack 1.61 seconds behind, enabling the Canadians to close the gap between China and Canada.
Canadian viewers quickly acted after being surprised by the tone and language used
“The CBC speaker just tweeted that the 14-year-old swimmer was ‘dead like a pig?’
The rebel did not realize that he was still on the broadcast."
Chinese Ai Yanhan described himself in the 4x200m Free Flag Race as follows: “14-year-old Chinese boy was heavy-driving, baby.”
Criticisms about Byron MacDonald were posted on Twitter quite harshly and quickly, and many were qualified to denounce him.
Twitter users couldn’t hold themselves when they heard how insensitive Byron Macdonald was acting
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: 'Wow #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and make us all look like racists.
Shortly thereafter, Scott Russel, who conducted CBC's broadcast, apologized for MacDonald's comment, saying, "We apologize for the comment posted about the swimming race."
These were really unfortunate words chosen, and we’re sorry for such an event.”
CBC had to apologize at least 90 times more than people who tweeted in response to the comment
Scott Russel, another speaker, was forced to apologize on behalf of MacDonald
CBC subsequently copied and paste this apology to over 90 Twitter users who submitted complaints about MacDonald’s comments.
The network quickly issued a statement apologizing.
We would like to express our sincere regret that these statements have been made and published.
Yesterday evening, we quickly apologized to our followers on our broadcasts, our viewers, and on social media.
We would like to clarify that Byron’s comments were not about the swimmer’s personality, but about his performance.
However, these were rather inappropriate and unfortunately chosen words, and Byron was extremely sad about what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald also apologized to the broadcast and attempted to defend his words by saying he did not want a personal assault.
He told CBC’s Olympic broadcast, “I want to apologize for a comment I made after the women’s flag race last night.”
“I was not referring to the swimmer’s personality, but to his performance.”
“I don’t need to say much, I didn’t want to disrespect, and I’m very sorry.”
Primark customer wept anger at a woman who desperately tried underwear in the middle of the store
Customers didn’t know what to do when a woman took off her clothes to try a shirt in the middle of the Primark store floor.
Worse yet, the woman looked at what it looked like in itself, took it out and put it back in the raft.
She continued to look after and then tried four pairs of underwear at the Bouverie Place shopping center in Folkestone.
The place where the woman tried her shirt before she repainted was the Primark store in the Bouverie Place shopping center in Folkestone.
Jenny Davidson, the mother of two children who were at the time in the store, said after trying the mysterious woman’s underwear, she “was dressed and left the store without buying anything.”
He said, “People couldn’t believe their eyes.”
He stood in the middle of the store and took a shirt from the vitrine, pulled off his shirted socks and pants and put on it.
"He didn't try to look for a special place to do this, he stood up with all his disrespect."
Everyone was looking at him as he took off his shirt and it seemed that he didn’t like the shirt because he put it back on the shirt.”
She tried three more clothes until she decided she didn’t like anything and then left the store, dressing again.
"Those who watched him didn't seem to care, and he didn't think about who would buy the shorts he tried on later."
Mrs. Davidson, 33, who lives in a town town, said, “How disgusting it is to think that someone will take out an unclean shirt that someone else wears and go home.”
The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidson added, “I think that the staff got out of the sale by finding the clothes after she left, and that’s a good thing.”
“When I get a new shirt and go home, it would be really bad to think that someone else was wearing the shirt and coming to me without washing it.”
A Primark spokesman said: “Primark is aware of the incident in our store in Folkestone on Tuesday, August 9.
The relevant product has been removed from sale.
How to Protect Yourself from Armed Attacks with Krav Maga
The outside world is quite dangerous, but this video offered by Dailymail.com can help you be safer.
We spoke with Rhon Mizrachi, the head of the New York-based Krav Maga Federation, to learn how to cope with armed robbers in close proximity.
Whether approaching you from the front or the back, this video will show you how to turn the situation against the thief.
Mizrachi says that when he approaches you from behind, the first thing you have to do is to turn your face and see the attacker and 'wipe off the line of fire'.
Then you will hold the gun between your forearm and your shoulder and hit your face with your empty elbow.
Then, when you kneel on your hips, the attacker’s pain will double, and at this stage you will turn the gun and take it from your hand and hit him in the face so that the gun is turned to him and the back of the gun remains up.
A similar technique is applied when an armed person approaches from the front: you pull your body out of the line of fire and grab the gun and turn it in a way that the attacker can’t shoot.
At the same time, you give your weight to the weapon, knocking the attacker from the chest area, turning the weapon and taking it from him and pulling the weapon back toward him.
Does it sound alien?
Watch the video to see how Mizrachi did this.
But remember, if you are not a Krav Maga master, the safest way to avoid any theft is to give your money to the thief.
Traveler Ian Wright takes his tongue to the dirtyest places in Europe for a travel guide
The British traveler sucked some of Europe’s dirtyest and most disgusting places and underwent a serious test of his immune system and his ejaculatory reflex.
The server and tour author, Suffolk Ian Wright (51), carried his tongue onto a Euro banknote, a Piccadily Sirki scratch, a train toilet siphon button, and a telephone with an ancestor in Russia to prove the power of the immune system.
He used a luminometer before licking each object to show him and us what kind of work he was doing.
But the experiment, which was to be turned into a film called The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, gave some surprising results.
While the idea of licking a trendy sifon button used by thousands of people is extremely disgusting, there are actually much more bad bacteria in the kitchen wash.
Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and medical experts during his trip to Europe about the increase in stomach bacteria and his health.
Fortunately, nothing he grinded produced any effect except the bad taste he left in his mouth.
Mr. Wright was known for testing his stomach’s endurance by traveling the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
This task, ranging from general scratches at train stations to toilet siphon buttons, definitely tested the immune system.
In a film about it, she said, “I’ve been a person who hasn’t paid much attention to my health since I was a child, and I’ve put a lot of things in my mouth, from soil to worms and clay water.”
During the film, he proved the reason for his fame.
The only thing he rejected was a dirty public toilet in Russia.
The production sample showed luminous counts of over 4000 units.
For comparison, the number of newly washed hands should be below 60.
But in newly washed hands it was a Russian public toilet where it refused to lick when its luminous count reached over 4000 units while it was below 60
Mr. Wright and Finnish dairy producer Valio have taken over the production of the tour movie, The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, which shows the number of bacteria in different places such as the bathroom.
He said in the film, “It’s almost one of the worst things I’ve smelled in a toilet.”
There can be nothing more dirty than that!
I don’t want to do anything because it’s disgusting.
The Lickhiker’s Guide to Inner Strength was developed in collaboration with Finnish dairy producer Valio.
The company supplied Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria as well as stomach bacteria and vitamins C and D, which help strengthen the immune system.
Niko Vuorenmaa, Valio’s Senior Vice President of Snacks, Fruit Juices and New Categories, said: “We wanted to offer consumers something really new.
The observation is something that is impressive and also explains the benefits of probiotics.
We did many crazy brainstorms where the idea of “Let’s look for Ian” finally emerged.
They claim that interest in stomach health has become a global phenomenon
Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to put the products in a much bigger connection; the good and bad bacteria around us on a daily basis, the importance of stomach health and its connection to the immune system.
Interest in stomach health is becoming a global phenomenon, and with this documentary we could provide consumers with more interesting information about this situation.
I also think that the movie shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added: “I would have lost my respect for him if Ian lied about things I wanted him to lick, like the disgusting Russian toilet shown in the film.”
While it was easy for Ian to lick some things naturally, some were quite difficult.
I’m glad that we’ve recorded some of these dirty licking acts.”
In a 2015 survey conducted by Valio, 84 percent of participants associated lactic acid bacteria with stomach health, and 58 percent said they used products containing lactic acid bacteria at least intermittently.
Maganda family destroyed social housing in Saltash, Cornwall before evacuation
A nice family left £50,000 in damage to the social housing they were evacuated because they intimidated their neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her wife Shaun Trebilcock were kicked out of their residence in Saltash, Cornwall after many complaints about Trebilcock’s rights.
When they were forcibly removed from the property, the housing association officials were surprised to see that the property could not be repaired.
Large holes were found in the walls, flooring boards were removed, garbage was thrown into the ground, and walls were inscribed.
The family has now been removed from the residence and is thought to have benefited from private accommodation options
Cornwall Housing housing manager Donna McEvoy said she feared the situation would be insurmountable.
He said, “This is really a nightmare for people here and I think people shouldn’t have to live that way.
There is a lot to take into account because this property will now be known as a very unpleasant part of Cornwall.
This family has a bad reputation and their names also have a bad reputation.
The family had three sons living in the intermediate estate, and according to the police, the family adopted many intimidating behaviors, including fighting with a baseball baston on the street, intimidating nearby residents, drug use, drug trafficking, and excessive screaming, quarrelling and contempt.
In June, an anti-social conduct was ruled for Skeldon (47), who was named in the Kira contract.
Old garbage was found in many rooms of the house that was thought to be destroyed.
In the past, the property for sale of drugs was removed.
Neighbors said they saw them fighting on the street and that the police were frequently calling for them.
Cornwall Housing forcibly evacuated her and her husband this week after recognizing that they were extended for 11 weeks to move voluntarily.
The evacuation was welcomed with joy by relieved neighbors who said their lives were turned into a nightmare.
Someone said, “Nobody cared about them.”
We’ve lived with them for 20 years and the situation has always been bad.
If you tell me how many times I’ve been there, you can’t believe it.
“This morning we couldn’t sleep.”
We woke up because it was so quiet; we’re not used to it!
They finally went away, and now everything will be great.
Adam Fitzpatrick, a neighborhood sanction officer at Cornwall Housing, said the family did not cooperate with the local government.
The family had been living in this house for 20 years and the property was often called to the police
Old plants and toys were dumped on the side of the social housing.
He added: “It’s really embarrassing that the tenant doesn’t take any responsibility for the evacuation of himself and his family; evacuation has always been the last option Cornwall Housing has resorted to.
This was a very difficult case because the behavior was extreme and its actions were so frightening that neighbors should not witness.
I highly appreciate the efforts of my team, the Devon and Cornwall Police Forces, and the courageously prominent members of the community to provide us with information.
I hope that this development will give neighbors some relief and be understood as a message that they will not tolerate antisocial behavior.
Mr. Fitzpatrick said he had three sons who lived on the estate at different times, but they were 20 years old.
After evacuation, a dirty bed left on the ground in one of the bedrooms of the house
Housing workers will have to clean the garbage that surrounds the house
In 2014, police found more than 70 grams of strawberries, strawberries, private items and £1,700 in cash by pressing on property.
Skeldon was fined after admitting his crime of possession of Class B drugs with the intent to sell.
He claimed that the money would be used to buy a tombstone for his son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After being homeless, it became apparent that Tanya and her husband are now living in a private residence in Plymouth.
There were walls on the walls of most of the rooms.
Police say they will work to evacuate tenants who violate rental rules
Angela Crow of the Devon and Cornwall Police Forces said the evacuator was also a warning for other tenants who continue to violate the rules.
He said, “This is also a message for those who think they can do what they want without any accusation and that their behavior will be wasted.”
The Devon and Cornwall Police Forces, which will continue to work with their partners to protect society, will never tolerate crime and antisocial behavior.
Tourists in Portugal were scared when a military plane flew down the beach.
Tourists in Aveiro, Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
The P-3C Orion aircraft of the Portuguese Air Force has flown from extremely low.
The air force said it was a training flight but insisted that there was no security risk.
This is the moment when tourists start to panic as the plane passes over the full beach.
In dramatic images, a military aircraft is seen approaching sunbathers on the sand in Aveiro, northern Portugal, almost at the contact level.
Travellers stood up because they were understandably worried about the noise generated by jet engines without seeing what was coming to them from the clouds.
The incident occurred in Costa Nova near Aveiro last afternoon.
Daniel Fernandes, one of several holidaymakers who shared a video of the dramatic close flight on social media, said: “Two times it really went down and it seemed like it was about to hit at one point.”
Nuno Arroja added, “I was surfing and I swear I felt like the plane was going to crash on me.”
Tourists on the beach in Aveiro fell in horror when the plane out of the dark began to fly at an extremely low figure
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats on the coast and had to go so low as it was the only way to control them.
The nearby extinguishing said the jet was flying lower than normal because of poor visibility due to the smoke from the power fire, but the air force insisted that no one’s safety was endangered.
This summer, extinguishing power fires have largely destroyed certain parts of Portugal’s mainland, killing four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese air force said today that the pilot must fly from below due to conditions that make it difficult for him to see (intense fog and smoke caused by power fires).
The plane was on training flight and was asked to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise.
London student killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British students who left London last year to join ISIS, was to have died in Syria.
Lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said his family had received information about Rakka’s death in Syria a few weeks ago.
ITV News on Thursday that he was believed to have been killed in a Russian airstrike on the group’s country-powered Rakka region.
Sultana was 17 years old and died while planning to flee the war-harmed country and return to Britain, according to her family.
“We hope this situation will stress that going to war zones as a grave stone and a testament for others is really risky and will break people’s courage to make this choice.”
In February 2015, two girls from Sultana and East London boarded a plane to Turkey and then a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultana’s family were told that he married an ISIS fighter in Syria and that he remained widowed for months.
Reid says he won’t give up Garland as Supreme Court candidate if Clinton is elected
Democratic leader Harry Reid in the Senate said he believes Democrats would nominate Judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court if the presidential candidate Hillary Clinton is elected.
Republicans in the Senate have been blocking Garland’s approval process since President Barack Obama nominated him in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said he will elect the new president to replace former Supreme Court Judge Antonin Scalia.
In a video speech on Thursday, Reid said he believed Clinton would choose Garland and “had reasons for it.”
Later, a spokesman speaking on behalf of Reid said he hadn’t spoken directly with Clinton about whether or not he would nominate Garland and that he was speculating.
He praised Garland and stated that Clinton's team did not want to "destroy the current situation" by making a new election.
Garland is the chief judge of the U.S. District Court of Columbia.
Reid said the Republicans who prevented Garland from being nominated were the “builders” and “criminals” of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
Trump said he was unfit for the job.
Treats noted that it is on the side of a naked calendar "just as much for men as for women"
Treats magazine is working with photographer David Bellemere to publish a calendar inspired by the Pirelli of the 1970s for 2017.
But instead of celebrity and naked people, they are trying to find a new generation of ball models for the 2017 NU Inspiration Fairy Tails calendar.
Treats chairman Steve Shaw stated earlier this year that the magazine, which has a high naked rate, is different from the former Playboy magazine because “Playboy is for men.”
I do this for women.
Obviously, he believes that the calendar is also so.
In a press release about the calendar, Shaw said, “Like men, we need to return to showcasing unfashionable, classic nakedness so that women can look at these images of the female body comfortably as an inspiration.”
Women will want to be part of this project because it is a beautiful work of art.
Models can send photos online or participate in public interviews in Los Angeles and New York.
Vinyl Target: Who Are the Buyers?
The middle-aged, lonely men love vinyl.
Let us tell you that this statement is based on real data before we go to the comment section to offer fantastic insults under the noise.
According to YouGov, the return of records, which is a much-mentioned topic, is a result of the nostalgia of the Middle Ages, not of the Y generation who pursues innovation created by a physical object.
Recent buyers of vinyl albums are mostly between the ages of 45 and 54.
In fact, the 18- to 24-year-old group is the lowest chance.
This is also due not only to the accumulation of enthusiasts; it has an emotional significance; older vinyl buyers tend to like to hide their feelings for themselves (56 percent and 53 percent) and enjoy being alone (69 percent and 66 percent).
Are YouGov’s results correct?
If this blog were a news broadcast on television, the camera would watch him walk through Soho’s crowded street, wearing a modest grey dress, exhibiting many gestures before stopping, and, after joining and opening my hands, say something authoritarian like, “Let’s take a look.”
So let’s take a look.
While the centre of Soho is slowly losing its magic and unusual atmosphere (buildings once housed by independent dealers are now filled with hotels, Eats, Prets and Paperchases) there are still several specialized plate stores available.
I’d probably like him to stop by the camera for the next part; I’ve been standing near different men in some of these stores and trying to learn about their ages and emotional states through observation.
Stuart of Glasgow (55), whom I follow as I go from Sister Ray (data counting: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (data counting: eight middle-aged men, probably a woman in her 20s), spends an afternoon in London for a meeting and searches for shops to fill out a few free hours.
I asked if he was a collector.
“I think I am.”
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These plates on the official above (the official sent me by email, I didn’t follow him to his home) decorate the walls of the living room.
The reason for the collection of so many albums and singles is partly a result of his spending income; he can now get records he didn’t have enough money for when he first came out, and buy back what he sold in his youth and time without metal.
“Most of the things I get in the late 60s and early 70s, things that come out when I was 11 or 12 years old; I’m too young to get.”
He agrees with the idea that people who love to stay alone are more likely to be introverted and adds: “I don’t smoke, I don’t drink too much alcohol.
This is my evil.
Wez (25), who works at Sister Ray, believes that many of the customers he encounters follow the YouGov profile.
But he also realized that a new wave of exaggerated advertising in the media was forming, and that people who heard that this fashion was coming back needed to buy back the old records.
In my interviews, I realized that people normally dropped their collections in 1998 or 1999.
Customers who first sold their vinyles to buy CDs now sell their CDs to get them back.”
This may explain the increase in people of a certain age who revitalize the vinyl.
And what about the alleged emotional importance of the discs?
It takes a few seconds to realize that disc stores in a store like Phonica offer a comforting community of people with similar personalities.
According to Wez, some elderly customers have been overwhelmed by the contactless payment system, especially.
Some vinyl enthusiasts may want to take refuge in the stability of the familiar record cover, which reminds them of quiet youth memories that have been overwhelmed by the digital world.
Wez says; “Sometimes it can be because of filling a void or seeing material objects as a kind of comfort.”
Because I am a collector, I have it, and I think most people have it too.
This is an easy way to fill your head.
A coworker jumping from a bunch of records says “We’re like social service workers.”
A survey conducted in April last month revealed that 50% of vinyl albums sites have not yet listened to the album.
The survey also found that 41% had a jacket they had never worn, and 7% had purchased vinyl while they had no plates.
At this stage of the news, I would probably have shown an extremely worrying appearance while examining a series of bossa nova beasts.
The "reward" aspect of this return is also an element noticed by Jonny (42), who works in Sounds of Universe (data count: three middle-aged men).
"Soon someone came to me and said, 'I don't have a record player but I want to buy a Radiohead record to put on our shelf.'"
Although this does not represent a large percentage, it definitely reflects the current situation.
More products, less music.
Some people say, “I don’t have plugs.”
These are not the elderly, but the young, the late ten years of age, who are new to this topic.
Now when I get to Fopp, which has separated almost an entire solid for vinyl, I see that the audience is quite varied.
There are couples in their 70s, photographers, young boys and middle-aged women.
The atmosphere is less cool from the above-mentioned stores (the last part of Wild Beast) and it’s good to see the diversity among customers, although it’s spreading sex-containing pop instead of soothing jazz from speakers.
None of them seem alone, but it’s hard to solve the psychological traumas that have bothered them by standing next to someone for more than 30 seconds.
Elanora (27), has been surfing on Fopp for a few minutes and browsing the discounted discs.
Instead of spending, he just went out to look at the vitrines.
He says he doesn’t have the option of making a record collection because he doesn’t earn much.
very expensive .
It’s easier to listen to music on the computer or otherwise, but the beauty of the vinyl... goes away as if it’s a lover.
I don’t know how to explain it, it doesn’t really look like it.
My final stop is a store said to have inspired the next generation of vinyl enthusiasts: Urban Outfitters.
I observe a group of young girls gathered around Polaroid cameras for a while before a father and daughter discussed the purchase of a Crosley plate player, as they were examining their trousers.
On the left is a staircase full of records from Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse, and Fleetwood Mac; records if not for an average collection; a blend of modernity and classics.
No one is looking; these are just decorative purposes, some are too high to be touched.
This is a “artistic vinyl.”
But the curiosity about these items may mean that the industry will make more money and send fewer customers to the depths of Soho; there’s not much to complain about.
It’s not surprising that a demographic group that has more money and time than most, spends more money on more luxurious items like vinyl.
But my findings indicate that YouGov’s results are true at least in Soho record stores; they do not count women collectors and vinyl enthusiasts in reality, in record stores or online forums.
These people are probably working pretty hard at school or in offices.
These people don’t spend their Thursday evenings walking through the recording stores on Berwick Street, scrutinizing the records, and escaping the gaze of a 30-year-old fake TV server looking over the shoulders of middle-aged men who are unaware of anything.
Greenland shark is the longest living vertebrate in the world
Scientists have revealed that Greenland shark is the longest-lived species on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who conducted studies on sharks, said the record belonged to a female, five meters long, believed to be between 272 and 512 years old.
French court rejects proposal to demolish shops in Jungle refugee camp
A French court has rejected a proposal by Calais officials to demolish dozens of debris shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp where thousands of refugees live.
In a court hearing this week, Calais officials argued that a total of 72 cutting stores, where people in the camp sold many products from cigarettes to energy drinks, made haircuts, or sold tea for 50 cents (40p) or basic meals for a few euros, had to be destroyed.
The Governorate of Calais argued that these places should be destroyed because they have created a parallel economy that does not pay taxes and risk fires and hygiene.
Beneficent groups told the court that shops and restaurants were vital, and that free food offered by government-sponsored organizations and other groups was insufficient for the growing population in the camp.
They argued that shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free food to those in need.
A court in Lille said there was no legal basis for the expulsion of the people who operated the 72 throwing store, but Calais Valisin’s concerns were also “completely understandable.”
Judge Jean-François Molla said bars, cafes and restaurants have taken on a far greater role than just feeding people living in “extremely dangerous conditions.”
He said these areas provide comfortable meeting points for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places in danger of destruction, the non-profit Jungle Book Cafe for Children serves 200 meals every day, teaches English and French, and advises hundreds of unwilling refugees in the camp on refugees.
More than 170,000 people have signed a petition to protect this cafe, which is for children.
In a letter sent to the Guardian, it was stated that this shutdown would be “a façade for these children, some of whom are eight years old.”
Two charities, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimated on Friday that the population in the Jungle camp has surpassed 9,000 (the highest number ever) after the number of arrivals increased during the summer period.
After gold in the Fiji masterclass, Britain won the silver medal in the seventh rugby championship
Britain’s impressive progress in the Rugby 7 Championship ended in the final against Fiji on Thursday, after a 43-7 defeat at Rio Deodoro Stadium.
Fiji gave masterclasses in conception, waist, side step, support, running lines, and muscle strength to win the first Olympic medal in every color.
After the defeat, Britain won the third silver medal of the day as a consolation prize not too bad, and New Zealand can now be proud of the efforts they have shown in the opening tournament of the Olympics 7 which they defeated, Argentina and South Africa.
At the beginning of the day, the South African team that defeated them in the semi-finals by 7-5 may have found them in the final.
But yet a Fiji in such shape could beat even a team of 15 people.
It’s unbelievable, but Britain can find comfort by thinking that at least one British will be wearing a gold medal tomorrow: Fiji’s head coach, Ben Ryan, is an Englishman from Wimbledon.
This was a tough trip for Britain.
Eight roads before, when they worked with Ryan, they had lost every match in the Seventh Championship in Adelaide.
This time, they lost only one.
Though this tendency is painful, the progress shown is truly surprising.
Fiji made a fascinating start, with the players pretty much overtaking Britain’s attempts to catch the ball.
It was like running between a series of busy buses for Captain Tom Mitchell and his crew, and the World Series champions went ahead 5-0 when Osea Kolinisao moved from the corner.
In the fourth minute, Jerry Tuwai faced another number from the right wing.
The match was 12-0 and Britain was almost unable to touch the ball.
Mitchell’s wonderful intervention prevented the mountain-like Leone Nakarawa from throwing a third but that he did was only delaying the number of Fiji.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua scored from the right corner and Britain dropped back 17-0.
While only a minute remains to the end of the first half, Nakarawa made another number from the beginning.
Then Vatemo Ravouvou flew to the line for numbers, passing between some challenging British interventions.
With this number, the score between the circuits reached 29-0.
While a team set up to play in the Fiji 7 championship, Britain was still trying to learn the basics of the business.
It is like this down above.
Britain made major changes between the circuit and closed the Fiji dam for exactly four minutes, which was a good improvement from the first half until Josua Tuisova came on stage with the perfect Fiji game.
Dan Norton was in a trial for Britain, and while he tried to score from the left corner to score 36-7, it was in the hands of Southern Islanders singing, shaking the flag, and dancing the fans of the game.
It was really hard not to admire Fiji’s cheerful approach from the beginning to the end.
Maa Viliame also praised the final additions on the Fiji game that didn’t need to be decorated in the last minutes.
When the whistle was ringing, the Fijians began to celebrate, and the Great Britain stumbled upon the way of the dressing room.
At the start of the day, Fiji defeated Japan in the semi-finals by 20–5, and Britain also faced South Africa in a tough semi-finals; Britain went ahead with a single number.
Kyle Brown led the South African team in the first half, but Dan Norton led the team in the second half with head-to-head foot movements.
Anthony's brother Marcus Watson, who was in the top 15 of England, was guaranteed a victory and a silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by their coach's fight against cancer
There will be no more emotional gold medals in these games, which also has a significant meaning.
After 220 punitive breaths from the first to the last move, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning realized that the moment they won gold at Estacio da Lagoa could be much more meaningful.
Though there were two people pulling the balls, there were three voices on the boat; the women were the first women to reach such a level this year in the duel in England as they advanced back and forth to the second Olympic gold medal and their coach Robin Williams’ voice was echoed on the boat.
Their judgments were quite clear; it was the 39th race in the series of invincibility that was unprecedented to their wife.
If we see two great athletes floating on the surface in a rainbow, this image does not fully reflect the nature of the victory.
Behind each gold medal, there’s a bucket of willing hands that make the added gains that made this difference, and no hand was as effective as the coaches who didn’t know if they would live enough to see that day when they were diagnosed with cancer 30 months ago.
As he said, they touched and left.
I was caught with the type of bladder cancer that could be intervened by surgery and they did.
If they don’t, they go everywhere.
That would be a pretty bad situation.
This changes your view of life a little.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
He was very lucky because he was able to start treatment outside of the season at the beginning of 2014, and it is unknown if he will have a correct expression in such cases, but in this way he will be able to minimize the distraction.
I had to pay, so I had to recover quickly.
It was an incentive for me.
I was in the hospital and even though they said I was enough to take a few steps, I was walking up to 6, 9, 15 meters in the garden.
It started this way.
Pulling up is a journey on its own, but that makes it a little bigger.
After the victory, it was in Williams, who spent a tense morning talking a little more than usual to overcome their own worries.
Stanning, who is a captain in the Royal Artillery Union and has previously been to Afghanistan, said: "I was emotionally broken this week, maybe it's a bit extreme, but it really means a lot."
This once again emphasizes what this means to me and how hard Helen, me and Robin have worked.
I spent three wonderful years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we’t have been, so I want to thank him for being the best coach in the world.
I could not find a better person or a better coach to work with.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost the race for five years.
The two have a tough rhythm that their rivals are unable to reach.
Even in the last 500 meters between the teams of New Zealand and Denmark, Stanning and Glover's strength was not yet exhausted.
We caught ourselves there.
Helen said, “See the process, watch the process.”
It is really important not to go.
We had a good start and we didn’t try to do anything incredible.
We didn’t expect fireworks to explode today, we just wanted to win the race with a good ball, and we did so.
The two will take a year off before deciding what to do in the future.
Glover has a wedding to attend next month; the wedding of him and television adventurer Steve Backshall.
For now, I just want to enjoy it.
I didn’t want to say this was my last race.
This would create too much pressure.
It took me six months to realize that I was an Olympic champion in London.
It was very new and I was very stressful.
Here, it took about four minutes.
It’s a much better feeling.”

Bulgaria announces inflation for the first time in eight months
According to national statistics, the monthly inflation rate in Bulgaria was 1% in June.
This is the highest value in years (since June 2012) and the first above zero since October, after a positive 0.2% last year.
The average annual inflation measured by the CPI for the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) was -0.8% compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015).
The consumer price index in July 2016 was 101.0% compared to June 2016, meaning the monthly inflation was 1.0%.
Since the beginning of the year, the difference in inflation rate (compared with January 2016 and December 2015) was -0.2%, and the monthly inflation difference between July 2016 and July 2015 -0.2%.
Compared to the previous month in July 2016, price increases were observed in the following consumer product groups: Food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), transportation (1.8%), entertainment and culture (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), varied goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell in the groups of clothing and shoes (2.2%), furniture, household appliances and routine maintenance (0.5%) and healthcare (0.1%).
Alcoholic beverages and tobacco products, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels; prices in communication and education groups remained at the same level.
Snapchat's "Anime" Effect Criticised as Asian Cartoon
While Snapchat says it’s inspired by animations for this filter, some observers say it’s racial insensitivity.
Snapchat allows around 150 million users every day to play with their identities at an absurd level by changing the reality.
You can turn yourself into an ananas, a dog, or a character jumped from a Roy Lichtenstein painting.
Merchants are pervasive, feature-changing tools that create more than 30 million improved self-concepts every day.
The wrong steps are quickly digged into the memory of the public.
Snapchat prosecutors have faced accusations in the past that the app supported black classification or offered whitened skin tones as beauty ideals.
Therefore, because of the lens they offer this week, which makes users pull-eye, broken teeth, and swollen cheeks, some critics have criticized the company for being a “Asian mask” that caricatures Asians.
And they wondered if these repeated disagreements signaled a larger problem with the company’s diversity.
News and anger spread with news from The Verge and Motherboard on Wednesday and announced one day later that Snapchat had removed the feature.
The company stated in a statement: Merek was prepared not to be caricaturized by Asians, but to worship anime characters.
But for observers who have experienced racism, this pattern reminded them of painful stereotypes.
Other people generally refused to compare anime.
Grace Sparapani, a Korean-born American art student who shared a lot of tweets about the photographs, said in an email that the coral was "painful and annoying in the lightest of terms."
"He added that when it comes to comparing the side effects of the filter with the bad Asian cartoon, the debate is difficult.
This also shows that the filter is not only an Asian mask, but also a humiliatingly Asian mask.
Snapchat is not the only company that transcends cultural trigger mechanisms.
American culture appears to be in an endless conflict over diversity and inclusion in many areas, from institutional meeting rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all carry in our hands.
And what Snapchat is referring to, with racial diversity larger than other counterparts, can also be interpreted as being in a higher sensitivity expectation.
In an interview Thursday, 25-year-old Katie Zhu said that when one of Snapchat’s spies created a diminishing image for a user, “it’s much harder for such movements to not be noticed as before.”
On Thursday, Ms. Zhu, a product manager and engineer working for Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and called everyone in that direction.
In an article he wrote for Medium and in a telephone interview, he stated that he believed racial conflicts reflected deficiencies in diversity in Snapchat’s hiring apps.
Ms. Zhu ended her article with a tag: #SnapchatiSilin, criticizing the company’s leading team of mostly white men.
Ms. Zhu, a Chinese-American, said: “Either they can make such decisions because there is not enough diversity between the different races among the staff, or they don’t feel safe or comfortable enough to talk about themselves, even if they are people who work there and belong to different races.”
Other observers also share their views on this complaint that he has largely left Snapchat unanswered.
The company does not share figures about the diversity among its employees by highlighting the private company’s status.
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to share its staff’s racial origins but, according to a spokesman, the company recently incorporated a recruitment manager to internally boost its efforts to focus on insufficiently represented populations and include them.
Ms. Zhu, from her point of view, noted that she would shut down her Snapchat account, adding, “I’m wondering if they need more users like us to say this isn’t true.”
Congressional Panel Says Military Authorities Are Destroying ISIS Intelligence
In a report released Thursday, a congressional panel that U.S. Central Command officials have destroyed intelligence reports to draw a more optimistic picture of the events on the ground about the fight against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.
An interim report prepared by a working group of the Palace’s Armed Services Committee, Intelligence Committee, and Defence Payment Subcommittee of the Republican House Presidents found there was “an unpleasant discontent” among Central Command intelligence analysts who said their superiors had changed the assessments of U.S. forces on Islamic State.
Centcom, known as the Central Command, is a military headquarters located in Tampa, Fla., which oversees U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
The report said: “The intelligence findings approved by senior Centcom leaders typically draw a more positive picture than the facts on the ground show about U.S. terrorism prevention efforts, and consistently provide far more positive results than the analyses made by other elements of the intelligence community.”
California Republican Representative Ken Calvert said, “What’s happening at Centcom is unacceptable; while poor analyses are presented to senior decision makers, our fighters are in trouble.”
Leadership failures at Centcom have reached the highest levels of the organization.
The 10-page report also details the ongoing problems in 2014 and 2015, including the Central Command's explanation and analysis of U.S. efforts to train Iraqi forces.
While there is no firm evidence that senior Obama administration officials have ordered reports to be changed, analysts feel pressured by Centcom leaders to provide a more optimistic view of the threat created by the Islamic State, also known as ISIS and Daesh.
In the first half of 2015, many of the Central Command press releases, statements and congressional statements were significantly more positive than actual events.
For example, a Centcom official has stated publicly that a major military attack to take Mosul back could be carried out as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq’s second largest city, is still under Islamic State control.
Kansas Republican Representative Mike Pompeo said in a statement, “After months of research, this issue has been quite clearly understood.”
From mid-2014 to mid-2015 the top intelligence leaders of the U.S. Central Command manipulated the intelligence outcomes of the commander to make the threat posed by ISIS in Iraq insignificant.
Republicans have formed a working arm after learning that analysts have expressed concerns that intelligence is being manipulated about the Islamic State.
As the investigations continue, the report published on Thursday will follow much more comprehensive findings.
There is also another Centcom intelligence investigation being conducted by the defense ministry’s general inspector.
Members of the House Intelligence Committee also published their findings on Thursday, contributing to some of the findings reached by the Republican working arm.
Democratic Representative Adam B. Schiff, chairman of the committee, said in a statement that “Centcom, ISIL and the Iraqi Security Forces, between 2014 and 2015, had an extremely narrow process of intelligence assessment.”
Schiff said the process "delayed the publication of intelligence findings", led to moral disturbance among analysts and lacked sufficient space for opposing opinions."
But Mr. Schiff and Democrats have stated that they have not reached a finding that the White House analysts of Centcom have put pressure on the findings to create a “pre-determined or political narrative.”
The preliminary results of the congressional review were announced by Daily Beast on Tuesday.
Last August, the New York Times that a Pentagon inspector’s general review was available following complaints made by Centcom analysts.
Commander-in-Chief Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that he would not comment on the defense ministry’s congressional report during the investigation of the inspector general.
But he said "experts may disagree about the interpretation of complex data in some cases and that the intelligence community and the Department of Defense support a healthy dialogue on these important national security issues."
The investigation will raise a hint beyond the question of whether the US-led bombing operation in Iraq and Syria continues or not (a claim raised by more and more Defense officials every day).
But last year’s accusations raised the question of how much President Obama could rely on the Central Command to honestly assess military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis points.
Criticisms of the Islamic State’s reflection of intelligence began when Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker wrote an article stating that he advocated a small force in Iraq despite the opposition of many analysts from President George W. Bush’s administration and has been debated for more than a decade after the 2003 invasion.
Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the Islamic State intelligence rebellion.
Officials said that despite Mr Hooker’s team’s public statements in the opposite direction last year, airstrikes against refineries held by the Islamic State have concluded that the terrorist group’s financial resources have not been significantly affected because they have built temporary refineries to sell oil on the market.
However, as The Times noted in September, this finding was not out of the Central Command.
Centcom’s then commander General Lloyd J. Austin III’s statement to the Senate last year has been criticized because it was seen by many lawmakers as an extremely positive assessment of the war.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel in the Central Command.
U.S. Women's Grass Hockey Team Wins 4th Backward Victory Against Britain
One day after Katie Bam scored three goals in her 6-1 win against Japan, the United States scored the first two goals of the women's grass hockey team in a match that the Americans defeated India 3-0 on Thursday.
While five goals in two games seem to require a lasting mastery in mind, Bam (27), said he wasn’t sure he did the same thing before.
He said, “I have no idea.”
I’m not one of those who keep records.
He knows this: the Americans share the first place in the group with Britain, who is in front of 4-0 in the Olympic tournament and after defeating Japan 2-0 on Thursday.
Britain and the United States will face each other for the first round of the final game on Saturday.
Both teams qualified for the quarter-finals and the match will determine who will finish the six-team group matches first and second.
The team that finishes group matches first will not face the strong Dutch team, the leader of another group, a little longer when the quarterfinals begin.
But after Saturday's match, the Americans created a sensation by showing a surprising progress here after their last of 12 teams at the London Olympics.
Bam was in the team.
He grew up in Blue Bell, PA; he was 3 years old when he first took his grass hockey waist (his twin sisters were interested in the sport at Drexel) and at the age of 16 he became the team's youngest player, joining the national team.
He missed the 2008 Olympics because of his failure to enter the final squad.
Then came 2012 when most things didn’t go well for him and his teammates.
The following year, a British coach, Craig Parnham, was hired and things began to change.
Bam says “a cultural change, a mental change, a physical change.”
We are no longer in London.
Completely turned over.
On Thursday night, Bam took the first number of the first tomorrow with a closely opposite hit.
India hadn’t won a tournament yet, but the team showed a surprising level of endurance and managed to maintain a score of 1-0 until the third quarter when Bam came into operation.
He made a long run with the ball from the left of the pitch and then twisted and threw the ball into the castle, leading the Americans 2-0 ahead.
Melissa Gonzales scored the last goal in the fourth quarter.
This was the first game in which U.S. goalkeeper Jackie Briggs, who allowed a goal in the first three wins, did not score a goal in the tournament.
The chance opened.
Same with Bam.
Parnham said, "We are in a good place right now," but how good this place is depends on the outcome of Saturday's match.
Tramboline cooling in the midst of Olympic ambition
No matter where you are, no matter what time, the Olympics are going on.
Events in Rio de Janeiro represent ambitious competition and work, and as if it would never end or avoid.
The Olympic swimsuit itself is like a flaming baton passed from swimmer to gymnast to triathlete.
Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos can’t watch television, read newspapers, or listen to what your neighbor says in a cafe.
And Logan Dooley.
Mr. Dooley, who participated in the Olympics for the first time, among sponsorships and TV ads that advise you to feel good, a heartbeat swimmer, gymnast, or gymnast may be one of the names shown in prime time.
But Mr. Dooley (28) from Lake Forest, California is fighting for a gold medal in trampoline at the Olympics.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event at the same level.
Far from the center, there are sports that are not universally recognized in the shadow: rifle shooting, artillery, badminton, tekvando.
The frog will always be with us, with the desire to be there for a long time.
But if I have to point out what I personally prefer, I would like to pay attention to the secret magic of the trampoline.
Though trampoline has been known as an Olympic event since it was introduced to the Sydney Games in 2000, the very few people I have asked in the past 16 years have not realized that it is an Olympic sport.
This may be a regional ignorance.
Although the United States sent athletes to the competition, it had never won a medal on the trampoline and had not had a competitor to go to the finals until 2012.
Men tended to share prizes with Chinese and Russians, while women with Chinese and Canadians.
Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will try to preserve the gold medals they won in London this year.
But the trampoline attracts attention as a rather trivial event; it may be partly because the unconscious ears think it is worthy of a clown school instead of the Olympics.
I have to admit that I’m not an expert here, I’m just interested in the subject.
It has a funny potential (like the cartoon-like shake created by the never-ending jump) but it basically reflects the luxury of gymnastics and diving, the two sports it brings together.
The word “trampoline” comes from the Spanish word hand trampoline, which means “trampoline.”
Champions candidates jump from the air to a height of almost 30 feet on a large trampoline and are asked to do a series of movements (burkma, pike and salto) before jumping on their feet.
According to the official Olympic program, they are judged according to the intensity, difficulty and "flight time".
Twenty-two athletes from 17 countries will compete in Rio, including 16 men and 16 women.
The most frequent progress in the Olympics is direct forward.
Those who want to win medals have to go further, faster and upwards, in some cases to the end of the gold quest, and backwards, upwards and downwards, in some cases.
Not only do they pursue the finish line or the starting wall, but they also have another challenging line on television; a world or Olympic record.
This stubborn effort is noble, admirable, and even extreme enough to drown even a viewer in tears.
But this is precisely one of the features that I found slightly tired when watching the Games.
The trampoline allows you to give it all a break.
Those in the trampoline move upwards.
Their goals are not moving forward.
He jumps up, rises up, descends down, and rises up again, seeming weightless like an astronaut.
Of course, it cannot be said that there is no competition or difficulty, but there is no humble work to the outcome during the routine, no disappearance in the distance, only an elegant suspension of the time and space capture as imagined.
The more cold a race can be, the more cold it can be.
The women’s ranking and then the finals will be held on Friday afternoon at 13 a.m. with Eastern time; men again on Saturday at 13 a.m.
NBC will broadcast the finals on both days as a block afternoon from 14.00 a.m.
In the midst of the Olympic madness, they promise a quiet and wonderful moment that can be ignored in the general arena.
And consciousness, according to The Wall Street Journal, if the United States would rise up just by offering male athletes to glimpse and objectivize, as male gymnasts recently suggested, we could say Mr. Dooley is waiting for his new fans.
“A Generation of Protests” in Ethiopia, a longtime U.S. ally
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators demanding political change in Ethiopia have faced fierce resistance from the government.
Witnesses say a large number of protesters were shot deadly in clashes with police.
Is Ethiopia about to collapse?
Over the past decade, it has become one of the most stable nations in Africa and a strong ally for the West with its fast-growing economy.
However, anti-government protests in recent months have swept the country every day and spread to more areas.
Last week alone, thousands of people took to the streets demanding fundamental political change.
According to human rights groups, the government’s reaction to this was quite cruel.
Witnesses said police officers shot and killed a large number of unarmed protesters.
Images of protests, believed to have been from late last year or early this year, show security officials scratching young people who had to hold their hands against a wall.
The highest level UN human rights official is now asking for a detailed review.
Rashid Abdi, project director for the Somali Peninsula at the International Crisis Group, a research group, said: “It has always been difficult to keep this country together and it will be much harder to move forward.”
Ethiopia is one of the highest populated nations in Africa after Nigeria, and its stability is appreciated by the West.
The U.S. military and intelligence services are working closely with Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats in the region, primarily in Somalia, and there are very few countries in Africa that receive such aid from the West.
The economy of Ethiopia is growing impressively.
Its infrastructure has been effectively improved; a new suburban train is even available in the capital, Addis Ababa.
And the streets are also usually quiet, safe and clean.
Although the best example of democracy was not shown in Ethiopia (human rights groups are constantly referring to the oppressive attitude of the government), the opposition in the country was quite limited, the opposition was effectively silenced.
Most were sent into exile, imprisoned, killed, or driven to the furthest corners of the desert.
But this situation may be about to change.
Seyoum Teshome, a university lecturer from central Ethiopia, said, “If you drown people and offer them no choice but protest, these events go out.”
The youth is in full protest.
A generation of protesters.
There are many complaints, from land use to pressure on power by the coalition in power.
After a rather critical election last year, the ruling party and its allies also took the last seat filled by the opposition and can now control 100 percent of the Parliament.
At the same time, tensions on the border with Eritrea, a rough and controversial line that led to the war that killed hundreds of people in June, are also rising.
Analysts fear that separatist groups such as the Oromo Freedom Front or the Ogaden National Freedom Front, which have disappeared in recent years, will be re-armed by retaliating from this turbulence.
There are several factors that explain why the painful feelings that have boiled under the surface for years are now exploding.
The first seems innocent: smart phones.
As cheap smartphones spread and internet service was provided, only a few years ago a large number of Ethiopians began to communicate using social media.
Even when the government shut down access to Facebook and Twitter, as it often did during the protests, most people were able to communicate through internet advocacy servers that hid their locations.
Several young Ethiopians said they gathered in this way for the protests.
Secondly, solidarity has also increased between the two major ethnic groups of Ethiopia, the Oromols and the Amhara.
Oromals and Amhara are not normally allies.
For a very long time, Amharals from the predominantly Christian mountainous regions of Ethiopia have been outstanding in politics and business, exploiting the predominantly Muslim and flat-ground Oromals.
But this is also changing.
An Oromo leader, Mulatu Gemechu, said: "We are gathering under one umbrella and moving towards cooperation."
The biggest protests were in the Amhara and Oromo regions.
Most Amhara and Oromo believe that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the Tigrian ethnic group, which makes up about 6 percent of the population and dominates in the military, intelligence services, trade and politics.
The third cause behind the unrest was the death of Meles Zenawi.
Meles served as prime minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until his death in 2012.
It was thought to be a tactical monster that everyone could not see.
Analysts say he’s especially specialized in identifying the first signs of agitation and in tackling and neutralizing competitors.
Conflict analyst Mr. Abdi said: “The current regime does not have this basic information.”
Ethiopia’s new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, has been elected in relatively uncertain terms to replace Mr. Meles.
Unlike Mr. Meles from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam is southern.
Analysts say he is unable to earn the trust of security services controlled by the Tigrans.
As a result, more blood was shed with more fear.
Ethiopia’s latest experience with this kind of confusion was the protests in 2005 following the robbery by thousands of analysts following a government’s defensive election.
In the follow-up measures, many protesters were killed, though less than the last month, and this period of confusion passed relatively faster.
Development experts praised Ethiopian leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning such as the new suburban train and remarkable progress in fighting poverty.
But it is clear that this has not stopped the rise of grievances against the Ethiopian government.
And this takes a dangerous and ethnic thing.
Last month, protesters in Gondar, an Amhara town, attacked owned by Tigrans, and Tigrans’ hatred is also rising on social media.
Analysts say the protests have left the United States and other allies in the West in a strange situation.
The U.S. government used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights over neighboring Somalia, but it was said recently that the base was closed.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it does not want this ally in a already fragile region to break down.
Mr. Abdi said, “It’s like walking on a very thin rope.”
Donald Trump describes Obama’s claim to establish ISIL as “courageous”
Donald J. Trump insisted several times last week on Friday that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were not serious as they claimed they were the "founders" of the Islamic State terrorist group, trying to wipe out the latest controversy around the campaign.
This statement raised new questions about the Republican presidential candidate’s ability to communicate openly with the American people.
At the same time, he was in a strange position in the process of trying to explain that his advocates did everything they could to defend him in the process that created this mess.
Mr. Trump insisted in interviews on Thursday that President and Mrs. Clinton had really insinuated that he had founded ISIS, after being on the proposal at a rally on Wednesday night.
But in a tweet early Friday morning, Mr. Trump said he was just making a ridiculous statement.
The post showed that Mr. Trump had completely stepped back one day before he said he was serious about the accusation in a series of interviews.
Conservative radio programmer Hugh Hewitt reminded Mr. Obama that he wanted to destroy ISIS and when Mr. Trump tried to help him soften this comment, he said the Republican presidential candidate didn’t believe it.
Mr. Trump came out of the final mess as he tried to change the focus of his campaign after the drop in polls.
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton had conflicting talks on the economy this week in Michigan.
On Friday, Mr. Trump wanted to go back on the subject again.
Speaking again on Twitter, he stated that Ms. Clinton’s proposals would raise taxes and found his speech boring.
Mr. Trump has used his defensive defense before.
Towards the end of July, after he encountered heavy criticism after the Russians showed an appearance suggesting a pirate attack on Mrs. Clinton’s emails, he explained those comments by saying, “Of course, I said this in a ridiculous way.”
This approach allows Mr. Trump to push the boundaries of political discourse and step back where necessary.
Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who follows the language both candidates also use, said: “This is an arrangement that enables him to “explain” somehow depending on the response by testing how certain messages reacted by those who supported him.”
But at the same time, he deliberately makes these statements and knows that they are too vague to be filtered when viewed from different perspectives.
After falling in polls in recent days, Mr. Trump has taken a much more aggressive stance instead of softening the air for the general electorate.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll released on Friday showed that Mr. Trump is far behind Mrs. Clinton in North Coraline, Virginia and Colorado, and that there is a tough race in Florida.
While Mr. Trump often avoids apologizing for the provocative things he says, he blames those who criticize him for misleading or not understanding his humour.
But Mr. Trump’s jokes, which have been subjected to much more scrutiny in the last few months of his presidential campaign, have left his loyal supporters in trouble in public supporting him, no matter how challenging his comments are.
Former New York City mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, one of Mr Trump’s most prominent supporters, did his best to defend the candidate in an interview with CNN on Thursday.
Asked about the correctness of Mr. Trump’s thesis that Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had established the Islamic State, Mr. Giuliani said, “I think it’s a legitimate, political criticism.”
From one point of view, ISIS was an unknown, small organization before Obama, and those who found them cute were completely wrong, and that was because of the withdrawal of troops from Iraq.
Most prominent Republicans are trying to argue that Mr. Clinton’s administration failed to deal aggressively with the situation in the Middle East and led to the rise of ISIS.
In the run-up to Friday’s rallies in Pennsylvania, Trump continues to accuse news media on Twitter of spoofing every word and behaving against him.
He joked at the “poor, miserable” television experts who tried to solve him, saying, “They can’t do that!”
Some Democrats laughed at Mr. Trump’s pretext, saying it was evidence that he was not suitable for the presidency.
Once Again at Greenpoint Coffee That Couldn't Deal with Prices
In Williamsburg, an old-fashioned place that only works with cash, Verb Cafe has been offering great coffee for 15 years, although it did not offer Wi-Fi.
Of course, he couldn’t cope with the prices at his store on Bedford Avenue.
The store, which replaced Verb in the summer of 2014, Soap Cherie sells soaps in the form of cakes.
Local residents were close to saying that this was the last loss of the destroyed city.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter: “New York is a change, I know it, but I still can’t believe that the CBGB is gone and the Chelsea Hotel is empty and the Verb is no longer a soap store.”
But New York is the city of reinventing as much as change.
Last November, a renovated Verb Cafe opened in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new Verb Cafe has a Wi-Fi connection and accepts credit cards but retains some former employees and similar simple air.
Coffee is still good.
At the beginning of the new Verb is Cisco Rodriguez, the long-time employee of the old cafe and the owner and CEO of the new site.
He joined Verb in 2001 and remained there until the end.
A client said he would be excited to do so when he offered funding for this new place.
Mr. Rodriguez (36), left most things the same.
Verb used the same distributor for the simits and bought an espresso machine from the same model.
Even the lights of the old Verb were used here again.
But Mr. Rodriguez said he wanted to offer a different experience.
Added new materials.
Baked-egg-and-cheese sandwiches are available in the menu and are also presented with ingredients such as cabbage and roasted onions.
There are rice cakes.
The cafe no longer serves beer, but offers fresh fruit juices.
Nine months later, Mr. Rodriguez said he noticed that the former assistants began to come resolutely.
He said, “Many of our former customers also couldn’t cope with the prices at Williamsburg.”
Last Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was one of those customers.
Ms. Oliveira (34) lives in Williamsburg and frequently visited Verb.
Even after moving to Greenpoint, he did not stop moving on this path.
Verb said he stopped drinking coffee for a while after closing off.
“I’ve noticed that what I love is the coffee and culture at Verb.”
Now he started drinking coffee again, but last day he chose the tea blend, a new additive, instead of the usual ice coffee.
Tom Rosenthal, another assistant, has been regularly at Verb since 2003.
He went to work and always ordered the same thing.
“Every day, about seven-quarters, I would enter without any surprise and they would prepare my daily order of butter-sweetened smoothies.”
Mr. Rodriguez said he wanted to make changes and added new ingredients to the menu.
Nowadays, although Mr. Rosenthal still takes his usual order, he sometimes makes a little change in his daily order by adding pastries, eggs, and cheese.
Mr. Rodriguez said he was not stuck in the soap store that replaced the old place.
In fact, the owners of Soap Cherie offered to make a special soap for Verb using the coffee’s cold-brewed coffee.
Mr. Rodriguez said, “I think we can still accept this offer.”
And the traditional Polish residents of Greenpoint also adopted this cafe.
One of the new customers translated the menu into Polish, and Mr. Rodriguez said he would soon find a space to display this menu so his new neighbors would feel good too.
The new location has other advantages as well.
The local juice store wants to bottle and sell cold roasted coffee.
There is a possibility that the cafe will expand to the nearby building.
It is even enough for most customers to have a new verb available where they can find their old favorites.
Joseph Whitt was a regular customer and was very upset when the venue was closed.
When the new venue opened, Mr. Whitt said he felt at home when he could get in and have a coffee.
“I had to smell it.”
The Depressive Food of Crisis Time in "A Square Meal"
In March 1933, shortly after sitting on the presidency seat, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat for lunch at the Oval Office.
A fan of his throat, President Roosevelt loved the decorated Fifth Avenue foods, such as shrimp butter and Maryland turtle soup.
That day’s menu was much more modest: boiled eggs with tomato sauce, potato flour, and sweetly dried erythropid pudding.
Jane Ziegelman said, “This was an act of building solidarity with those who were in trouble about eating.”
His wife, Andrew Coe, added: “This was also a message given to Americans about how they should eat.”
A couple living in Brooklyn Heights.
Mr. Coe’s latest book, “Chop Suey,” was about Chinese cuisine in America, and Ms. Ziegelman, in her book, “97 Orchard,” was about the lives of the Lower East neighborhoods through food.
A Square Meal, the new book they worked with and will be published by Harper on Tuesday, tells the history of American food during the Great Steam period.
They also showed solidarity with food and met with a reporter for dinner at the Eisenberg Sandwich Buffet in Flatiron, which has existed since 1929, the year the crisis began.
Mrs. Ziegelman (54) ordered sandwiches with cream cheese and olive oil, while Mr. Coe (57) preferred to sit down with hindi, potato flour and vegetables.
The couple found the reporter’s roll-out order suitable for discussing crisis-period meals.
Ms. Ziegelman said “Somonians were very popular.”
There was a land peanut butter, a lungs butter, a dry bean butter.
These were made of something cheap that burned the material with a material.
Imagine that you have eaten enough peanuts for dinner.
Mr. Coe shrugged his face.
“It must have been in the stomach of a man like a bullet.”
In the pre-crisis years, the tables in America, especially in rural areas, were like open buffets.
Women were cooking for the men working on the farm, and fresh cooked cakes were served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
American food was sent to Europeans who died of hunger in World War I. "A Square Meal" explains the history of the methods of dealing with the nation from becoming the center of abundance at a time.
Mr. Coe explained why he and his wife wanted to write about the matter, saying, “This was a time when food became a central, worrying issue for Americans.”
The new budget regime was equally disturbing: mysterious foods such as salmon and beets became the main consumption product, according to Ms. Ziegelman, “the beets were a great way to evaluate the remaining meals,” so chefs could hide the appetite suppressant materials in the bottom with a cream sauce coating.
Fresh fruits are replaced by dried fruits that are cheaper.
Meat, found at the heart of American cuisine over the years, has become a luxuriously shared luxury.
Interesting mixtures for calorie and nutritional value were tried, and the sense of doyum went ahead of the taste or general understanding of the kitchen.
While Ms. Ziegelman was researching for her book of recipes, she prepared an onion meal in a stove filled with peanut butter of that period.
Mr. Coe said, “It wasn’t a beloved contribution to the dinner table today.”
Ms. Ziegelman supported this: “It was surreal.”
It has nothing in common with onions in the oven.
In most home economics descriptions this was a prominent feature.
Home economics experts, including Louise Stanley, the head of the Federal Home Economy Office, guided the country’s eating habits as never before between 1923 and 1943.
By publishing their recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to be “sparing” and spread the struggle to turn puzzles like carrot cream spaghetti into tasty foods.
"A Square Meal" is a party of historic delicious snacks.
The responses given to hungry citizens by the government, such as President Herbert Hoover’s “Let Me Eat Cake” attitude, are extremely appetizing.
On the one hand, he was publicly eating simple Iowa farmers’ meals from his childhood, while on the other hand he was eating meals like the millionaire intellectual he had become.
Mr. Coe said, “He liked to eat the flavors of European cuisine like salmon salad fish.”
He was eating in a dining room almost entirely covered in gold, wearing jackets suitable for dinner.
It was very far from reality.
If his wife Eleanor didn’t encourage her to be an example with her stomach, President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake.
As the book explains, with Mrs. Roosevelt hiring an assistant who didn’t care at all about flavor, the White House began to present not only “the saddest dishes ever prepared, but also the most embarrassingly prepared dishes.”
After the country got back on its feet, most of the methods of cooking during the crisis were left aside.
According to Ms. Ziegelman, the understanding focused on calories and nutrition and how science is applied to cooking continues.
The couple stated that while writing the book, they learned a lot from Mrs. Ziegelman’s mother’s eating habits—for example, never throwing food into the trash.
Mr. Coe said, “Food waste really scared him.”
Ms. Ziegelman spoke of her old memories: “It really made people sick.”
There was a cremation case.
After the plates were gathered at Eisenberg, he and Mr. Coe pulled out a candy they had prepared at home: the dried spicy candy President Roosevelt ate at lunch.
Ms. Ziegelman said, “It’s called cracked dry erik,” adding that the most frequently referred number was to give these modest recipes a cool name.
There was no crushed cream; only dried eric, some flour, sugar, water and tar.
Everyone hesitated to find the brown glue.
Surprisingly, it wasn’t too bad.
Mr. Coe took the second and third tablespoons.
He said to his wife, “It would be better to have a piece of peanut that could be saved.”
Gilead will receive lawyer fees in Hepatitis C patent battle with Merck
According to a U.S. district judge’s decision, Gilead Sciences Inc. has earned the right to receive lawyer fees related to a hepatitis C patent case with pharmaceutical manufacturer Merck & Co Inc.
After a U.S. judge found that Merck was conducting a series of misconduct, including false testimony and other unethical practices, Gilead was reduced to paying $200 million in compensation in June for breaches of two Merck patents relating to Gilead’s great success drugs, Sovaldi and Harvoni.
At a hearing on Thursday, U.S. District Judge Beth Labson Freeman stated that Gilead was entitled to compensation for fees incurred during his defense.
Merck is trying to reach Gilead, the judge of the market, with new-generation hepatitis C drugs that can cure more than 90 percent of liver patients.
The case is based on 2013 when Gilead and Merck sued each other for claiming ownership of laboratory studies for sofosbuvir, the active ingredient of Gilead’s medicines.
US-backed forces say Membic has been taken entirely from Islamic State
On Friday, a group spokesman said U.S.-backed forces and the last Islamic State fighters inside the city had taken full control of the northern city of Membic near the Turkish border.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDG) are also in the process of cleaning up the city after a group of remaining militants hiding in the city have disappeared.
Sharfan Derviş, a member of the military council allied with the SDG, told Routers that they had released more than 2,000 civilian hostages held by militants.
He told Routers, “The city is now completely under our control, but we are conducting cleaning work.”
The Clinton family earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid federal taxes of 34.2 percent
Hillary Clinton released her 2015 tax return on Friday, showing that the Democrats earned the presidential candidate and his wife $10.75 million last year and paid federal taxes at the current rate of 34.2 percent.
In 2015, the Clinton family contributed $1 million to charities including most of the Clinton Foundation, earned approximately $5.3 million from former President Bill Clinton’s speech salary, and the former Secretary of State stated that he earned $3 million for a book from Simon & Schuster publishing about his time at the Foreign Ministry.
Clinton’s candidate friend, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine from Virginia, released his 10-year tax return with his wife Anne Holton.
In 2015, they paid federal taxes at 20.3 percent.
Clinton campaign official Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement, “Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set the standard for financial transparency.”
Instead, Donald Trump is hiding behind false excuses for promises to disclose his previous tax returns and stepping back.
While it is not required by law, it is a tradition for U.S. presidential candidates to submit their tax returns publicly.
Trump, a businessman from New York, and his lawyers said the reason for the refusal to publish the statements was an audit conducted by the Revenue Administration.
In connection with the Democratic candidate’s statements, Clinton campaign official Ian Sams tweeted “It’s your turn.”
On Thursday, Trump’s private lawyer, Michael Cohen, told CNN he would not allow Trump to publish them until inspections were completed.
A group criticizing Trump in 2012, including Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republicans, stated that this rejection posed questions about his own involvement, contributions to charities, business deals and many other connections with Russia.
Clinton posted an online video on Friday showing top Republicans pressuring Trump to disclose their taxes.
He spoke about this issue in an economic speech held in Michigan on Thursday.
He told the crowd, “He has refused to do what every presidential candidate has done for decades, to publish his tax returns.”
Politico that Trump hadn't paid almost any taxes for two years in the 1990s, and on Friday, the New York Times business department corner author shared statements with a number of tax lawyers and accountants that the situation could still be continuing in this way.
Federal tax rates have become a major issue in the presidential election.
Clinton presented a rule proposal named after billionaire investor Warren Buffet, which would allow those earning more than $1 million a year to pay at least 30 percent of taxes.
President Obama supported the proposal.
Last week, at a Clinton rally in Omaha, Nebraska, the Berkshire Hathaway group, operating there, challenged Buffett to come to Trump and submit his tax return.
Buffett said he was also going through IRS scrutiny and that Trump was "fearful" of voters, not the tax collection agency.
Clinton released the tax returns of her campaign until 2007.
Currently living in Chappaqua, New York, the Clinton family paid an average federal tax rate of approximately 32 percent between 2007 and 2014, and the combined tax rate reaches approximately 40.5 percent.
The Clinton family’s statement for 2015 shows that unlike most Americans, their income comes just as much as $100 from salaries.
Its primary investment is a low-cost index investment fund, and the Clinton family has stated that its stock and interest income is $109,000.

Powdered red pepper condoms, castage fireworks support the protection of elephants in Tanzania
Environmentalists in Tanzania use an unusual method to prevent elephants from entering human settlements; they throw them condoms filled with dusty red pepper.
The method has proven to be effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation and the U.S.-based Nature Conservation Alliance, which found the idea a few years ago, took steps to introduce it, starting to train volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania on the use of a non-violent, four-step method of protecting their homes and crops without harming animals.
In the past, most people used the gun to defend themselves.
Friday is World Elephant Day dedicated to the protection of animals.
Damian Bell, Managing Director of Honeyguide, said in a statement, “We’ve seen the attitude in these communities change since we developed the vehicle set; they’re now more confident that they can keep fillers away from their land without damaging the fillers.”
The first two steps involve holding the passing file lamp and playing the horn.
In cases where this is not possible, what is called the "red pepper cloud" is thrown away.
The powdered red pepper, mixed with the soil, is placed in the condom with a chestnut fireplace, only the tip is closed so that the fox remains open.
When it burns, the condom opens with a sound of explosion, and the red pepper flows into the air in the form of dust.
One breath is enough to send the pills in the opposite direction.
The last remedy is to use a fireplace that throws fireworks into the air, causing a loud, bright explosion.
Jewish filmmaker strikes hotel in Berlin, lifting Israel’s phone code on the “request” of the Arabs
A French filmmaker of Jewish origin caused censorship in the media after revealing that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin did not list the Israeli telephone code and that the employee raised the “requests” of Arab customers.
Claude Lanzmann, one of the authors of the documentary "Shoah" about the genocide, expressed his anger at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin in an open letter to the German news agency FAZ.
Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the list of phone codes provided by the hotel during his recent stay.
But the country was not among the states that could search directly from the room.
In 2016, how could Israel be purified and destroyed in Berlin, the new capital of Germany?
written by Lanzmann.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers the possibility of calling Israel through its own call center.
The filmmaker the situation to the hotel's reception for an explanation.
Lanzmann wrote that the response he received “shocked him.”
The hotel's secretary said the measure was taken "by a deliberate decision by the management of Kempinski-Hotels".
The reason behind this move caused the filmmaker to get much more upset.
According to Lanzmann, the employee said, “Most of our guests wanted the Arab and Israeli code to be erased.”
According to Suddeutsche Zeitung, the Israeli ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, described the situation as a "great shame."
This situation terrified us and surprised us very much.
This is really a big shame.
It is a shame that this has happened in Germany and in such a hotel chain.
This does not need to be explained.
We are waiting for the hotel to get the result," the official said.
The incident caused huge reaction in the online environment; people called it a scandal.
Some have accused the Kempinski Hotel of "climbing the coat" to the alleged demands of Arab customers.
In another post, the statement "You should be ashamed" was placed, stressing that the hotel was located near a synagogue on Kurfurstendamm Street.
According to Der Spiegel, Hotel quickly dropped the accusations, saying the incident was the result of "irresponsibility" and "apologizing" to Lanzmann.
The Suddeutsche Zeitung that one of Kempinski's representatives said "there has never been a direct order that Israel should not be included in the quick search list."
He said they had added the code.
Brazilian police use pepper gas and plastic bullets against student protesters
Students gathered in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo on Thursday to protest the government's reforms on the public education system clashed with police.
Police used pepper gas and plastic bullets against protesters.
The problem began as security guards tried to disperse students, leading the police to use plastic bullets and pepper gas.
Hundreds of students took part in the demonstration to express their dissatisfaction with the plans.
Governor Geraldo Alckmin proposed that less than 100 public schools be shut down and 300,000 students be dispatched to other schools.
Some of the protesters appeared to have written letters on the walls against interim President Michel Temer.
This latest protest took place a few days after protesters took to the streets in masses to support President Dilma Rousseff, who was removed by the country’s Senate vote.
Trade between Russia and Iran increased to 71%
According to Iranian ambassador Levan Dzhagaryan, with the lifting of sanctions, the trade turnover between Moscow and Tehran grew by 70,9 percent from year to year.
The ambassador said that since the lifting of international sanctions against Iran, the interest of Russian companies doing business in the country has increased significantly.
While new companies are preparing to provide access to the market, Russian companies areining existing ties with Iran.
"Of course, further expansion of trade is one of the main priorities of our bilateral cooperation with Iran," Dzhagaryan said.
In the first five months of 2016, the trade turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 70,9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and reached $856 million.
In particular, Russia’s exports to Iran increased by 91.5 percent to $697 million.
Russia’s imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $158 million.
This increase in trade was achieved with machinery, ground vehicles and weapons supplies," the ambassador said.
Dzhagaryan also expects a record number of Iranian tourists to come to Russia this year.
Last year, Russia’s diplomatic mission in Iran issued 35,000 visas to Iranian citizens, most of them for travel.
In addition, for the first time, Iran was ranked among the top 20 countries in the number of tourists visiting Russia.
We can say that the record of Iranian tourists who visited Russia last year will be broken.”
At the same time, relatively fewer Russians visit Iran, which is a subject the ambassador hopes to change.
“I personally recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yezd, where the monuments of ancient Persian civilization are kept in good condition.”
Cash to FETÖ from Izmir - Economic News
Interesting details about Kavuklar Group Chairman Abdullah Kavuk, who was arrested for providing financial support to the FETO, and Küçükbay Group Chairman Ahmet Küçükbay began to emerge.
FETÖ's 1 and 2 financial sources in Izmir, Küçükbay and Kavuk's FETÖ/PDY terrorist organization representative Fetullah Gülen were determined to regularly send the amount of money charged by courier each month.
It was determined that the money sent to Gülen to not go through the records was not deposited through banks, it was sent through the courier of the member of the organization.
On the other hand, in Amasya, in connection with the investigation of the FETÖ coup attempt, 9 people were arrested, including Fatih Altınay, chairman of the Merzifon Chamber of Commerce and Industry, who were brought to court, and 7 were released on the condition of judicial control.
$30,000 in 10 years
President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s call to “low interest rates” took banks to action.
Banks were suggested to be involved in the campaign attack initiated by Real Estate and then joined by GYODER.
The proposal to reduce the mortgage interest rate below 1 percent, which was assessed as a psychological limit, was also made by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
13 banks have raised their mortgage interest rates below 1 percent.
The banks that started their bankruptcy.
Based on monthly interest rates ranging from 1.12 percent to 1.29 percent before, with the last arrangement made, consumers who use a 10-year residential loan will pay less interest between 15 and 30 billion TL.
Preferred 5 to 10
So how much will the interest rates benefit those who will buy a home?
A person who uses a 10-year loan of £100,000 will benefit from a decrease in interest rates of £30,000.
The vast majority of people who use housing loans choose a five to ten-year repayment plan.
In the coming days, interest rates are expected to fall further.
Interest reduction sales will also have a positive impact.
In 2015, housing sales increased by 10.6 percent from the previous year to 1 million 289 thousand.
This year sales are expected to exceed 1.5 million with interest reductions.
GYODER Chairman Aziz Torun: Reduction to below 9 percent per year
It is an important step toward reducing interest rates for public banks.
They listened to the President’s call and dropped interest rates.
But this rate should be below 9 percent per year.
If this discount process continues, we also consider extending the 0.70 monthly interest rate campaign we launched for a few months.
Previous Previous post: Our Campaign May Last 3 Months
The participation of banks in this effort to bring vitality to the economy we have limited to a month can cause the period of this historic campaign to be extended by at least three to four months.
However, the loan interest rate must fall below 9 percent on an annual basis.
It is also pleasant to see that with the positive psychology and unprecedented solidarity that will be created only by the housing sector and the real market, and also by citizens, every sector has made sacrifices in the purchase of housing.
Polat Holding YKB Adnan Polat: We expect full support from banks
It is a good step to go on to reduce interest rates on our president’s call to the banks.
In addition, there are steps taken in all sectors toward the recovery of the economy.
The campaigns of the STK, the decisions taken by the Central Bank and all the steps taken in this direction are for the country.
All banks have to put their hands under the stone.
Come to them, join us in this journey, walk along the same path with us, let us live the economy together.
5.5 billion in 1.5 years from Sabancı
Sabancı Holding increased its net profit in the first 6 months of this year by 11 percent compared to the same period last year to £1 billion 353 million, and its sales increased by 22 percent to £17 billion 166 million.
Sabancı Holding Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Zafer Kurtul said that in the first six months of the year they have invested 1.8 billion TL, and from the beginning of 2015 to the present, about 5.5 billion Lira.
Kurtul: “As a country, we’ve been through a difficult period in the last period.”
“It’s time for more work and production for our country.”
Enjoy a two-year break from the boat
Due to the "Kabataş Dispute Regulation, Transfer Center and Renewal of Skills Construction" carried out by the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality (IBM), the Kabataş shipyards were closed to sea traffic for about two years.
A modern transfer centre will be built on Kabataş coast to integrate the sea, rail system and road transportation.
Traffic underground will ensure uninterrupted traffic along the coast.
The railway and railway systems will continue to work for a while.
Citizens Taksim, Eminönü, will be launched ring flights in order to ensure transportation to Beşiktaş areas.
The house falls, the house falls.
A bank manager sent a message to my friend.
It always happens the same thing.
Interest rates are falling, house prices are rising.
Rates are rising, home prices are falling.
“Look, it happened again.”
He explains his feelings because it is about individual loans.
Contractors who entered the 0.70 interest rate campaign organized by Real Estate Housing say that they raised prices in many housing projects.
I watched if there was any truth.
There is no shortage, there is no more...
Meanwhile, I think we had a conversation with a contractor who attended the construction summit organized by our newspaper a week after the attempted coup attempt by the Fetullahist Terrorist Organization on July 15.
The boss of a large company.
When I heard the contractor who will not name me, “I really need to raise the prices by 10 percent,” I said, “Do you want to make a contest opportunity?”
Following the coup initiative, with a campaign led by Real Estate Housing, the builders launched a large sales campaign with 0.70 interest and a 120-month period.
I admit, he put his hand under the stone before the banks, he took the risk.
But if we act with the spirit of unity and unity in order not to interrupt the pace of Turkey.
For a month, the banks also cut interest rates.
No one should take the opportunity.
And warn those among you who do.
President Erdogan accepted Omar Koç and Ali Koç
President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, Koç Holding Board Chairman Ömer Mehmet Koç and Koç Holding Board Chairman and Ford Otosan Board Chairman Ali Koç accepted.
Erdogan’s reception in the presidential shelter lasted 40 minutes.
BDDK calls to complain to banks
Mehmet Ali Akben, chairman of the Banking Regulation and Supervision Authority (BDDK), issued a statement regarding President Erdoğan’s “credit withdrawal” warning to banks.
Akben said, “If banks turn the withdrawal of loans into an opportunity due to market conditions and do so in different proportions, we won’t allow it.”
Those who bring such complaints and information to us, we say, "Give us your name on the bank and company basis, and contact the BDDK complaint line."
President Tayyip Erdogan warned the banks in a statement yesterday: “I say that when interest rates drop and credit opportunities are expanded, a new era will open in front of both our country’s investors and our banks.”
To stop trying to give loans to our country in this period, the banks that have recalled loans with excuses have decided to give them a clean, I want to announce that too.
In the period when interest rates were 7-8 percent per year, the banks earned money from these jobs.
More than 500,000 Russian tourists are expected
The President of the Association of Professional Hotel Managers (POYD), Ali Kızıldağ, said at the meeting held at EXPO 2016 Antalya exhibition area on July 15 before the coup attempt that Turkey-Russia relations have entered a positive route, that tariff flights from Russia to Antalya have begun and that there is a certain revival in tourism.
President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and Russian President Vladimir Putin's meeting excited the tourism sector as well as the sectors that trade between the two countries, "I expect that there will be very positive developments in terms of all sectors, from tourism and agriculture to food, from construction to textile."
Turkey and Russia are very close to each other, we have years of traditional relations.
“I think that if we as sectors move very fast on the path that the leaders of the two countries have opened, we will be able to close the distance immediately and move towards the goals,” he said.
If it were not for the coup attempt, the number of Russian tourists coming to Turkey would be estimated to exceed 1 million.
But we lost a month during the period we call the high season, so it’s about reducing the target.
I think if we start charter flights, we will exceed 500,000.
The season may last until the end of October or even mid-November.
In such a case, additional flights can be arranged towards Christmas.
I think this positive atmosphere will also be appreciated very well by the Russian people.
They also have an interest in Turkey.
I’m hoping that we’ll be able to get 700.
Red East, who expressed hope for the Russian market in 2017, said that if the relations between the two countries and the Russian economy recover, the number of Russian tourists could again exceed 3 million next year.
POYD President Ruddağ said that with the removal of the ban on public staff permits, domestic reservations started slightly, "There are returns in cancelled reservations, new reservations have also begun to be accepted."
“We have a hopeful expectation for the Victim’s Day.”
The removal of the ban on tour ticket sales imposed by Iran on travel agents after the coup attempt is also a very positive development, saying, "It would be very good if we could bring 100-200 thousand people in 1.2-2 months from Iran too."
Renew your existing loan?
First of all, find out how the new interest rate conditions that have been discussed with the bank you are receiving a loan affect your loan.
Calculate from your bank the cost of using a new loan at a lower interest rate along with the early closure fee (up to 1.5-2 percent of the commonly used fee).
If you are still advantageous when you include all costs, you can apply for the use of low-interest loans.
Don’t let the lion breathe.
The last champion, Beşiktaş, aims to win the Super Cup fight with Galatasaray and enter the morale in the new season.
Technical Director Shenol Sun, who built all his plans on victory, in his interview with his demands, "We should play temporarily and aggressively."
“I expect you to have a high percentage of ball and ball control for 90 minutes,” he said.
At the beginning, the players who missed the sports including Sosa did not think to drive to the pitch of the Shenol Sun was uncertain about Adriano and Quaresma.
The experienced manager tried Necip at the stopper in training during the week, but if Adriano plays on the left, Tosic will play at the stopper.
The Sun, which would also be a preference between Ricardo Quaresma and Kerim Frei, also made the ball run after a long interval to meet their demands.

I am looking forward to Tolga.
You’ll see Tolga with his posture, his physics, it’ll explode this year, everyone will watch with admiration.

Mehmet Topal centilmen, a master athlete.
If he did not agree with the club, we would like to transfer to Galatasaray.
Riva will end bank debt
Uzbek said that they would soon start building a hall next to TT Arena, "We wanted to build a hall of 13 thousand people."

Mayors to us

Some of the financial issues are still unresolved, so the official statement will be made today or tomorrow.
Pereira and his team dismissed the team yesterday as no official explanation was given.
The total cost of this operation was around 4 million euros.
However, it was stated that F.Bahçe would provide a number of deals under this price for the dismissal.
F.Bahçe, if paying Pereira's salary in advance, will complete a figure between 2 million and 2.5 million euros.

If you get a deal with a team, this payment will be discontinued.
Yes, in the end Pereira went and his Fenerbahce supporter signed a great revolution.

Women say, “You encourage us, we’re proud of you.”
“I opened a door to the women.”

FETÖ Deputy Laughin's assets were seized
The Prosecutor General’s Office for Terrorism-Technical and Organized Crimes Investigation of the Republic of Adana has prepared an indictment for providing funding to the terrorist organization by the Prosecutor General’s Office of the Republic of Adana, in order to ensure the improper increase in the value of non-migrants belonging to persons and organizations linked to FETÖ/PDY, in the case of 17 suspects, Adana was sued to the 2nd Heavy Criminal Court.
In the case where Fetullah Gülen, the number one accused, was convicted of the crime of attempting to eradicate the constitutional order, the court order issued a decision to arrest the accused, Ömer Ekinci, Kemal Elibal and Cemal Soncu, who were injured along with Gülen.
However, the court ruled that the four accused who had not been arrested and brought to trial had been prosecuted.
The Adana 2 Heavy Penal Court has therefore decided to seize all assets of Fetullah Gülen, Ömer Ekinci, Kemal Elibal and Cemal Soncu, who were found in a foreign country in order to ensure that the case in their rights remained unsuccessful and therefore failed to reach him, "in accordance with article 278/1 of the Criminal Proceedings Act (CMK)".
Together with the court’s decision, immovable property belonging to the accused in Turkey, land-sea and air transport vehicles, all kinds of rights and receipts, valuable documents, shares of the company in which the partner is involved, rent cash exists and bank accounts have been frozen.
Hussein Gülerce: The fall of Gülen is due to the fall of three legs
Hussein, who explained the coup attempt by the FETO, made shocking statements.
As follows from Hussein Gülerce’s explanations:
As I thought they were going to strike, I wrote about this in my last five or six months’ writings that “they can strike, but they can’t do in the command chain.”
I did not know two things; the first was that it was widespread and profound in this context, for example, the eight-year command officer of the General Commander of the Gendarmerie and the sons of Mr. President.
Mr. President, the most struggling person, who can pay attention to how he chooses his puppies, but the most important feature of them is an unseen secret.
Two very faces.
One of the most important proofs of the statement “This is not the job a retired preacher like FETO can do” is such a profound blunder.
They are supported by the CIA.
The CIA removed this person very early.
Mahmut Övür in 2014 says that in 1971 they met with Fetullah Gülen in Fuat East at Vehbi Koç's house.
The people who were most interested in this work at that time said it was the period when the relations between the CIA and the MIT were closest.
Our armed forces paid the salary of the U.S. personnel, and one man came out after not remembering them.
We will find out when, in 2014.
There was no explanation of this after Mahmoud’s writing.
For instance, an orphan has been caught, right?
I wonder who this is.
He went to Pennsylvania twice in the last 25 days and returned two days ago.
She has been abroad 109 times since 2002.
When you bring all this together, it is necessary to investigate: now all of those who have fled to the United States since March 1999 when Fetullah Gülen went to the United States, who have gone to the United States with a pretext, it is necessary to investigate.
You will see that they went to Pennsylvania on occasion.
But their true contacts with the CIA can be detected from there; there were many people sent to the U.S. in safety, especially those who needed to be upgraded from security.
Wikileaks has documents; Laughing is setting up an association and this association is holding joint meetings with the CIA.
Fifteen years ago, the CIA had been working to show that connection officially.
Fuat Avni was an intelligence pool in Pennsylvania two years ago.
The man who works at the prime minister's office works for Fuat Avni.
But the worst thing is that this information fell to the CIA just as it fell to Pennsylvania.
The collapse of Gülen depends on the collapse of three legs; one we call the foundation, which formed a friendly loop, there are those who are deeply hypnotized, even this coup attempt is still said to be Erdoğan's film.
I said three legs, a base support.
The stealing of questions, the theft, the defeat of the righteous, this foundation supported very much.
The other two are political support and international support.
International support is still there.
The only thing that will break the political support is to document that the cassettes of Baykal and MHP executives have been withdrawn by the FETO.
After July 15, the “FETÖ” was also used by Mr. Kılıçdaroğlu, and everyone’s eyes were opened.
Laughing is a number that says, “I don’t do it, I do it.”
"Yah, Mr. Hussein, these girl requests see very different dreams, they send me, I have no longer forbidden it, because it's not right to act with dreams."
A voice recording was dropped, the person speaking on the voice recording, Barbaros Kocakurt: Teacher friends dreamed, our Prophet twitted twice.
Police officers in Nusaybin.
According to the information obtained, the armored vehicles in which police performed operational duties in the district of Selahaddin Eyyubi were opened fire with long-armored weapons by terrorists.
At the first fire, a police officer was injured.
Two terrorists were killed in a fight against the police.
The wounded police were taken to Nusaybin State Hospital.
operations in the area.
TV broadcasts were not cut off.
Private televisions, which played an important role in preventing the coup attempt on the night of July 15, continued broadcasting in TurkSat thanks to a technical staff who heroically resisted the assailants.
Here is the hero...
Akkaya, who stated that they had entered the resistance psychology with the instruction to cut the broadcast during the reading of the report in TRT, said: "I took everything in mind by thinking that my friends were martyrs in the fire opened from the helicopter."
They asked me to take a gun and cut off the broadcasts.
I just turned off local TVs.
Then I told them to leave the building by telling us to go to the antennas.
I spent 20 minutes in the area where the antennas were located.
“I cut some cables here again, but I didn’t touch the broadcasts.”
When the bombers failed to cut off the broadcast in Turksat, they brought the specialists of Samanyolu TV.
The terrorists were caught by police who arrived three minutes earlier.
When the assailants returned to the building about an hour later, Akkaya told them that they understood that the TV broadcasts were continuing with the phone that came to them, and that the death came to their nose at that moment.
I took over the guard that night at 8 a.m.
That is where he empowered us.
My friend was a security guard for the e-government and electricity system.
As we met for tea as early as 9 p.m., a low-flight helicopter passed over us.
There were several other aircraft flying quietly around the helicopter.
We saw the lights.
It was probably an unmanned aircraft that could take pictures.
They flew in front of helicopters.
I’ve been there for 11 years, because it’s the first time I’ve seen such a close flight.
Then a movement began.
When we watched the news, we learned that the bridge was closed.
In the meantime, our general manager instructed those friends who were not in charge at the moment to come into the building.
As we went to the settlement to get information, we learned that all the packages of the publications in TRT fell.
TRT broadcasts were discontinued for 5 minutes.
I called the headquarters, but I couldn’t get there.
Our control station said the TRT broadcasts came back and began to read the notice.
Our Deputy Director-General Halil Greençimen, on the instructions of the Director-General, requested the immediate cessation of TRT broadcasts.
We started working to cut the broadcast because TRT has a broadcast from 3 channels.
We recently heard that the Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım said there is a "outbreak."
Our director’s order to “stop the TRT” brought us into a bit of resistance psychology.
We cut off the TRT, and after a while we heard the sound of a helicopter.
We went out, the helicopter that descended on the settlement fired everywhere, everyone was scattered side by side.
We hid in a building on the back.
We were 12 people.
When we arrived, the soldiers from the helicopter came in.
Some of our soldiers were captured.
We came out not to leave them alone.
In the meantime, I saw that they caught our assistant general manager and fell on their knees.
The soldiers were talking to each other.
“Let’s shoot one of them, let them be afraid.”
Then they put us all inside.
The commanders started shouting, “Who is responsible for this, I will not ask again.”
When we heard talk like “Let’s shoot someone,” we thought, “We don’t know about the country, but we got an instruction, ‘Cut down the TRT.’
There is a resistance.
At that moment, I felt like I had abandoned myself.
I said “my.”
I stood up without knowing what to do.
The only thing I thought at that moment was that my friends were shot from the helicopter.
I thought that there were 10-15 friends in the group, and when I thought that they would kill us in the end, I felt reassured.
The commander said, “You’ll cut off all broadcasts except TRT.”
We have a system section that we monitor when local channels are sent to the satellite.
We are broadcasting 80 of the 200 local channels.
I thought this room came.
There were no national broadcasts.
If I cut them off and say they’re all cut off, at least until that time help will come from outside.
Or go where he goes.
In the end, we agreed that we couldn’t get out of there.
“I’m going to cut it off.”
I cut off the antenna output of one of the local channel packages.
I cut off the power button that goes to monitors where we can watch national channels.
There were no signals on the screen.
I said I had to go to the antennas to be able to cut it completely.
The commander sent me to the antenna with two soldiers.
I opened the antenna room and one of the soldiers said, “Stop.”
He put his gun on my arm.
“You’ll cut them all but TRT, none will be left, I’ll hit one of you in the end, that’s you.”
I said, “When you go, you’ll see that it’s all going to be frozen,” and I said nothing else.
We entered the station and cut off local broadcasts.
I went to the other antenna.
At that time, I had a system that corresponded to the near 20 national channels.
When the local channels were cut off, about 20 monitors were wasted.
My Lord has given us such a help that we did not have difficulty in answering them and He has bound them with their claims.
They trusted the answers we gave.
They did not produce.
This relieved us.
When they got out, they asked about the location of the trail.
“I don’t know I’m a TV broadcaster,” he said, “Is there an electrician among you?”
“I said that after the evening, there will be no electricity, if the team fails, it will come.”
There was an electrician at the time.
I didn’t think I cut off the broadcasts.
I also wanted to cut off the soldiers.
They felt relieved because they thought the broadcasts were cut off.
They couldn’t watch the broadcasts.
Now the group is waiting.
About an hour later, when the TV was turned on in the waiting room, they saw A News broadcast.
The soldier entered.
He said he did not interrupt the news.
We met with the commander.
He said, “Rise up.”
I got up.
At that time, a soldier said, “There are broadcasts that are ongoing.”
“There are broadcasting channels in Cyprus.”
“They are broadcasting over Cyprus, we can’t do anything to them.”
Then he said, “After you have written to one of them, let us all stand up and walk.”
The attackers fled Turksat in a minibus.
I saw from the photos that the soldier who took me to the toilet and gave me water was executed in the seat of that minibus.
Three shots were fired from his foreheads and cheeks.
My friends confirmed that he was the same soldier.
They called him a “soldat.”
Probably a soldier.
They may have been executed to get rid of him.
According to Asim Akkaya’s statements, the first police team came to Turksat from Gölbaşı.
When police teams learned that helicopters were around, security guards returned to the district and went to collect ammunition.
They came back after 40 minutes.
When the police arrived, they could not see anyone in the outskirts.
Akkaya told the police that the alleged experts who were sent from Samanyolu TV only 3-4 minutes later arrived in the building, "They said to the police teams 'they called us from the inside, we are TurkSat staff, we need to get in urgently.'"
“When the police asked for identity, four of them were alarmed and hugged their phones at once and told them that we were caught inside.”
The Soul of the Mountains
The AK Party will move to Diyarbakır, Van and Mardin at the beginning of September with a large delegation of businessmen, artists, athletes and art leaders among them to establish "heart bridges" with citizens in the region.
AK Party is preparing to move the "Yenikapı spirit" formed by democratic attacks to Diyarbakır after the bloody coup attempt of the FETO/PDY party.
The support campaign, which will take place in the East and Southeast Anatolian regions before the Victim Day, will also be invited to the CHP and MHP provincial presidents.
The AK Party, which will send the message "State and people with you" to the people of the region, will deliver help to poor families and those in need.
The Gönül Bridge Project, which was held for the first time in Ramadan, was discussed at the last MYK meeting of the AK Party.
At the meeting, which assessed the positive outcomes of the project aimed at families in need, especially young people and children affected by terrorism in the region, it was decided to continue on the Victim Day of the Gönül Bridge.
The Vice-President General, President of Civil Society Public Relations Mehmet Müezzinoğlu began his work.
Accordingly, 12 provinces in the east and southeast will be gathered in Diyarbakır, Mardin and Van.
Three meetings will be held prior to the celebration.
At the events, businessmen, artists, athletes and art leaders will also participate.
At these meetings, the organization of aid and work will be dealt with.
On the occasion of the Victim Day, delegations of famous names will also bring their help to citizens themselves.
Young people and children will be paid holiday fees, and school needs will be paid in this way because schools are open after the holidays.
The meat will be distributed to those in need.
After July 15, the national unity between the AK Party, CHP and MHP against the coup will also reflect this project.
12 CHP and MHP presidents will also be invited to the organizations.
Assistance activities will be carried out jointly by three parties.
It is believed that the HDP is not invited to the events as in Newcastle.
The father-in-law of the orphan said.
He was arrested along with the father-in-law of FETÖ’s Just Orphan’s brother-in-law, who was shown as the number one of the July 15 coup attempt, and sent to court.
Father Jevat Yıldırım and wife Hatice Yıldırım were released on condition of judicial control and a ban on exit.
When he was sentenced to the trial, he said, “I am with the state.”
May God bless the wicked.
I didn’t really know the man I’ve known for 18 years.
I don’t have an orphan.
I want to get caught a moment ago.
You cannot live in this world or in the world.
Trust the Turkish justice.
If he makes a mistake, he will be punished.
It hurts us to escape.
It is a pity for the government, a pity for the government.
For 20-25 days, the police have not done any other work.
Yildirim said that Turkey does not want to return to Syria, "We do not need a coup, we need to work."
We don’t want Turkey to be like Syria.
Syria has a neighbor like Turkey.
We have a president like Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
He said, “What do we have to do with our affairs?”
On the other hand, the last 19th of July at 03:00 AM when it was shown passing through the axes of the TEM Highway Akyazı, the "SIR" plate car was left in Akyazı in the garage of his father-in-law's house after he was involved in the losses.

Smoking ban in parks and sports areas
Bilecik Mayor Selim Yağcı, at the signing ceremony held at the Sheik Edebali Cultural and Congress Center, said that they have added an article to the regulation of the banquet in the point of not smoking in parks, sports and play areas with the decision of the City Council.

He saw a man in Ergenekon and killed a fetus.
The Prosecutor General’s Office of the Republic of Ankara is investigating the role of the FETO in the mysterious death of the head of the Special Operations Department Behçet Oktay, which was closed in 2009 as “suicidal”.
Ramazan Akyürek, the former head of the Security Intelligence Department, who remained in the same location as Oktay and listened to him with a fake name as a suspect of the Hezbollah terror organization six days before Oktay died, is the chief suspect in the investigation.
It is alleged that some of the ammunition seized as part of the Ergenekon investigation was stolen and buried from the Special Operations Office by the security FETO team, which was also killed because of Oktay's identification.
The death of Behçet Oktay, the head of the Special Operations Department of the period, who was shot in Ankara on February 25, 2009 was called "suicide".
There were many question marks in the case.
Two years after the legal struggle of his family and family lawyers and the evidence he disclosed, this time the murder investigation was opened.
The gun was said to have been shot by the left-handed Oktay.
Furthermore, fractures and traces of stroke were detected on the body.
The investigation into the murder was opened in May 2012.
In the murder case, only Halil Kesici was tried, who was near him when he died and found a trace of barut in his hand.
The judge eventually resigned.
Nurhan Önder, who is in prison for another crime and sent a letter to the prosecutor's office, saying he was involved in Oktay's death, was sentenced to six months in prison for "assuming the crime and misleading the judicial authorities."
The rescuers are questioned.
Meanwhile, the prosecutor Hussein Yalçin, who called the incident "suicide", was promoted to Mustafa Düzgün Judy, who conducted the murder investigation, while he retired.
The family of Oktay, along with the prosecutors, wants the autopsy prosecutor Nihat Yıldırım to be investigated.
Behçet Oktay’s sister, Shule Oktay, and his brother, Nezih Oktay, and family lawyers made many requests during the trial.
The family, who said it was not possible for Halil Kesici to kill private-trained Oktay alone, called for an extension of the investigation.
The family who said the incident was covered up, prosecutors Hüseyin Yalçın and Mustafa Düzgün and Behçet Oktay requested that security officials who wanted to close the Behçet Oktay file as suicide be identified and tried.
While all the family’s demands were rejected, it turned out that Oktay was rested under the fake name “Abdurrahman Doğru” as a member of the Hezbollah Terrorist Organization 6 days before his death.
He was also confirmed to be the head of the security intelligence department of the time, Ramazan Akyürek.
On this development, the Ankara Republic Prosecutor General’s Office, which re-examined the Behçet Oktay file, began to examine the finger of the Fetullahist Terrorist Organization (FETÖ) in the murder.
The trial before the Ankara Heavy Criminal Court for Oktay’s illegal rest will begin on September 19.
There is a natural fat in the back.
The family of Oktay, whom he met in the morning, is hopeful of the current investigation.
Family members say that the FETÖ finger in the murder was covered during the previous demonstrative investigation and trial.
Sister Shule Oktay, “This murder actually came to show.”
We could not perceive.
My brother said they would eat me before I was killed.
I said “Kim.”
He then pointed to me the fetus.
I thought I would be removed from office.
I never thought of death.
There is, of course, a fetus behind this.
He said, “They were in charge of this.”
He called the young man’s family and joined his prayer.
After President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan spoke to the citizens at the Presidential Hall of Fame in the last watch of the evening, interrupted by the democracy guards, AK Party Sinop MP Nazim Maviş also called the family of the democracy city university Ömer Can Açıkgöz.
At 1:30 p.m., when they prayed for their son, Father Fahrettin declared that the phone came, "Our President also attended with his prayers."
“I said that our country and his health are important to us.”
“Your health is important to us.”
President Erdogan spoke to the citizens in front of the Presidential Hall of Fame last night.
Erdogan met with some citizens in Shilei after his conversation ended at midnight.
Tayyip Erdoğan, who walked along with an elderly aunt who was in charge of democracy, spoke with the citizens, cared for the children, and thanked the citizens for their sacrifices.
Erdogan subsequently, through AK Party Sinop MP Nazim Maviş, called the father of Ömer Can Açıkgöz, the city of 15 July, Fahrettin Açıkgöz.
TOBB University Law School student 21-year-old Ömer Can's father, Fahrettin Açıkgöz, stated that while praying at home for his son and the martyrs at 1:30 p.m., President Erdoğan was looking for him, "When I said we prayed for my son, our President also attended with his prayers."
He said that he and his family are very important to us.
“We were very pleased that the President called us and prayed on the phone.”
The FETÖ’s pyramid collapsed.
26 FETÖs were arrested in Izmir Urla.
Among the detainees is Liberation Naip Hepalç, who, in line with the statements of the victims, is referred to within the organization as "revolte", i.e. rape, and threatens those who want to terminate the subscription to the Time newspaper.
Twenty sisters of FETÖ’s servants were arrested.
In Bursa, 24 people, including former Bursa Security Director Ali Osman Kahya, were brought to justice.
Doctor Imami Arrested
In Edirne, an imam of the doctors responsible for the organization was arrested.
14 professors at Denizli Pamukkale University, 30, Alanya Alaaddin Keykubat University, 19, 2 academics at Karabük University, and FETÖ lieutenant Hilmi Sandal in Rize were arrested.
In Diyarbakır, eight judges and prosecutors and two deputy governors were arrested.
One of the judges was arrested in the courtroom.
Batman's Deputy Governor Shener Age has been revealed.
Two of the 465 police officers arrested in Istanbul.
In Konya 51, in Kayseri 14, in Malatya 14, in Siirt 10 police officers and in Adana provincial imam Naim S. were arrested.
He defended the PKK who attacked the people.
Turkey, which has been fighting for more than forty years to end the PKK terror, has begun to appear on the face of the day when it could not destroy the organization’s leaders in this struggle.
FETO militants infiltrated the critical institutions of Turkey have tried to tie Turkey’s hand on all four sides.
At the point of arrival today, serious suspicions and evidence began to emerge that the FETO was behind critical events such as the murder of Hrant Dink, the Uludere incident, the crash of the Russian aircraft.
We are very knowledgeable.
During the July 15 coup attempt, it turned out that the archive of FETO’s General Gökhan Şahin Sönmezateş, who directed the attack and assassination operation on President Tayyip Erdoğan’s hotel in Marmaris, was too big.
Earlier it was determined that Sönmezateş would report air operations to the PKK to terrorists while the planes were taking off.
In the investigations carried out by the intelligence units, it was also determined that the record of Gökhan Sönmezateş was flawed.
Protecting the terrorists
In addition to the leakage of intelligence to the PKK, it was also revealed that Turkish warplanes did not strike the specified targets exactly.
It was alleged that the point of intelligence provided by the MIT in the Kandil districts regarding the leadership of the terrorist organization PKK was prevented from hitting targets by being distorted by Gökhan Sönmezateş.
With the change of coordinates, it was determined that the fighter jets that flew to destroy the leadership of the PKK, hit places on the side of targets, and the terrorist organization’s leaders were thus eliminated.
In the intelligence investigation, it turned out that Sönmezateh played a key role in both the disruption of targets and the F-16s in the escape of PKK terrorists from where they were.
37,000 officers registered
Following the crackdown of the coup attempt by FETÖ members on the instructions of the terrorist head Fetullah Gülen, the reconstruction process was initiated in the TSK and in the Ministry of National Defense.
Especially when it was discovered that the entry questions to military high schools were stolen by the FETO, and that non-organized military students were sent out of schools by lightning, a comprehensive cleaning process was initiated.
With the final exports, about 37 thousand officers will be left behind from 39 thousand 287 officers, while the cleaning for generals and admirals will also be carried out for these officers.
For this reason, advancements will be frozen, especially in officers ranging from lieutenant to colonel.
A thorough investigation will be completed before the promotion.
The archives of 37,000 officers began to be opened.
With a total of 40 wounded soldiers, the FETÖ membership will be revealed.
Officers who do not have any relationship with the FETÖ will continue to perform their duties.
While it is stated that the struggle will continue until the last FETO is cleared from the army, the promotion of officers will only take place after the investigation.
The investigation is conducted jointly by the Ministry of Intelligence, Security Intelligence and the State Supervisory Board.
The officers who opened the file as part of the investigation are investigated whether they received rankings from civilians or harp school graduates, promotions they received, where they performed their duties and commanders.
Furthermore, it will also be investigated whether or not a member of the FETÖ has been wounded by a laboratory.
All measures will be taken to ensure that officers who have no connection with the FETO are not adversely affected by the process.
If the slightest suspicion is found, the officer will be brought to trial immediately.
Those who are identified with the FETÖ connection, those with knowledge and documents on their rights will be immediately cut off from the army.
As promotions are frozen during all these processes, the examination will be deepened.
Precautions will also be taken to ensure that there are no vacancies in the exchanges afterwards.
Those discharged from the TSK and forcibly retired by the FETO will be able to return to their professions with the same self-rights as their co-workers and counterparts after passing the security investigation if they wish.
2 out of 133 subpairs exported

Turkey: Turkey is poisoned by fetus
Tahsin Pehlivanoğlu, who retired from the guardians of MHP founder and first general president Alparslan Turkesh, argued that Turkesh was killed by poisoning and that this was done by one of the family in cooperation with the FETO.
From 1977, until 1997 when he died, Pehlivanoğlu, who was on Turkish side every moment, said: "I have not told anyone until now, but I have to talk after watching the picture of that soldier who was ripped out of Muhsin Yazıcıoğlu's helicopter and seeing that the same soldier was in the raidmen assigned to kill our President."
Here is what the Turkish police said:
I went to Germany in 1997.
We checked out three days before we arrived.
A 33-year-old doctor in Burdur thought, “You’re like an 18-year-old.”
He said, “You have nothing.”
He died of a heart attack a month later.
We returned to Ankara on April 3.
My father went to Amasya.
When they returned, they called me and went to a bar in Ankara Hilton.
After leaving, the Turkish driver tells Alparslan to "open the rear window."
He would not open the glass.
When the window opens, there is a loud sound.
They first performed a heart massage at the Chankaya Medical Center, but it was over.
We drove him to the medical center, but the work was over.
I think one of the family was poisoned in Amasya.
No autopsy was performed.
His ex-wife, Seval Turkeş, will have heard my discomfort and my words that came out and made statements to defend that "Turkey was killed."
The man makes the tomb, he opens the tomb.
He had a heart attack.
The Turkish tomb must be reopened.
Was the Turkish army killed?
They were arrested while stealing gold from Pennsylvania.

We picked up the siper, and then when the tank went, we continued to walk.
There was a bus stop on the bridge.
There was a lot of crowd.
We stayed there for a while and waited.
We wondered what to do if we could not move forward.
He asked us to cross the side.
When I crossed the side row, I guess it was a sharp sniper, we were a clear target and it was shot there.
After four hours of prayer, the prayer was completed.
There was no news of the shooting.
The wisdom of God.
God is the God of Alan.

Esenoğlu said that thousands of pieces of sunlight and the influence of the shooting separated from the comet called "Swift - tuttle" and formed the Perseid rainbow rain, this will become a fairly natural visual celebration.
Esenoğlu said that the Perseid skystone was first discovered in 1862, and since the 1990s it has been seen again in the world.
Esenoğlu, who said that the Perseid rains can be seen in July and August, said, “We need to be interested in seeing such a visual celebration coming from space.”
After all, this is a natural celebration.
“It will help us understand the universe better,” he said.
Red when cold, white when warm.
Esenoğlu, noting that some of the pieces that fell during the rain of the rock would fall to the earth in the size of a threshold, continued:
Perseid temperatures can reach up to 2,000 degrees Celsius.
Due to warming and friction in the atmosphere, Perseids produce red light when they are cold in the natural environment and white light when they are hot.
It is possible to contribute to science by writing how many sky rocks are seen on the International Astronomical Organization’s website.
This data is valuable because it is collected from all over the world.
Can be watched all night.
Recalling that the skystone rain moves at a speed of about 60 kilometers per second, Esenoğlu said that this visual celebration in the sky can be seen well throughout the night from places with little light in the northeastern direction.
Esenoğlu, who that more than 100 skyscraper rains occurred per year, noted that after the Perseid skyscraper rain, the Geminid skyscraper rain on 4-17 December was a natural event worth watching.
Less-educated former footballer
If this imbalance was disrupted, it was the winning alliance of Fetullah Gülen, a widely religious entrepreneur with populist Islamists led by poorly educated former footballer Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who founded more than thousands of schools, dozens of universities and educational institutes from Texas to Tashkent.
A translation of the above sentence in an article published last week in Foreign Policy.
Erdogan, a graduate of the university, is a poorly educated and former footballer; Gülen, a primary school graduate, is described as a wide-ranging entrepreneur, and these and similar articles are widely praised by Gülen’s leaders are frequently featured in the Western press.
After that, on the other hand, they try to explain in their articles on the subject “Why is the anti-America and/or the West rising in Turkey?” with sentences beginning with “Because Erdoğan...”.
It is possible to think that analysts who view the Western opposition in Turkey as a situation that emerged during Erdogan’s period are beyond the history of Turkey.
In fact, if you look at statistics, the first decade of the Erdoğan era can be read as a period in which the opposition of the West in Turkey decreased or remained on average.
Over the past decade, the United States hasined good relations with the European Union and the United States.
The fact that Erdogan criticized Israel with one-minute, that the massacres of the Assad regime in Syria resulted in the outbreak of the civil war, that the EU failed to show a clear policy and left Turkey alone in the refugee crisis, that some figures like European Parliament President Schulz won with a poem of disgusting statements that you can not imagine in the group, that the Turkish people who entered the country in the form of "Erdoğan is not our counterpart", that the Turkish people repair the PKK live bombs and repair our citizens in Britain, that the Turkish mayor of the YPG in the Syrian Armed Forces, the former Minister of Foreign Affairs in the United States, can create loyal offices in Europe with the need for unity, that the United States' soldiers who have lost their duties in Syria will be reduced to the threat of YPG to Turkey, the DAPGE, and why it is not a special representative of the United States and even the Muslims in the fight to visit YPGE.
Let us say that as a result of the bloody coup, we lost our 247 people, we forgot that the EU countries, our alleged allies, and the United States did not support our democracy until the failure of the coup was proven, that in Kerry’s first speech on the matter they expected to build “peace and stability in Turkey,” and that they did not put any emphasis on democracy and the elected government.
Well, how can it be forgotten that many leaders from around the world, including Turkey, participated in the protest march because of the murder of 11 Charlie Hebdo employees in Paris, but a month has passed since the coup attempt in which 247 people who resisted tanks for democracy were killed?
What about sending lower-level representatives from presidents or senior delegates who come several times a year to deal with the refugee issue?
How will we assess that all EU and US ambassadors have gone to visit the Hürriyet newspaper because the window was broken and do not attend a visit of solidarity to the bombed Greater Turkish National Assembly?
If it is remembered that during the first two weeks when the coup in Egypt took place, the EU sent a high-level representative to shake hands with the coup leader Sisi, and Kerry glorified the coup administration by saying "democracy is being rebuilt" in the post-coup visit, is it very abnormal that the Western countries who refused to support Turkey in their resistance to democracy expressed their concerns about Turkey's democracy at every opportunity?
But even allowing Gülen to live freely in the United States, whom 95 percent of the people see as responsible for the coup, is now enough to upset the Turkish people.
In addition to the background I cited above, I think it is clear that the rising Western/American antithesis cannot be explained by Erdogan alone.
Furthermore, Erdogan has not even said that he believes that the US has an influence on the coup.
So the box was never folded.
The Gezi fools who see their own people as small, who say "Sandık teferruattır", who humiliate voters who don't think like him as "ignorants who chew the sword," can they steal from the same wire after the night of July 15th?
After seeing how this people got to the state and democracy, did they ask the question, "Where did we go wrong?"
But are there so many questions to answer?
Officers who served at various degrees until yesterday and were given the right to use the weapons of the state, at one point accepted to enter the status of "Hain" and sought asylum from foreign states.
We must see how we live in an environment of mental turmoil and how obsessions with people lead people to behaviors that will be described as misguided.
When the brains start to blow...
Was there a perspective beyond comparing the cities of Turkey to the cities of Syria for those who participated in this action?
Why should an officer bomb his country’s parliament?
We should not fall into the mistake of expecting mindful behavior from the brains irrigated with the feathers of the FETO.
Others are responsible, but let us know that not only FETÖ is responsible for everything.
The personnel who presented politics as a profession of struggle, resentment and hatred have also made necessary contributions to the tragedies experienced.
Those who describe themselves as “Aid” have also convinced the masses that all kinds of irregular behavior and even ignorance are natural.
When we were given weapons to the hands of those who hated their own people, we even saw how they opened fire to this people.
The Way of Democracy, the Way We Know
I say something very simple: on the evening of 15 July in Turkey, the people’s soldiers in the FETÖ gave to the tufels, harams, sheriffs 250 citizens and built a lot to save democracy.
But there are three periods behind July 15, 1992-2002; 2002-2012; 2012 and beyond.
There are three changes prepared over these three periods: economic, social, and political.
Social change has produced two major phenomena: the migration from rural areas to the metropolis and the transfer of these migrants to the center after being held around the cities for a very long time.
I said on Wednesday that this transportation was via the subway.
I also stressed that the metro is the most important social change element.
The second major shift in the same direction are bridges and roads.
The contribution of the road and bridge to modernization is easier to understand.
The way comes, the economic and social structure changes.
It has changed the political structure as well.
I have identified this history with the bridges thrown over the throat in Istanbul since then.
Demirel built the throat bridge.
This was the culmination of the rural movement after 1950 in the 1960s.
Özal continued to move in the same direction with the second bridge, now called the 15 July City Bridge.
Even these routes show the established relationship between the surroundings.
It is also a sign of what kind of social change is being followed.
Demirel and Özal paid to melt the large masses in the center.
The ideology of the center.
The AK Party has not built the third bridge for many years.
The river was moving at all speed.
The people who came were placed in satellite cities.
A little closed system was established in those areas.
The local governments of the AK Party gave people superiority, jobs, social status, and they also voted for the AK Party.
So the masses were not asked to melt in the center, but to acquire their political consciousness in the surrounding and then come to the center as "they themselves."
This formation was related to the pre-AK Party headquarters discussions (1992-2002).
These discussions accepted to the masses the need for conservative, mute and stone people not to integrate with the center, but to stand side by side.
AK Party acted in the manner I stated after 2002 by masses politized, incorporated into politics, matured.
Following this, now note, the construction of the 3rd Bridge is simultaneous with the democratic struggle on July 15.
History and sociology are intertwined.
I’ll add another dimension to this: the AK Party’s movement, which I mentioned, is not limited to the Istanbul bridges only.
Something more interesting is happening: AK Party is now integrating surrounding cities with central cities.
It goes through two bridges.
The Osmangazi Bridge.
The 1915 bridge.
Add these paths.
Turkey will now reach Izmir from Trakia by another route.
Do you know what this means, İzmir will now be a different city.
Let’s say that the AK party won’t take the “Island” from the inside anymore.
Now Bursa, now Çanakkale, now the towns of Trakya will become other villages and social geographies.
That is all!
The 15th of July are the stars of this great adventure.
Van Persie in Fenerbahce
Fenerbahçe continued the preparations for the Grasshoppers match with their morning training.
The training, under the direction of Technical Director Vitor Pereira at Can Bartu Facilities, began at 10.00 a.m. and lasted a total of 1 hour and 30 minutes.
After a 30-minute core training in the hall, the players who came to the field performed 5 to 2 ball capture and passing exercises with running and heating movements.
The training was completed with two castle matches in the narrow field.
Fenerbahçe will continue their preparations with training tonight.
The man who laughed at the Holy Spirit...
New developments are taking place with the Fenerbahce Shield Operation.
Journalist Hüseyin Gülerce, who participated in a program broadcast on CNN Turkey and explained that this operation was carried out by the FETÖ, "a name from the sporting world raised Fethullah Gülen the words of Aziz Yıldırım about him."
“One day in the airplane, this person said, ‘What do you do next to Fethullah Laughen?’
When he laughed at him, he laughed at him, and he laughed at him.
Why did he go to the Holy Light?
The president of the most supportive club in Turkey, if he is in this mindset, may hurt him with his thought.
“The case was to purge the Holy Light,” he said.
After these words, an explanation came from Faik Light, one of the key lawyers of the Shike Case.
The light appeared in the Contrary Opinion program published in Habertürk and revealed the person who complained about Aziz Yıldırım to FETÖ deputy Fethullah Gülen.
Here are the words of the light:
The Holy Spirit says something about the laughter of Fethullah Gülen.
On a private plane from Azerbaijan.
The saint is a sensible man, he also speaks with fluid phrases when criticizing someone.
Maybe those words are a little winged.
Some people may react to those words.
These phrases are grown somewhere.
The towels, handbags, the businessman going there as if he had gone to Hach, Umre, is not a job to be accepted with such tolerance.
What they say, they criticize heavily.
The only problem is, of course, not that.
In the meantime, they also try a football team.
The direct links of some footballers and managers from the Galatasaray Club and Hakan...
Teacher: The matter is different
Trabzonspor president Muharrem Master extended his hand of friendship to Fenerbahçe.
The Master, who stated that the issue of Turkey is a matter of all clubs, said: "We are on the side of this country with 79 million."
We have to take a standing stance.
If Fenerbahçe has a problem with FETO, if it is wrong, I will stand behind Fenerbahçe.
“But the style issue between Trabzonspor and Fenerbahçe is different.”
Price of victims revealed
Karabulut said: "As a unit, we set the price of the kilogram of the living sacrifice as £18.
“We also determined the price of the cow once again as £17 for the living kilogram, as well as £15 for the living kilogram of the cow that we defined as the second class.”
Karabulut, who noted that animals that would not be sacrificed were also sold last year, told citizens what they should pay attention to when taking sacrifices:
Particular attention should be paid to animals.
It is also important that the animal is healthy.
For this, our citizens can check their vaccines in the animal’s passport when taking the victim.
In terms of external appearance, the victim must also be alive and alive, throwing his hair on him.
There should be no signs of saliva on the face.
In recent years, we have seen that animals that were not sacrificed were also offered for sale and sold.
An animal must be 2 years old.
We can see this by looking at the animals’ teeth.
The teeth of a two-year-old animal that we described as a cap have emerged.
The younger animals have no teeth.
In the image, the animal may look large, but the covers may not have the teeth out.
The teeth are also noticeable because they are already bigger than others.
Rize Airport to be located at sea
Turkey’s second airport will be Rize Airport.
Rize Airport will be built on the sea flood 26 to 32 meters from the coast, in the area of 266 hectares between the village of Yeşilköy in the district of Sunday and the girl tower position.
Due to the excessive depth in the construction of the Rize airport, approximately 3 times more filling material will be used than used at Army-Entresun Airport.
Within the framework of the project, a 45-meter high and 3,000-meter-long runway will be built where 36 aircraft can land per hour.
Rize Airport, which will generally serve passenger and cargo aircraft, is also expected to serve aircraft with composition class D, turbine class heavy, take-off weight of more than 150 thousand kilograms.
In the first phase for the Rize Airport project, which will be tendered on September 8 by the Ministry of Transportation, Maritime and Communications General Directorate for Construction Investments, sea flooding, piste, apron, taxi, environmental, safety wire rope, rope, PAT fields and environmental lighting works will be carried out.
The project will cost 600 million pounds.
After the infrastructure works, 150 million lira will be spent on the upper construction works covering the terminal buildings.
The construction of Rize Airport will be completed in 2 years and 9 months.

Here are the soccer players in Galatasaray's talk
It turned out that Galatasaray and national footballers who hit the stamp of Turkish football for a period took part in the conversation of Fetullah Gülen, the FETÖ deputy, in 1996.
In the image it was said to have been taken in 1996, among the footballers listening to Fetullah Gülen's conversation Hakan Ünsal, Mert Korkmaz, Okan Buruk, Arif Erdem, Ismail Demiriz, Uğur Tütüneker and Yusuf Tepekule is clearly evident.
In the conversation, he used the phrase of Galatasaray, "We scored four goals, we won."
Said Alpsoy, known as the former football imam of the FETO, also told the newspaper SABAH in recent days, "When Turkey was third in the world in 2002, the prize was distributed to the team."
He gave thanks, grace, grace, grace, grace, grace, grace, grace, grace, grace, grace, grace, grace, grace, grace, grace, grace, grace and grace.
The money collected was $250,000 or $500,000.
The money was taken to Pennsylvania.
Then he laughed and said, “Ariel, you have a lot to say.”
National football players participated in the laughing conversation!

Very striking statements about FETÖ from Robert Amsterdam!
Robert Amsterdam, an official at the law firm Amsterdam&Partners, which has legally investigated the international illegal activities of the FETO, wrote an article to the U.S. magazine Forbes, sharing information on how the FETO is organized.
Amsterdam said that FETÖ Deputy Fetullah Gülen is managing the organization from his headquarters in Pennsylvania, saying that when Gülen "lookes closely at how he runs about 150 charter schools in the U.S., it will be clear that the organization has secretly advanced organizational capabilities underground."
Amsterdam said seven months ago that it was commissioned by Turkey to investigate Gülen-affiliated companies and schools, stressing that what they have found so far is “shocking.”
Amsterdam, in its article, placed the following views:
According to information given to us by the dispatchers, the Laughing organization has a rigorous hierarchy in which instructions are transmitted.
These instructions are usually transmitted in face-to-face meetings in Smile and Poconos.
There are seven ruling groups on the hill.
This group transmits the instructions to the advisory committee.
Instructions from here go to regional imams, country imams, regional imams within the country, provincial imams, regional imams within the provinces, neighborhood imams, student home imams (light homes) and students.
Businessmen, bureaucrats and officers work at different levels depending on their positions and support within the organization.
The organization has created 55,000 jobs worldwide and has the largest contract school network in the U.S., Amsterdam, that millions of dollars of taxes paid by American taxpayers are given to these schools each year.
Amsterdam wrote that most of this money was directed between the members of the organization and transferred to “selected” companies.
Amsterdam explained this operation with the following examples:
California-based Magnolia schools were caught giving a $700,000 annual service contract to the company that Gülen was affiliated with and shared the same office.
Amsterdam has shown the Dove Science Academy in Oklahoma as another example.
Amsterdam noted that the school also paid the property owner an additional $3.1 million, and that audits found that the school and the management of the property company were made up of the same people linked to Gülen.
Amsterdam, which noted that similar situations were found in Harmony schools with 46 branches, which hold the largest place in the Gülen network, noted that smaller companies linked to the FETÖ were paid with pennies such as software licenses, curriculum purchase.
Amsterdam, drawing gold on what was done within the FETO, said, “These examples I have given show that about $28 million of American taxpayers are being abused.”
“But that’s what we’ve seen so far,” he said.
Amsterdam, which pointed out that so far nothing has been done to prevent such events, reminded that the situation has worsened over the past period, and that the Texas Education Office has started investigating the irregularities on all of these.
Amsterdam stressed that schools seemed to function normally, and that many employees did not have information about what kinds of corruption were involved.
Amsterdam, "But in fact these schools are working like a snow machine for Laughter."
"Laughing then uses his enormous amounts of money for political donations to hide his illegal activities," he said.
According to a former American teacher who worked in these schools, Amsterdam said that some employees in Gülen schools held separate meetings and transferred a certain portion of their wages to the organization, "It is believed that Gülen members in the Turkish Armed Forces also worked in a similar job."
The coup provokers have strengthened their positions over the years.
"But apparently the army was working normally while a parallel force was gathering power behind the scenes," he wrote.
Amsterdam concluded his article:
There are questions of interest in the minds of U.S. policymakers about the events of 15-16 July and beyond, and that’s something expected.
But while dealing with the situation of the two allies on a diplomatic level, individual government officials need to wake up to the fact that Gülen’s operations violate U.S. law in a massive way.

Explanation of Zaccaria by Sergeant
Asked about the allegations that Zekeriya Öz and Fairy Orphan were captured in Georgia, Çavuşoğlu said, "At the moment this information is not true."
Different reports are coming.
All of this is assessed.
We are in close contact with local authorities.
“Every kind of detail, information, information is carefully assessed.”
Asked if they were suspicious of being in Georgia, Çavuşoğlu said, “Zekeriya Öz had fled to Georgia before.”
It was detected by cameras at the customs gate.
He knows he is coming to Europe.
We look at every information that comes to us, not just for these two, but for every information about other fugitives.
Wherever they flee, we will follow their footprints.”
Asked about his meeting with the Iranian leader, Cevad Zarif, Sergei Cavusoglu said, “Two issues were assessed.”
There are a lot of issues between Iran and Turkey.
Our common struggle against terrorism is political, commercial, transport, energy.
There are regional issues.
The first is Syria, Iraq, Yemen and the Gulf Region.
Turkey and Iran can play an important role in solving the geographic problems we live in.
We have ideas on many things.
We are both of the opinion on many issues, such as Syria’s territorial integrity, border integrity and the cleansing of Daesh and other terrorist organizations in Syria, having an inclusive government.
We had different opinions about Assad.
We will continue to talk about it as always.
We want to continue the Geneva ceasefire negotiations.
It makes no sense unless the unity of views in many matters essentially brings results.
He said, “The important thing is to get the result.”
Asked when Turkish aircraft would participate in operations in Syria, Çavuşoğlu said: "Our delegation had gone to Moscow on this matter."
“The purpose of establishing these mechanisms is to take steps in the fight against Daesh, especially here, and to coordinate any incident so that the accident does not occur.”
When asked about Iran’s gas purchases, Çavuşoğlu said: “Iran and Turkey are two brother countries.”
The arbitrators should not decide, we can make an agreement between us about it.
There was a little sitem.
We must be able to make these agreements before we go to arbitration.
“We have demanded gas cuts, we have demanded prices,” he said.
Asked about the date of Gülen’s return to America, Çavuşoğlu said: “A delegation from America will come in the 22nd.”
The meetings will take place on August 23-24.
The Ministry of Justice is preparing the file.

One of these children is dying.
The other is in a heavy condition too.
He carries injured people in his car’s luggage from Narince to Kahta.

Thankfully, he followed the team car that his father had taken with him in front of the Security Department.
The Sakarya Republic Prosecutor General’s Office has determined that Hakan Şükür and his father, Selmet Şükür, provided financial support to the FETO.

Beware of children’s habits.
Dentist Dr. Bilgin Giray of the Faculty of Dental Medicine said that children relaxed with this reflex by making sucking a necessity because they couldn’t chew at an early age.
Dr. Giray, who listed the reasons for the appearance of finger sucking habits in children, said: "Finger sucking is an event that occurs from birth to 3-4 years of age."
Most babies swallow their toes.
After the age of 1–1,5 a child suckles his finger to satisfy the need to suck in childhood, the mother’s breast suckles his finger to relieve and relieve his cravings.
He said, “He can get bored and squeeze himself, when he sleeps, when he’s anxious, and when he’s away from his mother, his finger can suck.”
Dr. Bilgin Giray, who emphasized that the foundation of finger sucking behavior seen in advanced ages lies in the lack of ability in the parent-child relationship and the feeling of confidence in the child is not sufficiently developed, explained the effects of this behavior on dental health with the following words:
Finger sucking behavior has a negative effect on the shape of the child’s tooth structure.
As a result of the pressure that occurs during sucking, the upper teeth are pushed forward, while the lower teeth are pushed backwards.
This also leads to the positioning of the lower jaw behind, disrupting the balance of the dam and tooth structure.
The physiological reflection of this is in the form of a speech disorder and aesthetically poor appearance of its closure.
Dr. Giray, who noted that a much more complex treatment process could be experienced in the 6-7 year period when permanent teeth began to emerge if there was no early solution, "We can protect our children from closure and joint problems before the completion of jaw development."
“That’s why children’s eyes and hearing controls need to be kept under control today,” he added.
New Breath in Near-Vision Treatment: Trifocal Lenses
After cataract treatment, patients do not naturally want to wear glasses.
For many years, patients have been used to solve this problem.
With trifocal medicines that began to be used in recent times, the success of treatment in this area has taken a step further.
The difference between trichocal lenses and other lenses is that they can provide clear vision not only at distant or near distances, but also at distances defined as intermediate distances.
Treatment of distant, near or intermediate distance vision disorders
Intermediate distance in visual impairments represents a point we use very often in our daily lives.
For example, the indicator panel of cars, the portable computers we hold in our arms, or the distance intervals we define as the length of the arm of 60-70 cm.
Thanks to the correction of the intermediate distances of trichocal lenses, our patients do not feel the need to wear glasses in any way, regardless of whether they are near or far away.
Another advantage that trichocal medicines provide is that they also reduce nighttime complaints.
Dr. Volkan Hürmerich, an eye disease specialist, said: “There is no difference between the triphocal lens treatment used for each distance vision treatment and the normal cataract treatment.”
Our patients who are treated with triphocal treatments regain eye health with a 7- to 10-minute procedure.
And the next day our patients can return to their normal lives.
It is an operation that improves the quality of life especially for people who drive a car, use a lot of computers, love to read and lead a more active life.
You can also consult an eye specialist to find out if this procedure is suitable for you, which can be applied to every patient over the age of 18.
It is not used in heart surgery.
Varicose veins are a disease that has increased in frequency in recent years.
Genetic intimacy is a primary factor in variste; long working hours, jobs that have to stand for long periods of time, and long sitting cause an increase in hernial complaints.
Are the vessels used in heart surgery?
Questions like what to do if I have a heart attack are often asked by people.
Here are the answers to these questions.
There are two types of leg system:
In the leg there is a deep tubular system called the main pathway that leads dirty blood to the lungs and collects the main dirty blood of the leg.
These are called deep femoral veins and superficial femoral veins.
These problems in the vessels are more rare, the vessels cannot be closed in their diseases, and medication treatments are applied to keep these vessels open.
In the leg there is a sideway called the surface tubular system that leads dirty blood to the lungs and connects with the deep tubular system in the jaw.
This system consists of two large and two small safen veins.
In these four veins, insufficiency and varicose veins can also develop.
Columns that can be used in heart surgery are superficial columns called large safen veins.
The absence of these vessels does not harm the body and can therefore be used in heart surgeries.
But the vessels need to be healthy in order for these vessels to be used in heart surgery.
The heart is a very important organ.
The procedure of taking varicose veins by surgery or leaving them in place with a laser also reduces the workload of deep veins and makes the leg healthier.
A false belief among the people is that even varicose veins can be used as a replacement.
Varicose veins are never and never used in heart surgery!
There are other veins that can be used in heart surgery.
Reserve vascular systems that can be used in heart surgery are located under the chest cage, around the stomach and in the arm.
Therefore, it is unnecessary to wait to use the varicose vein for the heart and worry about it.

Previous PostPrevious Super Cup
Galatasaray Sports Club President Dursun Özbek released a statement before the Super Cup Final between Galatasaray and Beşiktaş.
Here are the words that Dursun Özbek has attracted attention to the unity and unity in Turkish football:
Galatasaray and Beşiktaş, two roots and two favorite clubs of Turkish sport, will face for the Super Cup on Saturday evening, August 13, at Konya Metropolitan Torku Arena.
This is neither the first nor the last match in a competition that leaves our club a century behind.
It is a very important time meeting.
As we all know, our country went through a big storm on the night of July 15.
The coup attempt by the Fethullahist Terrorist Organization/Parallel State Making (FETÖ/PDY), which meant our democracy, was overcome thanks to the unity and unity of all segments of society.
We paid a heavy price that night.
We gave the towns.
We have a lot of gases.
This painful price has once again reminded us of the virtue of democracy, of the necessity and importance of peace ruling in these lands, not of struggle.
That night, the representatives of the Turkish sport, with one voice, with one heart, opposed the coup; all together, they stood by the side of democracy.
In these critical days, we need the unifying feature of the sport more than ever.
I wish this match, which coincides with the 2nd anniversary of the death of our precious opponent, President Süleyman Seba, and just before the new football season named after our club’s legendary captain, Turgay Sheren, to be the beginning of the atmosphere of love and peace in Turkish sport.
No matter what the score will be at the end of the match, which will be played in front of the tribunes where Galatasaray and Beşiktaş supporters will split in half, I assure that the winner will be our country and the Turkish sport.

Scot Callum Skinner is flying home as Britain catches gold
While the British trio retained the title they received from London in 2012, the Scottish Callum Skinner ran to victory last night in the men's race on the race track in Rio.
Glasgow’s 23-year-old racer took on the pioneering role adopted by Scottish Sir Chris Hoy, and made this legend proud as he returned home victoriously with this young, revered New Zealand dress.
In the event four years before Hoy took five of his six Olympic golds, Britain had won a shocking victory.
And despite Hoy's retirement, they repeated this by finishing the race world championship in London in March for the sixth time.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of expert startup player Jamie Staff.
This was exactly what Hinduism did when it appeared.
Hoy’s retirement also created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
He had seen the potential Scott had already realized in advance and the British coaches had not given up on Skinner.
Although Hindes, Kenny and Skinner, who were champions with Hoy four years ago, broke the Olympic record in the ranking round, New Zealand re-established the record in the first round.
And the British trio went into a duel for gold.
Although Hindes was a little behind in his turn, Kenny brought the team ahead, and Skinner also relied on it.
Much of my conversion that allowed Kenny and especially Skinner to keep pace using a larger vehicle to slow him down was this change of strategy.
Hoy followed them out of place as an expert commentator for the BBC, and was caught in the eyes of Skinner, Kenny, and Hindes when they got on the podium.
Glasgow’s 23-year-old Skinner said: “This is an honorable comparison.”
I’m here just to do my best and announce my step.
In the final we broke the Olympic record and defeated the world champions.
It was really incredible.
There is no better way to win it.
Hindes admitted he deliberately fell on the track after a bad start after winning with Kenny and Hoy in London in 2012.
He subsequently reacted to this review, and there was no way for Britain to claim from its rivals.
This time, there was no such problem for an incredible victory.
Hindes said, "We were like London with all the British flags on the stand."
A team that was formed three months ago.
We’ve lost so many world competitions so it’s really incredible to win the Olympics again.
This is just an event, a medal, for a nation that won seven out of 10 races in both Beijing and London.
If this is the measure of the progress we have made in the last five months, we have five more days to successfully finish on the race track.
Kenny’s attitude shows that Hoy’s dream of repeating three gold records at one Olympics is not impossible.
This will mean that Kenny, who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy and is also born on March 23 (also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister, a sacred history of British sports), will reach six gold medals and a silver medal.
It is the same level as today.
Kenny will then go to the sprint race; the race will start today and last three days.
The 28-year-old Bolton said: “For now, I just enjoy it.
Team activities are always the best.
You can win with your friends.
To be honest, when winning alone, one feels alone.
Hindes said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be awarded the title of knight."
Although this is only the performance of today’s medal, there are many good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull finished first in the four-mile team race.
They completed the track at 3:51.943 times.
The world record set by the gold medal winner in London in 2012 is 3:51.659.

Energy contract cancellation and the future of the Portland estate is doubtful
The future of the Portland aluminum stove store in Victoria and the work of hundreds of workers fell into uncertainty after the announcement of the termination of a supply contract by one of the facility owners, which would lead to the cancellation of all supply contracts of the energy company that supplies the facility.
This move came after the Victoria government decided earlier this year not to exceed subsidies to keep the facility running.
The 20-year fixed subsidy expires in November.
Work at Alcoa’s Portland facility could be at risk up to 2000.
Any shutdown process can cause up to 2,000 jobs to be directly or indirectly endangered.
Additional chaining effects can also occur, as the dormitory consumes about 10 percent of Victoria’s entire electricity.
In 2014, Alcoa Point closed its Henry residential site, leading to the shutdown of the Anglesea power plant last year.
Alcoa’s Portland residential facility is losing money and facing the risk of closure.
These developments came after several years of speculation about the future of the facility, initially following the strengthening of the Australian dollar and recently based on the facility’s consumption fee.
AGL, which supplies power from the Loy Yang A power plant in the Latrobe Valley to the large aluminum basin, said the other three owners were expecting to take action to terminate their contracts as well.
A large majority of the facility is owned by a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, and smaller shares are owned by China’s CITIC and Japan’s Marubeni Corp.
“AGL expects the Portland plant to continue operating, which means that the physical electricity demand of the basement will continue.”
AGL stated that the contracts are “risk balancing contracts” that should come into force from November 2016.
Since the contracts have a 12-month termination period, they will be completed in 2017.
The energy company said, “Therefore, AGL will continue to expect contracts to contribute to the 2017 fiscal year as well.”
The impact that AGL may be exposed to on potential gains for the fiscal year 2018 and beyond is currently limited to the adoption of a strong long-term contractual position for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL said the value of its contracts on its accounts had already dropped to $187 million due to "expectations of disruption."
Alcoa said the decision to terminate the contracts "did not affect Alcoa's ability to supply electricity to the operations or to the operations."
The U.S. company signed a 20-year contract in 2010 that was scheduled to enter into force in November this year, but has not yet explained why it has not withdrawn from the agreement.
Analysts are on the lookout for the possibility of closure of both the Portland home store in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to economic difficulties in the sector.
Stephen Mikkels, AGL’s chief operating officer, responding to analysts earlier this week, said Portland uses about 600 megawatts of energy each year and Tomago 900 megawatts.
If both of these installations are withdrawn from the market, it will cause the demand in the [electricity] market to decline at a significant rate.
And as a producer, this is not a good development for us.”
Not only is the star of the Kardashian TV show; Kendall on the cover of Vogue’s September issue
Model and executive mother Kris’s fourth daughter of the Kardashian-Jenner group, Kendall Jenner (20), is on the cover of the highly anticipated September issue of U.S. Vogue.
Kendall, a brand ambassador for Estee Lauder, who featured on Milan, Paris and New York fashion weeks, announced the news on Thursday on her Instagram account.
Kendall wrote, “I cried when I looked at this cover in a room full of people I loved.”
After the cover was revealed, a script-based reality video was released where the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (Rob and Caitlyn troubled in the bar, and uncle from everyone’s favorite show world, Keeping Up producer Ryan Seacrest) featured a strange (or just specific to the Keeping Up with the Kardashians program), the family, who had forgotten the cover of their sisters in the video, then made a classic ending: they were actually preparing a surprise party.
While this is the cliché story line of almost every "birthday" episode of all children's television shows (Seacrest says, "Did you think we forgot you?" with a cartoon rabbit's intimacy at 8 a.m.)
With this development in the September issue of Vogue, we are definitely entering a new Kardashian era.
Kendall's sister, Kim, may have surpassed her on the cover of Vogue (which she shared with her wife, Kanye West, in April 2014), but the magazine's September cover is a hit in itself.
The September issue of Vogue was the best-selling number of the year.
With its thickness resembling the coffee table book of a fashion magazine, this figure has attracted the attention of many advertisers (Fashionista found that 615 of the 832-page leather last year contained advertising content).
The revelation of the cover star is also a process closely monitored; for the past two years, the magazine’s images have leaked before the official announcement.
Previously featured women include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there has been a place on the cover from "famous models" to "model-making celebrities".
Oscar-winning Dior ambassador Jennifer Lawrence appeared on the cover in 2013, and the following year this honor was given to Lady Gaga.
But even if Mrs. Jenner, described by the magazine as the "glowing model" of the generation, was included in the previous category, it can be said that her environment was pretty good.
These celebrities are not the relatives of celebrities, or reality show stars, or the young people of today who know how to shoot good Snapchat videos (although Jenner is all of them).
These are all women who are legally talented, leading in the entertainment industry.
Beyonce, on the cover last year, spent one of her career’s best times with Lemonade’s departure.
Of course, not everyone is pleased with Jenner’s success.
Because of her reality show history, Jenner’s position in the fashion world will always be annoying.
In June, the original Victoria’s Secret model Stephanie Seymour criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid by naming them the “characters of the time.”
When news came out that Jenner would be on the cover of Vogue, the idea came to the surface again.
But it seems ineffective to focus on dissatisfaction.

And in his free time, he might just take part in reality shows on television to see his brother Kourtney and their children.
Social legal support centers reject 160,000 people each year
While the sector is preparing for the impact of further financing cuts in the currently challenging operations, more than 160,000 people from the nation’s most vulnerable sector are being evicted from social legal support centers.
Three out of five people in Queensland (mostly elderly people, migrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence, and those without a source to fight unfair evacuation decisions, etc.) are rejected while seeking free legal advice and representation.
Social legal support services that have exhausted their capabilities are preparing for more cuts.
As of June next year, these legal support centers are planned to be deprived of more than 30 percent of federal funding.
James Farrel, Queensland Director of Social Legal Support Centers, that thousands of people are found to be rejected each year in the National Association of Social Legal Support Centers’ latest Census Report.
Mr. Farrel said the situation would get much worse if the federal government’s decision was not revoked.
He said: “Queensland’s social legal support centers are chronically receiving insufficient financial support, which means thousands of people are unable to access the vital services they need.”
People in violent relationships, struggling with governance and gaps, families in the process of separation, and workers dismissed unfairly... All of these are facing problems of a legal dimension and are unable to get the help they need, according to this report.
The federal government will cut funding by 30 percent from June 2017, meaning thousands of unprotected Queensland residents will have to deal with more complex legal problems without getting help.
We call on Justice Minister and Queensland Senator George Brandis to immediately recover these financing cuts so that people can get the support they need when facing a legal problem.
Last year, the government fulfilled its pledge to raise legal aid funding to the national average.
Now we must look at the social legal support centers and the communities they serve, and the investment that the Palaszczuk government will make in this important work.
After allegations of personnel taking guns, Donald Trump's campaign team was sued
New York: Donald Trump's campaign team has been sued on charges of not taking any action after the Director of North Carolina Operations was told to have fired a gun on a staff while travelling with a chip in February.
The case was revealed in a case opened in a state court on Wednesday by former software trainer Vincent Bordini in the state campaign team.
Bordini said he had been waiting for months to be concerned with the situation from the inside but later realized that "it won't happen."
As stated in Bordini’s complaint, the director, Earl Philip, “pulled out a gun, put his right mark finger on the bag, and held the stamp on Vincent’s knee.”
According to the complaint, after Bordini complained to local and regional campaign team leaders, he learned that at least four more people had had the same experience with Phillip.
In his complaint, he said, “It is not necessary to fire to damage the guns.”
The case opened two days after the Republican presidential candidate provoked rage to the North Carolina crowd saying that “the people of the Second Amendment Constitution” (which seem to be gun owners and gun supporters) could take action if rival Hillary Clinton were elected and elected their own judges.
Trump’s campaign team said the media assessed these statements out of context and that he did not support violence.
Bordini, with his complaint, demands compensation from the campaign team for surveillance impairment and from Phillip for the attack, crash and spiritual damage.
Trump’s spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, did not quickly react to the message asking him to comment.
His attempts to reach Phillip were unsuccessful.
WCCB, a local news firm in Charlotte, that Phillip had just left the campaign.
The call to his consulting firm Innovative Consulting Services was also not a quick return.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is running a controversial campaign.

Tagged ‘Magician’ line
Following President Erdogan’s call for FETÖ activists “everyone may not know intelligence, may not know security, notify” the MIT and Security FETÖ established a line of information.
After the July 15 coup attempt, new applications are also launched for the identification of "hidden communists" who hid themselves while thousands of FETOs were thrown out from institutions.
In the framework of the studies, President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan stressed the importance of the announcements that citizens will make in the struggle with the FETO: "Your friends from that community can be your friends, I say reveal them."
You need to report to prosecutors.
It is a national debt.
"Everyone may not know intelligence, they may not know security, or they may not be able to reach, look, the men are fleeing," he said.
As part of the work carried out, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the General Directorate of Security and the National Intelligence Organization (MIT) launched an online notification application.
According to this, the citizens around the FETO who serve the FETO, the organizational activities they know, the institutions that belong to the organization will be able to pass through this application to security and MIT.
The information of persons who will notify www.egm.gov.tr/pages/hbar, www.mit.gov.tr/customer via the form provided to the service via the links will be kept.
Those who wish to apply the notification submitted by the Security Directorate General will also be able to add documents.
He will be returned if he wishes to do so again.
The citizen can also make this information to the Republic Prosecutors in the provinces and districts where they are located, as they can notify the police assistance line by telephone.
Inspired by Bodrum, they built a 'exemplary village' in Sivas
Canköy, affiliated with the Gölova Prefecture of SIVAS, was made "example village" with the cooperation of Kaymakamlık and charitable businessmen.
In the village, where roads were asphalted and parkland stones placed on their floors, all houses were painted in blue and white, taking the example of Muğla's Bodrum district.
Gölova Kaymakamskap prepared an exemplary village project to improve the image and quality of life of villages attached to the district.
In this context, 66 villages in Canköy, 12 kilometers away from the district center, were selected as a sample village.
Infrastructure and construction services increased the roads of the village asphalted, and the elevations were covered with park stone.
Village houses with different colour tones were painted with the support of Selahattin Ayan, the businessman who owned Pelit Pastanele.
The whole village was painted in white and blue colors.
The board is an example.
Erkan İsa Erat, who informed about the study, stated that they were preparing this project to sign a study that would also be a role model for other villages, saying: "It was part of our project that the village looked more modern, that all the houses were one color."
We were looking for a place to take examples when we started this project.
When we went to the basement, the pictures of the houses painted white and blue windows caught our attention.
We also wanted to take Bodrum as an example for the purification of white and its positive impact on people.
We painted all the houses in Canköy in white and blue colors.
This work was done in cooperation with the government and charity.
The project cost approximately £200,000.
With the work, our Canköy in Sivas became like a small basement.
We want to continue this kind of work with our budget and again with the support of our businessmen.
Canköy Governor Abdullah Macit, 66, said that with the support of Kaymakam, the village has a completely new image.
Macit thanked everyone who worked, stating that being an exemplary village pleased them and the villagers as well.
Drugs in Kangal
Seven people were arrested in the drug operation organized by gendarmerie teams in Kangal district of SIVAS.
Police teams working in the Chetinkaya district in the province, with the help of narcotic detector dogs, seized 600 grams of cannabis, 49 drug pills, 1 hunting rifle and 1 dry pistol.
Seven people were arrested in connection with the seized materials, while legal proceedings were launched for their rights.
In the case of FETO/PDY in Adana, 4 people were seized in the property together with Laughen
Fethullah Gülen/Parallel State Making (FETÖ/PDY), who was tried and executed in the 2nd Heavy Penal Court on allegation that they made profits from corruption in Adana, was ordered to handle all assets of Fethullah Gülen, Ömer Ekinci, Kemal Elibal and Cemal Soncu.
With a notice made to the Adana Security Department on May 15, 2015, in 2012, Metropolitan Mayor’s Deputy Councillor did not worry and the administration was claimed to have earned a rant amount to reach 150 million pounds, despite the fact that the land belonging to the Kanuni University, known by its proximity to the Gülen community, was turned into a residential area, despite the lack of parliamentary decision.
As a result of the investigation launched on the news, Mihni Aldırmaz, Ferat Yüksel, Mustafa Vural, Hasan Uzun and former president of the Adana Trade Exchange, Muammer Çalışkan, were arrested.
Fethullah Gülen and the former Adana Metropolitan Mayor’s deputy Zihni Aldırmaz also filed a lawsuit in the 2nd Heavy Penal Court for 5 to 35 years in prison for 17 defendants who were detained among them.
While all defendants did not acknowledge the charges, in the final stage of the case, all defendants with detention were released under judicial control and a ban abroad.
Their wealth is held.
The court ordered the arrest of the number one accused in the case, Fethullah Gülen, along with the defendant Ömer Ekinci, Kemal Elibal and Cemal Soncu.
However, the court ruled that the four defendants who were not arrested and brought to trial were charged with smuggling.
In order to ensure that the case in their rights remains unsuccessful, the court ordered that Fethullah Gülen, Ömer Ekinci, Kemal Elibal and Cemal Soncu, who were in a foreign country and therefore failed to reach him, who fell into a smuggling situation, be disposed of of of all their assets in accordance with Article 278/1 of the Criminal Proceedings Act (CMK).
Together with the court’s decision, immovable property belonging to the accused in Turkey, land-sea and air transport vehicles, all kinds of rights and receipts, valuable documents, shares of the company in which the partner is involved, rent cash exists and bank accounts have been frozen.

Controversial asset funds again in the commission
The Turkish Asset Fund, which is expected to be among the world’s largest funds, was silently removed from the law over objections.
It was decided to re-examine the fund due to the absence of the control mechanism, but it was re-examined in the commission without any changes.
CHP Deputy and Plan and Budget Commission Member Utku Çakırözer, who assessed the Turkish Asset Fund bill proposal brought by the AKP to sozcu.com.tr, said: "We are absolutely opposed to keeping this structure that will consist of compulsory retirement cuts to be taken from assets belonging to the Government, workers, employees, and unemployment funds collected for the unemployed, outside the constitutional control mechanisms."
The Turkish Asset Fund bill, which the government prepared in order to provide long-term funding for investments and projects, was removed from the law on Tuesday, with the opposition’s view that it should also be discussed.
But today the AKP brought the proposal back to the Plan and Budget Commission in the same way.
CHP member of the TBMM Plan and Budget Commission, Eskişehir MP Utku Çakırözer, told sozcu.com.tr about CHP’s concerns and concerns about the asset fund bill.
“When the establishment of this fund came to the Plan and Budget Commission in the package bill, our former Minister of Finance, Zekeriya Temizel, who is at the head of the CHP delegation, expressed our concerns and concerns, proposed that this be removed from the package law and also discussed in detail.”
The government, which accepted this view, also withdrew the draft.
The proposal came back to the committee yesterday.
"The government seems to insist that it is removed from parliament within a week."
Çakırözer stated that there should be a consensus about the passing of the Asset Fund Law, "Our biggest concern in this proposal is the irregularity."
"The assets belonging to the community, the employee's obligatory retirement cuts to be taken from employees, the income to be collected from the unemployment fund for the unemployed, the income to be obtained without personalization, are transferred unregularly to a structure outside the control of the House and the House of Representatives and without any responsibility."
Russia, China and the Gulf countries, where such funds were set up, have surpluses in oil revenues and trade, and the fund is financed in this way, “But we have a savings gap.”
So the funds will be made up of public resources, that is, the money of the people.
A total of 100 billion in the unemployment fund is planned to be transferred from the mandatory individual pension fund for employees, 100 billion, 50 billion without personalization.
“That means that this fund that will be made entirely from the people’s money must be under public control and that this money should not be spent irresponsibly.”
Submitting that it is unacceptable to keep a fund out of Parliament’s control in which the resources of the state were collected and the assets belonging to the state were guaranteed in borrowing, Çakırözer expressed his concerns and concerns about the proposal for the Asset Fund Act as follows:
The accumulation, expenditure, business and transactions related to the borrowing of such a large public asset on behalf of the public cannot only be passed through the supervision of independent audit firms.
There must also be a public inspection and a transparent structure.
In the bill, there are no provisions on the control and transparency of the Asset Fund by constitutional institutions.
There is no limit on how much resources will be transferred.
No one will ask how this fund is used.
The purpose of the fund is to fund large projects.
There is no need to create an uncontrolled fund outside the budget.
Why not get into the budget?
When this happens, the wise naturally ask the question, “Why does the Competitor and the Assembly avoid control?”
Declaring that they are not against the transfer of money accumulated in the Asset Fund to investments, but that they are against it being done with non-transparent, non-accounting mechanisms, Çakırözer continued: "Can such a fund be discussed?"
But if the Government insists on this, then we must ensure that the international standards applicable in other countries where such investment funds are established also apply in Turkey.
It must be structured in a manner in which control and accountability mechanisms are introduced.
It must be established in such a way that the account of the citizen's own money used on it will not be deposited, until the next penny is paid.
Çakırözer, who expressed his strong opposition to the Asset Fund bill as he came to the commission, said: "We are pleased that the AKP is listening to our criticisms in Parliament, especially after the July 15 coup attempt."
In this proposal, we hope that the AKP will listen to our constructive criticism.
We oppose the unlawful use, transfer of national assets, the irresponsibility of those who use them and the lack of public control.
“The asset fund that is desired can only be beneficial if these concerns are addressed.”
On the draft law, it was learned that efforts were made to a consensus between the AKP and the opposition.
“It is a sign of the confidence we have in Turkey.
Speaking at a meeting in Istanbul, Ford’s Chairman of the Board of Directors Ali Koç said: “The 30 billion TL investment we have made in the last 5 years is an indication of the confidence we have in the future of our country.”
Vice President of the Board of Management of Koç Holding and Chairman of the Board of Management of Ford Automotive Ali Koç and the managers of numerous foreign-funded companies met at the conference "Those who trust Turkey, those who produce in Turkey" held by the Istanbul Chamber of Industry (ISO).
Speaking at the meeting, Ali Koç said: "Our faith and trust in our country together with our partners is not only pronounced, we are filling it with our investments and actions."
The $30 billion investment we have made in the last five years is an indication of the confidence we have in the future of our country.
Turkey has a reliable and fair legal system, a democracy in international standards, a qualified workforce and an ecosystem that promotes R&D, innovation, entrepreneurship and added value.
In the last few years, our government has offered our industrials the most comprehensive incentives in our republican history.
“I believe that, with these incentives and holistic strategies, we can launch a new ‘Investment Movement’ that we need.
Hüseyin Gelis, Chairman and CEO of Siemens Industry and Trade Turkey, said: “Not an event is an issue for a single country, we know it as global players.”
We came to Turkey with a long-term look.
If we are in unity and unity, our problems will be solved.
We were able to bring to this land what was not possible in Turkey 160 years ago.
We will continue to work in these areas.
“We’re going to build factories, of course, but our horizons should be open in this area,” he said.
Ahmet Erdem, President of Shell Turkey, stated that Turkey is one of the 10 priority countries for them, “Turkey is one of the 10 priority countries for Shell.”
We believe in the potential and future of Turkey.
We have invested in many areas, including energy, and we are continuing to do so.
We thank our President, our Prime Minister and our Ministers for their supporting work for international investors.
This is a trust for international investors.
“This is a way to increase the competitiveness of our country.”
Dr. Altan Demirdere, President of Sandoz/Novartis Turkey and the Middle East Region, said: “Our Global CEO would come to Turkey on August 10.
The trip was postponed.
We also opposed it.
The arrival of the CEO was very important.
They wanted a bulletproof car as protection.
When he arrived, he saw that everything was normal.
He left the guards and the car and returned happily to his country.
Investing in a country is like marriage.
If everything goes well, you will get engaged and get married with a long-term plan.
We are married to Turkey and have no intention of divorcing.
He returned from the threshold!
Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım attended a teleconference with businessmen at the consultation meeting on "Those who trust in Turkey, those who produce in Turkey" held by the Istanbul Chamber of Industry at the Swiss Hotel.
Prime Minister Yıldırım, who stated that the industry sector that will provide Turkey's comparative superiority is the industry sector, "In the industry sector, we should also not escalate the transition process to Industry 4.0."
“If the value added is high, the locomotive of our country and we are concerned about capturing the 2023 targets, we need to think about the industrial revolution, the revolution of information and technology, and we need to it.”
On the night of July 15, Yildirim added to his words that Turkey was returning from the brink of a great abyss, "Those who meant the future of our country, those who tried to destroy its democracy, the humbles who did not even fear to bomb our House of Representatives in Gaza, if they were muvaffak, today we were talking about another Turkey."
We would have talked about a Turkey among the countries of the Third World, which was seized by the Darbe, destroyed by national will and fell from the League of Developing Countries in the world.
“Thanks to God, we have defeated this trouble with our nation’s bastion, our Commander-in-Chief, our President, Mr. Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and the determination of our government.”
Prime Minister Yildirim continued his words: "We will quickly come out of the impact of this incident and look ahead."
It is never true that we live with constant shock.
We have very ambitious goals ahead of us.
The coup attempt did not shake the Turkish economy.
Those expecting chaos and crisis were once again wrong.
Today, our democracy and our economy are in disarray.
Our banking sector, our financial sector continues to operate in a healthy way.
In 2015, the foreign trade gap appears to have dropped by 25 percent.
The national income ratio of the search gap fell from 5.8 percent in 2014 to 4.5 percent in 2015.
At the end of this year, we aim to reach 4.
We will never change our strict stance on public expenses.
Turkey’s 2016 budget also exceeded the national income of 130 countries.
We have reduced the national income rate of the budget gap, which is over 11 percent, to 1.3 percent in 2015, and we are striving to maintain those rates.
In public debt, we are in a better position than the EU, than many countries in the world.
Our banking sector continues to operate on a solid ground.
“Our Central Bank did not feel the need to exchange in the market despite July 15, and there is no reduction in our reserves, we have a gross reserve of over $121 billion,” he said.
Prime Minister Yıldırım said that the development of the economy, the increase in production and the creation of new jobs will provide all kinds of facilities, "We also make comprehensive arrangements to save you from your past burdens."
We have carried out many arrangements, and we continue to go through them, until the over-the-counter and the recapitalization of unpaid tax debts is achieved by bringing a relief again.
“You continue to produce for the country, continue to trust your country, and your government will continue to remove the barriers ahead of you one by one.”
Hakan’s father was taken to hospital for high sugar
Sermet Şükür, the father of Hakan Şükür, who was detained in the context of the operation against the terrorist organization FETO/PDY conducted in Sakarya, was taken to hospital as a result of the increase in sugar during the interrogation.
In the framework of the operation initiated by the Sakarya Republic Prosecutor General's Office after the July 15 coup attempt against the terrorist organization FETO/PDY, former national footballer Hakan Şükür and his father Sermet Şükür were arrested yesterday evening.
Hakan thankur’s father, Sermet thankur, who was arrested in Adapazari on Friday’s prayer, was taken to the hospital while the interrogation continued.
As a result of the increase in sugar, the treatment of the Sermet Thanksgiving who was taken to the hospital continues in Sakarya Education and Research Hospital.
Turkey is not leaving the West, it is not leaving the EU.
Mehmet Şimşek: Turkey is not breaking away from the West, it is not leaving the European Union
Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Şimşek, Minister of Science and Industry and Technology Faruk Özlü, Minister of Economy Nihat Zeybekci Istanbul Industry Chamber (ISSO) attended the conference on "Those who trust Turkey, those who produce in Turkey".
Speaking at the meeting, Science Industry and Technology Minister Faruk Özlü said: "I think that many good results have come from the developments that took place on the night of July 15 and after."
The most important of these is undoubtedly the spirit of unity and unity that the whole of Turkey now deeply feels.
The July 15 process showed how strong the Turkish economy has dynamics and how much the society has internalized democracy.
"It is clear that for a society that has reached this level in economy and democracy and democracy, the next process will be easier and faster."
“I want Turkey to get rid of this crisis.”
Economy Minister Nihat Zeybekci, who said they were struggling to tell the world about the July 15 coup attempt that came to the court from Faruk Özlü, stated that they have declared confidence in this regard as the government.
Zeybekci also referred to the interest reductions initiated by the banks in the last period, "If the interest rate of the first five-hundred of my real sector is going to 63.4%, we have to give up all our power to focus on this business."
The President is coming back and speaking about it.
With the real sector, with the banking system, with the government, with the politics, with the unity and unity shown by the politics after the July 15 civil Turkish democracy revolution, Turkey must get rid of this trouble.
We welcome the recent developments in this regard.
“I hope that in the coming period we will realize the sustainability and continuity of this competition starting downward like the monthly zero-point nine, eight, initiated by the banks with the encouragement of our President,” he said.
“We will give the passport to our exporter.”
Nihat Zeybekci, who said, “We will not leave the country in the world under the leadership of our President, our Prime Minister, we will not leave the door that has not been stolen.”
We will not leave anyone with whom we do not contact about increasing our trade.
"We will never and never ignore this; we will not be among the birds at hand when we run after the bird in the branch."
Zeybekci also stated that in advancing times the exporters will be given green passports, "one of the latest decisions that his law came out, we have now completed the regulation in the Ministry of Economy; approximately from our exporters, from the first figures, we will also give our exporters around 17 to 20 thousand the licensed green passports representing this country, to the order of our exporter."
“Those who are in the workplace need to be cleaned out of the state.”
Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Şimşek, referring to the July 15 coup attempt and subsequently announced OHAL, Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Şimşek, described the coup attempt as a "marvelous nightmare" and said: "But it is left behind, now we need to look ahead."
Shimşek, who said that OHAL was declared for two simple reasons, said, "Of course those who are in this attempted coup must be cleared from the state and this process is working; but more importantly, serious administrative reforms were needed to avoid confronting such attempted coup again."
As a climate necessary for these administrative reforms, the Emergency State was declared and very serious structural reforms have been carried out so far.
"While we do all this, of course, we have acted within democratic principles and the rule of law, and we will continue to do so."
Speaking that life has returned to normal in many areas, Shimşek stressed that it is not the slightest reason for companies and individuals to worry about the financing of terrorism.
“I think the foundations of Turkey’s democracy have become solid, because when you look at the origin of recent past problems, you will definitely see that this network of betrayal is in the business.
“Therefore, the clearance of this terrorist organization from the state will strengthen Turkey’s democracy because this period is closing in Turkey.”
According to Shimşek, the foundations of the economy are generally solid and have returned to the normal structural reform agenda again without losing time, "Turkey has returned to its original agenda, there is progress in structural reforms."
If we do not have structural reforms, we will not; because populism and protectionism are increasing in the world.
“Turkey can only and only prepare for the future by making reforms.”
Finally, he stressed that Turkey will not break away from the West, "Turkey may sometimes be in disagreement with our Western allies, our friends, but Turkey is not breaking away from the West, it is not giving up the European Union."
He jumped 25 meters into the sea and...
In Antalya, the 17-year-old Shamil Tayyar Flagship was hospitalized when he jumped fishing into the sea from a 25 meter high fence called 'Kartal Hill'.
In the evening on the coast of Konya, Swimming with friends, Shamil Tayyar Flag, then jumped into the sea fishing from 25 meters high cliffs known as "Kartal Hill" under the variant.
Shamil Tayyar, a professional swimmer, was injured in the neck after hitting the water.
The flagman, who had difficulty moving in the sea, was pulled to the shore by his friends, who were once again professional swimmers.
Medical officials who arrived at the scene after the incident took Shamil Tayyar Bayrakçı to the Antalya Education and Research Hospital with an ambulance.
The patient who was treated was not in danger of death.
A friend of the flagist told the police, “When he jumped fishing from the Cartal Hill, his neck was injured.”
“We didn’t expect that would happen.”
25 deaths in the newspaper
The settlements in the town of Sarmada in Syria’s Idlib province, located about 10 kilometers from the Cilvegöz border gate in Reyhanlı province, were hit by regime planes.
Local sources said 25 people were killed and 40 wounded in the attack.
Two separate air strikes were carried out by the regime aircraft on noon and afternoon on the opposition-controlled town of Sarmada near the Syrian Bab-Al Air Border Gate.
Local sources said the airstrikes targeted settlements and killed 25 people.
While 40 people are to have been injured in the attack, which also heard the sounds of explosions from Reyhanlı, the number of dead is worried about rising.

Two brothers killed in gun attack
In the two districts of ADIYAMAN, two brothers who were attacked by gunmen in a car lost their lives.
The incident occurred on Mustafa Kemal Street in the evening.
The 39-year-old Ramazan Karahan, who was on his way to the city center, was shot by an unidentified person in a 02 KH 839 car.
The car under the control of Karahan, which lost control of the fire, collided with another vehicle.
Meanwhile, the man who came next to the car, Ramazan Karahan, and his brother next to him shot after 50-year-old Ömer Karahan.
The Karahan brothers were seriously injured while the attacker escaped from the scene by motorcycle.
Police and medical personnel were dispatched to the scene.
The wounded brothers were taken by ambulance to two state hospitals.
Despite all the efforts of the doctors, Omer and Ramazan Karahan, who were treated in emergency services, could not be rescued.
While the bodies of the two brothers were placed for autopsy, the police, who examined the mobese and security cameras in the area where the incident occurred, began work to identify the fugitive assailant.
Britain should channel the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will offer renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and in London, but across the country.
I think this will make Heathrow quite attractive, as we did in London in 2012, when we made an incredible effort to benefit all nations and regions from the Games.
The Olympics provided great advantages for Stratford and East End.
And by creating opportunities for local people and close to Heathrow, we will this again.
We will create 10,000 new internships for our local communities alone, 40,000 new jobs, and we will not leave young people unemployed around the airport.
Like London before 2012, there will be those who think that the struggle to expand Heathrow is too difficult.
I was told that Britain would never prepare for the Games and that we would be embarrassed by the whole world.
Those who doubted were wrong in 2012 and they will also be seen to be wrong about Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers all the questions asked.
As in the Olympics, Heathrow is not just an infrastructure project for a few people, but for many.
The expansion leaves the opportunity to create 180,000 new jobs and £211 billion in economic growth and many skills and job opportunities both around the airport and across the UK.
At Heathrow, from the T5 (which has been named the world’s best airport terminal for five years backwards) to the T2, we have a great team that has put in place a timely and budget-friendly £11 billion infrastructure investment for the world’s busiest two runways.
We are now ready to offer a third track supported by private investment worth £16 billion.
The London 2012 Games were a huge success for the United Kingdom, and I have no doubt that the Heathrow expansion will be the same.
It is time for us to secure our commercial future by channelling this Olympic spirit into the expansion of Heathrow and to create many skills and job opportunities that Britain will be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton, Heathrow Chairman of the Board and former Treasury Secretary of Commerce
Adblock Plus is “like a cat-fire game” about Facebook ad blocking
According to one of the companies that attempted to block ad-blocking software for companies that earn money from online advertising, it resembles the "cat-fare game".
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced it would block ad blockers on its desktop site, Adblock Plus posted a blog post saying users could update their filters to block ads on the social network.
On Tuesday, Facebook said it would change the codes around the ads to make it harder for ad blockers to identify which part of the page was an ad.
But Adblock says it has now resolved the new codes.
In a blog post, Adblock spokesman Ben Williams wrote that “this advanced backward struggle between the community blocking open source ads and those trying to prevent them has been ongoing since the time advertising blocking was invented,” and it’s possible for Facebook to produce its own solution in the near future.
The world’s largest social media company’s entry into this struggle shows how much publicity blockers are raising concern for the industry.
According to a study by Pagefair and Adobe last year, around 200 million people worldwide use ad blockers, four times the number of people who used this type of software in 2013.
With 1,03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook via mobile devices, mobile ads now account for 84 percent of Facebook’s advertising revenue.
According to a spokesman, mobile ad blockers are following the company’s desktop ad blockers because Facebook’s mobile apps and Instagram are not effective for the social network.
Since Facebook sees such a move as worth investing, desktop ads should still be able to generate sufficient revenue.
Again on Tuesday, Facebook announced that it will update its “advertising preferences” tool so that people can better control the ads they are presented to them.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblock’s new filters are worrying, and will block some of the non-advertising content on the site as well.
A Facebook spokesman said in an email, “This is not a good experience for people and we plan to address this issue.”
Ad blockers are a blinded tool, so we are focused on creating tools such as Ad Preferences to give people control.
A woman rushed into a Swiss highway, it looks like a suicide.
The victim was sleeping on the highway at midnight.
In a seemingly suicidal incident, police are looking for witnesses who witnessed several cars crashing into the woman on the highway early on Thursday.
The incident occurred at A1 near Morges in Canton Vaud just after midnight on Thursday.
Vaud police said in a statement that the woman was lying on the ground "disperately" in the darkness of the night and that several cars struck her.
A 49-year-old Swedish woman, who was apparently trying to kill herself, was struck by several vehicles, including a truck.
He lost his life at the scene.
Police said they were interviewed with several of the drivers involved in the incident, but that some were not identified and asked them and everyone involved in the incident to report to them.
Lawyer Gilles Hofstetter said in a statement to Le Tribune de Genève that "a criminal prosecution has been opened as a "reasonable" step to be taken in such cases."
However, it is not yet known whether the drivers involved in the incident will face any charges.
Was it possible to avoid the conflict?
This is what the prosecutor has to determine,” Hofstetter said.
Two similar cases in the past five years show that drivers will not be held accountable.
In both cases (both of which included a person going on the highway in the dark), the newspaper ruled that it was normal for drivers not to wait for a hoverboard to cross the highway in the middle of the night.
Last year, a police officer was found innocent of causing death due to negligence, which caused a man to die by hitting a man on the road near Paynerne on A1 one night in August 2014.
In court, it was stated that the 22-year-old victim was drunk and strayed on the road.
The court said the police officer, who was responding to an emergency call, used the vehicle reasonably and that the presence of a man on the road was “a completely exceptional and unpredictable situation.”
Those who are aware of the incident near Morges on Thursday should call the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was once suitable for life
According to predictions from the new NASA climate model, Venus once had suitable conditions for life.
Scientists at NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies have developed a model to explore the past of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether or not Venus, with its hot, water-free surface and CO2-filled atmosphere, is home to conditions similar to those once on Earth.
In the past, scientists had explained the low rotation rate of Venus by its thick atmosphere.
But recent predictions suggest that Venus may have had a thin, Earth-like atmosphere and could still rotate slowly.
The model also looked at the topography of the ancient Venus.
Although there are more dry areas on the planet than on Earth, it may have once had sufficient water and protection against rapid evaporation due to geographic variability.
Ancient Venus also benefited from a 30 percent slower sun.
GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio said in a news release, “In the simulation of the GISS model, the slow rotation of Venus made the sun’s side sun-facing every time for almost two months.”
This also resulted in rain, creating thick layers of clouds that move like a umbrella that protects the surface from sun-induced warming by heating the surface.
As a result, average climate temperatures were emerging only a few degrees colder than Earth is today.
The model created a story for Venus similar to the evolution previously hypothesized by planetary scientists.
Although Venus once had suitable conditions for life, it has been exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light over a process of several billion years.
The oceans evaporated and the water vapor burned away by ultraviolet rays.
Hydrogen was exhausted and there was only a thick atmosphere filled with carbon dioxide with the deadly greenhouse gas effect left; that is, Venus as we know it today.
The researchers shared the findings of the new Venus climate model in Geophysical Research articles.
Patrick Roy resigns from Avalanche
Patrick Roy said the team was not entitled to comment on the decision-making process and resigned on Thursday as Deputy President of Colorado Avalanche Coach and Hockey Operations.
Colorado Executive Vice President/CEO Joe Sakic approved the development and said the club would immediately start looking for a new coach.
Roy, 50, said in a statement, “Over the past three years, I have performed my duties as chief coach and vice president of hockey operations in Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination.”
Over the course of the summer, I have long thought about how to improve and raise this team to a higher level by giving it the depth it needs.
To this, the vision of coach and VP hockey operations must be in perfect alignment with the vision of the organization.
He must also have the right to speak in decisions that affect the performance of the team.
At present, these conditions have not yet been met.
Upon joining the team on May 23, 2013, Sakic thanked Roy for his contributions to the team.
Sakic said, “Patrick informed me today of his decision.”
We thank him for everything he has done for our organization and wish him good luck in the future.
Roy was awarded the Jack Adams Award as the league’s best coach for his first season with Avalanche in 2013-14.
He earned the club 112 points and made the team finish the league first, but Colorado defeated Minnesota in the first round of the play-off period and missed post-season games every two years.
Avalanche passed the 39-39-4 goal in 2015-16 and got five points less than needed for the second joker area at the Western Conference.
Roy on the Honour List won four Stanley Cups, both for the Montreal Canadiens and both for the Avalanche.
Oil workers in the North Sea continue negotiations to suspend strike
The strike was suspended due to the pay of oil workers in the North Sea, and the main negotiators began discussions for a new round of talks.
The strike against the oilfield service company Wood Group is being carried out gradually on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
“We have decided to resume the process to resolve the existing dispute with the Wood Group and the unions Unite and RMT,” the statement said.
Over the next few weeks, we will hold a series of meetings that will last all day to adopt a new perspective on problems from the beginning of next week.
Trade unions have said the protest against a 30 percent wage cuts is the first in 25 years.
Wood Group cut payments to contractors in the North Sea by about 9 percent this year due to negative market pressures.
Following this process of reducing the fee, the company also applied a 10% price reduction to its contractors on the coast in 2014.
The company said the additional cuts would provide the company with the space it needs to get through a difficult period in the market.
Shell has dismissed thousands of employees during the process of merger with British energy company BG Group and announced plans to shut down oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries.
Energy companies are under pressure due to low crude oil prices, an economic situation brought about by Britain’s decision to leave the European Union in June.
Scottish MP Dave Anderson will meet with workers’ leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest workers’ disputes in the North Sea.
As he said, the North Sea is vital for the regional economy.
In a statement, he said, “We need an efficient economy in the North Sea and across the country, not for the minority, but for the majority.”
Despite an average of about $7 billion in investments over the past five years, less than $1.4 billion is expected to be invested in new projects in the North Sea in 2016.
Kepler measured the speed of the star's rotation
With its final mission, the Kepler Space Telescope helped astronomers create the most comprehensive catalogue in terms of the speed of rotation of the stars in the Earth team star.
The new data helps astronomers understand why the stars in the constellation rotate at varying speeds and how their periods of rotation are related to planet formation.
Luisa Rebull, a research scientist at Caltech’s Center for Infrared Processing and Analysis in Pasadena, said in a newsletter, “When we compare our results with star clusters, we hope to learn more about the relationship between a star’s mass, age, and even the history of the solar system.”
The star is 445 light years away from Earth.
Most of the stars in the cluster formed 125 million years ago and are reaching a new level of maturity.
They are moving at the highest speed possible throughout their lives.
At rotating speeds, the stars in this stage of maturation form large amounts of star winds.
As these winds advance through the star's magnetic fields, they create a breaking effect on the stars.
As a star gets older, its speed begins to decrease.
Kepler measures the speed of rotation of each star by tracking the time between the appearance of visible star spots such as sunspots.
The latest catalogue of rotation speeds suggests that larger stars rotate faster than smaller stars.
Rebull said the stars resembled dancers, and that the big ones would turn on one foot more slowly than the smaller ones.
Rebull said: “We see that those who turn slowly are much heavier and those who turn fast are very light stars.”
Since the Earth team is so close to the star, it is an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare its rotation speed with the characteristics of the star.
Rebull said: "The country team provides theoretical models for star rotations in both directions as the star is young and old."
There’s more we want to learn about how, when, and why the speed of rotation of stars drops, and why they put their ‘dance shoes’ in a corner.
Rebull and his colleagues have detailed their latest analysis of the rotating speeds of the Earth team star in three new articles that will soon be published in the Journal of Astronomy.
