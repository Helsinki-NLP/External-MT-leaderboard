A Republican Strategy to Confront Obama ’ s Reelection
Republicans ’ leaders justify their policies with the need to combat electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Center considers the latter to be a myth, confirming that election fraud in the US is less common than the number of people killed by lightning strikes.
Republicans ’ lawyers in the US, by the way, only 300 cases of electoral fraud in 10 years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures partially undermine the US democratic system.
Unlike Canada, the US Federal States are responsible for holding elections in the individual states.
In this sense, since 2009, the majority of American governments have proclaimed new laws that make it difficult to register or vote.
This phenomenon has gained in importance after the November 2010 elections, with 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
As a result, 180 draft laws were introduced in 2011 alone, limiting the exercise of electoral law in 41 states.
The new electoral laws require voters to present a photo ID and proof of U.S. citizenship.
In addition, these laws also shorten the time periods for early voting, declare the right invalid to register as voters on election day, and deny citizens the right to vote for which a court file exists.
Before the 2006 elections, no US state asked voters to present a photo ID.
Indiana was the first state to make such a demand.
The United States Supreme Court confirmed the constitutionality of the Indiana Law in 2008.
The Republican authorities hastened to extend this practice to other states.
Over the last two years, they have promoted bills in 34 states that force voters to show a photo ID.
It is important to note that, unlike Quebec, US citizens do not have a universal identity card such as the health insurance card.
Indeed, 11% of US citizens, i.e. 21 million persons entitled to vote, do not have a photo ID issued by a government authority of their state.
In addition, five million new voters do not have such an ID in 2012.
However, more than a hundred dollars are often to be paid to obtain the required ID.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and low-income people.
In fact, 25% of African-Americans, 15% of people with an income of less than $35,000, 18% of citizens over 65 years and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 years do not have the required photo ID.
This goes further.
Students who are seen as voters who vote more for democratic candidates are not allowed to use their photo ID issued by their institution in several states.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of fishing or hunting associations who choose more for the Republican side to use the cards issued by these associations for elections.
Before 2004, no federal state demanded proof of citizenship for voting.
Arizona was the first state to introduce such a demand.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws calling for voters to demonstrate their US state citizenship.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting Hispanic voices.
For it is obvious that two out of three Hispanic voters prefer the democratic party.
In addition, in 2011, Republican legislators promoted laws in eight states that abolished voters ’ registration on election day.
In addition, you have limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to those voters who wish to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, the campaign to register voters in the 2004 general elections helped to register about 10 million citizens.
The measures adopted since 2009 have reduced the proportion of new voters in 2010 by 17% compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican legislators have adopted laws in five other states aimed at shortening the period for early voting.
For example, in the 2008 Florida general election, 33% of the voters who voted in advance were Africans, even though they represent only 13% of federal voters.
The same applies to the Hispanic population.
The latter accounted for only 11% of voters, but 24% of the citizens who voted in advance.
By contrast, the whites, representing 76% of voters, accounted for only 46% of the voters who voted in advance.
Of course, democratic legislators and their supporters have vigorously opposed the adoption of laws restricting the registration of voters.
Several bills were blocked by the veto of democratic governors.
The U.S. Advocate General has intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They could partially limit the damage.
For example, only 16 of the 34 states have adopted laws requiring the presentation of a photo card.
However, the new rules introduced in 2012 will undoubtedly complicate the exercise of suffrage.
Democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the laws adopted and see them as a clear objective of influencing the results in the key states in 2012.
A 2011 report by the Brennan Center shows that those states that have passed these laws make up 171 of the 270 votes required by the Electoral Body to win the presidency.
It is too early to confirm with certainty that these legislative changes to the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential elections in 2012.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures partially undermine the US democratic system.
Prostate cancer early detection: should the test be done or not?
In fact, the PSA test sometimes showed incorrect results, with false negative or even false positive results that lead to unnecessary medical interventions.
This leads to greater hesitation of the already undecided men for carrying out early detection tests.
Should the test be done or not?
We obtained the opinion of two specialists.
The studies carried out in the US have had many interference factors between control groups, making it difficult to interpret these data and make clear recommendations.
Another study, this time from Europe, concluded that there is a difference in the mortality of patients with and without early detection.
This study has also shown that the probability of metastasis formation after 12 years is 30 to 40% higher if no early detection was performed.
Therefore I recommend the test from an age of 50 years or 40 years, if you have a direct relative who was already ill with prostate cancer.
There is also a higher risk in men of African American origin.
The most important thing is to make the right decision once a cancer has been detected.
There are cancers that are aggressive and others that are indolent.
The patient really needs to understand the extent of the risk of his cancer by identifying the possible options in which prostate cancer can remain untreated if it does not affect the quality of life in the long term, and in these cases it is more likely to opt for active monitoring of the disease.
Today, many men who have seen cancer do not receive treatment because their cancer is not aggressive and does not pose a threat to their lives.
They are proposed to be actively monitored and treated as the disease progresses.
With increasing accuracy, one determines the criteria for a decision, who should be treated and who should not.
That is why I recommend carrying out the test.
Most important, however, is to talk to his doctor to determine whether he should be performed or not.
In cooperation with the International Society for Urology, Movember has developed an instrument with which it is possible to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of the PSA test.

Preventing the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle cure to prevent cancer.
Despite progress in research, adopting a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of developing it.
It is estimated that 30% of cancers could be prevented if all were to eat well and move sufficiently.
"If there were no more smokers, this would increase to at least 50%," says André Beaulieu, spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
However, it is assumed that about 10% of cancers are caused by inheritance.
Several remain completely unexplained.
The fight against tobacco dependence remains a priority for the Canadian cancer society, despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Smoking is responsible for 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for several other types of cancer.
It severely damages people's health.
"There are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec today," says André Beaulieu.
Encouraging data: 10 years after abandoning the cigarette, the risk of dying of cancer is reduced by half.
The Weight
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, obesity and obesity also promote the outbreak of the disease.
They appear to increase the risk of breast, flu, rectum, oesophagus, pancreatic and uterine cancer.
"Research shows that regular physical activity protects against colorectal cancer throughout life," he adds.
The Nutrition
The organisation also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In too much quantity, it increases the risk of developing flu or rectum cancer.
Sausages should also be avoided.
The preservation of meat by smoking, drying or salts can lead to the formation of carcinogens.
"The latter can damage the body cells and lead to the development of cancer," he explains.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have investigated the relationship between vitamin additives and cancer.
However, their investigations are not conclusive at present.
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, the studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
While one study found a reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, another showed an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has also not yet been clearly shown.
Furthermore, Mr Beaulieu stresses the importance of talking to his doctor about his concerns and his family preoccupation.
"The implementation of an early detection test does not lead to cancer."
The Higg's Boson analyses
The announcement of the probable discovery of the Higgs of Boson caused a sensation last summer, and for good reason.
In fact, it is believed that this boson is involved in nothing less than the mechanism responsible for the mass of all objects in the universe.
And finally it is the last particle whose existence was predicted by the standard model - our best or "least false" explanation of nature and the behaviour of matter - but not yet observed empirically.
But for physicists, it is not yet completely certain that this is really the Higgs.
We know, without the shadow of a doubt, that we have a real new particle, and that it is very similar to Higgs ’ s Boson, predicted by the standard model.
Moreover, this seems to be confirmed by new data presented this week at a major physics congress in Kyoto, but there is still a lack of data to be completely secure about it.
Nevertheless, let us assume that this is actually the Higgs, since there seems to be only a small risk of deceiving oneself, and let us look at what it is all about.
There is an inevitable indispensable law in this world, which means that two objects cannot be present simultaneously in the same place.
It is not possible to violate this rule - and try it not too strong as you will hurt.
For even if particle physics is a truly strange world, it turns out that such a law also applies to it: the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time, if they are in the same "quantum state", whereby this "state" generally consists of some of its properties.
Based on this, the physicists divide the particles into two categories.
In one corner there are the good citizens, who are called Fermione and obey the Pauli principle.
And in the other, the bosons move, an evil gang of anarchists, to whom nothing is sacred - in any case not this principle, which means that they can indeed be in the same place at the same time.
These bosons are divided into two groups according to the website The Particle Adventure of the Berkeley Laboratories (which is by the way absolutely amazing): the mesons, which we will not treat here and the "power-particles", through which the great forces of nature spread and with which the Higgs of Boson would somehow be related.
But it must be emphasized here that these bosons are not all as exotic creatures as one might think.
If you are able to read this chronicle, then only thanks to a boson of extraordinary banality: the photon or the "light particle", which is the "messenger" of the electromagnetic force.
When a particle accelerates with an electric charge or changes the direction, the electromagnetic field is "disturbed" exactly at this place, like a pebble that was thrown into a pond.
This "disturbance" creates an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon and thus one of the bosons "carriers of force".
Stable field
The same is true for the Higgs and Boson, with the difference that another field, the Higgs and Field, must be "disturbed" so that this boson can be seen.
However, the Higgs Field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the pathogen must reach very high energies, a little comparable to a frozen pond whose surface could only be scattered by a very large rock.
Therefore a huge particle accelerator like the CERN is required - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring with a circumference of 27 km! - to achieve such energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again helpful to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
In fact, it is not all particles and not all materials that interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do this, but others do not - for example, a sheet of paper would never keep itself in the fridge.
And equally, not all particles interact with the Higgs Field: those who do have a mass, while the others (like the photon) have no mass.
For what can all these research be 'good', Mrs Plamondon asks?
For science, they are used to verify the standard model (SM), and they also enable physicists to closely investigate all deviations between the observations and the predictions of the SM.
By the way, there are numerous physicists who eagerly hope that such deviations will be found, as the slightest difference could open a door to a "new physics" and plug some holes of the model.
It must be said that the latter still has great defects, since it does not provide an explanation for gravity (ups!) and dark matter, which forms about 80% of the matter of the universe (again ups!).
However, such deviations have not yet been found at CERN.
Impact
The impact of this research on the general population is more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there is no.
By the way: in the early 1960s, the laser pioneers in the Bell Laboratories did not suspect that their work would trigger such a revolution.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle - who worked in the Bell Labs, in which the laser was invented in the 1960s, and who himself developed the first permanent screed laser (the first ones were pulsed) in 1962 - has already said that the laser was rather regarded as a "laboratory play" at the beginning.
Imagine yourself...
Applications can also result from all the instruments that surround research.
For example, Willard Boyle developed a small light sensor in 1969 during his optics work.
Although it was not the original purpose, this sensor now serves all digital cameras worldwide as an "eye" and has brought it the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009.
Of course, this does not mean that the activities of the LHC will inevitably change our lives, but it means that you can never really know...
Palliative care - the best way to die... | Le Devoir
Quebec recently discussed the sensitive issue of the end of life with its Committee on "Dignity".
The debate must be resumed shortly, although a draft law is being prepared.
However, much remains to be done in this important area.
Le Devoir has tried to look at this more closely.
A few weeks ago Mr. L. lived alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that consumed him had left him a period of two years.
"They gave me five years to live, I've managed seven years," he said half-heartedly, lying in his bed at the home of Palliative Care Victor Gadbois in Beloeil, where he had arrived the day before.
"However, it is always a shock, you cannot be prepared for it," he says.
The disease does its job: an immeasurable weakness prevents him from going to the toilet alone and even eating himself.
Sitting at the table before a delicious lunch, he resigned to let himself be helped with food.
Courageously he even succeeds in smiling and talking to the strangers who are busy around him, bringing him his medicine, and offering him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is to heal my diarrhea because it is humiliating," he says.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this evil.
"In the course of our lives, we learn that a man is peeing standing," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist in the home of Victor Gadbois.
Returning to the childhood phase is unacceptable humiliation for certain people.
"This depends on the person's ability to take a step backwards," he notes.
In the opinion of several people who work in palliative care, great events take place in the midst of these regressions.
Patients who are sent to the home for palliative care Victor Gadbois all suffer from cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this stage, doctors and nurses who take care of them no longer heal them with so-called "healing" care.
For Mrs. A., 89 years, the worst fear is to die "consciously and by suffocation".
But through the illness I really got to know my children.
"I have good children," she adds.
"I have no more wishes in life," she says before she accepts that she is put on a mask to help her breathe.
In the next few days, she still expects a last visit of her son, who comes from Italy.
In the home of Victor Gadbois, a group of volunteers offer body care and food intake assistance.
Palliative care is used when there are no other possibilities.
To make dying more pleasant.
In Quebec comes to 11,700 inhabitants a bed for palliative care.
This is very little if one takes into account that one day we will all die.
Here life continues under the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the home.
Both at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
The dying person is given a mouth care with Brandy or Pepsi, depending on the wish.
Diabetics no longer have to control their blood sugar levels.
And death is part of everyday life.
Last night we served Mr. X a beer that died during the night.
This morning his son will drink the beer at the foot of the deceased.
"We help relatives and patients alike," reports Nursing Director Nathalie Savard.
In the home of Victor Gadbois is not a day like the other.
In addition to an old man of 93 years, who enjoys the last family meeting in the courtyard and is well supported by his pillows while one stumbles in his honor, a young man of 36 years, surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two young children, dies tragically after trying everything to survive.
"For six months, three to five beds have always been occupied with cancer patients under the age of 45," says Dr. Christiane Martel with concern.
53% of the patients assigned to the home Victor Gadbois come from their home, 47% from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, i.e. care that is supposed to relieve the suffering of patients when the latter has reached the final stage of their lives, both at home, in the hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the home Victor Gadbois and the Society for Domestic Palliative Care in Greater Montreal, specialize more or less exclusively in the care of cancer patients.
It is precisely this great inadequacy in Quebec health care that ensures that several palliative doctors are concerned about adopting a law regulating euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since the month of October, a manifesto has been circulating, signed by prominent personalities of palliative care such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, to express their contradiction to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, Quebec ’ s healthcare system is inefficient enough to ensure that all have the right to high-quality palliative care before being accepted for euthanasia.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient who was 14 days in distress with great pain, without taking any measures to alleviate her.
I fear that patients only want to die because they do not receive adequate health care.
At the same time, several oncologists treat their patients, despite the worst predictions, until the last day.
The chances of survival of Hélène Richard were already minimal when she broke down a burdensome chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I would cancel the treatment, she answered me that she regretted that I was abandoning the fight, she told me.
However, she had told me that I was in the end!
No omnipotent care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who have asked to die are grateful to the nursing staff for not accepting this wish after their pain has been relieved by a team of palliative care.
It must be made clear, however, that palliative care is not omnipotent in pain treatment.
According to Elsie Monereau, head of palliative care at the Montreal Domestic Palliative Care Society, 8% of patients do not respond to pain treatment.
At the very end of life, physicians often fall back on the terminal sedation, which amounts to either falling asleep sporadically or permanently until the time of his death.
We can no longer pretend to see this side of suffering.
Patients without pain relief will increasingly have the opportunity to resort to this terminal sedation.
Patients whose pain is not relieved all say the same sentence: "I want to die."
But that does not necessarily mean "I want you to fall asleep", but "I want my pain to be relieved".
The realization of this report was possible due to a scholarship for journalism from Canadian health research institutes.
Large scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Civil servants of the road construction office, companies of the main construction industry, financiers of political parties and specialists of the Italian mafia every day tell what they know about a great "system" in which construction industry, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists and mafia are entangled.
An "industry" that was very expensive for the taxpayer, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
“It ’ s strange how the system declines since drastic measures have been taken, ” jokes Jacques Duchesneau, Quebec deputy and former head of the Montreal police.
The scandal was uncovered by him on the basis of an in-depth investigation into the embezzlement of the treaties on road construction in Quebec, which the then Prime Minister had only reluctantly agreed to.
The Duchesneau report established a direct link between industry, secret financing of parties and bribery of officials.
"Since the start of the investigation in 2010," he emphasises, "the Ministry of Transport alone would have saved one billion dollars in contracts," because some of them restrained their instinct to get their share!
The Charbonneau Commission "has already brought down two mayors," he adds, hoping that she will succeed in "showing the tactics behind the individuals."
A permanent anti-corruption unit launched in 2011
The permanent anti-corruption unit launched in 2011 is also making great efforts with its troops to the government ’ s accountants, investigators and analysts.
In addition, the police of the "Marteau Force", which has caused the Montreal "Channel Cartel" to be more cautious in the artificial inflating of the treaties since 2009...
In recent weeks, she has been conducting several house searches and making accusations of fraud and corruption against local officials such as Frank Tampino and Richard Marcotte, who is the mayor of a suburb.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his post as Mayor of Laval, Quebecs third largest city.
He is suspected of having repeatedly received bribes in exchange for public contracts.
By the way, engineers from the Montreal Road Building Office, as well as entrepreneurs of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito, were explicitly accused.
The latter caused a stir by explaining to the Commission the functioning of the "system" for obtaining public contracts.
For several years, he himself paid 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to an intermediary associated with the Mafia who transferred the money to the Union Montreal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
In the 2000s, Mr Zambito had his hand in the game everywhere, giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (approx. 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially to the liberals who were then in power.
He also admitted that he had organised illegal funding for former Liberal Vice-President Nathalie Normandeau.
sewer contracts whose costs were artificially inflated by him
In Montreal, the “system ” of corruption worked smoothly.
The former civil engineer Gilles Surprenant described this in detail before the Commission: in ten years he received gifts from the construction company, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants and ice hockey matches, as well as bribes in the amount of 736,000 dollars in exchange for sewage contracts, the costs of which he artificially inflated.
Other road construction officials have admitted that they could be lubricated by artificially inflating the bills by 30% or 40% with incorrect additional services.
In addition, an organiser of the Mayor ’ s Party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr Tremblay of deliberately overlooking a shadow budget that filled his coffers with money.
As a result of these revelations, Mr Tremblay resigned at the beginning of November, which plunged Montreal into a serious crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first Montreal deputies to strike the alarm.
As mayor of the Rivière district of the Prairies, in the east of the island, she refused to sell a municipal property in 2010, which was acquired for 5 million dollars and sold on to developers in the booming real estate market for 1.6 million.
70% black money in election campaigns
The investigation, which is ultimately carried out, says that it "draws on a thread that enables us to understand the functioning of the system undermined by ants in order to stop the evil and denounce the guilty."
She says that the procedure is "painful but positive".
We are cleaning up the wound, but we need an investigative unit only for Montreal, as well as supervision to prevent the return of questionable practices.
How to clean.
Regular.
Jacques Duchesneau, for his part, notes that "officials have stolen several hundred million dollars," but above all he thinks about the role of "officials who are in the picture about tactics," if they were not involved in fraud!
On the basis of 70% of the black money in funding the election campaigns in Quebec, he quips: "I was told that this was only a weak sign of reality."
The Quebec government proposes to limit donations to parties to $100, which, according to him, would not change the situation: "As long as election spending is not strictly limited, there will be black money in politics."
He recommends a complete revision of the public procurement system and the financing of the parties: "We cannot fall deeper; by courageously getting to the bottom of things, we can rebuild the house on a more solid basis with more controls and laws."
If this story damages the international reputation of Quebec and that of Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau calls on those who laugh to take a look into their own backyard...
"PSG is not the FC Barcelona!"
This season you have taken on a new scale with PSG.
How do you explain this progress?
It can be explained by a personal insight, but also by the new dimension of PSG.
Great players have come.
Every day I make progress on their side.
The technical staff also gave me a lot.
These elements encourage me to improve my playing level every day.
And in a game this is even easier.
Everything goes very fast in football.
But I don't break into enthusiasm.
Since my beginnings at the centre of INF Clairefontaine ’ s preparatory training up to my season at Saint Etienne, I have always progressed step by step.
They thus take advantage of the competition introduced by Carlo...
This summer ’ s newcomers are accustomed to playing very high levels.
You also know that each training session is decisive.
This leads to a player like me who has to face and want to do his best.
By the way, Carlo gives me a lot about my playing position.
He is supported by co-coaches like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Is the right person for the task?
Of course.
And respects all technicians.
There is currently no comparable person in Ligue 1 and he is one of the best trainers in Europe.
He looks back on a rich experience and has won many titles with prestigious clubs.
He had contact with big players.
I think he will win more titles in Paris.
In January I had an encouraging conversation with him.
At that time I had just recovered from an injury series.
The trust he has placed in me is also an explanation of my achievements.
What do you think about the first part of the PSG season?
In Ligue 1 Lyon has taken us the place of the top rider.
But we are lurking in ambush.
One of our most important goals is the Champions League: we qualified in this way for the Eighth finals.
What is the aim of the association in this competition?
We will try to get as far as possible.
From now on everything is possible.
However, we will have to speak out against very good European teams.
First of all, we want to become the first of our group in front of Porto, so that we can carry out the eighth finals as home matches.
Can PSG become a large European association in the short term?
He already has the budget...
To become a large European association, Paris must win titles and make a name for itself in the long term.
This is not the case today.
In financial terms, the PSG gives itself the means for this project to take concrete forms.
Would it be a great failure not to win the title in Ligue 1, as was the case last season?
Of course, this would be a great disappointment.
This year, we really care about forgetting this title.
In the last season we were close.
In May, we were disappointed because we were strong enough to win.
We finished the season with a very strong performance.
We have concluded with 79 points.
Normally you should be a master with 79 points...
But another team, that of Montpellier, has achieved an even better season.
I believe that this year is the right one.
Even though the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are wrestling for the title, I believe that we have the stuff to win it.
Do you think the media expect too much from PSG?
Given what has been invested and the players we have, it is normal that much of us are expected.
We fully accept that.
However, if we win a home game against Troyes 4 and you still find something you can accuse us of, it is certainly a bit frustrating.
One wonders what people still expect.
We could never win every weekend with 4-0.
We are not the FC Barcelona!
We try to establish a game concept.
A team builds up with time.
We proved strength in the Champions League.
Consider Manchester City, an association that has not been able to qualify for the second round for two seasons, and which has also made huge expenditures!
With regard to the invested sums, you were believed to be a break with 15 points advantage!
That would mean that our opponents and the French championship would be ignored.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not good in the last season, were "booted" by this new PSG.
This shows that Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that in the month of May we will be the smiling winner and tell us that, despite all the difficulties, we have finally won them.
The PSG seems to be completely dependent on the performances of PSG.
It is all the better that we talk about a "dependency".
This means that it is powerful and scores many goals.
Therefore he came and he proves that he is the star of Ligue 1.
Wherever he has played, he has shown that he is a great player and a world star.
Within the team we respect both the player and the person.
He also respects the people surrounding him.
What he has done is truly extraordinary.
This encourages others to improve their game level.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, also allows everyone else to make progress.
How did you experience the 2012 European Championship with the French national team?
Like a disappointment.
It was my heart to participate in this EM.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from hitting out some playing time.
I have seen things there from which I have emerged strengthened.
Today I succeed in realising good matches in the national team.
This was my hope since my baptism with the "Bleus".
We have learned our lesson from what has happened in Ukraine, and today we must show exemplary behaviour.
What do you think about the first months of Didier Deschamps at the top of the "Bleus"?
It has achieved promising results.
We have a good position in the qualification group for the World Cup.
The national coach is strict, close to the players and encourages victory.
As Laurent Blanc was.
But I do not want to make a comparison.
Blanc had achieved his goal by qualifying us for the European Championship.
I hope that Didier Deschamps will lead the "Bleus" to Brazil.
Does the draw (1: 1) compelled in Spain on 16 October represent a kick-off game?
This game has given us confidence.
Everyone has worked for everyone else.
Before this meeting in Spain, I have never experienced a comparable game in my career.
With Bitcoin payment and selling is possible without bank
The opposite of the current monetary exchange on the basis of central banks, identified transactions and handling fees between stakeholders.
Moreover, as so often happens in these technologies, a political vision is tangible: the conviction that the current monetary system, shaped by bank monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, the Bitcoin invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) is both a virtual currency (but convertible into dollars, euros, etc.) and a protocol for secure exchange such as BitTorrent, which allows direct exchange of files.
Some 200,000 transactions have already been recorded with 15,000 computers in the network.
Some thousand websites accept Bitcoin as a donation or as a means of payment.
After reaching a peak of $30 (€23) in June 2011, Bitcoin ’ s rate fell to $2 five months later before recovering to around $10 (the rates are listed on the bitcoincharts.com website).
Nothing particularly impressive compared to world trade in real currencies or financial products.
Nevertheless, the European Central Bank (ECB) has shown interest in this in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
She describes Bitcoin as "the virtual currency with the greatest success", "in competition with the dollar or euro" and "similar to conventional currencies".
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies, such as the "credits" used to advance in a video game that you can win or buy (and sometimes exchange) through games.
The social network Facebook has also developed such a system.
However, each time trade is controlled and processed by a central authority.
With Bitcoin, all network nodes are simultaneously depositors of the invoice book, auditors, money issuers as well as buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users actually takes place between two E-mail addresses in the form of an E-mail.
With the difference that the user can choose a different address for each payment, which ensures anonymity.
A number of data related to this transaction is electronically signed by a double encryption system.
In this way, the network can check the authenticity of the transaction.
Using the contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the Bitcoins traded are present in the public accounts accounting book distributed throughout the network.
The decisive step is to include this new transaction in this book.
This is done through a mathematical task launched on the computers, with the winner, who is a kind of temporary central banker, having the privilege of adding this additional line.
It is a fragmentation of the file, i.e. the conversion of a large file into a shorter and unique electronic fingerprint.
The computers "take" the new transaction and add a number to it before the whole thing is "chopped".
The goal is to find the number that gives a special fingerprint (many zeros at the beginning).
If this number has been found, the other nodes can effortlessly check if it is the right one.
The transaction is thus permanently linked to the chain of all other transactions, and any modification would change the fingerprint.
If a user wants to pay the same money twice very quickly (less than 10 minutes) for fraud, only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network and the other remains unconnected, as both have different fingerprints.
The computer that solved the task receives 50 Bitcoins.
To prevent inflation, this reward is halved regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
The Bitcoins in circulation are thus limited to 21 million, but can be divided up to one hundredmillionth, which leaves a certain margin...
In addition, the difficulty of the task is increased with every improvement of the computing power.
The life of the network has already had ups and downs.
The websites that provide Bitcoin services were attacked and Bitcoin deposits stolen.
"The vulnerability does not affect the actual protocol," says Pierre Noizat, who has just introduced Paymium, which is a real money payment company using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reports on the possibilities of money laundering through this anonymous service.
However, cash also has these shortcomings.
Important actors such as Wikipedia refuse donations of this kind.
They are accepted by others like the WordPress blog platform.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron from the Weizmann Institute in Israel analyzed the accounting book and showed that almost 80% of Bitcoins are not in circulation.
A "Mega Final Sale" was launched in November.
"Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged," said Jon Holmquist, who works for the company Coinabul, who converted Bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of a book on this currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as a transactional network.
His system Paytunia corresponds to a credit card (with real money) or contactless payment with a mobile phone, but uses Bitcoin to validate transactions that are cheaper.
In addition, the owner manages his identity and can thus remain anonymous.
The system can be easily implemented by dealers, and the latter do not need to install new terminals or computer programs.
You simply have to specify an address that can be "photographed and recognized" by a phone, says Pierre Noizat, who assures that he has thousands of users.
There is a general trend in which hierarchical systems are being reconsidered in favour of more horizontal systems.
"It will take some time for Bitcoin to prevail, but 2013 could be a turning point," he predicts.
The ECB, by the way, provides in its report to reassess the various risks, which are now highly regarded, in the event of a success of this currency.
We have withdrawn from Afghanistan.
And after that?
French troops have left their responsibilities in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the US are expected to follow at the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to take possession of its territory again, and for the Afghan people to decide their future without expecting anything from us.
We have punished Afghan farmers in particular by seeing them as terrorists.
And ourselves with our 88 soldiers killed, as well as the injured and wounded.
The Taliban are made up of foreign extremists, former leaders who have fled to Pakistan, but often also of peasants who refuse an armed foreign presence, as at the time of the Soviets.
They want to defend their centuries-old and archaic traditions, even if jihadists, Pakistani, Arabs, Uzbeks and Tajik joined them.
Tolerated, sometimes supported by local insurgents, the latter will no longer be there when Western countries become more discreet.
The withdrawal of the French troops from the base in Nijrab, which I observed from a hill planted with almond trees and financed with French loans, was done properly.
The trucks and tanks overflown by helicopters have reached Kabul without being attacked.
From the end of 2014, there will be no more inflows of the Taliban in Kabul.
Since their irresistible advance from 1994 to 1996, the conditions have changed.
At that time Kabul was empty and the country was subjected to war because of the struggles of the various insurgent groups.
Their seizure of power was then regarded as a kind of liberation and return to security.
Afghan women have paid the price of obscurantism for farmers overwhelmed by Al Qaeda, but their situation has not improved to this day.
Former Mujahedin, the Afghan government and current Taliban have a common desire to keep women in a subordinate position.
The most important personalities of the anti-Soviet war came back to power in 2001.
They have turned into business makers by confiscating government land to sell it as a building land to refugees from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting from massive US subcontracting.
They got into disrepute, and most of them were not themselves involved in the battles.
As I have heard in the campaigns, people want a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave the country, like those who have benefited from the American grants: capital flight is considerable.
Young people are fed up with war and its ideologies.
During their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they have had contact with the modern world, and have enjoyed its benefits.
About 65% of the population is under 25; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, one fifth of the total population.
In cities, state schools are full of girls and boys.
These young people, who do not want to return to the obscurantism of the former parties or to the corruption of certain leaders, will have to provide jobs.
All, including the armed parties, are possessed by mobile phones; television with its Turkish series, which represent a modern world, is viewed everywhere.
An army is now in place.
Will the authorities under whose authority it will be considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already trying to restore the militia in the province, which will escape the power of the central government.
Afghanistan, the country of the mountains with strong local identities should have benefited from a certain decentralization in the example of the Western nations, but by abolishing the office of Prime Minister, which existed since the constitution of 1964, the US wanted to make it a centralized state with a strong presidential power.
President Karzaï does not want foreign controls, in particular on the occasion of the elections planned for April 2014.
But his country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and long before.
Industries have not been rebuilt, workable storage facilities are not available and important irrigation systems have not been repaired.
Everything is imported; apart from fruit and vegetables, nothing is produced.
The private initiative is given priority.
In a country undergoing 30 years of war, state control of infrastructure would have been necessary.
The rumour was spread that Afghanistan had immense natural resources.
This reinforces the impression that Western countries were only on the ground to seize it.
Without energy to process the iron or copper ore on site, or without means of transport for an export over the mountains, no mining is possible.
The Chinese have almost left the copper mine of Mes Aynak, the international archaeologists (financed by the World Bank) have excavated on the huge Buddhist site and remain the province ’ s main employers.
One day, it will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which imports and exports are largely dependent, to reestablish normal relations.
The withdrawal of the French combat forces was completed on 20 November.
The new Cooperation Agreement provides for the continuation of traditional aid: school for girls and boys, French Institute at the universities, French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support of the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, a service "Civil Military Actions" of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), which was discontinued in 2012, has carried out in dozens of mountain villages numerous charitable works and measures for the rehabilitation of agriculture and carried out by a small French non-governmental organization to try to "win hearts and spirits" and achieve the impossible task of compatibility of aid and offensive actions.
This work, for which many local workers were required, could help to suppress the uprising: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increased agricultural land.
What souvenir do we leave behind after military expenditure of EUR 2 billion?
A much more modest budget will help to improve local living conditions, which are often very hard in these valleys at an altitude of more than 2000 metres.
The Embassy received dozens of written requests from small agricultural projects from municipalities in the province of Kapisa.
In order for farmers to free themselves from the uprising led by foreign groups, which is their wish according to their own statements, the continuation of small, well controlled and directly concerned civil aid would be necessary in their favour.
A constitution with the crusher rod in Egypt
This is a new poker game by President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt remains divided more than ever in relation to the Constitutional Declaration, which temporarily grants it unlimited power, it has decided to put everything on one card.
To the surprise of all, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would adopt its final version the next day.
Just one week ago, the Head of State granted this plenary two additional months to complete its work.
Egypt has now relied for almost two years on a provisional text that has been amended several times, weakening institutional stability and leading to legal confusion.
This new initiative has only caused the country to become even more divided.
For his opponents, the President persists in his "autocratic delirium" by continuing to "break his word" and "trample the law".
On the side of its supporters, it is assured that it is a way to end the institutional and political crisis as quickly as possible and to accelerate the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 14 days.
A very short period, which forces the brothers to renounce their intention to explain the text to the Egyptians section by section.
For the President, it is also a way to rediscover his public and democratic legitimacy while the protest is raging throughout the country.
After confirming in an interview with the American weekly Time, Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote benevolently.
In view of the fact that an ultimatum is being put to the Egyptian people with this resorting to a hasty vote: "Either it agrees with my draft or I reserve the unlimited authority", the latter should supposedly put an end to it after the adoption of the Constitution.
85 mostly Islamist members of this Constituent Assembly adopted the text yesterday in a strange atmosphere.
The majority of Liberals have not responded to the call.
Shortly before the Constitutional Declaration in mid-November, they turned away because they felt that they were unable to bring their views to bear.
Representatives of human rights organisations, religious minorities or civil society have acted equally.
To achieve quorum, 11 people, deputy members, were added in a hurry yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
It is not surprising that the articles were mostly adopted unanimously.
By the way, the commentators found it entertaining that the only difference of opinion of the day... was expressed at the time of prayer, since some members of the body felt that the clock of the Constituent Assembly did not go exactly.
The text, which was adopted last night, consists of 234 articles.
Finally, Article 2, which drew all attention, remains identical to that of the 1971 Constitution and states that "the principles of Sharia are the main source of law".
The Salafist parties, for which the establishment of Islamic law is an important demand, had the hope of replacing "the principles" with "the rules", which would have made a stricter application possible.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article has not been changed is proof of their good will and respect for the other members of Egyptian society.
"hypocrisy" reciprocates the liberals who regard this only as propaganda.
According to them, the Islamization of the Constitution takes place through other articles.
In particular, they have Article 220 in mind, which recognises an advisory role for the University of Al-Azhar, in particular with regard to the review of conformity with the laws of Sharia law.
According to the Egyptian specialist Sophie Pommier, this is disturbing, because "the people who are called for an opinion have not been elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
One can see here the first signs of a theocracy. "
Liberals ’ fears are also fueled by the fact that the next rector of this university should be far less moderate than the current one.
"There is currently no concrete religious commitment.
With this Constitution we remain within the framework of the bourgeois state.
Most lawyers who have worked on this text are not Ulema, but academics who have been trained in part in the French system, "summarizes Alexis Blouet, who writes a doctoral thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
However, he acknowledges that "there may be ambiguity in relation to Article 220, since the terms used are borrowed from the religious vocabulary.
One refers here in particular to the "Fiqh" [Islamic jurisprudence].
And in the future, the question could be raised as to how far civil judges are competent to decide. "
In addition to its religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday is strongly criticised for the far-reaching powers it grants the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood argues that they are significantly reduced compared to the former regime.
Another point of contention: the powers of the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the examination of the defence budget is not submitted to Parliament but to a national defence council.
Similarly, there will be no ban on civil proceedings in military courts, as called for by the associations for the defence of human rights.
The latter also share their fears about the text they regard as threatening liberty.
The fact of blasphemy is maintained and insults are now banned, which could have serious consequences for the right to freedom of expression, especially for the press.
Furthermore, no article relates to the protection of women, underlines Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
In your opinion, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by Article 36.
This word was not contained in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian president had to speak on television last night, demonstrations are planned for this afternoon.
The proponents of the head of state will march up Saturday.
In Israel Ukrainian tourists expect sacred sites, the navel of the world and a sea of brine
The Promised Land unites in itself the glory of biblical truths, modern comfort and untouched nature.
AIF gives you the five main reasons for a visit to Israel.
Bow in front of the holy places
Visit the river Jordan, where Jesus was baptized.
It is said that all who bathe in this river receive God's blessing.
Galilee is the place where Jesus performed his miracles: the conversion of water into wine on a wedding celebration, walking on the water, the confinement of the sea tower and fishing.
Just here Jesus appeared to his disciples after the resurrection.
Most of the sanctuaries are located in Jerusalem.
Here believers walk the Passion or Way of the Cross of Jesus Christ (in Latin: Via Dolorosa).
The path starts at the Roman fortress Antonia, Pretorium, where the court was, and leads through the streets of the old town to the grave church on Mount Golgotha, where there is the crucifixion, the anointing stone and the tomb of Jesus.
This is the Christian view of the navel of the world, which symbolises the salvation of humanity.
The convent of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem stands at the place where, according to a Christian legend, the tree from which the cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus grew.
In Jerusalem there is also the most sacred place of the Jews - the Wailing Wall, the remains of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD.
Traditionally, people of different faiths leave notes with wishes, which are then fulfilled.
Journey to the heights
The ruins of the Massada fortress form the remains of the secret hiding place before enemies that Herod the Great had built for his family in the year 25 AD.
They are situated on a rock wall in the mountains at 450 meters above sea level.
Only mountaineers can reach the ruins by themselves.
All the others bring a cable car to this historic summit.
In the north of the country in 1600 to 2040 meters height is the famous ski resort Hermon, in which it attracts countless tourists in the winter months.
There is a shuttle bus from the foot of the mountain.
The ski slopes have a total length of 45 kilometres.
According to an ancient legend, pagan gods lived on the top of the mountain.
Visit unique museums
There are almost 300 museums in this country.
With only one trip not all of them can be visited.
But at least the five most interesting of them should be paid a visit.
Among them is the Israel museum near the Knesset (Parliament).
Old Qumran manuscripts or scrolls of the Dead Sea, found in rock caves in the Judean desert, and about 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological exhibits are kept there.
The Museum of Art in Tel Aviv is also worth a visit.
The collection of works by the Impressionists and Expressionists Monet, Pissaro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso is exhibited there.
In Akko you can visit the museum in the Bad Al Basha, which houses several halls of ancient Turkish baths with sculptures of the then visitors and bathers.
In Caesarea you should visit the unique private Ralli Museum, where you can admire Dali and Rodin sculptures.
There are neither museum guides nor souvenir shops.
Admission is free and donations are rejected.
The fifth museum, namely the Holocaust and Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, tells of one of the most shocking chapters in history.
The most touching section is the monument to the children, built in memory of the 1.5 million children who were destroyed in the concentration camps and gas chambers.
When entering the room there is complete darkness.
Stars sparkle.
And the names of the Jewish children and the countries in which they died resound.
Ukraine is also mentioned there.
Do something for health
The three main recreational areas of Israel lie on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
In each of the three places there are swimming pools, water parks, dolphins and oceanariums.
Surprisingly, the Red Sea is also bathed in the winter months, as the water temperature does not fall below 21 ° C and the air warms up to 23 ° C.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and bathed all year round.
By the way, this unusual sea with a position of 417 meters below sea level is the deepest sea in the world.
Its turquoise blue water has a high salt content and thus carries even non-swimmers easily on the surface.
The surrounding landscape is indescribably beautiful.
Visitors come here for treatments using salt water (natural salt brine) and healing mud as well as for the treatment of skin inflammation, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes and calming stressed nerves.
Touching the Mysteries of Antiquity
These secrets hold the old town of Tel Aviv, the city of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
The famous sea route connecting Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia ran through this city.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legends.
According to tradition Noah built his ark here, and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with which he lived a long and happy life in this place.
Tourists like to stroll through the narrow streets named after zodiac signs.
Fortuna is said to be the legend of all those who touch the walls in the alley with their zodiac sign.
In Jaffa you can meet newlyweds from all over Israel and even other countries at photo mines.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can stroll through the Roman theatre and conquer the fortress of the Crusaders.
In Roman times Caesarea was the most important city of Judea and residence of the Roman governors, including Pontius Pilate.
Nowadays evening concerts and operas are performed in the carefully restored theatre.
Booklist for tourists
If you go to Israel, don ’ t worry about your bad English skills: about 30% of Israelis speak Russian.
The money in the trip is rather not taken in euros, but in dollars, which can simply be changed into shekels (current exchange rate: 1 dollar to 3.8 shekels).
In the city you can mostly take the bus, but in Jerusalem there is also an expressway and in Haifa the only subway line of the country with six stations connecting the lower city with the upper city.
In fact, it is an underground funicular.
A trip within the city costs 6 shekels regardless of the means of transport, which includes a transfer for a journey of up to 1.5 hours.
According to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated in Israel on Saturdays.
From Friday evening until sunset on Saturday, markets and shops are closed and public transport rests.
And on Sunday morning the working week begins.
In many cafes, restaurants and restaurants only kosher food is served, which excludes pork, sea products, fish without sheds and dishes that contain both milk and meat products.
Instead, you can choose between different dishes with mutton and beef, soups and desserts (prepared with coconut milk), traditional Jewish humus paste, various sauces, fried balls of pureed beans and peas (falafel) as well as fruits and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs in the streets of Israeli cities.
But there are many well-fed cats that stroll through the streets comfortably and undisturbed.
In the evening you can even see them sleeping on the roofs of parking cars.
The cats like animated places and do not say no to treats.
A rental car costs between 37 dollars per day (Hyundai Getz) and 188 dollars (Audi A6, Volvo S80) depending on the brand.
The insurance costs an additional 15 dollars per day.
And bike rental costs 15 shekels per day.
Tickets for museums cost 30 shekels on average.
In figures
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
Most adventurers and recreational seekers came from Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England, the USA and Ukraine.
From January to October 2012, 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists came to the Promised Country, an increase of 51% compared to the same period in 2010, before the visa requirement was lifted on 9 February 2011.
"The great and powerful" leads to Moscow: Migrants save money for language
While MEPs and civil rights activists discuss the benefits of the law on binding language tests for migrants, criminals are already acting with counterfeit certificates
Every year 13 million guest workers come to Moscow, Saint Petersburg and other cities in Russia.
Most of them are the citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money for the maintenance of the families who remain in their homeland.
On 1 December, a law entered into force requiring each migrant to take a test certifying knowledge of the Russian language.
Until now, this scheme only applies to migrants who want to work in the services sector, in the municipal housing sector and in the retail sector.
However, according to the Federal Migration Authority, tests should become mandatory in future for all guest workers.
Not only language tests, but also tests must be put into Russian history and the foundations of legislation.
Language skills must be proven both for obtaining and extending the work permit.
Exceptions apply only to citizens of countries where Russian is the official language.
Also excluded from this law are persons who received their certificates of education and diplomas before the disintegration of the USSR in 1991.
Sense, problem and protection of rights
The whole of the exams will be held under the aegis of the Pushkin Institute for Russian Language, the Russian University of International Friendship, the Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
Migrants can pass the tests in all cities and already more than 160 centres have been opened in Russia.
The initiative to introduce the tests was supported by Members of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Authority.
Citizens' rights activists, on the other hand, asked several times before the law came into force in the press: what does it actually bring about?
What changes does the requirement to have language skills bring, both for the Russians and for the guest workers?
Above all, the spokesman for the Migration Authority said, it was about reducing the number of forced laborers.
"Many are now talking about the protection of the rights of migrant workers," said Viktor Zebelev, head of the Representation of the Federal Migration Authority in Tajikistan.
Their rights must, however, be protected from their departure.
Only an organized recruitment will solve 90% of the problems of foreign workers.
Problems are encountered by migrants without a job, education, language skills and medical evaluation.
Sebelev is convinced that a future migrant without language skills will inevitably encounter people with evil intentions who, on the pretext of help, will put him in a dark, narrow barrack, where he will endure with dozens of his equal months without food and documents and work 12 to 14 hours a day.
We receive many complaints from our migrants.
"In the home you are promised the one, and on arrival you will be cheated, get their passports taken off and will not receive the promised wage," confirms the head of the Head of Labour Migration of the Tajik Migration Authority, Tolib Schwaripov.
Not scolding, boss!
Nevertheless, many citizens of the Central Asian republics who want to earn their money in Russia admit that they cannot only speak the language of the target country, but can hardly express themselves in writing in their own language.
Of course, this is not so much their fault as the evil: only a few Turkmen, Uzbeks and Tajiks can afford a reasonable basic education.
Because in their families there is not even money to feed the children, let alone to buy them decent clothes, shoes and school clothes.
As teenagers, these children immediately seize the first opportunity to earn money.
"It is difficult without language skills," they admit.
"You feel humiliated and inferior."
Civil rights activists stress the following important aspect of the law.
Only migrants with legal status must take the test.
If you do not have this status, there is no examination and therefore no official work.
Meanwhile, most of the guest workers remain illegally in Russia.
"Welcome" or "Forbidden access for unauthorised persons"
Many migrants confirm that it is not easy to obtain official status in Russia.
The reason is bureaucratic hurdles and, of course, the linguistic difficulties.
In addition, the legalization costs money: 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
Fake registration can be done quickly and only for one and a half thousand.
The staff of the Russian police know that our documents are mostly fake and we are not registered, and then there are cases of blackmail.
"They want one or two hundred rubles for cigarettes and tea," says Tajike Umed Huskadamov to journalists.
"Do not shy away from costs for false papers"
Already on the day the law entered into force, it turned out that not only the registration documents of migrants can be falsified.
Some counterfeit certificates certifying the completion of the language test have already been confiscated by employees of the Federal Migration Authority.
The counterfeit papers were printed with an ordinary color printer.
Of course, the new owners did not get this for nothing: every migrant who hoped to save himself so the tests paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
This is more than twice as much as the cost of the official test: it costs a migrant worker three thousand rubles.
The most important immediate task is to protect the system from corruption, so that the certificates cannot be bought easily, both officials and civil rights activists are in agreement.
For the moment, the authorities can only promise to give guest workers who will fall through the test for the first time that they will have time for a basic language course.
In addition, new arrivals without language skills are offered positions in areas where no active communication with people is necessary.
Ministry of the Interior ignores illegal arms market
Proportion of legal weapons in criminal offences extremely low
The Russian Ministry of the Interior is planning to tighten the arms law for private arms owners.
The authorities are responding to recent events: injured in shootings on weddings and seven dead in the shooting of Moscow lawyer Dmitry Verogradov.
The police want to ban the use of non-lethal weapons in public and to raise the age of possession of firearms from 18 to 21 years.
The proposal was supported by Irina Jarowaja, Chairman of the Duma Committee on Security and Corruption, and promised that the amendments to the Arms Act will soon be submitted to the Duma.
Not everyone is satisfied that the Russian authorities want to combat the problems by "attracting the screws".
An open letter has been published on the Internet, the author - representatives of various arms associations - calling on the authorities to refrain from "meaningless tightening up".
The percentage of crimes with registered weapons is very low, said the criminal lawyer, Vasily Lesnikov, the Russian service of the BBC.
According to the Interior Ministry statistics, 142 crimes involving the use of registered weapons were committed in 2012 over six months, while a total of 1.168 thousand crimes were committed for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that tightening up the law for private arms owners will not prevent criminals from using themselves on the black market.
According to the authors, at present any weapon can be found in Moscow for little money.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of the Interior stresses that the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from factories to officers
The weapons enter the black market via several channels.
There are five such main channels, told a former colonel Viktor Baranez, who worked for ten years in the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot of a website that accepts arms orders
The first channel is the army or military, i.e. weapons stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were stolen both by the Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves," says Baranets.
On the second channel come illegal weapons that are stolen from criminals.
Baranez explains that this includes weapons stolen both from the police ’ s weapons chambers and directly from law enforcement staff.
Other illegally sold weapons come from military weapons camps.
Explosions often occurred in many military camps.
"There is evidence that some cases were arson, to cover up the lack of weapons," says the former military member.
According to Baranez, arms manufacturers also contribute to the black market.
"Nowadays, there are countless private arms factories that do not stand up to international competition and therefore slash the weapons under the hand of the black market, for example in Moscow," the expert reports.
Another channel of the black market is smuggling.
Especially many guns and rifles come from poor countries like Kyrgyzstan.
"There is an own, sometimes artisanal production there as well as a mafia, which organizes the smuggling", explains the former military member.
Where do the weapons come from?
Experts calculated the proportion of each of the five channels involved in supplying illegal weapons to the black market.
In 2011, a report was written by the Centre for Problem Analysis and State Administration.
The experts analysed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and the Federal Service for State Statistics, Criminal Literature and publicly available data on weapons portals.
According to the investigators, most of the illegal weapons come from the army and legal protection authorities.
Half of all the weapons on the black market are there because of the 'guilt of those responsible who have come to deal with weapons in their work', the report says.
According to the researchers, 17% of the weapons come from conflict zones, 14% go back to theft in arms production, and 5% come from illegal excavations.
A sales advisor for an arms store that does not want to be named, assures that weapons that are found in illegal excavations have not been bought for a long time since they are outdated.
According to him, it is more common for traders to obtain supplies in a weapons camp.
A weapon, for example a gun of type TT, is purchased via a ensign.
The weapon is issued and passed through the fence.
"The dealer brings the weapon to the city and sells it there for 900 euros per piece with two magazines," he says.
"The police, of course, are aware of everything and therefore, if they cannot comply with the plan to detect crimes, periodically carry out inspection purchases at dealers offering illegal weapons," adds the sales advisor.
"Like in a luxury shop"
Buyers and sellers find each other most frequently through acquaintances.
I had looked at websites and blogs when someone became aware of me and suggested that I come to the station "Begowaja", where a person would wait for me to bring me to a certain place where we could negotiate the price.
I only learned the price of the weapon there
Military Commentator Viktor Baranez
"To get a weapon, I need a friend who has contacts," says the sales consultant. "I have such a friend, but I don't trust him."
There are traders in the markets, but there you have to go and agree with a code like "Ivan Ivanovich, who lets align that the daughter has lost a tooth".
I am even coming to some drums about a friend to whom I trust.
He also delivers the rings to me only because he knows that I do not whistle him.
Newcomers are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former military member Viktor Baranez tried to buy illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he wrote an article on this subject.
According to him, the schemes have not changed.
He got a photo album in which "everything possible" was shown.
"I felt like in the luxury shop," the military member remembers.
According to Baranez, the buyer does not get the cat in the bag, but can try everything.
As a potential customer, I do not just buy, but drive with the seller into the forest, and there we set up a target.
"I can then shoot there, and if I am convinced that the weapon has a good shot, we negotiate with each other," the expert describes the procedure.
Shopping from the sofa
Internet search engines show search results for websites and groups in "Vkontakte", where weapons are offered "for different purposes".
There are neither any papers needed nor personal meetings.
"You only need the right sum of money," it says in the advertisement on the website "buy gun or gun".
There, users place their orders and make inquiries.
Is it also sold to minors?
"Of course without license", user asks "Ivan" (literally quote).
"Buy a TT. Moscow" is the laconic request from "Fedorenkov".
The Federal Security Service recently switched on countless fake websites, and buyers who want to purchase weapons go up into the network.
People come like hungry fish feeding and then land in Siberia and are allowed to shovel coal
Military commentary and former military member Viktor Baranez
I have heard about the following scheme: The website is normally registered abroad, and Russian laws do not apply.
The controllers accept the orders.
The buyer transfers the money via a bank machine.
"In response, he receives a photo and a description of the hiding place of the weapon," reports the spokesman of the non-profit organization "Pravo na oryzhie" Dmitrij Kislow.
Viktor Baranez stresses that at the end you can also leave empty and come behind bars if you place a request on a website.
The Federal Security Service recently switched on countless fake websites, and buyers who want to purchase weapons go up into the network.
"People come to feed like hungry fish and then land in the Siberian labour camp and are allowed to shovel coal," he says.
A Makarov for 100 US dollars
According to experts, the price of illegal firearms is 100 to 900 US dollars.
According to Dmitry Kislov from the organization "Pravo na oryzhie" you can buy a gun of type Makarov for 100 to 300 dollars.
You have to wait up to one and a half months.
The weapon is issued in military weapons camps by middle-class guards.
According to the Ministry of the Interior ’ s official statistics, the number of crimes against illegal weapons throughout Russia fell by 7% to 22.9 thousand between January and October 2011, while the number of cases of theft and blackmail in connection with weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosives fell by 7.8%.
In the United States strike almost inhabitants of food and supermarket employees
Every fourth US American youth sits behind Mc Donald's cash register at some point
In recent days, massive protests against low wages have taken place throughout the US in Walmart stores and restaurants with popular fast food chains such as Mc Donald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
No one can yet predict whether the protests will continue to swell or whether they will soon be released.
The protests are supported by trade unions and several left-wing non-profit organisations.
In addition to raising the modest wages of simple Walmarts and Fast Food employees, the organisers of the protests are pursuing the goal of establishing trade unions.
Until now, this industry has hardly been organised by trade unions.
46 cents a year?
The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, on the so-called Black Friday, where sales took place in the US, attracting millions of customers, sometimes leading to manual crowds.
On that day, some Walmart Employees, of whom there are 2.2 million worldwide, laid down their work and, together with trade unions and left-wing activists, disputed branches of the chain whose target group are low- and middle-income people.
Walmart sells all products, from diapers to hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The goods in Walmart stores are between 8 and 27% cheaper on average than in large supermarkets.
That is why many of Walmart ’ s low-paid employees buy only at their own workplace.
The prices and the product range made Walmart one of the largest companies in the USA.
According to critics, Walmart can sell the goods often only because the employees are poorly paid.
The latter also complain about heavy working conditions, for example missing forklifts or hand scanners.
The participants in the protests on "Black Friday" demanded wage increases and expressed their anger that the contribution to the company's own health insurance had increased from 30 to 100 dollars a month.
A typical Walmart employee who earns US $9.5 per hour cannot afford this increase, they said.
Researchers from the University of California in Berkeley show that if the company raised the average wage to 12 dollars per hour, it would cost Walmart 3.2 billion dollars.
That is about 1.1% more than they now donate for wages.
If Walmart changed the wage increases completely to the customers, each purchase cost them in the future only 46 cents more.
This would be more than $12.39 per year compared to today ’ s spending.
Proponents of Walmart are pleased to see that protests took place only in nine states and that they did not cause any losses to the company.
The Black Friday lasted in its store from 8 o'clock in the evening on Thursday to midnight the next day, and during this period Walmart sold about 5000 items per second.
All in all, the Walmart cashier carried out nearly 100 million transactions on "Black Friday".
In an interview on the website of the left-wing Huffington Post, the company ’ s spokesman, Dan Fogelman, claimed that a total of “less than five ” Walmart Employees were laying down the work and that the protest action was merely“ another PR trick ” of the union that organized the protests.
"Free cash register!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where their goal, however, was not Walmart ’ s branches (which are not desirable in this advanced city and therefore hitherto inexistent), but McDonald ’ s and other low-cost restaurants.
McDonald's says the company sells billions of portions, and yet you are not given sick days, and you are not paid for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, Member of the New York City Council
Currently, the minimum wage is $7.25 per hour in accordance with federal and New York legislation.
The minimum wage is gradually raised in fast food restaurants, but not too strong, and on average their simple New York staff gets $8.90 per hour.
Less than they no one deserves in this expensive city.
How it is possible to get out of New York with so little money is incomprehensible to me.
There was once a time when almost a quarter of all US youth were behind the counter after school at McDonald's, but the teenagers still lived with their parents.
Hardly anyone saw in it the main source of income or planned to stay longer there.
Now, in interviews with McDonald's staff, I constantly meet people who complain that they have to cope with this wage and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, there is a comment in the forum of the Wall Street Journal, whose author notes that it is irresponsible to get children if one does not know how to feed them.
Participants in the protests, which began on Thursday at 6: 30 a.m. in front of McDonald's on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that the cashers and cooks of fast food restaurants receive a minimum wage of 15 US dollars per hour, which is more than a doubling of the current minimum wage.
They continued to demand the formation of trade unions in the fast food industry.
America ’ s law forbids corporate governance to stand in the way of this goal and exhort or dismiss union members.
On the other hand, management does not make it easy for them.
However, the establishment of unions in the fast food industry is also difficult for objective reasons.
The most important reason is the high staff turnover.
Unsatisfied
There were loud protests that day in front of many other fast food restaurants in Manhattan.
The highlight of the protests was a meeting at noon in front of McDonald's at Times Square, where some local democrats spoke, including councillor Jumaane Williams, who said, "McDonald's says it sells billions of portions, and yet you are not given sick days, and you are not paid for your honest work!"
The demonstrators were also supported by other prominent New York democrats, for example, Mayor Bill De Blasio, who said that "we should join forces to support the fast food workers so that they can earn a fair wage and achieve the economic prosperity that every New Yorker deserves!".
According to the New York Times, this was the biggest action of its kind in the history of the US fast food industry.
However, only a few hundred people were on the ground, not all of whom are employed in the fast food industry where tens of thousands work in New York.
It is not yet foreseeable whether the spark of these protests will mobilize entire masses.
"The brain can only be moderately overlittered"
The topic of enlarged reality, which is popular with fans of modern technologies, is usually perceived by the lens of special glasses lately.
First, Google presented a working model at its annual conference in the summer, and in November it became known that Microsoft had also applied for a patent.
In conversation with the head of the group for interactive 3D technologies in the Microsoft laboratory in Cambridge Shahram Izadi, it becomes clear that the glasses were only a transit station for the company ’ s scientists.
It stimulates the possibility of manipulating virtual objects in the air with bare hands and creating virtual open spaces.
- Please describe briefly which research your group is conducting.
- We deal with the interaction of man and machine, but want to expand the limits of this interaction.
So far, most of humanity has remained stuck in the phase of working with pixels on flat screens, which are sometimes touched.
However, we want to look ahead for 5 to 10 years and foresee the radical changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and the Kinect sensors are a step forward, and nowadays no Xbox is sold without Kinect, as everyone is interested in motion control.
- What is waiting for us in the future?
- Although Kinect has brought the interaction to a physical level, much still happens on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information (the system receives more data) could be improved, the output has not yet been decisive.
We try to change this, work on real three-dimensional display systems based on various technologies, including projections.
We need to release the computer world into our physical world and make it more tangible.
However, it is necessary that not only the user but also his environment is recognized.
Then we could add virtual objects to the real world much easier.
And first and foremost we should get rid of these ravaged Virtual and Reality helmets!
- What do you think about voice control?
It is popular, but is it not overvalued?
- It is certainly not the all-purpose solution, as it raises questions about privacy, because one does not always want to inform all those around about his actions and intentions.
Actually, any kind of interaction with computers is good, but each in its particular niche.
For example, in the area of controlling objects in public places, we worked on a project in which we experimented with short and short gestures instead of spreading.
The gestures were not recorded by the object camera, but by a bracelet that registered the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is still relatively large, but could theoretically be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
But overall, the future belongs to mixed types of control, such as gestures and language.
- How?
- We would ask you, for example, to give you this jacuzzi can?
They say it and at the same time point to it.
- Normally I just say it.
- Oh, it would be very difficult to see.
- Does that mean you want the user to adapt to what a machine can afford at the respective time and what not?
- Not necessarily, but this is about a mutual approach.
I think that in the near future we will have to work in particular on the development of new sensor types, which will enable people to understand reactions more precisely.
These can be laser sensors, for example, as they offer good resolution in depth, which is very important.
- What requirements do you place on modern cameras based on your work with the Xbox Kinect sensors?
Is there a lack of resolution, depth or something else?
- The present generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the field of three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, 8 megapixels at a speed of 1000 fps would not be bad.
But the main thing is not the megapixels themselves, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
From this point of view, all current technologies are not good enough for us, as the developers of the algorithms have more work.
It must be taken into account not only the resolution along the X and Y axes, but also along the Z axis.
The speed and number of images per second are also important.
The movements of the human being are extremely dynamic and frankly said, the current 30 fps are too little especially for gestures.
Stephen Betishes developed in our laboratory in Redmond a contact sensor with a adjustable processing delay between 1 and 100 milliseconds, whereby today's commercial sensors are closer to the second value (60 to 100).
Not everyone understands how much this affects the interaction between man and machine.
For my work I needed exactly such a device, only without touch control and with more pictures per second.
- Should the number of cameras not be increased?
- Kinect currently works with three "cameras", one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the other a receiver for the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actually an ordinary RGB camera.
It does not serve to calculate the object depth.
More cameras could possibly solve the problem...
Or strengthen the problem, as more calculations would be necessary.
It would be nice to have a flexible Kinect system similar to that in which we could play with different camera inclinations to determine how this helps us in the three-dimensional determination of a position.
- If I remember correctly, Microsoft unlike Google did not present its glasses to the public.
Do you not think that glasses have the best prospects in terms of applying the technology of expanded reality in everyday life?
- Of course it is not pleasant to always hold a smartphone in the raised hand while on the road, but I think the following: The greatest variant would be a "changing" extended reality, in which we could switch from the glasses to the smartphone via a cloud,
The glasses are a personal gadget and it is their strength (only you can see private items), but also their weakness, because an extended reality by means of glasses prevents you from working on virtual objects together with others.
- Imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holograms in the air is accessible not only to Tony Stark from Iron Man, but also to normal mortals.
There is a problem that critics of this idea often point to: there is no tangible reaction!
The hands feel nothing at all!
What answers does your group want to give to this objection?
- In my lectures I often speak of the fact that the expanded reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth breakthrough could well be the integration of tactile perception.
An interesting method is currently using the second hand as a somewhat unusual projection pad.
She perceives pressure excellently!
But there are also technologies that are actually geared towards giving the "pictures in the air" something manual, for example, the interference of some directed ultrasonic rays at a certain point where the finger is, creates a feeling that is at the moment still as weak as someone bloated over the palms.
There are also bands for the wrist that affect the nerve endings in the fingers, also that is a potential direction.
- Have you tried to outwit the brain?
Let it think that it feels what it should feel if it just sees something?
- This is a good idea, so we have not tried yet.
Here lies another task, with which we will have to fight for a long time, namely to let a person physically in a closed room believe, he is instead in an open, practically infinite space; here we work on concepts with treadmills (other than in fitness studios), mobile platforms as well as large balls.
So far, the brain can only be moderately overlittered, and there are still many busy years ahead of us.
This is precisely what makes the work in the field of virtual reality so attractive for a researcher: on many topics, we are only at the beginning.
Own taste instead of culture - rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt continues the "St. Petersburg avant-garde" project, dedicated to the inhabitants of the city who form the avant-garde of art and culture.
On the selected list, high-ranking representatives of the Petersburg art scene have already landed, whose successes go beyond the borders of the city and who often find recognition in Europe without being known in the rest of Russia.
The new hero of Rosbalt is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city is known by Kirill Miller, the bearded dressed in red, which can be seen at the Russian Museum, at the summer garden, at the scene of meetings or at vernissages.
Wherever Kirill Miller ’ s paintings are exhibited, they attract large crowds of people.
Kirill Miller is one of the typical St. Petersburg social philosophical artists who create new myths.
Kirill Miller is a luminous personality of the St. Petersburg avant-garde at the end of the 80s or the beginning of the 90s.
He is also a man of the city and conjures up a smile in the face of his fellow citizens through his presence on the street and provides them with a good mood.
Recently he grabbed a rotary organ and became the St. Petersburg rotary organ player, as he finally felt ready for this difficult role with regard to his artistic existence, his philosophy and his image.
- Kirill, why are you always in red and not, for example, in yellow or turquoise in the city?
I chose the color red as a fashion designer, which deals with the look and the image.
In this world, red is the compromise between artist, image consultant and society.
In society, everything that deviates from the Graunorm evokes aggression and bad behavior.
But I want to talk to people through my provocations.
Each of my past provocations was an invitation to talk.
- When did you know you had to become a painter?
- At an exhibition in the Palace of Culture Nevsky where my works were exhibited.
I understood that I had to go this way.
Then the time of the old free but not officially recognized painters came to an end, and new and free painters like me were incomprehensible.
I became friends with the painters of the new generation, that is, with the representatives of the "Gazonevshina"; from this came "Pushkinskaya 10", and then the end was first.
It draws me to the theatre, to fashion, to music, actually to everything, except literature.
- And all this united in your kind of clinic... - It was important to me to be at the center of St. Petersburg culture, where the best artists were to gather.
In 1995 I occupied a room in Pushkinskaya 10, and there until the renovation work there was a musically artistic club for the Bohemians, the house of St. Petersburg Bohemians.
Many were born there: N.O.M., Tequilajazzz, and I also remember how Schnur came there with his project "Ucho Van Goga".
Cord and his friends sang simple songs for the play, wore tight jerseys and among them belonged also the today announced composer Igor Wdowin.
When the group began to play live, it became "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg moderated many programs before the time of "Halli and Galli".
We gave them Trachtenberg, and it began his great career, but he learned the basics with us.
Also the gallery "D 137" or the club "Griboedov" have their origins in the art clinic.
Our staff and regular guests went there.
I am a hero of the past century, when culture meant something else.
In 2000 there was a survey in the press about the award "Personalities of our City".
I won in the category "Artist of the Year", and so I was at the climax.
It is not easy to work in new times according to old rules; I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
Today it is easy to become famous, but culture and popularity are not the same: you can be famous without making a cultural contribution.
- Your work has an unmistakable style.
- Many of my pictures are real pearls and clearly express the topicality and sharpness of thoughts.
I will have an exhibition with the theme "The Russian Museum as Clowns".
Clowns are timeless.
I used to be social, but now it hurts and is afraid to be like that.
In a clown everything blurs and loses its tragedy.
I love the grotesque, and I have grotesque ideas.
Let us save the world, for example, by prescribing that everyone has to dress up completely.
Now everyone pays attention to the clothes and orients himself to the outside and not to the inside of the human being.
But perhaps you should not give a man your hand, but spit on his face.
The deception disappears through disguise.
- Recently we saw you in the role of the urban playwright. - A cultural city should have such a hero.
Who if not I?
- Can commercial art also be beautiful?
- Nowadays commercial art must be careful, considerate and flattering.
We see the decay of cultures.
Previously, people formed large groups: the Bohemians loved the one and the simple people loved the other.
Now there are micro-communities and it is difficult to please everyone.
I am not a hundred dollar note that everyone likes.
Now you have to think about who you will like.
Now every cult star has about 100 followers.
- To the performances of Stas Mikhailov come several thousand!
- To him come abandoned women, there plays a role in the sexually deserted social sphere.
For cultural reasons there are 300 people and not 10 thousand, so there is less management, money, and everything goes down.
I have followers, and the most important thing is not to deceive them and not to destroy what has been achieved.
In my youth I painted such paintings, which hung at a collector even in a row with the works of Falk and Larionov.
I started with pictures that normally only come at the end of my career.
Nowadays there are often misunderstandings.
It means: spiritual culture and consumer culture.
Consumption has no culture at all, that is something completely different.
I am a person of past culture and grew up with artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty and refused money to paint.
That is the culture I support.
- Kirill, what is missing Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
They say: servants of culture.
But not every one of them can deal with culture.
With the real tsars, it was different, because the tsars perhaps did not understand much about culture, but they understood that proper experts are necessary.
There are currently good consultants in Moscow.
In Petersburg, we have those who could be experts, but they are being blocked because it requires more senior experts who properly assess the first and clear the way for them.
Now only your own taste counts.
The same applies to the Erarta, but with the difference that they honestly say that they do not accept all contemporary art and therefore some painters have to look for other museums.
- What is Petersburg for you?
- Petersburg is not the Capital of Culture; in Moscow there is much more culture and a corresponding breeding ground.
Art can hardly grow on our stones.
We need a cultural breeding ground because, for example, we now have more writers than readers, and that is not right.
There are many curious people in Europe who visit exhibitions or concerts.
That is much less with us.
Art must be modern again, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project is financed by grants from the city of Saint Petersburg
Birth in space
Earth in danger.
Global warming or collision with killer asteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with strawberries on board are looking for a replacement planet.
In order to save humanity, the important question is how we can reproduce ourselves in weightlessness or on the replacement planet?
I do not think there are many choices.
In fact, there are only two real planets that we could at least hypothetically inhabit.
"Namely Mars and Venus," says the scientific assistant of the Astronomical Sternberg Institute Vladimir Surdin.
However, while the conditions on Mars are comparatively life-friendly, there is a temperature of 500 degrees on the surface of Venus.
Life would only be possible at high altitude or in the orbit of Venus, i.e. in space.
The researchers initially addressed the question of reproduction in space with regard to the flora.
Already half a century before, experiments with plants were carried out.
The fourth generation of peas bred in orbit did not differ in the slightest from earthly species.
It followed the breeding of insects, more precisely tiny fruit flies (Drosophila), in orbit.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent into space to explore how weightlessness affects the development of embryos.
It develops a normal chick.
But then the problem begins.
"The problem is that the chick must find support; it must be able to stand on his legs and start moving," explains Vladimir Sychev, head of the laboratory of the Institute for Medical Biological Problems RAN.
Without solid substrates the chicks surfaced wildly.
Ten hours later, the instincts of the newborn were completely blurred.
The chicks did not react to light and sounds.
Four days later they simply died.
"Twice we let chicks slip and then put it in, because it is simply impossible to work there with them," Vladimir Sychev notes on the failed experiment with chicks in space.
The last breeding cage with animals flew into orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in spring 2013.
However, only same-sex species will be found on the biosatellite "Bion".
There was an experiment with rats that were already fertilized into space.
In principle, nothing special was found.
"This was just with the biosatellites, but again it was only a single experiment, and the research must be continued," notes Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, the space rats got offspring.
The problem of reproduction directly in space has not yet been solved.
The task is difficult.
Animals that are torn out of their natural habitat simply cannot follow their reproductive instinct.
In contrast to animals, man could do that in principle.
The Homo sapiens is capable of abstract thinking and can create a similar emotional background.
Such experiments are not carried out from ethical considerations.
But women have been flying into space for 50 years.
There was the greatest risk at Tereshkova.
The most valuable that mankind possesses is the female organism.
Our seagull flew away, and no one on earth could have answered the following question: Does it survive space flight?
Will she be able to give birth to a child after this flight?
"After all, nobody answered this question," says space veteran Wachtang Watschnadse.
In June 1964, just one year after her space flight, the first female cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova, gave birth to a daughter.
The father of the child, Andriyan Nikolayev, was also cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second woman in space, Svetlana Savitskaya, who was orbit twice and even did work outside the space vehicle, gave birth to a son.
Nevertheless, a risk remains.
We only have very few cosmonauts, where everything went well after long flights and they got healthy offspring.
"The more, the more dangerous it is even on flights to the orbit," concludes cosmonaut Valery Polyakov, Hero of the Soviet Union and Hero of the Russian Federation.
Yet humanity must look for new ways in biotechnology, radiation protection, and the creation of artificial gravity.
The hydrolaboratory in the cosmonauts preparatory centre is a mandatory station during flight preparation.
Here in a suspended state the cosmonauts gain routine for the work in open space.
The water represents weightlessness.
Even if adults feel that water is pleasant, it is a foreign environment, but infants feel that water is a natural element.
It is as if the small Ichtyander bear witness to the fact that life on the land descended from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that a child is about 9 months in the mother ’ s stomach in the amniotic fluid, and that it can then become more easily accustomed to water.
In principle, this is logical, since from birth to first swimming only 2 weeks pass.
"This is too little time to forget," says baby swimming teacher Marina Aksenova.
Whereas weightlessness is a much more natural condition for a newborn child, the woman is not without gravity.
In the state of weightlessness, the abdominal and pelvic muscles reproduce enormously quickly and thus also the ability to squeeze out the child decreases.
Well, we bypass the pre-birth aid.
For example, the birth could also take place in a special chamber to squeeze out the child.
"But what happens then?" is the not insignificant question of Valery Polyakov.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without feeling the attraction of the earth, the organism cannot form the skeleton and muscles.
A newborn child cannot be put in an orbit like an adult for training.
He will simply lack what is of fundamental importance for his life.
"This experiment, which we carry out together, namely the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will lead to the birth of a disabled person, a completely unadapted person," says the head of the Bioethics Commission of the Institute for Medical Biological Problems RAN, Igor Pestow.
So far, the birth of children in space is mere theory.
At some point, however, it becomes a reality when the inhabitants of the Earth set out on a distant planet in their spaceships, which becomes the home for their offspring born in space.
NKU Chief: Control of the Black System Failed by Debt of Politics
In connection with public procurement, the Czech Republic has good supervisory bodies and adequate laws, but falls behind in their application.
In conversation for Aktuálně.cz, this is said by Miloslav Kala, Vice-President of the Highest Control Office (Nejvyšší kontrolní úřad, NKÚ).
"A law is never perfect, but it must be applied correctly - and I do not think that is the case with us," Kala comments on the current situation.
A similar result appears to be the result of joint control by Czech and German auditors.
As a negative example of practice, he leads Prime Minister Petr Nečas to the so-called "Black System".
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS would not harass entrepreneurs with controls - is the system now banned or allowed?
"A law must have its validity, and if something is forbidden by law, then the chairman of the government cannot simply come, and the control office, whose duty is now once the control of the observance of the law, in its activity hinder", notes Kala.
At the meeting of the Control Committee of the Chamber of Deputies you spoke about a common Czech German project in which the laws of both countries regarding public procurement were compared.
What was it about in concrete terms?
This is a parallel examination which we started about two years ago.
Simply put, it is a question of the European legislature defining how public procurement is to be handled, on which the national legislation is based, and finally, there is the actual practical application.
All of this we compared with each other, and although the examination has not yet been completed, we have found very interesting differences. Generally speaking, the laws are perhaps even more "strict and perfect", but the actual application in Germany is better in some parameters.
This confirms that it is not enough to establish new and more precise rules over and over again, and it is also necessary to deal with the actual application of the law.
To what extent can the project be a help to you? What results for you from this project?
Such joint control could help us to stop constantly striving for the perfection of laws and the reduction and balancing of thresholds, if this does not seem to have a particularly positive effect.
Profitability means buying a thing at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price) and excluding unlawful enrichment or even criminal acts.
But the reduction of threshold values for orders does not guarantee that we will achieve this goal.
Perhaps it is even the case that in this way we will only burden the system with excessive 'paperwork', and those looking for gaps in the system will have much easier to exploit than if the thresholds were higher.
You are talking about the problems with the practical implementation of the Czech procurement law.
How does the control system in Germany work?
Is there a similar authority here as our NKÚ, or does the system work differently?
As far as the authorities are concerned, the German counterpart to the NKÚ is the Federal Court of Auditors, which has a similar structure to that of us and also has a college, which is only formed slightly differently.
The competences are also comparable to a certain extent, but Germany is a federal state, i.e. there are also these audit institutions in the individual federal states - in this the German system differs from ours.
The BRH may only control federal funds, which corresponds to our state funds.
Public funds, which are administered by the districts and municipalities, are subject to the control of the state accounting institutions.
As far as German legislation is concerned, is it easier than ours?
In general, I would be reluctant to compare this without concrete indications. Nevertheless, in some respects, Germany is often referred to as a model, but it certainly cannot be said that Germany is better in everything.
Is that perhaps because the examiners there are better?
This is certainly not, but as I said: I do not particularly like comparisons of this kind.
It should also be noted that those countries which are an example for us also have problems to contend with.
Otherwise they would not have any cooperation with our authority, right?
As far as Czech legislation is concerned, what significance did the amendment of the procurement law have for your authority, do you already feel any effects?
In view of the fact that this amendment is only in force for a short time, it has not yet affected our tests.
As our controls take place retrospectively, we have to expect a certain delay here.
Until now, we have seen more effects in the preparatory phase of future controls - we have introduced the new control instrument "Detection of risks of inefficiency" and analysed and analysed with this almost 14,000 public procurement - here the changes will naturally have an impact, as the thresholds change, the conditions for certain types of tenders have been modified, etc.
Do you see the adoption of this law rather positive, or is the system burdened with further bureaucracy?
I think that this law is certainly a step in the right direction and I hope that this assumption will be confirmed.
However, the problem may arise that the rules become 'stricter' and can no longer be respected.
Already under the previous rules, persons undergoing an audit vis-à-vis the institution (for example, in the case of an operational programme of regional policy, the Regional Council) are accountable to the effect that any failure to comply with the procurement law constitutes a breach of budgetary discipline.
Is it then useful to make the law even more stringent?
I do not think that way.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse the system and not punish those who have committed a formal error that does not affect the actual decision-making process.
Such a system puts even greater pressure on bureaucracy.
Where is the way out here?
Let us first say which path is not effective.
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS would not affect entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called "black system" - what exactly does that mean?
Is the black system forbidden or allowed?
A law must be valid, and if something is prohibited by law, then the chairman of the government cannot simply come, and the control office, whose duty is to control compliance with the law, can hinder its activity.
He can say, "We change the law and allow the thing", but he can't say that we do as if nothing were.
The procurement law contains relatively strict rules on the formal execution of certain transactions - and that is also right for the protection of public competition.
On the other hand, it is also tragic if the bidder with the best offer is excluded solely because of defects in form.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly - and that is what I think we lack.
On the roads there is some ice cream, but mostly they are dry.
On the roads of the Czech Republic there is some snow and ice smoothness.
However, the roads are mostly well passable, sometimes increased caution is required.
Karlovy Vary
In the district of Karlovy Vary the roads were well passable this morning, sometimes there was snow and ice.
The temperatures decreased to -5 to -10 ° C, during the day it should become a little warmer.
In the region it is no longer snowing, and in the lower altitudes only a thin snow cover remains.
On the ridges of the Ore Mountains, however, there is about 30 cm of snow.
According to the District Road Guard there was limited visibility due to fog.
The R6 expressway and the first class roads in the region are currently fully accessible.
However, attention must be paid, for example, to bridges on which the roads are sometimes iced up and smooth.
All roads in the second and third categories, including mountain roads, are also passable.
On these roads, however, snow remains frozen or drifted out.
Particularly in the higher altitudes, therefore, increased attention is required.
Districts Pardubice and Hradec Králové
On some roads in eastern Bohemia there is danger because of ice smoothness, in higher locations and in the mountains there is sometimes an extended layer of snow on the roads, the road and motorway directorate communicates on their websites.
The road masters warn drivers of ice smoothness, which can occur especially in higher locations in the district of Pardubice.
Ice-ice smoothness can be achieved in particular on second and third class roads in the Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy and Vysoké Mýto districts.
The roads I / 43 and I / 34 at Svitavy are chemically treated.
Snow lies in particular on the roads in the Giant Mountains and in the mountains Orlické hory.
An extended layer of snow lies on the roads of the Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov districts.
Today it is mostly sunny or cheerful in eastern Bohemia, and it remains largely precipitation-free.
The temperatures are between -3 and + 1 ° C, a weak wind blows.
Pilsen District
The roads in the district of Pilsen are today well passable, but local attention is required, and the driving style has to be adapted to the weather.
This is frosty in the morning, with temperatures between 3 and 9 degrees below the freezing point.
As it snowed before and the temperatures subsequently fell, ice smoothness can occur on the roads.
Nebulae can also be expected on a local basis, but the visibility will improve during the course of the day.
This information comes from the district road masters.
The D5 motorway is practically unrestricted, however, the road masters recommend increased attention between the 80th and 131st kilometers.
The roads of the first class are mostly dry, but frozen.
In the south of the circles Pilsen and Tachov, however, ice smoothness can occur in sections.
The roads of the second and third class are damp, and therefore the reference to possible icy sections applies here as well.
Drivers should be particularly careful mainly on the less frequented roads in the Bohemian Forest area.
Olomouc Municipality
Today, drivers who are heading towards the altitudes in the Olomouc district have to count on snow patch.
After the use of spreaders, snow is kept on Červenohorské sedlo and on the road towards Videlský kříž.
The road masters were forced to use nocturnal snow. According to the street administration, about 3 cm of new snow fell in the Šumperk district.
In the other areas of the district the roads are mostly unrestricted.
"Snow remains in Šumperk County at the altitudes.
On the Červenohorské sedlo pass, drivers will have to expect snowflake in the direction of Jeseník, "said a member of the Šumperk road management team to ČTK.
Her colleagues in the Jeseník district also had to get out at night, according to her information, the roads are free and wet up to the altitudes after chemical treatment.
In the Olomouc district, the roads are fully passable, but in the Šternberk district, drivers have to drive cautiously in forest sections, as the roads are still damp.
District Ústí nad Labem, District Liberec
In northern Bohemia, road masters report several poorly passable sections of the road.
In addition to several places with snow or glazed ice, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice in the Ústí n.K. district is closed according to the traffic police.
Temperatures remain below zero even in lower locations, so that snow and ice will remain on the roads. However, no problems are reported from the lowlands, especially southeast of the Bohemian Central Mountains, and the roads are usually dry there.
No traffic disturbances have been reported so far.
Ice smoothness is reported in particular from the surroundings of Štětí.
According to meteorologists, there were ideal conditions during the night - during the day rain and melting snow, at night cloudless sky and frost.
Bad traffic conditions are reported from the main routes as well as from road I / 13 at the border of the districts Ústí n.L. and Liberec.
The road between Telnice and Knínice was closed due to branches pressed from the snow load to the road.
Šimon Ornest: At our concerts we want to collect positive energy
What do you think about the world going down in less than a month?
This is one of those disaster reports to which we people are so fond.
With our band The Tap Tap we ’ re more fun about it and say that we ’ re the only band in the world that can collect enough positive energy to stop or prevent world destruction.
In December you will also realize a unique project with three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you introduce the project to our readers?
It is a nationwide benefit event that we have been planning for two years.
For this we want to use the marketing potential of the Mayan calendar, the end of which is predicted for December 21 at 11: 10 in the morning.
On the day before, i.e. on December 20, three concerts will take place in Prague, Brno and Ostrava at the same time from 21: 00.
The end of the concerts is supposed to be about the time when the Mayan calendar ends on the Pacific island of Kiribati, which lies in a time zone around 12 hours before us.
From whom does this idea come?
Originally probably by me, then we designed the idea together with our graphic artist Honza Augusta.
Not only do we want to gather sufficient positive energy to prevent world destruction, but we also want to reflect together with the public on the state in which we hand this world over to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar, we have also developed a unique collection of shoes, T-shirts, bags and keychains against the downfall of the world, with which the people can also support us with their purchase via www.e-tap.cz.
The band The Tap Tap has also recorded the so-called anthem against the end of the world with the title "Weltuntergang fällt aus" together with other performers.
Even today, the hymn is very popular on YouTube. Will it also resound at the benefit concerts?
Of course, and at the very end, provided that everything works out and that the end of the world does not take place...
The hymn is to be sung simultaneously by all performers at all three concerts.
In addition, the hymns will be broadcast live together by Czech television.
The text of the anthem comes from Tomáš Hanák, who also plays the main character of Jesus in the video clip, Xindl X sings with...
How did you come to work with them?
We also cooperate with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, which is due to the fact that we realize many benefit events and concerts...
We strive to involve these people intensively in our projects.
It has been shown that most of us are interested in working with us and have fun.
What purpose does the proceeds of the concerts against the end of the world benefit from?
For the establishment of the barrier-free educational center Studeo, where we have been working together with the association Tap at the Jedlička institute for six years.
The students of the Jedlička institute are regularly supervised by lecturers who help them with various leisure activities.
Since the students themselves do not have the means to visit the lecturers, we would like to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the Jedlička Institute, a separate building is to be built, into which we then move with this project.
Several groups and performers perform at each concert.
What criteria did you choose them?
We wanted to put together a programme that appeals to all generations, including children.
For example, Chinaski, Support Lesbians, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý perform in Prague.
Further information can be found on the website www.kpks.cz.
Are similar "major events" planned for the future?
In May we will perform for the first time at the Prague Spring, and also for this concert we will prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year we would also like to perform in the Czech House in New York, and I personally - if we are already in the USA - would also like to combine this with performances in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not very small, so far you have already performed in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap, however, is a group composed of people with disabilities.
How do you manage these journeys logistically and organizationally?
It is not as bad as it seems at first sight.
Five of our members are wheelchair users, i.e. the wheelchairs must be transported in the luggage compartment. Furthermore, we have to carry many instrument cases and other luggage...
Nevertheless, so far it has always worked without problems, ČSA and British Airways were always very well prepared for us, that I have sometimes already wondered.
Even in Moscow, where we were recently, there were no problems.
By travelling abroad, you have a comparison of how accessibility in individual countries looks like, how people with disabilities can be treated there, etc.
How did you experience these things so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities where everything works better than with us, we have just witnessed in Russia that everything is still in its early stages in the East.
Opposite Prague, Moscow is absolutely not suitable for disabled people. There, it is still unusual if someone is travelling alone in the city centre by wheelchair.
It is not even self-evident that a wheelchair driver is allowed in the elevator, for example.
Fortunately, clubs are also emerging there trying to point out the problems of people with disabilities.
And in what respect must we catch up with the more developed countries?
There are still many things in which we hang behind...
It should be noted, however, that improving the situation always depends on the efforts of those affected.
In London and Madrid it is absolutely common for people with severe disabilities to move independently in the public space, go to the museum, use toilets, etc.
But it is not exactly customary that a larger group of disabled people take an active part in social events there, in which we are a little ahead of the West with the band The Tap Tap!
Respect for the public and accessibility is one thing, but only when important athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers come from our ranks will things really begin to change.
So far, these are only individual cases of particularly strong personalities.
The Tap Tap is currently very popular, but if we go back a few years, what motivated you to found a band in 1998?
At that time I started as a supervisor at the Jedlička institute, where I met many young people who were interested in dealing with something intensely.
And since I am a musician myself and play saxophone among others, I have founded a music group together with a colleague.
Well, and over time, as our moderator, Láďa Angelovič, used to say, it got out of control (laughs).
But the band became known only in the last years, or am I mistaken?
It is true that cooperation with well-known singers has helped us, and we have also begun to actively promote ourselves.
We have become aware that if one does something and this cannot be seen outwardly, one's own achievement does not exist in a certain sense.
Thanks to the EU funding, we can also afford good lecturers, high-quality equipment and so on.
Was it your goal to get it so far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I have felt the potential that things can be tackled differently.
In the show business today often one copies the other.
This is logical in its own way, as everything new is considered with caution and accepted only after a long time.
There are few really unique things, and I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression that the viewer usually has is of course compassion; this is only natural...
But this compassion is absolutely superfluous, because people with disabilities are not lonely and abandoned beings that we should regret.
They are people who can live and develop a full-fledged life, provided they have the necessary means to do so.
I always say that if people with disabilities succeed, this is not just progress for themselves, but for the whole of society.
Was it also helpful for this success that you are a strict boss, as you hear from many people?
If you want to do something good, you must not compromise on many things and also demand a certain discipline.
However, I believe that this is completely normal.
Some come to us with romantic conceptions, and when they find out that they have to rehearse twice a week, complete preparatory phases and spend a lot of time on concert tours, then the enthusiasm goes out quickly among many.
But this is how it works everywhere, in every band that wants to work seriously and achieve something.
Currently, The Tap Tap has twenty members.
How many of them were there from the beginning, i.e. since 1998?
Only one: Láďa Angelovič.
We are an open group. People come and go. That cannot be prevented.
Who has the will and the desire to participate, is always welcome with us.
Finds instead of the day before the predicted end of the world, Thursday the 20.12.2012 at 21: 00
Venues are: Incheba Arena / Prague, Fléda / Brno and Plynojem / Ostrava; 12 Czech bands and other musicians
All three venues are finally connected to each other via a live circuit and there is a common interpretation of the anthem "Weltuntergang fällt aus" of the band The Tap Tap.
The aim of the concert is to raise funds for the equipment of a multifunctional educational centre for disabled people, which is to be created under the name STUDEO at the Jedlička Institute in Prague. Cost point: CZK 25 million
Admission costs CZK 400, children up to 12 years free of charge, tickets are available in advance at Bohemiaticket.
Poland and Space.
Last week, Poland was accepted as the twentieth member of this space agency at a Council of Ministers meeting of the member states of the European Space Agency (ESA). Poland is thus the second member of the former Eastern Bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became a member of ESA on 12 November 2008).
Poland started a close cooperation with the ESA in 1994 and participated in several projects in the following years.
Poland ’ s journey into space began much earlier, of course.
Even before the Second World War, Polish cosmos enthusiasts were engaged in space travel, not always coming to understand it.
Here, for example, I recall the lecture given by A. Šternfeld in the Warsaw Observatory on 6 December 1933, in which the author presented thoughts from his pioneering work "Entrance to Cosmonautics".
However, the ideas of the young engineer (born in 1905) left the audience cold, and after years Šternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski had shown interest in his work.
Šternfeld won in 1934 for "Entrance to Cosmonautics" the Prix REP deer donated by Robert Esnault and André Louis Hirsch.
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became an important advocate of astronomy and space travel.
In Polish magazines he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski ’ s worldwide recognized contribution to the development of space travel has been appreciated, among other things, by the fact that one of the craters on the earth side of the moon was named after him.
Already in 1925 a railroad Draisine was built in Poland, for which a rocket engine was planned.
The author of the draft and the details of this project unfortunately remained unknown.
It is not even clear whether the rocket should be used for starting or braking the draisine.
The information on this is exclusively from the contemporary press.
In 1933, the Polish infantry began to deal with rocket powered bullets.
The research was conducted by the Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia Institute in cooperation with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi.
It is clear from the documents handed down that research had penetrated to the stage of practical testing.
The research was then interrupted by the invasion of the German Wehrmacht.
In 1937, the draft of a photoelectric hunting rocket by Ing. Rohoziński appeared in the trade press, and in the following year, the work "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" by the author Leliwa and Krzywoblocky appeared.
Both projects dealt with the military use of rocket propulsion.
Shortly before the war, all projects for military use of rocket technology were coordinated by the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Committee Doradczo and Naukowy).
The committee was established in 1937, but after two years of work, its work was terminated from the start of the war.
Further articles on space travel appeared after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Space Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne) in the Polish press.
The first mention of this company is made in 1954 in the November issue of the magazine Problemy, in which four extensive articles of space travel are devoted.
The article by Prof. M. Subotowicz contains the proposal to establish a space society.
At the time, there were already the first projects on satellite technology, and it was foreseeable that exploration of space would have a future.
As early as 1956, the Polish space company PTA made an effort to join the International Federation of Space Aerospace, which was founded in 1951, and in fact already became a full member in the autumn of 1956.
The following year, the first PTA president, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became Deputy Chairman of the International Federation for Space.
He held this office until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA has been instrumental in the development of the extremely successful meteorological missile (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish rocket for scientific research.
The first type, the RM1, was completed in 1957, the first start was on 10 October 1958.
The rocket with a maximum flight height of 1800 m was about 80 cm long and weighed not quite 5 kg.
Later an improved version, the RM 1A, was built, and in 1959 in the Błędów desert flight tests began with the two-stage rocket RM 2. more
The rocket was 1.4 m long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
A further stage of development should already be able to do real scientific work - the RM34 rocket should reach an altitude of up to 14.5 km and be used for the observation of height winds.
In 1962, however, the further development was discontinued.
Successor of the first rockets of type RM was the Meteor 1-missile developed in the years 1962 to 1965.
The rocket was designed as a two-stage rocket, its total length was 510 cm and the takeoff weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types of this rocket were developed (Meteor 1A, -1B and -1C), which differed from each other in the size of the transport space for scientific instruments.
The Meteor A1A rocket had a transport space of 0.4 litres capacity, Meteor A1B of 0.34 litres and Meteor A1C of 0.62 litres.
The maximum altitude of all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the meteor missile was developed in the aviation institute. The first flight tests began in October 1970.
It had a take-off weight of 380 kg and was able to transport a payload of 10 kg to a height of about 60 km.
Afterwards the versions Meteor and Meteor were built.
The accession of Poland to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960, followed two years later by the establishment of a national COSPAR committee, is also worth mentioning.
Poland also participated in space research with Soviet satellites as part of the Intercosmos programme, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became second intercosmonaut after the Czech Vladimír Remek.
The repeal of the law on non-profit work is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court repealed the law on non-profit work.
This decision provoked a lively public debate.
It is certainly interesting to look at the problem from a broader perspective.
The liberal economic systems in the EU and in the globalised world are based on the principle of unregulated economic competition.
In the end, this means that the individual economies are in a permanent conflict with each other.
This is due to the principle of free trade and the free, unrestricted movement of private capital, which goes hand in hand with unbridled financial speculation.
Due to the large differences in the value of labour (wages), there are price tensions.
This term refers to a state in which the manufacturer attempts to compete economically by importing favourable goods by "undercutting" the competition, thereby increasing its market share and increasing its profit.
On a large scale, this means for most companies to relocate their production abroad or to buy cheaply there, or to give up their business. The result is high unemployment in countries with comparably high labour costs.
Since private capital has no social responsibility and therefore no responsibility for the unemployment it causes, government expenditure necessarily increases.
This situation is exacerbated by the fact that the entrepreneurs are absolutely unwilling to pay their taxes, thereby replacing the overall economic and social damage they cause.
This situation is generally known, so that specific statistics are superfluous at this point.
The ruthless practice of private capital creates a situation in the individual economies in which governments are forced to compete to artificially reduce their own population ’ s social level and thus attract foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments deliver private capital to their own populations, regardless of the social consequences.
This is particularly true in amendments to existing laws.
The aim of these measures is to force their own people to accept the dictates of private capital, particularly in terms of wages.
This is done on the one hand by economic coercion with long-term unemployment, and on the other by curtailing workers' rights.
The result is increasing poverty, as well as increasing differences between rich and poor.
In Germany, there have been public food dispensaries for the poor for several years, which are no longer able to feed themselves through their own work.
The number of people affected is already in the millions.
In the course of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, there are regular cases in which workers receive such a low wage that the state must increase its income to the minimum of existence.
Such a scandal was also revealed in the case of auxiliary staff employed in the German Bundestag.
The austerity measures of virtually all the EU ’ s southern states will undoubtedly amount to the same condition in which people are forced to emigrate (as was the case in the nineteenth century) under the pressure of a catastrophic collapse of their social level, or for a wage of hunger on the margins of society, hoping that eventually private investment capital will flow into the country.
Here, of course, the question arises as to where this capital comes from?
When it comes from another EU country, only poverty emigrates from one country to another; or capital remains the same, because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco, Egypt, or Africa in general, workers work for a fraction of European wages.
This concerns the whole of Latin America.
Liberal theories and media claim, to the point of surprise, that the state must not participate with capital in its own economy, and that planned economy leads to economic catastrophe.
Private capital persists narrowly in its position that the state must not intervene steadfastly in the economy.
But then one has to ask oneself whether private capital does not influence or even guide politics and thus the entire state in its own selfish sense.
Here is the clear answer: yes.
The proof of this is the existence of a practically omnipotent and ubiquitous lobby in all states.
The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, of reciprocity, of legislation in which practically everything is criminal but nothing is punishable.
In Germany, the situation is such that a state ministry, for lack of finance, assigns private, closely intertwined legal entities to the industry to draw up draft laws.
These draft laws are subsequently adopted in the Bundestag.
All violence no longer comes from the people, as the Western constitutions proclaim, but from strong financial groups that prefer their own interests.
It seems that the liberal democracies are rapidly getting into a situation as Appian describes in his work on the crisis of the Roman Republic at the time of Caesar and Pompeius: "The state has been in disintegration for a long time, and the offices have been occupied with violence.
For bribes, by unlawful creeping up of advantages or with stone and sword.
The corruption grew unrestrained, and the people went to the election with already bought votes "..." People with character did not apply for offices, so that the state had no consul due to this decline for eight months "..." One really began to talk about the fact that the only medicine in this difficult situation is a monopoly, and that a strong man must be elected "... Appian thought of Pompeius, but the strong man was then finally Caesar, who replaced democracy permanently by the monopoly.
As it turns out, today ’ s society, as in antiquity, is founded on the reckless preference of one ’ s own advantage, without paying attention to the interests of society as a whole.
Private capital is not, by its very nature, able to recognize and enforce the advantage for society as a whole.
The result, today as then, is an unprecedented decadence of the elites who do not strive in the least for deeper reforms.
The cause of the rise of fascism and communism must therefore be sought in the ruthless liberalisation of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
From today ’ s point of view, the downfall of these regimes in favour of liberal democracies can be seen as a certain pause in which the next round is already emerging.
Particularly catastrophic is the fact that today ’ s elites are in complete ignorance of the possible future losses of hundreds of thousands of lives, of the humanitarian and social disasters that we are already witnessing, and of the crimes against humanity, as we know them from past and recent history.
The repeal of the law on non-profit work is not a solution here, at least not a permanent one.
Under pressure from global and European economic competition, the Czech Republic will be forced to continue looking for ways to push down the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The only solution is targeted political and social reforms that increase the state ’ s participation in the economy, increase citizens ’ influence on the government, and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society in favor of the state.
Israel: Labor of Chaos.
"... that nothing arises from violence, or could ever arise," Sting sings in the song Fragile, whose most important verse in the chorus is: "... lest we forget how fragile we are".
"If my sons did not want wars, there would be none," says the dying Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, in 1849.
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, there were, as always, a large number of reactions.
Some stand behind Israel and argue with its right to self-defense while they call the Palestinians terrorists; others, in turn, support the Palestinians, argue with the racism of the Israeli state, with the genocide committed against the Palestinian Arabs, and call the State of Israel terrorist.
At this point, I do not want to write about who is guilty and who is a victim in these ever recurring waves of killing; in the end, the present inhabitants of Israel, including the self-governing areas, were born into the current political situation and did not experience the beginning of the violence itself.
It is a matter of opening the reader ’ s eyes behind the scenes, looking at whom the 95 years of tension (calculated from the Balfour declaration in November 1917) in the small town of Land in the Middle East are above all useful.
My thoughts are partly based on accessible historical facts, others are derived from these and emerge from my own understanding of who or which group of people decisively influences the events of modern history.
The history of mankind is primarily a history of the struggle for power.
In each epoch we can make an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is less apparent is the question of whether it was really always these personalities who determined their steps autonomously, or whether behind their throne stood someone who directed their actions towards a predetermined goal.
We have to admit that we live in a time when the world ’ s wealth is concentrated in the hands of fewer individuals, and that this concentration of money and the power resulting from it has not arisen within the lifespan of a generation.
Among these astronomically rich families stands out one that could be called the head of the octopus (I do not know if there is still someone standing above them, but I do not exclude this) - the Rothschilds.
Much is not written about them.
Understandably.
The first press agency (Reuters) was bought by the Rothschilds in the nineties of the nineteenth century in order to prevent the connection of their name with highly criminal acts, in the background of which was always the consolidation of their power, the increase of their property or both.
The Rothschilds are involved in almost all of the world ’ s central banks, and against the countries where they are not involved in the central banks, they wage wars or prepare for them (before the attack on Afghanistan, there were 7 countries; after the attack on Iraq, there were 5 countries; after the overthrow of Ghaddafi, only four remained, with Russia in the meantime subordinating its central bank to the Russian government).
Whoever tried to oppose this family had to pay with life for it.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew Rothschild ’ s Bank of America ’ s status as a central bank. During the civil war, he began to issue his own (i.e. state) banknotes and was murdered in a theater in 1865.
J.F. Kennedy began to issue his own banknotes and wanted to abolish the FED - he was murdered in 1963; the deputy Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the FED for triggering the world economic crisis in 1929.
The global desire for power of the Rothschilds led in the years 1859 - 1871 to the formulation of a plan for the unleashing of three world wars by Albert Pik, a freemason of the 33rd and thus highest degree of knowledge.
The first war was aimed at eliminating the great monarchist statehood of Europe, the second war was aimed at breaking the colonial rule of Great Britain in particular, and the third war was aimed at reducing the world population to about 0.5 - 1 billion people (such a number would provide their conveniences and luxury and would not consume so many resources), creating a universal religion (ecumenism is here nothing more than the apron), and finally leading to the assumption of absolute power.
The method with which the group of the richest families with the Rothschilds works at the top is the triggering of a crisis and the subsequent offer of a solution (order from chao - order from chaos).
These solutions, however, are wrong and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see Foundation of the FED, so that crises such as those they caused do not repeat in 1907).
After they had succeeded in triggering the First World War through the murder of the Habsburg heir to the throne Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed the Russian empire by the revolution of the Bolsheviks.
The First World War ended with the sudden, militarily and economically unfounded capitulation of Germany (the war was no longer necessary for the destruction of the Russian Empire), followed by the dissolution of the Central European great power of Austria and Hungary.
In order to be able to ignite the Second World War more easily, the bankers allowed politics to create a latent conflict situation by occupying Germany with gigantic war reparations, thereby creating the prerequisite for impoverished masses, so that they only had to cheer on a sufficiently strong leader for the Germans, who named the guilty and offered simple solutions; another factor was the creation of the multiethnic state of Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, which was to assume the function of a fifth column and also took over to kindle the war fire.
At the end of the 19th century the Rothschilds initiated the founding of the Zionist movement, in which a branch sought to establish a Jewish state, possibly in the historical area of Judea with Jerusalem as capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour declaration already mentioned created the precondition for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine; there were first clashes with the resident Arab population.
Terrorist attacks have occurred on both sides.
The Second World War broke out, and whether Hitler broke away from the chain at which the international bankers had initially held him, or whether everything went according to plan, is difficult to estimate, in any case the suffering of the European Jews in the concentration camps created the prerequisite for the recognition of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was founded in 1948, and just as the war reparations against Germany prepared the ground for the Second World War, the proclamation of the State of Israel is the creation of the focal point for the Third World War.
If international bankers succeed in unleashing this war, the Jewish people will be the victim in the foremost line of struggle, this time together with the Arab or Muslim population of the Middle East, similar to that of World War II.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of conflict and chaos, not only in the country itself, but also internationally (just think of how sharply people divide themselves into adherents and opponents of Israel).
Who is the culprit, and who is the victim of the conflict between Palestinians and Israelites, where injustice only causes injustice in an endless spiral of violence, beginning with the greed of individuals and their pursuit of global power?
It is necessary to distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and their leaders, since the international bankers in Israel, as with us, the people, are voting exclusively for their own candidates.
The current prime minister of Israel, the hawk Netanyahu, is a typical example of a politician loyal to international bankers who is prone to fascism, doing everything possible to launch a war with Iran, which, in view of Iran ’ s membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), could rapidly escalate into a global conflict, and which could lead to a destruction of the world economy because of Iran ’ s control over the only two-mile wide Strait of Hormus, which accounts for 20% of world oil supplies.
In what light do the words of David Rockefeller from 1994 appear: "The only thing we need is an all-encompassing crisis, and people will welcome the new world order."
In their imagination, the new world order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the human population serves a small group of financial aristocrats.
A world in which every newborn child is implanted a chip at birth to subject this being to total control.
"And it shall be, that the small and the great, the rich and the poor, the free and the servants shall all give themselves a mark upon their right hand, or upon their forehead, that no man may buy or sell, except the mark, the name of the beast, or the number of his name.
Here is wisdom! He who has understanding, let him consider the number of the beast.
For there is a man's number, and his number is six hundred sixty-six. "
The movie Argo: When it's the worst, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a mob of demonstrating Islamist students occupied the US Embassy of Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
For their release, they called for the extradition of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who had fled to the US after the revolution, who for decades had preserved the patronage of his regime.
There was no positive way out of this situation for the American government - it could not afford to throw the Shah overboard, as this would have severely damaged the trust of its allies in other countries.
At the same time, it was unable to enforce the release of hostages in Iran, where the revolution led to the establishment of a theocratic regime.
It was a serious blow to the reputation of the united states, and the subsequent fiasco in the violent attempt to liberate hostages made everything even worse.
The diplomats captured were finally released after 444 days after negotiations had been mediated by the Algerian government.
The fate of hostages caused a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiment at home.
The Iran debacle contributed significantly to Jimmy Carter ’ s defeat against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film Argo by the director and actor Ben Affleck describes an episode of this story that gave the USA a small partial victory.
Immediately before the occupation of the embassy, six embassy staff managed to escape.
This ended after numerous complications in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
The CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities, managed to bring the refugees from Iran, helping them to cover up their true identity with an extravagant story - they traveled camouflaged with Canadian passports as members of a film staff who allegedly visited locations for a science fiction film in the country.
Combination of genres
The plan developed by Tony Mendez, the expert on "Exfiltration", also required Hollywood cooperation.
To make the camouflage credible, articles about this film project appeared in specialist magazines, press conferences were held, and the fictitious production company had a real office.
The details of this operation were kept secret for a long time and the film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Afflecks Film is a special combination of several film genres.
On the one hand he is a realistic political thriller, but at the same time also a so-called "Caper Movie", i.e. the story of a successful hussar piece such as the film Ocean's Eleven.
As a result, the mood levels in the film alternate - on the one hand, the documentary scenes from Tehran (iconic contemporary photographs are shown in the title sequence, and there are no major differences in the film version of the same situations).
On the other hand the loose passages from Hollywood, which come ironic and slightly exaggerated.
And then there are scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions - men in suits at the meeting table, on the official corridors, on the phone...
Ben Affleck succeeded with this film a remarkable restart of his career.
A smiled actor has become a respectable director, and as an actor he is no longer the goal of ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film after the thriller Kein Kinderspiel (Gone Baby Gone, 2007) and the thriller Stadt ohne Gnade (2010).
At the same time it is Affleck's first film, which does not play in the director's home Boston.
The feeling for the atmosphere of the place belonged thereby to the characteristics, which the previous films of this director distinguished from the standard Hollywood.
Affleck also proves this feeling in Argo, where Tehran is "played" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film play in the streets and show the reconstruction of events that really took place - the input sequence of the storming of the message is very impressive in its clarity, yet conveying the feeling of confusion and unpredictability that occurs when the story moves somewhere.
Affleck and his team have a similar effect on fictional scenes (the wrong film wand on a bazaar in Tehran).
Too much action in too many places
The director also had to deal with the fact that the story actually does not offer many exciting scenes in the cinematic sense.
With the few, however, he works quite successfully, sometimes helping the reality something - which then does not always look so elegant (the scenes, in which the imminent crisis at the airport in Tehran is averted by a telephone call in America, or even the chase on the runway, seem somewhat artificial).
The weakness of Argo is its too wide dispersion, which is conditioned by the need to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in their roles as Hollywood co-workers, but their characters deserve more space, and thus they are far from alone in the film.
Affleck ’ s film thus loses some traction. It ’ s a film that can be followed with a certain interest, while gouting the design and the style of a 70-year-old thriller.
However, he hardly arouses enthusiasm.
However, as a reminder of a somewhat lively piece of history to this day, and as a proof of how exaggerated the ideas of the almighty and omniscient secret services are, it is sufficient.
Guidelines for inflating balloons, bananas and circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which annually launches a survey on the most absurd bank charges, has decided this year to host the competition "Most absurd regulation or idea from the EU's workshop".
"This was the idea behind the recent EU plan to introduce 40% of women in the management of large European companies," said Patrik Nacher, who is responsible for organising this survey, to the newspaper Právo.
Among the nominated absurdities, for example, is the ruling of the European Court of Justice on the standardisation of insurance tariffs for men and women.
Until then, women enjoyed an advantage in life insurance because they are objectively lower risk for insurance companies.
"Other incredible ideas from the EU's workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.
The actual vote will then take place until the end of February 2013 ", Nacher informed.
The controversial EU Regulations include, among other things, the mandatory addition of bioethanol to fuels, which is consequently harmful to nature, and the prohibition of reliable mercury thermometers, just because they contain a relatively small amount of this hazardous substance, or the directive on the size of chicken cages, which made eggs much more expensive this year.
Criticism in the past also harvested the de facto prohibition of the use of the term "butter spread" or also the prohibition of selling conventional light bulbs.
Bananas must be 14 cm long
The EU's apparatus often decides under pressure from this or that lobby of trade and industry, whose demands are usually represented in Brussels by one or more member countries (for example, the Czech Republic is currently trying to impose the demands of Czech banks with veto threats).
Lobby interests were also behind the fact that bananas of the highest trade class in the EU must be at least 14 cm long and must not have a "curvature anomaly".
The European Commission defended itself with the argument that it was merely harmonising the inconsistent national standards that would hinder trade.
EU standards on fruit and vegetables have already been softened against the resistance of some countries by pointing out that the previous directives would lead to food waste.
A candidate for victory in this survey may be the EU Regulation last year, which, in accordance with balloons, must be provided with the indication that children under eight years of age are not allowed to inflate the balloon without the supervision of an adult.
The EU referred to an American study that, according to balloons, is the leading cause of child suffocation.
A similar restriction already applies to children up to 14 years of age when using fair flows.
There are also curious ideas at home
It is also relatively absurd to have a directive that concerns European officials themselves - anyone who has an official function in the EU must not use the name of Macedonia because of the sensitivity of the issue for Greece and must instead say FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
In cooperation with the association of liberal economists Laissez Faire, the Bankovnípoplatky.com server nominated not only the above-mentioned absurdities but also the EU Regulation on the scope of food supplies in a Member State.
The EU thus set the maximum volume of food stocks on the day of our accession to the EU in the Czech Republic.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the fixed volume for canned mushrooms, for which we were threatened with a high fine.
The organizers of the survey were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive money for not having a sea, or by the idea of giving subsidies for applications for funding.
These ideas did not come from Brussels, but from Prague.
"We are disadvantaged by not having a sea.
We will apply for a refund from the EU ", said the then Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) in autumn 2004.
He argued that the grain harvest was very high and that the state camps were overcrowded as a result of the so-called intervention purchases.
As the Czech Republic has another way to sea ports, Palas believes that the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
The European Commission finally met with the Czech Republic to organise a tender for the purchase of cereals from countries that do not have access to the sea.
Funding for applications for funding was offered to the municipalities by the Ministry of Regional Development under the direction of Minister Pavel Němec (US Federal Republic of Germany), which was specifically intended to provide funding for the establishment of funding applications to Brussels.
EU: Bizarre Regulations are the exception
Regulations in the Member States, although they are easy to target criticism, the EU's efforts to regulate, and hence the effectiveness and development of the European Union as a whole, are, in some experts' opinion, more worthy of recognition.
According to these experts, a more serious problem is the EU funding for projects that have nothing at all in common with the deepening of European integration, but which have been forced by individual Member States in the budget negotiations.
Emotions in this country also evokes the fact that the Czech Republic, like other Member States in Brussels, has to fight for the right to use specific designations of traditional products and does not always win this fight.
After a six-year fight with Germany and Austria, the Czech Republic was able to defend the name "Olomoucké tvarůžky", the national rum (Tuzemský rum), whose tradition dates back to the 19th century, but our manufacturers had to rename it "Tuzemák".
The name rum may only be used for products from sugar cane distillate, not for products from sugar beet.
In the official list of products registered in the EU, the company of world-famous cheeses Feta and Gorgonzola, Lübeck marzipan or Parma ham now also includes Karlovy Vary rusks, carp from Pohořelice and Třeboň, or the hops of Saaz.
The Pardubice gingerbread or the Hořice rolls can breed with an EU brand.
"People want me to save the republic, but I'm just an amateur," Okamura claims.
Mr Senator, how do you get the idea of running for the office of President?
I do not want to be a senator or president.
If everything worked without problems in our country, I would not run anywhere.
But I can no longer see how the republic has been plundered for 20 years, how thieves are running around freely, while people are increasing taxes and retirement age.
I had no ambitions to become a politician.
But if I see something that I do not like, I try to propose a solution to change that.
And since I am already over 40, independent and non-partisan, I have no other way to influence things than to run for the office of a senator or president.
In the Senate you made it and then immediately made your way to the castle.
Don ’ t you turn your backs on your voters?
I told myself all the time that I will take up the battle for the castle after the result of the Senate elections.
Later, I clarified this and said that I would stand for the office of President if I was elected Senator.
But my goal is not the function. The function is an instrument with which I can realize my visions.
For this I need as much influence as possible and a strong mandate.
The difficulty, however, is not only that we, as a people, are scolding in the pub and in front of the TV, but we are destroying anyone who wants to change something.
In addition, the media, who want to rob you of the honour, and who confuse the freedom of the word with the freedom to lie.
For example, I was told that I would bribe journalists or that I was a consultant to Jiří Paroubek.
Let us talk about your visions.
You have taken up the fight for the castle with the thesis of the material and criminal liability of politicians as well as with retroactive declarations of assets of more than 20 million crowns.
To do so, you need to change laws.
As President, you have no competences in this respect, and only the Senate as a whole can bring forward legislative proposals.
How do you want to solve this problem?
As a simple citizen, I have worked to ensure that the travel guide remains a free trade, and this has been enforced.
The problem is the petty intellectual policy - if someone comes from the right or the left with a good proposal, it is deliberately rejected, and that only stops the population.
As an independent party loser, I have much greater potential to gain support from all parties represented in Parliament.
My advantage is that I can take from every party what is best for our country without drawer thinking and party dogmas.
Do you see yourself as a human being in politics rather right or left?
From the Czech point of view, it seems to me that people see me more on the left.
For me, however, this right is totally unimportant.
For me, it is important that we move forward.
It is not a matter of whether someone belongs to the left or right camp; I want to connect people.
I always publicly support any good solution approach, even if it comes from KSČM or ODS, and I will also oppose bad ideas.
You dislike someone who calls you populists.
But do you not confirm what you have just said?
If you set up a business plan in a company, then you also have an ideal goal and a vision.
And you want to approach this one.
I can call this populism, but all the proposals I have mentioned already work in the world, or they have been discussed by important experts.
However, without any support in Parliament, you will only have keywords.
And that means that you will not get far in the long term in politics.
Or do you think that if you only talk to people for a long time enough, you will succeed, for example, in enforcing material and criminal liability?
I have no other option.
To convince politicians, journalists and the public and to try to bring them to our side in order to achieve these goals.
As President, it would not be a problem for me to call on the chairmen of the parliamentary parties live on television to enshrine the material and criminal liability for politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors by law.
And those mentioned would then have to say why they reject this.
A strong personality who points to grievances can exert pressure on the political scene.
Take only once the direct election of the president, which was a merit of public pressure.
I say quite clearly that I am an amateur; I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.
I try to find allies for my views and visions.
I have just started with politics and I am trying to find the support of the majority for my programme.
I always try to judge things myself; and if it does not work, I will go back to the private sector in six years.
That sounds a little as if Okamura should save the Czech Republic.
I am not a Saviour.
I know that I do not achieve anything on my own; that is why I have talked to several well-known personalities about whether they also want to stand for the Senate.
I spoke to Radim Jančura, for example, but he refused because of overload.
I also supported investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, who exposed fraud in the trade in light fuel oil.
I started my candidacy with the condition that people are deeply dissatisfied, but now I am no longer sure.
Sixty percent of those entitled to vote did not go to the elections at all, and those who went have mostly elected representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate we are only two independent.
People have chosen such a Senate composition that changes will be very difficult to enforce.
Nevertheless I will fight for my visions, e.g. for the direct election of the mayors and district heads.
Do you think about founding your own party?
I have not thought about this yet, because I have no time to review the past of any potential party member, nor do I have the money for it.
I do not even have money for the Presidency campaign; my transparent account only includes CZK 20,000.
You have no money?
You speak of wealth declarations, what would your look like?
I estimate my private assets to be about CZK 60 million.
In Prague I have a plot with a value of 25 million, an apartment for about 10 million, another for 8 million, an art collection worth about 10 million, as well as an Aston Martin for 3.5 million and a Škodu Superb, which is worth about one million. And then I have a few million in my account.
The Aston Martin was by the way a child's dream - James Bond always liked me how he drove in the car, was galant to women and at the same time fought against evil.
You drive an Aston Martin, have a fortune of 60 million and have no money for your campaign?
You say that you want to change the republic, but you do not want to invest your own money in it.
That is not exactly convincing.
I do not have 15 million for the campaign.
Should I make debts?
I have already put 2.5 million into the campaign.
The fact that I do not have sponsors shows that my program does not arouse too much interest.
And I am not obliged to contest the campaign from my own resources.
The cost of the campaign is basically covered by my salary as a senator.
But I could not live from the senatorial salary alone; for example, I could not finance my son's English school, which costs 30,000 per month.
If I just wanted to make money, I would run for nothing.
So do you continue to work as an entrepreneur in order to have your income?
Did you not say that you will return these activities?
But that is not related to the height of the salary.
As promised, I partially reduced my activities.
For example, my deputy becomes managing director of the travel agency in spring.
People want to see me as a Samaritan who saves the republic.
But I also have to live on something.
What monthly income were you used to as an entrepreneur?
Approximately 200,000 to 400,000, and that is still the case.
As President, I would, however, completely discontinue my activities.
You can find the full conversation in the Saturday edition of Právo.
The MVRDV architects prove that the real adventures are not only in the head - using the example of Spijkenisse and the recently built Bücherberg - 2 photos
"I find the building funny, it looks futuristic, and finally there is something interesting to see again," says Lisette Verhaig, a passer-by at the roadside.
And Stefan Spermon, IT technician in a nearby large-scale business, says: "But, it's beautiful, the house."
But I wonder why we still need a library today.
All have Internet, iPad, and eBooks.
No one goes today voluntarily into one of these old style libraries, right?
Spijkenisse, a sleeping town in need of a visit just outside Rotterdam, is a strange record holder.
The 80,000 inhabitants of the municipality have the lowest rate of education in the Netherlands.
In order to counter this stupid circumstance, a few years ago they decided to contribute to general education and to rebuild the seven fictitious bridges depicted on the euro banknotes as nicely brushed reinforced concrete miniatures.
The success of the education offensive was limited.
And so the city fathers realized that there was only one way to master statistics: a library must come!
Winy Maas of the Rotterdam architectural office MVRDV, master of the daring bar diagrams and producer of funny, indeed often cynical buildings, took the matter with his usual serenity and appeared in 2003 to the competition for Hearing with five books under his arm and a grin in his face.
And while the jury looked around and shrugged, the cheeky Meuse stacked his exquisite souvenir of greatness to a pyramid and ended his actionistically supported speech with the words: "Dear municipality!"
So that is my proposal for the book mountain of Spijkenisse, for the so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the 30 million euro mountain has been buried.
It is part of a revitalization project, which also includes underground parking, supermarket, post office and a few adjacent residential and terraced houses with a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November the Bücherberg was awarded the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
The project is also nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
This means that the faceless small town gate, which up to now had no more to offer than a post-modern pedestrian zone and an astonishingly ugly town hall, behind whose white facades one would be inclined to suspect a dairy factory to enrich a piece of contemporary architecture.
Above all, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in the history of its existence.
The long way to the book
The first impression: book dorado under cheese bell.
There is indeed a lift that leads through the middle of the mountain massif, but the true spatial and reading pleasures open up when the topography is pedestrian.
The all-round glazed interior is bright and clear, the burnt clinker floor and the elegant street lamps speak the language of a public city square unmistakably.
The urban ambience is perfect.
You are already looking for park bench, dog and football playing boys and girls.
And everywhere books, books, books.
"Normally the bookshelves stand along the facade, and in the middle there is a large, dark room, which is usually uncomfortable and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
We have turned the classic room configuration upside down and put the reading area from the inside out.
The interior of the Bücherberg is cleverly used: in the middle are offices, Internet library, chess club, environmental center and building technology center.
A special joy are the black bookshelves, which are wall cladding, parapet, stainless steel railings.
Optics, feel and smell are foreign.
Even die-hard architects and civil engineers shake the head of the unknown building material.
"We wanted to work with recycling materials here," explains Joop Trouborst, project manager at the municipality of Spijkenisse, on request of the standard.
And so one day we encountered a suitable waste product from agriculture in a Frisian farm.
For many years, a millimetre thin plastic fleece has been used in greenhouses and on fields in the Netherlands as a root underlay.
This is cheap and time efficient.
The thin textile holds one, two seasons, then it is ripe for the bulky waste.
For the library, the fleece was pressed to four centimetres thick plates for the first time in these quantities.
Under heat and pressure, the so-called Landbouwplastic (KLP) turns into a dark, homogeneous, resilient material that smells a bit of new cars and a bit of sports shoes.
After 105 steps you reach the summit.
At the end of the almost 500 metres long hiking tour, the Literaturcafé not only offers a fantastic view of the city, but also rewards you with Dutch croquettes and potted fish trees.
They provide an atmosphere, but above all the right humidity in the literary mountains.
Donations for the new soul
"One would not believe it, but this house is despite the many glass surfaces a flagship project in terms of ecology," says Trouborst.
Heated and cooled with geothermal heat.
Although the Bücherberg stands under a glass lintel, even on sunny days the sun shines only briefly into the interior.
The wide wooden glue binders, which stand across the glass façade, serve as shading and capture most of the solar radiation.
The room climate is very pleasant.
The rest is done with fully automatic blinds.
Stefan Spermon, the initial skeptic from the IT industry, has already ventured into the new library.
Also Lisette Verhaig was already there.
And also the TCM teacher Cynthia Bogarde, who calls the Boekenberg even Spijkenisses "long overdue soul".
The reason: For the opening a few weeks ago every inhabitant was invited to donate a book from his personal stock.
This is intended to fill the optical gaps in the not yet fully equipped library - currently 70,000 pieces.
The concept has emerged.
The shelves are filled up to the top.
"Nothing is worse than a half-empty library," says architect Winy Maas.
"I think, thanks to our invitation, every inhabitant now has a certain relationship with this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
And if it is only to the ornament.
Thus MVRDV succeeded in the supreme discipline, which is called in the jargon of identity foundation.
Spijkenisse has written literary history.
As young and uneducated as it may be.
This is finally a starting point for identity.
Szabo: "Germans must play a bigger role"
Germany abstained from voting on the admission of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on US and European relations, Berlin is thus balancing on a narrow diplomatic level.
Deutsche Welle: Earlier this week, Germany had initially signaled that it would vote against the request for Palestinian observer status at the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
Now, however, Germany must be cautious about its special relationship with Israel.
At the same time, however, I do not believe that it supports the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - but without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained on setting up a no-fly zone.
This was finally enforced by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on important international issues?
Yes, that is true.
This is because it is changing its foreign policy, away from a policy managed by the US, so to speak, towards a German foreign policy.
It is aggravating that Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform policy.
So the Germans find themselves between the fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not accustomed to that.
I believe they still touch on their role, but they are on the way to a more 'normal' foreign policy.
A foreign policy, as they have France or Britain.
What does a "normal" foreign policy mean from a German point of view?
It shows a willingness to take positions in national interests that are independent of those of the US or European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, that is, exports and relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany ’ s economic interests are to a certain extent different to those of the other major powers and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Did these economic interests influence the attitude in the Middle East conflict and the UN vote?
On the one hand, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf states.
It must therefore be careful not to upset the public, but also the elites, in the Arab countries.
That certainly plays a role.
But I would not want to attach too much weight to this either, that is not a completely one-sided relationship.
But it certainly plays an important role in German considerations.
Has Germany damaged its relations with the US by abstaining on important decisions, such as the vote on Palestine?
I believe that there is great understanding of the German position in Europe and even in the USA.
That is why I do not believe that this was such a dramatic break as on the Libyan question.
Perhaps Germany will even gain some respect with it.
Because it signals that it is taken seriously as an international player and that its interests must be considered.
There are different opinions in Europe on the Palestinian initiative.
The US, on the other hand, has made clear its support for a veto.
Are there any differences of opinion between the US and many European nations?
Due to American domestic policy, these differences have always existed.
I believe that the Obama administration has quite a secret understanding of the European position.
But due to the political situation here, the government cannot, of course, publicly support this position.
I believe that the real differences of opinion are not as great as they always seem.
If you look at Obama ’ s relations with Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama is not so brightly enthusiastic about Netanyahu ’ s policies.
Is it difficult for Germany to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the US on the one hand and the position of the most important partners in the EU on the other?
I think that is exactly what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
It would, of course, be a little easier for Germans if there were a coherent and uniform European policy, which is not the case at present.
So they cannot be part of a broader line and must instead push things out of their own position.
That is what they are doing with the euro.
I believe that in future, Germany will play a leading role in pushing Europe to a European position.
Of course, this is not easy for Germany, already because of the relationship with Israel.
This has always been a sensitive issue.
But I believe that it is clear to the Germans that they must play a more independent role.
Does Germany see itself as an important international player - does Germany want to play a leading role at all?
Or does Germany still find leadership difficult?
Germany is not yet accustomed to it, it is still unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult for the country to play a larger role.
For example, when we look at the euro crisis, every time Germany assumes a greater role, various anti-German feelings become free.
This does not make it easy for the Germans.
This is actually the old problem: you do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
In this sense, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the US.
It must be susceptible to various neighbors and opinions, and that is not easy.
Now the influence of the US in European politics is steadily decreasing, but the EU is not filling this vacuum at the moment, who else remains?
The Germans will simply have to play a greater role.
Even if they don't like it, it is unpleasant to them and makes them even more unpopular - c'est la vie!

"Brand Protection" in China: When Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani is a world-famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren likewise.
But what is Armani Polo?
Behind it lies a name officially registered in China, which has nothing to do with the original companies.
Nevertheless, it enjoys protection as long as the real namesake does not complain.
And even then it is not clear whether they are right.
"It is becoming more and more difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing, a law firm specialising in infringement of industrial property rights in the Far East.
Every week a new case ends up on my desk.
The imitators already have a few additional letters so that they can register their trademarks.
So Gucci becomes simply Lu and Gucci, instead of Prada one lets enter Prada and Kny.
German companies are also legally copied in this way, such as the sports goods manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens a folder with entries of the Trademark Office in Beijing.
On 14 September 2010, a Chinese company had the trademark Zegna DF Puma protected there, an art name that was also used by the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
It is well known that the Chinese are world champions in copying and infringing intellectual property.
In the big cities there are multi-storey department stores that sell almost exclusively counterfeits.
But Pattloch ’ s cases are different: on behalf of his clients, he claims that Chinese companies are officially given the right by the Trademark Office to use a designation that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call this "Bang Mingpai", a passenger brand.
The word is based on "Bang Dakuan".
This means women fishing for rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any fault
"This is harmful to business, you have to fight it," demands Pattloch.
"The brand is watered down, the unique position disappears, the image is enormous."
The financial failures and the process costs of the industries concerned go to the millions, especially with expensive flagship products.
According to the market research company CLSA, China is the third largest market for luxury goods with a volume of 15 billion euros a year and the fastest growing.
But deletions of dubious entries in the trademark register are difficult to reach and go into the money.
The procedure can last up to nine years, with uncertain results.
Pattloch reports cases in which the court dismissed lawsuits because after the long period of time the objected name had become "market reality".
If the plaintiff had bad luck, he even had to pay the plagiarist money because he violated his mark in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes the law of the jungle reigns here.
Famous cases also concern graphic elements.
In 2009 Daimler lost a dispute with the construction machinery manufacturer Sany, the company that recently took over the German concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
The Chinese can therefore still use an emblem similar to the Mercedes star.
The Volvo buyer Geely originally used a blue and white logo reminiscent of BMW; the dispute was settled, Geely had to change it.
The fashion manufacturer Lacoste lost in China against imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore, who let the famous crocodile look in the other direction.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any fault.
The CTMO Trademark Office in Beijing admits that there were bottlenecks there in 2010 due to too little personnel and room equipment.
Last year, however, one had returned from the "emergency situation in the workflow to normality".
Thus the existence of unprocessed opposition proceedings had fallen by 22 percent.
Almost 57,000 such cases have been completed, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
Nevertheless, 81,500 objections are still awaiting completion in the Office.
To tackle this costs a lot
As so often in China, the figures are impressive.
Last year, CTMO received more than 1.4 million applications for trademark protection, almost a third more than in 2010.
This is a record and means that for the tenth time in a row China is leading the list of new applications around the world, the authority informs.
This also applies to the stock of all valid trademarks, a total of 5.5 million pieces.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan had been levied.
Simplified means that each registration costs an average of 1280 yuan or 160 euros.
Coming up against it costs many times, as the case of the German family company Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the Group has been fighting against a Chinese plagiarist.
The Germans were able to achieve that its illegal production of imitated automotive parts was lifted.
But the imitator continued to secure the Chinese rights to the Freudenberg brand.
They themselves failed to do so because family names could not be protected in Germany, says Hanno Wentzler, Chairman of the Management Board of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The Trademark Office CTMO rejected the Munich objection.
In the next two instances Freudenberg got right, but the opponent continues to fight.
You have to watch hellish
The case is now pending before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident to bring the matter to a good conclusion, and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says, "The procedure is extremely complex and costs us a lot of time, money and nerves."
The internal costs could hardly be quantified, the company archive even had to look through one hundred years old files in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago Freudenberg offered the other side a "high six-digit euro amount" for settlement in vain.
"This shows how much this is worth to us," says Wentzler.
The dangers in the Far East even threaten to shrink to Europe.
Then, when imitators secure unprotected trademarks there.
A Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather.
The Group has long given up this business segment, yet it was able to avert registration.
"You have to be hellish," says Wentzler.
Both he and the lawyer Pattloch advise German companies to be very careful when dealing with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark rights; rather, foreigners should “register everything that is somehow worth protecting ” in China, as Wentzler says.
Otherwise this can be much more expensive than registration.
In fact, if Freudenberg was in the last act of his market drama, then one would probably have to pay the other side license fees for his own name, Wentzler explains.
Or we are pushed out of the market in the segment in question.
World Day: Stamping, singing, helping
In Heidelberg the choir Imbongi - and in Swaziland Aidswaisen are pleased about it.
The history of a connection that overcomes far more than 8733 kilometers.
First of all there is the stomping: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, ladies pumps and men's lippers are looking for the beat on the parquet floor, find it quickly.
One is two three is four.
Only then the voices of the singers slowly swell on - alto, bass, tenor and soprano - besieging, bewitching and following each other.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor, almost lifts it out of his fabric shoes when he brings it together with his supple wild gestures.
It is Monday evening, in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg the Imbongi choir rehearses a new song.
The fifty singers have come, between 23 and 69 years old, from the human geneticist to the houseman.
"Om'Obani" is not a simple piece, each choir voice has a different text and this in a very foreign language: Zulu, which is spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in parts of Swaziland.
Help for self-help
There are around 34 million people infected with HIV worldwide, which Unaids estimates, the United Nations programme to combat AIDS.
23.5 million people live in southern Africa.
245000 AIDS orphans live in Swaziland.
More than 40 percent of the population are now HIV positive.
The association Voices for Africa has found godparents in Germany for 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Esitjeni.
70 of them attend a secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros a month you can take over a sponsorship.
It guarantees the child school fees, school uniform and a warm meal every day at the Gogo-Center.
Imbongi means on Zulu storytellers or also lobbyists.
The bantusprache fluent can speak nobody in this room, but sing.
For almost ten years the choir has been practicing songs in this foreign soft language and brings them back from time to time to where they originally came from: to the south of Africa.
Because 8 733 kilometres away from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is the village of Esitjeni, which depends on the voice of the German choir.
Forty percent are infected
About 2000 people live there, some still in simple mud and straw huts, most of them are children.
More than 300 of them no longer have parents, because they are subjected to the HIV virus.
In Esitjeni, the smallest thing in Swaziland is revealed: highest HIV infection rate, lowest life expectancy worldwide according to Unicef.
Circumcision of the male foreskin, which demonstrably reduce the contagion risk by half, is hardly assumed by the population.
More than forty percent of people in Swaziland carry the immunodeficiency virus, with the middle of thirty dying is no rarity.
During a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir discovered the village, but above all the Imbongis saw many children on the streets, who were not only lacking parental care, but also simply everything: food, clothing, education.
Without a school leaving certificate, you have no chance in a poor country.
Initially, it was the private commitment of individuals to send a child to school for a few euros a year and to allow him a warm meal a day.
But already a year later the choir founded the association "Voices for Africa", which takes care of the AIDS orphans in Esitjeni almost professionally since then.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most important sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial STI include syphilis, chlamydia and trippers (gonorrhea).
Common viral STI are HIV, human popiloma viruses, herpes genitalis or hepatitis.
Felt louse and scabies belong to the parasitic STI.
Who are the main groups concerned?
Syphilis and trippers occur mainly in men who have sex with men.
At least four out of five of all syphilis reported in Germany are reported to be transmitted through sexual contact between men by the Robert Koch Institute.
In heterosexual adults, chlamydia infections, trichomonads, candidiasis, trippers, and human papiloma viruses are common sexually transmitted diseases.
The spread of HIV is comparatively low among heterosexual adults in Germany - nevertheless: Approximately 20 percent of the new HIV infections are accounted for by this group.
Chlamydia infections occur much more frequently among adolescents than among other population groups.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections affect young people aged 15 to 25.
Human poplar viruses are also common among young people.
How did the number of infections develop?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to notification.
The number of syphilis infection has more than doubled from 1697 diseases in 2001 to 3698 in 2011, according to the Robert Koch Institute.
The number of new HIV infections has been declining since 2007.
In 2011 there were around 2700 cases.
That is about a tenth less than the year before.
What symptoms indicate venereal disease?
Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, problems with urination, discharge, abdominal pain as well as vesicles or warts.
However, they often do not cause pain or other symptoms and therefore remain unnoticed.
How to protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but do not provide 100% protection.
In part, pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be passed on through lubricating infections and close physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend regular examinations, especially with frequently changing sex partners.
Early diagnosed, most STI can be cured and late sequences avoided.
Through sponsorships, donations and, last but not least, the Gagen, which the choir invades throughout Germany, some things come together.
"We have already sent around 200,000 euros to Esitjeni," says Annette Lennartz, the chairman of the association.
In the village itself, Zodwa Dlamini, a confident and assertive woman, manages the funds from Germany.
She also takes care that the orphans are well accommodated, for example with one of the grandmothers.
The Gogos, as the old women are called on Zulu, are the pillars of the village.
Some of them have taken up to 14 orphans, give them a roof over their heads and make sure that the children in their uniforms appear punctual every day for school lessons.
Who no longer has anyone, comes to the shelter to Khanyisile, a single woman who is paid by the club as well as the two cooks who cook every day for more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" has launched a sewing school, built two chicken houses, and organized together with the American health organization PSI that many in the village have made an HIV test.
This is not a matter of course, because as evidently as the disease is in the whole country, it is best to keep silent.
A king with 14 wives
"Aids is an absolute taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality."
Actually strange in a country where the king officially holds 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
Among other things, it is also due to this state-sanctioned form of life that the HIV virus has spread so quickly in recent decades.
But also the many migrant workers who carry the virus through the country.
There would be free condoms on every corner, Annette Lennartz says, "but they are hardly used.
The culture is another - flesh to flesh. "
In order to promote cultural exchange, the Imbongi Choir travels through South Africa every two or three years together and sings songs full of melancholy, fighting spirit, confidence and black self-confidence, which many still know from the times of apartheid at the southern tip of the black continent.
A bus full of white people singing songs in a black language - so much recognition not only brings mood and joy, but has also defy some grim border soldiers a few tears.
The journey always leads to Esitjeni, where the singers visit their godchildren.
Even if you hardly find the small village on maps, in the valley of the Ezulweni river it is more than known.
"Go to Esitjeni, the light is there," people say.
And when you return the 8733 kilometres of airline to Heidelberg, to the stamping singers in the rehearsal room on Bergheimer Straße, you can see it shining.
Messenger: NASA discovers ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe has found evidence that there is ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice cover may be up to 20 meters thick.
The US Space Agency NASA has demonstrated the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is closest to the sun, there are also frozen water, as three studies published on Thursday in the journal "Science" show.
The Messenger probe has found evidence that there is an ice cover in the permanently shaded region of the planet.
This should be at least 30 centimeters thick and possibly up to 20 meters thick.
The water probably came from comets or possibly asteroids that hit Mercury.
No one would associate the discovery of ice but with the existence of life on the planet, said the chief scientist of the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on the Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
But the findings could help clarify how water and other building blocks of life have reached other parts of the solar system.
Unnoticed by Earth citizens, probes, telescopes, and small robots like Phoenix are exploring the depths of the universe.
From time to time they send pictures to Earth: Small peepholes in infinite expanses.
The picture comes from a camera developed by German researchers from the Max Moreover Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, who circles around the Sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not a "planet" according to the new definition of the International Astronomical Union of 2006.
This section of an infrared image of the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" of uncountable star generations: The oldest stars can be recognized as blue dots, the pink colored "newborns" in the Star Circle Hall are more difficult to identify.
This star-forming region - called W5 by scientists unromantically - discovered the telescope Spitzer in the star image Cassiopeia, at a distance of 6500 light years.
This iridescent glow of a dying star has been taken up by the Spitzer ’ s Defense Telescope.
The donut round ring consists of material that the star flung out in the dying process.
In the giant Trifid fog, 5400 light-years away from Earth, new stars are created from gas and dust.
This photo of the Galactic Birthplace was shot by the Spitzer -telescope.
The Pleiades' cluster, also called "The Seven Sisters", can be seen with the naked eye at night.
With the telescope, however, the colours are more effective.
Like a red age, the Helix fog looks towards the viewer on this infrared photograph.
It is located 700 light-years away in the Aquarius constellation.
His similarity to an earthly continent earned this fog the title of North America.
A combination of normal and infrared photo ensures spectacular coloring.
This infrared star could only be recorded in its full beauty by the infrared detectors of the pointed telescope.
Saturn and its rings: How these arose is one of the great puzzles of astronomy.
Perhaps they are the remains of a Saturn moon that disappeared 4.5 billion years ago without a trace.
One of the largest and sharpest images of the Hubble telescope: The Whirlpool Galaxy
Depending on the colour scheme, images of spiral galaxies become true works of art.
The photograph, published by the European Southern Observatory, shows the Trifid Nebula in the constellation of Sagittarius, several thousand light-years away.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word trifidus (tripartite, tripartite), as dark dust strips divide the glowing heart of the stars.
In the constellation Snake Bearers, astronomers have photographed the harbingers of a cosmic carambola: 400 million light years away from Earth, the cores of two merging galaxies rush towards each other and will inevitably collide with each other.
These stars were recorded in the M83 spiral galaxy.
Those who are not technical abbreviations may call them Southern Fire Wheel.
The photo of the Hubble space telescope shows an excerpt from the iris nebula in the constellation of Kepheus.
The fog, which is 1400 light years away, consists of dust grains, ten to hundred times smaller than ordinary house dust.
This image was composed of optical and X-ray images of different telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes, 430 million light years away from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, took up the Hubble space telescope.
Scientists call the larger spiral galaxy UGC 1810.
In this star nebula is the brightest group of young stars of our Milky Way.
The Starcradle always produces new youungsters.
These stars of the cloud, associated with the rosettes of the nebula, also produce constantly new baby stars - 5000 light years away from the earth.
In this brightly radiating galaxy with a small black hole there is no dust yet, but only gas.
Researchers suspect that it only emerged shortly after the Big Bang, when hydrogen was predominantly found in the universe.
Our insights into space: the most important telescopes
The telescope is said to have been invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608 - even before Galileo Galilei used it to observe the stars a year later.
Since then, the mirrors of the optical telescopes have been increasing - and the insights they provide are getting deeper and deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale's telescope was the largest telescope in the world in the Palomar Observatory near San Diego.
The mirror, here in the picture, had an average of five meters.
The Large Binocular Telescope is located in Arizona, USA.
It allows looking into space over two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior of the Gran Telescopio Canaria on the Canary Island of La Palma is huge - alone the mirror comes to 10.4 meters in diameter.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented - to save costs.
Nevertheless it reaches a diameter of about eleven meters.
Disadvantage of the favorable design: The telescope is fixed in its height angle - and thus limited in its mobility.
The hobby is also fixed in the height angle.
Its special feature: the high light collecting force.
In spite of the comparatively low mirror diameter, this is enough for the world's largest mirror telescopes.
Using a radio telescope in Arecibo (Puerto Rico), researchers listen to space after extraterrestrial signals.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
With the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI) any computer owner can help by providing computing power.
View of the Observatory of the European Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope - which honours his name.
With its four mirrors, the telescope can also illuminate the middle infrared spectrum.
The European Extremely Large Telescope is also planned at the ESO Observatory in Chile.
Its main mirror is intended to cover a lush 42 meters - and be composed of almost 1000 mirror elements.
Pictures are to be expected at the earliest 2018.
Until 2007, the two cake-telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
They offer two mirrors with an average of ten metres each.
The check-up telescopes are part of the Mauna and Kea Observatory, which beside them still looks into the sky with the Subaru and the IRTTF.
Also on the Mauna Kea a new, gigantic telescope is to be created - with an average mirror of thirty meters.
Here you can admire it on an illustration.
The most important impressions from space, however, are provided by the Hubble space telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, it has provided images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the space telescope Kepler has been looking for extrasolar planets - mainly those that can be inhabited.
On February 2, 2011, it was announced that 1235 planetary candidates had been identified since the beginning of the mission.
In the picture the last preparations are documented at the space telescope Kepler.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be launched into space on an Ariane5 rocket at the earliest in 2018.
The primary mirror of the space frared telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope: It should look for light from the first stars and galaxies for the Big Bang.
Scientists assume that ice also exists at the south pole of Mercury.
However, there is no reliable data for this, as the messengers circle far closer to the North Pole around the planet.
For decades radar measurements have indicated that there is ice on Mercury.
The scientists now have certainty about the Messenger probe, the first to circulate around the Mercury, launched in 2004.
Drink butter every day - and be 168 years old
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people reach biblical age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A search for traces in the country in which 97 year-olds are still comparatively young.
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people reach biblical age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A search for traces in the country in which 97 year-olds are still comparatively young.
The ride through the Talysh mountains is wildly romantic.
The minibus rumbles over the winding road, past densely wooded hills, raging rivers and simple farmhouses.
Everything is green and juicy, you could think you would find yourself in the Black Forest.
But this is the deepest south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few kilometres away.
Here lives the Caucasian ethnic group of the Talysh, of which not much is known, except that it speaks Persian and Azeri perfectly and is very durable.
End station is Lerik.
The small town is full of architecture from Soviet times, which doesn ’ t even want to fit into the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe hardly come here, too burdensome is the approach from Azerbaijan's capital Baku.
For the 323 kilometers you need eight hours, because the road is only one-lane.
The fabulous wealth that the country owes to its oil in the Caspian Sea has not yet arrived here in the province.
But Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has the stuff for tourist attraction.
"Baku became famous in May with the Eurovision and Song - and next year we have a festival of the oldest people in the world", says Fatulayeva.
She is the director of the Museum of Longevity, probably the only one in the world.
Here is documented the Vita of about eight dozen Talyshes from the area, older than 100. Fatulayeva points to a Black and White photo.
This is my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
At the age of 136 another child was born
But the controversial star of the museum is shepherd Şirali Müslümov, who is said to be 168 years old.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And in view of the oldest documented person, who was 122 years old, Müslümov ’ s age seems extremely doubtful.
"He was born here in the region in 1805, and died in 1973," Fatulayeva explains.
The man was married three times and had 23 children, at the age of 136 he is said to have begotten another daughter.
So did Şirali Müslümov count at his age for a few decades?
But Rembrandt Scholz, an age researcher at the Max Moreover Planck Institute in Rostock, has also heard about the elderly in Central Asia.
"Conspicuously many high-age people are also present in some areas of China, Japan or the Hunza valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "also in Sardinia there are extremely many very old men."
Due to lack of documents, however, no scientific proof of age was to be conducted, especially as registers of persons were missing.
Every day melted butter
The fact is, however, that people in the region around Lerik are remarkably often reaching biblical age.
There are currently 20 people older than 100 years.
So why do so many elderly people live here in the south?
The aseric travel guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains this with the special genes of the Talysh.
Museum director Fatulayeva believes that it is nutritional.
But the fact that the calorie-rich food of the Talyschen should be so healthy, that the meat, bread and especially dairy products love and many of which drink a glass of melted butter every day does not seem exactly plausible from a nutritional point of view.
Or is it the original way of life that keeps people young? Rubaba Mirzayeva lives in Cengemiran, a tiny settlement near the town of Lerik.
With her 97 years she is still comparatively young for these latitudes.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house that is typical for the entire Caucasus region.
She sits on the ground with a butter barrel, which she tirelessly rolls back and forth.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of Mirzayeva ’ s sons and one daughter, both of whom have long been grandparents.
Also two toddlers jump around.
In the kitchen, guests are prepared tea, which is served in the typical armadu jars.
Mirzayeva ’ s white teeth stand perfectly in line and limb, under her headscarf she hides long, dark blonde braids that her son proudly reveals to us.
I have always washed my hair with milk, so they never left me and kept their color.
"I never used shampoo," says Mirzayeva.
Monthly pension goes to life
She has always eaten only what came from her own farm, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
All my life I did not buy food once in the supermarket.
Then she tells of her husband who was in the army.
It was worst in the post-World War II period.
But everything got better when the "beloved father" Heydar Aliyev took over the helm.
The propaganda sounds strange from the mouth of an old woman.
But the cult driven around the nation ’ s father figure, who ruled his country like a dictator, hardly knows borders in Azerbaijan.
Until 2003 he was in power, later his son Ilham took over the helm.
After all, there is no need for Azerbaijan ’ s old people.
230 Manat (about the same sum in euros), Mirzayeva receives monthly as a pension, for local conditions an amount from which one can live well.
And perhaps Mirzayeva ’ s son, who had long since been angry, is also right: “The elderly enjoy respect in our culture. ”
They live in the middle of the large family, are loved, cared for and are happy.
If this is no reason to stay alive as long as possible
The word 'human rights' is missing in the Constitution
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Rivaling rallies in Cairo reveal the deep division of the country.
The future constitution with Sharia as its base is fiercely controversial.
The Egyptian president did not save with pathos.
We must make the transition.
"And that he succeeds lies in my responsibility, before the people and before God," he said on state television.
His speech was addressed to the whole people, but above all to the Christian Copts, the Liberals, enlightened Muslims and secular people.
For they all, hopelessly disputing so far in a confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a divine state on the Nile of graces of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohammed Morsi said he had almost apologized for temporarily curtailing the powers of the Constitutional Court and expanding his powers "to save the revolution".
But what the 61-year-old engineer, who holds a doctorate from the American University of Southern California, really wants to save, the Egyptians are not quite aware of it.
Should the judiciary be disempowered?
Indeed, the 234 articles that the Islamist-dominated 100-member Constituent Assembly has whipped through in a 15-hour night parforcerty are partly worrying.
As in previous constitutions, the draft states that the case law is based on the "principles of Islamic law".
But what does "principles" mean?
That was and still is a matter of interpretation and it is to be feared that the Islamists will use the spongy formulation and the legal scope for a stricter interpretation of sharia.
This suggests at least a newly added article: In all matters relating to Sharia, it is necessary to consult the University of Al Ashar, the country ’ s most important Islamic institution, with great radiance throughout Sunni Islam.
This does not have to be done, but it can mean that the clergy supervise the legislation, which would de facto result in the discouragement of the judiciary.
Much of the draft constitution is a matter of interpretation
Also problematic: Civilian military jurisdiction should be maintained.
These courts served to suppress opponents during Mubarak ’ s rule.
After the fall of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were in military confinement.
The state should also, according to the draft, "protect" the true nature of the Egyptian family and promote its morality and values. "
This is formulated so bluntly by law that state institutions could even use this article to control the contents of film art and literature.
In plain language, this means nothing more than censorship.
By the way, no article explicitly defines equality between men and women.
For this another forbids insulting or slandering the Prophet Mohammed and his messengers.
But what is an insult and how it is to be punished remains unclear.
Similarly dubious is the formulation that "insulting people" is forbidden.
Is there a caricature of the President or a joke at the expense of a legal scholar?
Interpretative case, as so much in the draft which Morsi has to sign and according to his words "very soon" will be presented to the Egyptians for the referendum.
"The revolution has returned"
The opposition has been forming for weeks against the Islamists ’ supremacy.
Tens of thousands gathered in unaccustomed harmony on Friday evening at Tahrir Square in Cairo and vowed to bring down the Charter even before it can enter into force.
"The revolution has returned and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbahi, third place in the presidential elections.
Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed El Baradei said that the draft Constitution belongs "to the Müllberg of history".
Via Short Intelligence Service Twitter, he accused Mursi ’ s followers of wanting to lead a “coup against democracy. ”
"When he calls out the referendum, we will go to his palace and topple him," said opposition player Jasser Said.
"We are not yet tired, the blood of our brothers is not yet atoned," the Egyptian media quoted the opposition politician Chaled Ali.
And several judges announced that they would not want to monitor the referendum, making it invalid.
"The Koran is our Constitution"
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood, for its part, was a counter-demonstration, but not on Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other side of the Nile in front of Cairo University.
Many veiled women and followers of the Salafists participated in it and cried, "The people demand the application of God's law."
They demanded of Morsi: "Clean the land!" and said: "The Koran is our constitution."
A struggle for sovereignty over the symbolic Tahrir Square, where everything began, would probably have provoked civil war conditions.
Obviously, Morsi ’ s followers did not want to risk that.
The Muslim Brotherhood declared that both the opponents of the draft constitution and the supporters had spoken out loud and clear.
Now is the time to let the people decide at the ballot box what direction the country should take.
A majority in the Islamists ’ draft is considered safe.
"The word human rights does not even exist"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry about this forced constitutional process, which should have gone until February and involve all social forces.
The 48 year-old human rights lawyer and chair of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) defended the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in prison or in court under Mubarak.
Not because he would share their view of the world, but because for him human rights are indivisible.
He was beaten, sentenced, and imprisoned for this.
"And now the word human rights does not even stand in the new constitution," he laments in conversation with the "World on Sunday".
Morsi's extension of power to all three powers in the state made the lawyer resign.
These measures are blatant violations of democratic rules of the game and will lead Egypt into a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the President de facto overrides it," complains Saeda.
But democracy cannot function without civil society organisations.
Saeda feels left alone, also by the international community, which looks at the ideological struggle for direction on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
That could avenge itself.
A Demonstrator on Tahrir warns, "You're driving a monster you can't control anymore."
Rakfisk from Norway: Is this the world ’ s worst smelling fish?
The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy one of the highest living standards - not only in Europe, but throughout the world.
Could the secret of the success of the country have something to do with the local appetite for pretty bad smelling fish?
Take a selection of overripe cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a pile of dirty, damp sports clothing.
And leave them there for a week.
So about one must imagine the nasal odor of Rakfisk, one of the great delicacies of Norway.
I am in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There is snow here, spectacular landscapes - and this persistent smell in the air that simply does not want to disappear.
Rakfisk is trout sprinkled with salt, which is fermented in water for up to one year, depending on how stinky one would like his fish.
When in Norway the darkness comes over the country and the weather gets colder, Norwegians flock to a festival here in Fagernes, which is dedicated to this, now, really very captivating specialty.
"One eats it raw and then rinses it down with a glass of aquavit," says Havard Halvarsen, who actually works in the local fire station, but also organizes the festival as a so-called "Rakfisk and General".
Around us people consume small fish cubes and take large amounts of alcohol.
"People like Aquavit more than Rakfisk," says Havard.
The spirit can displace the smell.
I cost some snacks.
If one avoids to bring the Rakfisk near the nose, it is not bad - like Sushi, which has a quite long bus ride behind it.
Rakfisk is the product of a very different, much poorer Norwegian epoch, when there were no cooling possibilities and fish was soaked in airtight saltwater casks in autumn.
In the deepest winter it was then removed after long fermentation and consumed - undoubtedly with the help of alcohol dampened senses.
One generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work and emigrated mainly to the US.
Today, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by a flourishing labour market, high wages and a comprehensive health care system.
Even from Sweden, the old rival, who was far richer than Norway not long ago, immigrants flock.
Rakfisk is seen as something important - an essential, if strictly smelling part of Norwegian history.
It is one of the more expensive dishes you can buy here.
But actually everything is expensive here - a small glass of beer or a sandwich costs a proud 10 euros.
Norway does not often succeed in the world press, and most people do not seem to disturb it.
Here it is still hated to name Anders Breivik - the racist right-wing extremist who shot 77 men, women and children last year.
Instead, we refer only to the "incident of 22 July".
Norwegians find it difficult to accept that someone in their peace-loving country is capable of such brutal murders.
Since the early 1970s, Norway ’ s wealth has been largely driven by growth in one of the world ’ s largest oil and gas industries.
"But oil is not the only reason why we are doing so well," says Anna, our waitress, who distributes round trays with mature Rakfisk and embodies the Nordic ideal with her long blonde hair and piercing blue eyes.
We are a - as they say - prudent people.
Her English is spotless just like most people here.
We are not very afflicted, we do not like boasting.
Norway has handled its wealth of oil very cautiously - a large proportion of industry yields are invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
When in the years leading up to the world economic crisis everyone threw money around them that they did not even possess, Norway kept its purse closed.
"As long as we can ski in winter and hike in summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"And of course eat Rakfisk," she adds with carefree laughter.
I stand in the snow and stand for another court - I have enough of Rakfisk.
Such a moose Burger is definitely something different. I feel the juicy meat.
But in the evening the starfish is on the menu again.
The hotel where I stay is one of several venues that organise a Rakfisk ’ s dinner, where guests can vote for the best - or perhaps the smells most challenging - fish.
There is a Live TV circuit to a showmaster clothed with fly, surrounded by plates with Rakfisk.
The spectacle is similar to the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What score do you have up there in the mountains for the best fish, Thor's Jürgen?"
"Here are our points, Havard".
You clap and laugh.
A man falls from his chair, possibly overwhelmed by Aquavit.
But perhaps it is the severe haze of the whole fish.
Mexican Enrique Pena Nieto faces difficult start
While Mexico ’ s future president Enrique Pena Nieto is preparing to take office, Will Grant from the BBC analyses the challenges ahead and the mixed feelings of his people.
Currently, traffic in Mexico is particularly bad.
Even on better days, this is always a clogged city, but on Monday a steel ring was built, which blocks several important traffic routes to the capital and causes chaos on the streets.
The aim, however, was not to disturb commuters on their way to work, but to prevent demonstrators from reaching Parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico ’ s new president Enrique Pena Nieto will receive the presidential tie and take over the nation ’ s leadership.
It faces a complex task.
Mexico has proved itself economically well under the outgoing government of Felipe Calderon, but the country is in the grip of a drug war that has already cost 60,000 lives over the last six years.
"My government is strongly committed to reducing violence," said Pena Nieto to US President Barack Obama at the Oval Office earlier this week.
I will propose a new security strategy with which we can achieve this objective.
Pena Nieto was a governor of his home state, Mexico, before he was on an equal footing with the US president.
In this densely populated, extensive part of the country surrounding the capital, opinions about the new head of state are shared.
A Direct Man
In the remote small town of Valle del Bravo, for example, one likes to remember him.
Residents of the holiday resort assign him the development of tourism and the construction of the infrastructure.
To reach the city, one can drive on one of the highways that Pena Nieto had built and which represent a great improvement over the brittle, bumpy roads that once existed here.
Plaques with his name hang outside a modern sports centre and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
"We expect from him real and lasting changes," said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, who works as a Congressman for the Pena Nieto Party, the PRI.
In particular, as regards security and the economy, we hope for an interesting and real change that our country so urgently needs.
After 81 years in power, the PRI was replaced by Vicente Fox in 2000.
Congressman Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, the party has high expectations of Enrique Pena Nieto.
He rejects the opposition ’ s accusations that the new president lacks substance.
He was a very direct man, very committed and had great plans for the country.
He is an outstanding statesman, but above all he is also someone who can listen.
But on the other hand, not many people share this view about their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast to the paved streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
The place is hidden under highway crossings and in many respects is a suburb of Mexico.
And the problems in the community are of crucial urban nature.
Earlier this year, the military was turned on to combat the drug gangs operating in the neighbourhoods, and violence against women is a particularly acute problem.
In the last two years alone, dozens of murdered women have been left behind on a spot near a large garbage dump.
During the reign of Governor Pena Nieto, more than 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico - a statistic that even exceeds that of the city of Ciudad Juarez, which is notorious for its violence and murders of innocent women.
Critics Pena Nietos believe that he has at least not adequately addressed the problem of female murders during his term of office.
But in the worst case, his government has closed its eyes to the problem.
In a concrete building, typical of the rundown quarter, Irinea Buendia fights with tears when she shows me photos of her deceased daughter Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of the events, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
But her family believes that she was murdered by her partner.
"When I arrived at her home, it seemed as if her body had been washed," recalls Senora Buendia.
There were signs that she was beaten, and the corpse had already been used.
While her mother tells her story, a picture of Mariana looks down on us from the wall. It is mounted next to a cross carrying a single word: justice.
But it is precisely this, according to the family, that has been denied to her so far.
The authorities treated me as if I were a chat, a troublemaker, a örglerin.
They want their judgment simply to be accepted and put on their mouths.
"But this is not possible if there were so many faults in form and omissions," she says.
When President Pena Nieto receives the presidential tie on Saturday, he also assumes a great responsibility.
Tens of thousands of Mexican families have been affected by violent crimes over the past six years, and the new president has promised to address this issue in particular during his term of office.
"I hope that as President he is as Governor," says PRI Congressman Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
But the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza are most afraid of this.
The Prosecutor's Office alleges that Bradley Manning did not complain about mistreatment
The prosecutor ’ s office contradicts Bradley Manning ’ s accusations that he had been mistreated in prison
The hearing deals with Mannings time in the Quantico Military Prison, Virginia
The defence seeks to dismiss the indictment on the basis of harsh conditions of detention
The private US Army is accused of having stolen thousands of confidential documents
On Friday, the prosecutor ’ s office tried to find out that Bradley Manning, accused of the greatest disclosure of confidential information in U.S. history, missed several opportunities to complain about his alleged mistreatment in military confinement.
During a cross-examination of Mannings during a pre-trial hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Maj. Ashden Fein said that documents on weekly visits made by prison officials during Manning ’ s nine-month detention period in Quantico, Virginia, had no complaints about his treatment.
One day before the cross-examination, which was held as a result of a request from the defence for the rejection of the indictment - Manning had already been sufficiently punished by the hard detention period - Manning had declared that he had considered the suicide in prison.
The US Army intelligence analyst arrested in June 2010 is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents during his service in Iraq.
The material was then published by WikiLeaks on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed Manning as a source of information.
At the hearing on Friday, Fein and Manning went through the forms that officials had completed following their meetings with Manning during his detention in the Quantico Military Prison, where he had been imprisoned from July 2010 to April 2011 under increased prison conditions.
The officials asked Manning questions and wrote his answers.
When Fein asked him about the forms on Friday, Manning admitted that he had judged the treatment by his guards as "excellent" and the treatment by the establishment as a whole as "very professional".
The forms, according to Fein, did not contain any complaints about abuse, although the officials had asked Manning directly about his treatment.
Manning replied that he had expressed his concerns orally and that the officials had discussed them with him and indicated that they were dealing with them. However, they had not been logged.
"They wrote (after discussing the concerns)" No problems ", and that did not necessarily mean that I said nothing at all," Manning said.
The judge, Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he did not complain about his treatment when he met with a committee in January 2011 to investigate the suicidal thankfulness he mentioned a few months earlier on a form.
Manning replied that his intention during this meeting was to have his observation status reduced to "prevention of injuries".
The military said it had assigned him this restrictive status - which is one stage under the suicide threat - to his and the protection of others.
"I wanted to convince employees that I was doing well and to get rid of the observation status for the prevention of injuries (...) in order to achieve a higher quality of life from my point of view," said Manning.
Manning pronounced his arrest and transfer to Kuwait on Thursday, where he was detained for nearly two months before being transferred to the Quantico naval base in Virginia in July 2010.
He said that he had considered suicide in Kuwait and had once become unconscious because of the heat.
Not being allowed to know what happened to him or to the outside world was burdensome.
"My world shrank to Camp Arafjon, on this cage together," Manning said on Thursday.
I thought I would die in this cage.
When he was transferred to Quantico, Manning spent most of his days in a small cell - at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours - and without society.
He was allowed only one mattress, a blanket, flip flops, clothes and his glasses.
Manning said he had tried to stay in motion, because the day was forbidden to sleep or even to lie down.
He always had to sleep with light, which entered his cell from the outside.
When he turned around at night and guards could no longer see his face, they woke him up to turn back.
In January 2011, Mannings lawyer formally raised objections to Mannings ’ treatment.
Manning was transferred to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011.
On Friday, the judge Manning also asked for an accusation he had raised in his statement on Thursday - so he had to sleep one night naked in his cell in Quantico and stand naked in front of guards and other prisoners in a morning count.
Manning had said he had never had the opportunity to cover himself with his blanket during this count.
In the interview on Friday Manning stated that he had closed his guard's order to drop the blanket with which he could have covered himself. However, he admitted that no one had asked him to do so.
On Thursday Manning said that he was forced to sleep naked the previous night. He would have tried to show an official that he was not at risk to himself.
Manning told the official that he could have used his underwear or flip flops to hurt himself, but did not.
That night, Manning said, his underpants, flip-flops and glasses had been removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that the judge will at least take his prison experience into account and drastically reduce his prison sentence should he be convicted at his trial before the military court, which is scheduled for the beginning of next year.
The defense has indicated that Manning will commit minor offences, while other charges considered too extreme are being challenged.
The continuation of the hearing is scheduled for this weekend and the prosecution is expected to justify the conditions of detention.
The Pentagon remains in its position that Manning has been detained in accordance with the provisions applicable to all prisoners under the highest security precautions in Quantico.
The charges against Manning include favoring the enemy, unlawfully publishing intelligence information on the Internet, transferring national defence information and stealing public property or documents.
If he is found guilty on all counts, he is threatened with life imprisonment.
My Mexican identity crisis.
Many people are forced to leave Mexico due to the lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to blame emigrants - they remind them of difficult times, he says
Navarrette believes that Mexican Americans are trapped between two worlds
On a recent trip to Mexico, I had just crossed the hall and had arrived at passport control when perplexity was spreading in me.
Signs pointing to two queues: one for "Mexicanos" ("Mexicanos"), another for "Extranjeros" ("Aliens").
I stood there for a few seconds, unsure to which I should go.
I grew up in central California and was called "Mexicans" all my life.
An ethnic abbreviation - just as my friends in Boston call themselves "Irish" or my friends in New York "Italian".
Later I decided on "Mexican American".
But that was Mexico.
And in the home of my grandfather there was no need for abbreviations or hyphens.
I was just American.
I speak Spanish, at least good enough to maintain myself in this language at both ends of an interview.
But I do not have the vocabulary of a native speaker, and I do not get rid of my American accent either.
So I took my American passport and put myself in line for Extranjeros.
I thought about that moment this week when future Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House to meet President Obama.
The agenda included all the issues that are expected when the heads of these two countries meet: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto was also very interested in talking about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one reason why Mexicans today are equally likely to remain in Mexico instead of emigrating to the United States.
He wants to join forces with the United States and Canada and create a North American trading bloc modelled on the European Union.
And Pena Nieto swore to continue Mexico ’ s war on drug cartels, even though he did not mention any details in this regard.
Mexico ’ s relationship with the United States is complicated and full of resentment.
Most Americans are unlikely to waste a single thought that the United States invaded Mexico in 1848, forcing the country ’ s leaders to surrender more than half of their territory under a reserved gun.
But for Mexicans who think in centuries and not minutes, memories of this event cannot be overlooked.
So, as soon as a US government official criticises Mexico with even the slightest, complaints are heard - in the Mexican press and among the elites of the country - about how the Americans are oppressing the sovereignty of their neighbouring country.
And the children of Montezuma go on the path of war.
Yet Mexico ’ s greatest challenge lies in its relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
Fancy to talk about resentment?
There is more than enough.
Mexico has winners and losers. People for whom the country offers opportunities, and others for whom it does not.
The only reason why so many people of Mexican origin live in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that at one point in our pedigree a person - perhaps a parent or grandparent - did not get a chance in Mexico and emigrated to the north.
And in most cases this person corresponded to a profile - dark skinned, uneducated, from a poor village, etc.
We are the descendants of these people, and our faithfulness applies to them.
Not Mexico.
And although we may have now lived the American dream, attended good schools and received good jobs, we must never lose sight of the American dream we live - not the Mexican one.
Our identity may sometimes be blurred, but as far as our loyalty is concerned, this is not the case.
This clearly applies to the United States.
Furthermore, we are aware that many Mexican leaders do not like us.
This is based on reciprocity.
They see us as a memorial to a humiliating defeat and look down on us because we are not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties to Mexico will never be strong enough.
In their opinion, our existence is a symbol of failure.
If our families had not failed in Mexico, they would not have gone.
And then we would not be trapped behind the silk curtain - with a pleasant life in the United States, but somehow lost.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and legally immigrated to the United States as a child, reminds me that there are tensions between Mexicans and Mexican Americans, because Mexicans have a clearer idea of who they are - and Mexican Americans do so badly.
While she is an American citizen, she sees herself as part of two countries.
But many Mexican Americans, whom I know, feel that they are neither one nor the other.
We love the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
One enjoys the best of both worlds, but is not rooted in any of them.
In Mexico we are seen as Americans.
And in the United States we are seen as Mexicans.
As I should learn during my trip, there is something that makes this relationship even more complicated: some Mexican leaders and parts of the educational citizenship want to resume their ties to the diaspora.
They want to use Mexican Americans as provisional "ambassadors" for Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We should tell our American colleagues how great a visit this country is and pressure on the political leadership to intensify its ties with Mexico.
Well.
That will not happen.
Too many injured feelings.
And, given the unfair distribution of income, unbridled corruption and drug violence, many of us are not at all sure that this is really a great country.
I fear you have to go alone, Amigos.
That is fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not yet prepared to forgive the United States for dealing with Mexico a century and a half ago, they must also accept that some Mexican Americans have resentment for how their family members were treated not so long ago.
Hmmm.
Maybe we are "Mexican" when I thought.
Old Battles, New Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could prove to be an unexpected pillar of peace
Can there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The latest bloody events seem to suffocate such hope in the bud.
In the midst of the usual blame, countless buildings have been thrown into rubble, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis killed - and for the first time rockets from Gaza have struck near the Israeli metropolis of Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But, while Israelis and Palestinians seem trapped in their historic conflict, the Middle East is changing around them.
The Arab Spring has created a new, uncertain situation, and whether they want it or not - Palestinians and Israelis have become part of this confusion.
Perhaps this will only lead to more bloodshed.
But there are reasons to believe that the deadly stalemate could finally come to an end.
A war that is neither lost nor won
At first glance, in view of the current situation, optimism seems far from appropriate.
Even if the ceasefire agreed on 21 November continues, this week ’ s fighting has strengthened the hard-boiled on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that has been controlling the Gaza Strip since 2007, will claim to have pushed back the Israelis, despite the fact that its group itself suffered huge losses.
Although several Hamas leaders are killed and the 1.7 million inhabitants of the Gaza Strip are enclosed in one of the most desolate and densely populated corners of the planet, Israel has not yet succeeded in destroying Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas is gaining in the West Bank, controlled by the rival, moderate Fatah Palestinian group.
And Hamas leaders could conclude that they have time on their side.
As Islamists have gained influence in the Arab world, Hamas has been able to draw powerful and rich friends to its side.
Turkey, a reinvigorating regional power once considered Israel ’ s closest Muslim ally, has seized the Hamas party – just like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf states.
Judging by Hamas, supporters believe that an Islamist crescent is formed around Israel – from Lebanon in the north, where militant Hezbollah has power, to Syria, where rebels may face Bashar Assad ’ s fall, to Jordan, where Hamas ’ s allies threaten the king.
And, in particular, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt – the most populous and important Arab country by far – on the southern flank of Israel has changed the region ’ s balance in the long term.
Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had little time left for Hamas.
By contrast, the brotherhood with Hamas is marginalized and its leaders are more dependent on popular views.
In future diplomatic negotiations, Hamas could prove to be an actor who cannot be pushed out by Israel and the United States.
The Israeli hardliners, on the other hand, draw an opposite conclusion.
From a military point of view, Hamas is no longer in danger.
The Israeli missile defence system, "Iron Dome", has proved itself and many of the Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
For at least a while Israel will be able to sleep calmer.
In diplomatic terms, the United States holds steadfastly to its position, and many European countries have blamed Hamas for the latest escalations of violence.
Israel has done well in recent years, particularly under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who has largely ignored the peace process.
Although rockets from the Gaza Strip have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, the country has remained relatively free from suicide bombers - not least thanks to the ranges that enter the West Bank and thus into the main part of a possible Palestinian state, which protect the Jewish settlements, which have been declared illegal under international law, but are constantly being expanded.
Netanyahu is in good shape. Avigdor Lieberman, in the run-up to the elections on 22 January, allied his Likud Party with an even more militant group.
Why also these deceitful Palestinians pacify and leave their own state to them?
If they really had control over the West Bank, would they not fire rockets, just like their counterparts in the Gaza Strip?
No, it is better to keep them in check behind the wall and punish them if they dare to lift their heads.
Perhaps the hardliners will be able to prevail, but the Arab Spring could get them through the bill.
Even if the Islamists, now in power in Egypt and in other countries, have little left for Israel, they will initially focus on domestic difficulties.
Israel ’ s defense act is greater than that of its four Arab neighbors together.
A war with the local superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments to repair their economies.
That pragmatic President Morsi met Barack Obama to achieve a ceasefire could be a promising sign - and perhaps symbolize the beginning of a new era.
Israelis should also think in the longer term.
While the rest of the Arab world is taking timid steps towards democratisation, Palestinians are still being deprived of their right to self-determination - a powder keg that will undoubtedly explode one day in the Israeli-occupied territories, just as a bus exploded this week in Tel Aviv.
The repression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state, and with the growth of the Arab population, this situation will only worsen.
Bloody missions to push Hamas back in Gaza will increasingly demand diplomatic tribute over the years.
Both sides need an external impetus
The right answer is that represented by the more sensible representatives of both sides, the majority of the rest of the world, and by this newspaper: two states in which Israel assigns territories for security purposes.
The hope - small for the near future - is that the ceasefire will give outsiders more influence in enforcing this solution.
Egypt must now, together with Turkey and Qatar, stop arms deliveries to Gaza, and is better positioned than ever before to convince Hamas of the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, supplemented by territorial exchange and a common Jerusalem.
External Arab nations should also persuade Hamas and Fatah to reach an agreement.
This would do more for the creation of a Palestinian state than with the forthcoming request for UN observer status.
Obama, too, must play his part in encouraging Israel to negotiate.
During his first term of office, he missed the idea of his own peace plan.
Far away in the white house it seems as if it is also averse to participation.
But that is a regrettable short-sighted perspective.
The United States has an essential interest in a stable Middle East.
This includes a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Australian laws on uniform cigarette packaging enter into force
Health warnings and diseased body parts on neutral green packs that are the same for all tobacco brands
The world ’ s first laws for uniform cigarette and tobacco packaging have entered into force in Australia, replacing brand logos and colors with neutral, olive green lids, which are also printed with drastic images showing sick body parts and infants and children suffering from cigarette smoke.
Apart from the different health warnings and pictures, there is the only difference between the packs in the brand names, which are printed in identical, small font from Saturday onwards.
Australia is thus introducing the world ’ s most stringent rules on tobacco packaging.
The Australian Federal Government wants to dissuade young people from smoking by eliminating the glamorous image of tobacco consumption.
The government proceeds from studies that have shown that people who have not yet started smoking at 26 will no longer start with 99% probability.
"You can already see in children of young age that they understand the message that tobacco companies are trying to promote with their brand image," said Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek. She quotes studies that have shown, for example, that children associate the crown of a logo with the idea of a princess.
Although Australia has one of the least smoking rates in the world, and the changes will have little impact on the profits of multinationals, other countries are already considering similar steps.
The tobacco lobby fought hard against the laws.
It was said that the laws would favour black market trade, resulting in cheaper and more accessible cigarettes.
"The laws will lead to serious, unintended consequences," says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Chinese and Indonesian counterfeiters will offer far greater quantities of these products on Australia's roads.
Others say that the laws have boosted their business.
Sandra Ha from Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, notes that demand for cigarette etui and silicone covers has increased enormously to cover unbearable packaging since British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco failed two months ago at the Supreme Australian Court to challenge the laws.
Zico has sold up to 6,000 units to wholesale stores and is waiting for new stocks.
For us, this is a good deal.
According to experts, the hooks in the popularity of social media are precisely the population to which the plan is aimed.
A number of Australian laws have banned tobacco companies from TV advertising, forbidden them to act as sports sponsors, and forced most traders to stop exposing cigarettes in stores. Now, tobacco advertising has changed to the Internet.
The Australian government has banned internet advertising by local companies and sites, but has no influence on international sites.
"Those who market tobacco and have only one small area left to advertise their products will not get around the Internet," says Becky Freeman, a healthcare researcher at Sydney University.
On social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook Freeman has found an increase in experience reports on trademarks written by "normal people".
One has to ask oneself the question: Is this merely a private person, who finds such a great favor to Marlboro and cigarettes, that she even takes a video for it - or does a marketing agency have to do with it?
British American Tobacco Australia says that instead of focusing on marketing, the industry is focusing on dealing with the new laws.
It has even gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new rules - those countries complain to the World Trade Organisation about unjust trade restrictions, although none of the countries trade more closely with Australia.
A WTO decision is expected in mid-2013.
According to Plibersek, the government has held talks with other countries that are considering similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to issue photographic warnings in 2001.
They have now been extended to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Harder laws are being considered in Great Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many Australian smokers are defiant.
The pictures do not affect me.
I just ignore them.
"You simply take a tilt and put away the box," says Victor El Hage when buying a cigarette box on which a photo is printed with a mouth tumor.
To be honest, there is only one reason why I would stop, and that is my little girl.
James Yu, operator of the tobacco trade "King of the Pack" in downtown Sydney, says the uniform packaging made the filling of his shelves more difficult.
"I used to use an hour to sort in a delivery, now I need four," says Yu.
"The government should have banned cigarettes completely - then we would have told ourselves okay, that's it, we make dense," he adds plainly.
In a constantly electrified world it is nice to be bored
This Thanksgiving I unexpectedly spent five hours at the airport when our plane failed due to mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane.
So I had enough time to get bored with a few thoughts.
I don't want to lie.
Waiting for a flight at the airport for half a day is quite annoying - even if books, magazines and iPhones (and of course tax-free shopping) are available.
But more and more academics and child development experts are leading boredom as something positive.
If it goes after them, it is okay for us - and our children - to be bored occasionally.
In this way, the brain is forced to lose itself in interesting ways, which may promote creativity.
And because most of us today are almost constantly staring at one or the other screen, the benefits of boredom no longer benefit us.
So should we welcome boredom with open arms?
Yes.
And no.
I will come back to that again.
Like many people, I have always assumed that boredom is a relatively current phenomenon that has developed with increasing leisure time.
But Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011) does not see this.
"In fact, boredom has a very long history," he says.
The house walls of Pompeii decorate a Latin graffiti about boredom, which dates back to the first century.
And then there is the question of how we actually define boredom.
According to John D. Eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada, the problem is that boredom has been defined and discussed in many ways.
After a long reading of research literature and the presentation of the idea in front of a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues came to the conclusion that boredom can be defined as the experience of "wanting to do a satisfactory job, but not being able to do this".
Boredom differs from apathy in that the person is not busy, but wants to be.
In apathy, however, there is no urge to do anything.
The key experience of boredom, he says, consists in a "disturbance of the attention process, paired with bad mood and the feeling that time is only slowly passing away".
Boredom can almost sound like depression.
But Professor Eastwood believes, although these two states may be related, bored people see the problem in their environment or the world, while depressed people see the problem in themselves.
Sometimes we believe that we are bored, even if we have difficulty concentrating.
In her study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention" - in German, for example: "The Inactive Mind: The Definition of Boredom under the Attention aspect", which appeared in September in the journal "Perspectives on Psychological Science", Professor Eastwood and his colleagues point to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a volume on which a person read a magazine article.
Some groups heard a loud TV program from the neighbouring room that had nothing to do with the content. Others listened to it at low volume, so it was hardly perceptible, while the third group did not hear these sounds at all.
The people who heard the barely audible television said that they felt more boredom than the other two groups - they had problems concentrating, could not find any reason for them and attributed their difficulties to boredom.
If one tries to concentrate on a difficult or exhausting task, the disturbance of attention can lead to boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, if you perform a monotonous activity - "just like looking for faulty products on a factory conveyor belt, music can distract and help not to feel bored".
In fact, he says, we now know that gnashing and scribbling, often interpreted as a sign of boredom, can even combat them by keeping people physically more attentive.
"Studies have shown that children who are allowed to stamp around learn more and keep more information than those who are forced to sit still," Professor Fenske said.
We all get bored at some point - my delayed flight, a droning loudspeaker, a particularly tiring film.
But some people get bored lighter than others.
In order to measure these differences, researchers developed a "long term susceptibility scale" in the 1980s.
On the scale you will find statements like "Many things I have to do repeat themselves and are monotonous" and "I have so many interests that I don't have enough time for everything".
Using such scales, researchers have found that boys become bored more often than girls, according to Stephen Vodanovich, professor of psychology at the University of Westflorida - especially when it comes to the need for more and greater diversity of external stimuli.
But in general, teenagers are a pretty tense bunch.
In 1991 Reed Larson, professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted almost 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day with a pager.
He found that 32% of adolescents were bored in school and in doing homework, while 23% said they were bored if they were not in school.
But only 3% of parents said they felt bored.
Today, 21 years later, Professor Larson says that he does not know whether the percentage of boredom has increased or decreased.
He is certain, however, that "the youth is perceived as particularly boring", mainly because children and teenagers have no great influence on their daily routine.
So back to my question of origin: Is boredom healthy?
Sometimes not, because in extreme cases it leads to people taking extreme physical risks and falling into gambling or drugs to alleviate them - studies have shown that.
On the other hand, many philosophers and authors examine the relationship between boredom and creativity. Professor Vodanovich, who has been researching the subject for more than two decades, is of this opinion.
"With boredom, the brain wants to tell you that you should do something else," says Gary Marcus, Professor of Psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain does not always know what to do best.
If you are bored and you use this energy to play guitar and cook, you will be happy.
But television may create a sense of happiness in the short term, but it may evaporate in the long term.
So if an iPad is enough for his bored child, it can lead to boredom. However, it has not learned to entertain or control himself, says Professor Fenske.
And he adds: "Self-control transfers itself from one situation to the other".
The child not only learns to talk, but also gets more self-control in other areas.
I do not believe that we should celebrate boredom.
Nor should we be too critical of them.
Instead, our goal should be to make us feel at home, even outside the constant need for activity and technology.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"It sounds as if we should be bored more often. But boredom is the tormenting, ceaseless desire to do something meaningful," he says.
He believes that the truth is that people are only looking for a way to switch off and relax.
"In an environment where we are constantly overstimulated, it is difficult to deal with when the noise is silent."
There is no clear guideline for the new marijuana law in Colorado
The 19-year-old Community College ’ s student and football player Anthony Orozco stands in the south-east of Colorado for a crime that will soon be legal in that state: the possession of a few marijuana rocks and a whistle with which he smoked them.
According to Orozco, he and some friends were on a September day driving in Lamar near the border with Kansas when they were stopped.
After the police officer found marijuana in the car, Orozco was summoned for the possession of drugs and drug utensils - cavalier crimes, each with a penalty of 100 US dollars - and received a court date.
"We are treated like criminals," says Orozco.
But is he also one?
In the uncertain weeks following the state ’ s decision to legalize small amounts of marijuana for its own use, the response to hundreds of smaller drug offences depends less on the law than on the location.
Hundreds of administrative violations revolving around marijuana are already dropped here and in the state of Washington, which approved similar measures.
The police authorities no longer persecute adults over 21 years of age for possession to a small extent. This is legally permitted as soon as the new laws enter into force in the next few weeks.
But prosecutors in Colorado ’ s more conservative districts have announced that they will continue to prosecute existing marijuana lawsuits and are still quoting people in court.
At the same time, several cities, from the suburbs of Denvers to the Western Mountains, agree to prevent new, state-licensed marijuana stores from opening in their communities.
"This situation is developing so quickly that I do not even know what will happen next," says Daniel J. Oates, Chief of Police in Aurora, located east of Denver.
And regulators in the state of Washington also scratch their heads.
They are waiting for guidance on setting up a licensing system for the production, manufacture, distribution and sale of the drug - bearing in mind a deadline of 1 December 2013.
Washington believes that Colorado is in any case ahead of most states in terms of regulating marijuana, where the drug was first legalized for medical purposes and then for self-consumption.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, so the state is well suited to orientation," says Brian E. Smith, Spokesman of the Washington State Spirits Supervisory Board.
But Smith also admits that no place or system can do more than serve in the sense of a rough guide.
"We have no real precedent to follow," he adds.
The Washington Act, called I and 502, will enter into force on December 6, and thus also constitutes the end point of a grey zone in which the state licensing system does not yet exist, but possession is legalized.
And unpleasant practical questions have to be clarified at this time - for example, how the state requirement of an "appropriate access" to licensed marijuana is to be agreed with the ban on cannabis shops within 300 meters around schools, parks, playgrounds and childcare facilities.
"Nowhere will it be harder to find a location for a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in the Seattle agglomeration," says Ben Livingston, spokesman for the Center for Legal Cannabis, a recently formed research group.
On 21 November, Chief Oates sent his staff in Aurora an e-mail stating that the prosecutor would no longer prosecute minor marijuana crimes in persons over 21 years of age, and that the police would "from now on" seek no lawsuits for these crimes.
Chief Oates added that the police would continue to impose urban regulations to regulate growers of medical marijuana and drug traffickers would continue to be persecuted.
In Weld County in the north of Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck represents a stricter view.
After the vote, he stated that his authority would continue to pursue cases of marijuana residence, mainly to encourage consumers to withdraw.
At the moment, 119 persons have to be brought to court for possession of about 50 grams or less marijuana, although many have also been indicted for other crimes.
"Our authority has a duty to prosecute infringements which were criminal offences at the time of the crime," Buck said in a statement.
The reactions are ambivalent even in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the county, no longer indicates adults for the possession of smaller quantities.
District Attorney Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, but also decided not to drop all pending ownership proceedings.
"I don't think I'm wasting my time enforcing the right until it changes," he says.
Although 55% of Colorado voters supported the measure, it was clear from the outset that it would not be easy to reconcile marijuana ’ s personal consumption with the complexities of government and the legal system.
And the contradictory reactions throughout the state revealed a profound discord among local officials about the great green experiment.
District prosecutors are a "cultural barrier", says Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver, who represents defendants in court for marijuana crimes and acts locally as a spokesman for the national organization for the reform of marijuana laws.
"They have spent so much of their lives prosecuting people that they still cannot accept legalization," he believes.
As the first countries to treat smaller amounts of marijuana such as alcohol, Colorado and Washington are traded as national model cases for the legalization of drugs.
While advocates and state officials are preparing for an age of legal sales, they are also nervously waiting for instructions from the federal government to continue to treat the sale and cultivation of marijuana as a criminal offence at federal level.
Advocates of the legalisation movement hope that the Ministry of Justice will give in.
Despite several sensational arrests of consumers and sellers of medical marijuana, the federal government has allowed the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington, and 16 other states to a large extent.
Kevin A. Sabet, former drug advisor to the Obama administration, believes that while detective officials will probably not enter doors to seize smaller amounts of drugs, they will probably refuse to tolerate legalistic government-regulated marijuana under the new legislation.
Several cities in Colorado are not waiting for federal authorities to act.
Even before the election day, some local municipal administrations approved moratoria for new marijuana stores, although they could only open in about a year.
Last week, Montrose, a city in the West, passed a six-month ban, which is likely to be adopted next week.
"We do not want to get into a position where we license someone and then face a major problem at federal level," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the City Council.
Our community voted against this amendment.
We follow what the municipality has chosen and not what the state has chosen.
Many questions are still open.
Petronella Wyatt: I was bullied from Oxford because I am Tory
Not only university students of today are attacked for their views
It has always been my greatest dream to get a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my elder brother had visited that university which I once considered to be the world ’ s greatest temple of knowledge, a modern Greek symposium that promoted the great pillars of civilization – free thinking and tolerance.
But within two weeks of my entry into Worscester College at the end of the eighties - there I had planned to study history - I had packed my suitcases again and so caused the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed in tears.
My friends were confused.
In the Evening Standard it was said that I had gone because I had a problem with fellow students having sex in the adjacent room.
The author A N Wilson mischievously explained that I had left the university because I was forced to drink from damaged cups.
But the truth was less amusing.
I ran away.
Yes, ran, because I suffered from systematic bullying and threats.
Not because of my rather unusual name, or because I had come from a private school.
I had been harassed only for one reason - a reason that seemed all the more narrow-minded and cruel in this alleged cradle of enlightenment: my now deceased father Woodrow Wyatt had been an important adviser to Margaret Thatchers and I advocate the Conservative Party.
Why do I mention this right now?
Now, according to current reports, a new generation of moderate rights students are suffering similar persecution.
The organized and rising hatred of Tory ’ s Oxford students has now developed such dimensions that a group of them last week called for equal rights to benefit gay, disabled and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Junior Common Room (JCR) of Corpus Christi College state that due to their political views they are "often actively isolated, personally attacked and declared undesirable".
They call for a place in their college's Equal Opportunities Committee to ensure that their opinions can be expressed freely.
Her situation was worsened by a recent documentary about political students on BBC Two, "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right", which Netanyahu portrayed as eccentric and neo-Nazis.
Among other things, it showed Joe Cooke, former president of the conservative student association of the University of Oxford, who drove in a roll-Royce and with silver suit and silver-studded walking stick.
At other universities conservative students say they are regarded as "scapegoats for introducing higher tuition fees".
The 20-year-old Luke Black, vice-president of the conservative student association of Nottingham University, said in a Sunday paper: "There is a growing left-wing tendency at universities.
People believe we are like the Bullingdon Club, without getting to know us at all. "
Samuel Roberts, 21 and history student in Corpus Christi, who initiated the request for greater protection, believes that such a climate is "unpleasant." 19 year-old Stephanie Cherill, designated president of the conservative student association of Oxford, says that she has observed a growing rejection of students of moderate rights at JCR.
"This poses a threat to intellectual discourse and to the well-being of members," she says.
In my first weeks in Oxford, I belonged to such a minority.
As an incredibly shy 18 year-old, I arrived in September 1986.
The hatred of the Conservative Party had reached its peak.
Last year, the university voted not to give Margaret Thatcher, a former student, an honorary title due to cuts in higher education.
The atmosphere would have frightened even Stalinists.
In the first days of the first semester of the week, during which new students get to know each other and the tutors, I got a taste of the future events.
I had the experience that the tutors not only tolerated the mockery of Tory ’ s students, but even enjoyed participating.
Political issues such as the miners ’ strike, privatisation and the rejection of the government ’ s sanctions against South Africa ’ s apartheid regime found their way into the tutorial ’ s wood-panelled spaces.
At my first of these events, I was supposed to translate French texts from the 18th century into English. I had not been prepared for what was to come.
"Miss Wyatt", said the tutor Harry Pitt (meanwhile deceased), "please translate the first paragraph".
I stumbled.
Pitt was a small man with a face like a cake dough, and quite hateful.
"Do Thatcher's followers refuse to learn French, or are they just stupid?" he asked me.
The other students giggled.
In my eyes tears resounded.
"I suggest that you take a few French lessons in your spare time - so if you are not too busy with your social activities," Pitt growled at me.
I returned to my room with my head hanging.
That evening I sat alone at the college dinner when someone tapped me lightly on my shoulder.
It was an English student from the second year named James, who introduced himself as a member of the conservative student association.
"I know who you are," he said kindly.
Unfortunately, it is as it is.
Anyone suspected of being Tory is harassed.
For me it is bad enough, but they know that your father Margaret Thatcher is close, so it will be worse for you.
Most Tory ’ s first-semesters pretend to be Labour ’ s supporters.
In a local pub I later tried to disguise myself.
I insisted that I did not agree with Mrs Thatcher on all points.
This trick should prove unsuccessful.
A beginner in philosophy, politics and economics, who ironically visited the conservative Eton College, said to me: "You are the daughter of a fascist pig".
You are polluted.
Other students shared his opinion.
I was perverse and dirty.
"How do Conservatives have sex?" one of them asked me.
They beat each other, right?
I felt like homosexuals had to feel before the more liberal legislation of the United States.
Would I ever manage to live a normal life at Oxford University?
Would I be able to meet like-minded only after darkness?
Should I turn to the Labour Party and suppress my natural inclinations?
The three years that lay before me stretched before my spiritual eye to a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only tutor to openly recognize himself as Tory was Norman Stone, Professor of Contemporary History, who had his seat in my college.
He was hated not only for being a conservative, but also for advising Thatcher on foreign policy and writing speeches for her.
He was rarely there.
He hated the place, found it provincial and petty and rejected it for his Marxist deterministic historical perspective.
In 1997 he accepted a professorship at the University of Bilkent in Ankara in Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he told me.
I began to commute between Oxford and my parents ’ house and found refuge with more open-minded friends and family members in the city.
I told my father that I hated Oxford and why I did it.
He seemed unbelieving.
During his time in the forties, all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said smoothly.
They would never do such a thing, not in my city of dreaming tower tops.
Even my communist friends always displayed perfect manners.
His wet eyes were clouded.
Give the whole a chance.
I'm sure you're just teased.
It would break my heart if you went.
Exhausted by my frequent travels to London, my emotional resistance became weaker.
One of my masculine friends, Tory's followers, had given in to the pressure and renounced his beliefs.
During a tutorial the following week, during which another historical tutor had seriously claimed that I was "an enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
Although I was secretly shattered by shame, I admitted that my parents had brainwashed me and called it "old towel".
The relief lasted only briefly.
It was my father who hit the last nail in the coffin of my Oxford career.
At that time, he wrote two columns a week in the Netanyahu press.
My door was closed.
I hid in my room, and after five minutes my hammers gave up.
When they left, I packed a suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never returned.
You can gladly call me a wintry slaptail.
But no 18 year-old should ever suffer such intimidation and maliciousness in an educational institution.
And even more tragic is that it was Oxford, a university that not only produced 14 Tory prime ministers, but hides behind an undeserved reputation for equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to celebrity"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino - Master of the Couture", which opened this week in London, ABC speaks with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen and other famous customers of the Italian fashion maker.
Somerset House, the former residence of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition about Valentino Garavani.
This was recognized by the designer at the opening of "Valentino - Master of the Couture", a magnificent retrospective for which more than 130 dresses of the Haute Couture were put together, created by his "Maison" in the last 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with his distinctive Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story whose only protagonist is "il signore" Garavani, but who could not have been written without his distinguished clientele.
Valentino always felt fascination for the embroidered and distant world of the nobility.
In the first hall of this exhibition, which will be on view until March 3, there are a number of private letters and photos with the signature of the most exquisite aristocracy, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Princess Marie and Chantal of Greece and Margarita of England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino shows these personal memories as trophies of his social ascent from the humble fashion maker in the city of Voghera in northern Italy to the idol of the international jetset.
To be in love with the nobility does not have to be a disadvantage.
Baroness Fiona Thyssen says Bornemisza: "At least they don't kick their tilt on your splendid carpet, as some beautiful celebrities do from pop music."
In the 60s and 70s they lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular, generous and elegant host.
"We all rejoiced when we were invited to his house in Gstaad," explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, close friends with forgotten beauties such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to celebrity.
And yet he is a star.
Valeria Mazza, in a Valentino dress
Also the Argentine model Valeria Mazza does not forget the charisma of the fashion maker.
Many years ago, after a fashion show at Piazza di Spagna in Rome, we went home to him for dinner.
We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
At every detail of his apartment, the decoration, at the food and at the music one recognized and felt his influence.
"All those invited felt important and loved," recalls the "top model" that began her career at the week of Haute Couture in Paris in 1995.
"He never comes out of fashion because his designs are works of art," she concludes.
Fashion show of origin
The life of Garavani is not a story of obsession, rather of mutual love.
He likes people with good education and the highest titles, and they love him.
One of the Somerset House galleries has been transformed into a glorious 60-metre-long catwalk that proposes a roll swap: the user takes the place of the model and walks along the catwalk to admire a dreamlike "audience" wearing Valentino's masterpieces, such as the dress Jackie Kennedy chose for her wedding with Aristóteles Onassis, the costumes Monica Vitti wore in "La Notte", or a coat of wool and leather belonging to the empress Diba.
In this audience of fashion dolls radiate names like that of Sibilla de Luxemburgo, Gloria of Thurn and Taxis, Mette and Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sofía of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the fashion maker, 2006
Many of these customers say the first Valentino is like the first love, "unforgettable".
I can still remember perfectly.
It was a pants, a shirt, a vest type "Gillette" and a jacket from the autumn / winter collection 1971 and 1972.
"It was a gift from him," says Naty Abascal, one of the designer's muses.
"I prefer him to all the others because of his great love for women and because he emphasizes our beauty," added the ex-Duchess of Feria.
I like the colors he uses very much; they have a lot of light and underline the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Even the princess and opinion leader in fashion Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg cannot forget for the first time when she wore a Valentino.
When I was a teenager in Italy, I dreamed of finally having the age and opportunity to wear one of his evening dresses...
At the end of the 90s it finally happened.
I bought my first Valentino dress for a party in my cousin's castle, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress with flying skirt and a draped top with a décolleté that honours his name.
"It was a dream come true," says Rodrigo d'Arenberg's widow.
"Valentino does not depend on fashion, his obsession is timeless," explains this Italian aristocrat who lives between París, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D'Arenberg keeps her evening dresses of the fashion maker "with absolute care", "because a dress is not only a dress, but also the related memories".
The "King" of Fashion
The grand finale of the exhibition in Somerset House is the wedding dress of Marie's Chantal Miller for her wedding with Pablo de Grecia in 1995.
Four months of work and 25 "magazines" (as the fashion maker called his seamstresses) were necessary to make this ivory silk dress with beads, twelve different embroideries and a four-and-a-half meter long tail.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the supreme authority of the trade press, this dress was a milestone in the Haute Couture at the end of the 20th century, "the return to the customers of the supreme society".
Valentino is now her best copy for years with the Elite's savoir.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest award in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, awarded with the Legion of Honour, Garavani accumulates as many honours as any of the husbands of its customers.
"I have always noticed his refinement, his tranquility, his well-kept and perfect appearance," admits D'Arenberg.
I saw him last time a month ago at a gala dinner at the Museum de Orsay.
He sat at the table of Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a very good friend of mine.
"He was spotless; time leaves no trace of him".
And this says a princess...
The most difficult occupation in the world: the human working animals of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the carriers of the Indonesian volcano put their lives and their health at risk if they carry 70 kilos of sulfur over the steep, rocky paths.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and others work literally in hell.
This is the case with Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn their lives by getting sulphur from the volcano Kawah Ijen in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
For this purpose, he has to climb down to the bottom of his crater every day, where the sulphur gas flowing out of the earth solidifies in contact with the air.
After breaking out large sulphur stones, which can weigh up to 70 kilos in total, he transports them in two bamboo baskets on his shoulders over the steep paths of stone.
It is only 250 meters to the top of the volcano, which rises to a height of 2386 meters, but the exhausted carriers need more than 40 minutes for the ascent in the turtle pace, keeping the balance and putting their steps carefully so that they do not slip and crash.
They know that every step can cost their lives, as happened to a French tourist who crashed years ago on the steep slopes of the Kawah Ijen.
The miners of Kawah Ijen earn 5 Eurocent for every kilo of sulphur they extract.
Upstairs, they pave the way between the tourists, who photograph them like circus monkeys and run with the tirelessly heavy baskets three kilometers to the scale, which a mine company has set up a little further down at a height of 1850 meters
The company is PT Candi Ngrimbi, who has been using the volcano since 1960 and (never better) his workers to whom she pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 Eurocent) for every kilo of sulfur.
This is sold to the petrochemical industry for 10,000 rupees (83 Eurocent) each, because this mineral is widespread in everyday life and is used for the production of matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even for bleaching sugar.
"Since we normally carry 70 kg, we get about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each way," Anto explains, who normally does three routes a day.
For each route he needs three hours, after which he is completely done, but at the end of the day he has 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) together.
What looks like a miserable reward for such an almost inhumane effort, however, is the triple of what he would earn from field work.
"The daily son of the miners here, where 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) are paid a day during the coffee harvest and the average monthly income is two million rupees (167 euros), is very high," explains the carrier, who previously worked as a bricklayer on the tourist island of Bali.
There he earned 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day, and the work was not so hard, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a nearby village, for a reason that is as important in Indonesia as sulfur: "I have married a girl from Bali, where they are Hinduists, and I have brought them to Java to convert them to Islam".
Anto has asthma, breathing with difficulty, coughs frequently and his eyes are irritated because of the toxic gases.
The 27 year old Anto has been jeopardising his life at the Kawah Ijen for three years, whose sulfur has already left his first marks, although he covers his face with a mask and special glasses.
Anto has asthma, breathing with difficulty, coughs frequently and his eyes are irritated because of the toxic gases from the volcano.
This is the price he has to pay for reaching his dream.
"I'm going to work here for another two years because I want to open a shop or learn Spanish or French," he promises in a more than acceptable English.
This likeable and intelligent but life-punished young man could work as a tourist guide, waiter or hotel reception, but instead he does the work of a carrier.
He shares a dirty wooden hut with other carriers and gets up every morning at two o'clock, because the sulfur also flows out at night, where his characteristic yellow color shines bluish in the dark.
Challenging the shadows, he climbs into the crater in the light of a small headlamp on his helmet which he bought from his own money.
About 400 carriers load the baskets with sulphur on their shoulders at the crater bottom.
Despite its large profits, the mining company has not mechanized sulphur mining to save costs, and does not provide any equipment to carriers working on their own account and paying for weight.
They also do not receive a share of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) per camera, which the guardians of this nature park together with the entrance fee of 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) demand from the tourists who come to take pictures of the volcano and the human carrier.
"This work is for animals and not for human beings," protests Madrusin, a 42 year old wearer who has been working at Kawah Ijen for three decades since leaving school.
He is able to carry up to 110 kg and assures that he continues "as long as it goes" because he needs the money for the education of his three children between the ages of 10 and 18.
I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano was my whole life.
Even if the sulfur burns the throat and the eyes itch, when the wind suddenly turns and the miners get stuck in the thick pillars that rise out of the crater, the men are so hard that no one complains about serious diseases... of course except the usual breathing problems, osteoarthritis, pain in the knees and blisters on the shoulders that have deformed from the weight of the baskets.
With the basket on his back, Unainik is only able to carry 50 kg with his 53 years.
Every day he and his companions break 15 tons of sulphur from the volcano, which are transported by three trucks via a goat path between the bushes to the camp in Tamansari 18 kilometers away.
"I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano was my whole life," Unainik explains, opening his mouth wide, in which some teeth are missing.
Of his five children, the eldest also works as a sulphur carrier with his 30 years.
Time is passing, but the poverty is holding generation to generation in one of the toughest professions in the world: those who work as human burdens on Kawah Ijen.
Singapore needs babies to save the economy
The Singaporeans blame them for not having children, for the career, stress and cost of real estate and child education.
"The population of Singapore must grow."
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife: we fulfil our civic duty and we create life!
It seems incredible that the verses are part of an advertisement for mint bonbons, but nevertheless - or just because of this - they became a viral video on YouTube at the beginning of this year in Singapore.
The sentences are part of a rapper ’ s song, the local sayings like “pushing a bao ” (loaf) in the oven to make fun of the low birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising company BBH, which has shot the video, maintains the hope that the commercial reaches in a funny way to draw attention to the problem.
Her creative director Douglas Hamilton says that he wanted to use the power of music to get people to fulfil their "national duty".
This is just something for the internet, so we had to make it funny and funny.
It is the biggest problem in this country.
When it comes to reproducing, we are the worst in the world, so we noticed that it was an issue we had to take care of.
We knew that the government had tried a lot, such as the marketing of perfume with pheromones or the organization of Speed Dating evenings (fast flirts).
Possible that many of these ideas were creative, but they did not necessarily lead to success.
So we thought: why not do something as creative as possible to tackle this problem, such as composing a rap?
1,2 Kinder
Anyone who does not take this issue easily is the government of Singapore.
Every year, it spends 1,300 US dollars on policies to encourage citizens to get more children.
A government package for couples and parents grants up to $15,000 per child, prolongs maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But everything had so far little success.
Singapore is a rich, high-tech city state in south-eastern Asia, also known for the conservatism of its rulers and its strict social controls.
According to its national population authority, the birth rate is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time this rate was over 2 - which is also known as the replacement rate - was in 1976.
So why don ’ t the Singaporeans get more children?
Tan Wei Ming, Director of Marriage and Family Policy of the National Population Authority, says that this is due to "better education" and "greater career opportunities".
"This has enabled people to have considerably more options regarding life goals and to set priorities except to marry and to make a family", she explains.
These changes in social conditions have contributed to the increase in the number of single persons and the delay in marriage and births, the result of which is the reduction in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy aimed at a dramatic increase in immigration to counteract the reduction of the population has led to resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites where the hardly camouflaged xenophobia is flourishing against many new immigrants, especially against the Chinese, who are criticized for keeping wages low and not integrating.
The rise in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the ruling party in Singapore achieved its worst election result since independence last year.
Since the elections, an attempt has been made to correct the problem with higher contributions and levies for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the falling birth rate has the known impact on a nation ’ s economic growth, tax revenues, health costs, and immigration policies, Singapore ’ s example also shows unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to ensure that not so many small apartments are built.
It already has an impact on the housing market.
The Municipal Development Authority has begun to control the number of small apartments known as "shoe boxes" that can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have a living area of 46 square meters and show a great sales success.
However, there is concern that they can promote the lifestyle of the solitary, and that they discourage the construction companies from building large homes for families.
But Lim Yew Soon, general manager of the real estate company EL Developers, says that his "shoe boxes" can be sold much faster than larger residential units.
They are so popular, and the units are sold out by days and even weeks faster than the larger units.
This means that they are much better for our cash flow.
He admits, however, that the new standards give developers clearer orientations, which were previously put obstacles in the way if they wanted to build too many small housing units within a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city state.
Even if these new rules could pave the way for an increase in the national birth rate, talks with the Singaporeans working in the financial district suggest that they will not have a major impact.
"People are heavily stressed, the apartments and also the education are expensive, which is why it is postponed by many," says a young manager.
The children can get others.
"It is important for me to have my own money and time," says another man, about twenty years old.
Men and women lead their careers, the stress and the cost of ownership and education as reasons why they cannot have children.
That is why the Singaporeans have the last word when it comes to getting children - the government can do so much.
The offline private offline is online private
Privacy
According to the dictionary, this is the property of private or "that area of private life where one is entitled to protection from any kind of interference".
What is private for someone under the age of 16?
How is this definition applied to everyday life and social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he is exposed to when he publishes situations he would not share in real life on the Internet?
El Periódico interviewed five young people between the ages of 10 and 15 who are often online.
In four cases, they linked the term to "something very personal" on a personal level and "to the password and the user" when they applied it to social networks.
“I wouldn ’ t post my deepest secrets, ” says Jorge, 10 years old, trying to explain the meaning of“ private ” on websites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had accounts for two years.
"These are very confidential secrets, my mother may know them, but not the whole world," he confirms.
On FB I upload beautiful pictures or pictures of games.
I also spend my time with acquaintances.
“I wouldn ’ t share a photo that isn ’ t mine, or someone who makes the fool, ” he says.
The boy is aware that it is wrong to publish obscene photos, nudes, crimes, or to write insulting or violent comments.
Jorge assures to know 35 friends he has in FB and nine followers in Twitter.
Most are relatives.
Among them also the mother who has the password to one of the accounts.
I signed up to Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if someone answers me, I just upload them" he adds.
"The social networks are entertaining, I can quickly talk to relatives in the distance or with friends" he says.
Asked he answers that he would never accept an invitation from an unknown.
Even if someone recommended him a stranger, he would ignore this.
The case of 14 year old José is different.
The teenager has user accounts in Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask. In Ask he admits not to know 20 of the people he added to his friends list.
"That doesn't frighten me, because we have something in common, for example music," he says.
After indicating the boy no one made him suggestions or asked him for his address or telephone number.
"When someone distorts me or asks me to do so, I simply remove it from my user account," he admits.
José reported to Ask after reading a recommendation in Twitter.
The boy is not unknown to experiences that are known today as cyberbullying.
The friend of a friend was blackmailed in a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He never knew who it was," he assured.
According to José, the victim did not close the user account.
"He did it only privately."
He then explains a number of steps to configure a user account securely.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yes, I would do that if he is unsympathetic to me or I want to wipe out one for him.
"But I know this is cyberbullying," he explains.
Key issues
Marielos Porras, teacher of English with a degree in education and learning, believes that in order to orient children and young people, it must be understood that it is the purpose of social networks to inform.
"The Internet was created as a medium for the search for information, but with the publication of these pages the rules of the game have changed," she says.
Porras explains that the academic Marc Prensky, holder of a Master's degree in Pedagogy at Yale University and author of the work "Digital Natives and Immigrants" formed these terms to explain the phenomenon.
The Digital Natives are they, the children and young people who grew up with this technology.
"We are the digital immigrants who are supposed to teach them where we are still learning," he says.
He explains that this is a complex issue, "because we ask them to have a defined criterion about what may be spread, published or said, at an age where maturity is insufficient."
"They should also be picky, if it is most important to them to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," he adds.
According to the expert, the most effective way to teach children and young people what privacy is is to ask them questions that make them think.
“To tell you they shouldn ’ t do it, doesn ’ t work, ” he says.
Porras then mentions some possibilities: there are things that you would not tell a stranger. Why do you do it on the Internet?
Or: Would you like to publish a photo of yourself, like that you published by a friend?
Do you know what the others publish about you?
Did you ask the other persons for permission before, if you have labeled photos of celebrations?
And another question: do everyone need to know what you are doing in every moment?
Another point is to give them an understanding that they need to act online as they do offline.
They are the same rules.
"Someone outside the Internet acts with respect, morality and other principles, and the same must apply to social networks," he explains.
Monitoring
Estuardo Guardia, university professor, primary school teacher and educational advisor, comments that it is indispensable that parents read carefully the guidelines of social networks.
When they understand all sections, they have solid foundations to talk to their children about the importance of opening one user account on the Internet.
"For example, age, or what you may share or publish," he explains.
According to Guardia, the children must be reminded of the lesson "Don't talk to strangers".
Conclusion of the Unasur Summit without publication of the Lima Declaration
The 6th Summit of the Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without publication of the Lima Declaration, which was previously announced and was to be signed theoretically by the seven leaders present.
Efe repeatedly tried to gain access to the signed document at the 6th Ordinary Session of the Heads of State and Government of the Unasur. Sources in the State and Presidential Chancellery initially announced that they would hand it over after the Closing, but then declared that it would be published at some time on the website of the Peruvian Government.
When asked about the text, they stated that the content was presented to the press by the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala, for short explanations.
Journalists' access to information about the summit was limited at all times.
During the day, only the picture of the Presidential Meeting without sound was transmitted in the press room with the message "private session, limited audio".
The few information circulated among the journalists was received by the press speakers of some of the Unasur governments present at the meeting, but not by the Peruvian spokesman.
The only document that was distributed during the day was the list of participating presidents, causing discomfort among hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who demanded more information.
After that, the Peruvian Presidency sent the media an E-mail with the Summit's "Final Declaration", but it was the Humala Declaration and not the official document to conclude the Summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the Third Summit of South America - Arab States (ASPA), and on this occasion, too, the so-called Lima Declaration, which had been announced earlier, was not published, despite a strong press call.
On the official website of the ASPA you can see that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities stressed that the information systems were available to journalists, but that they restricted access to information to a large extent.
The summit also ended with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to adopt a judgment of the Court of Justice of The Hague, which resolves a border conflict between both countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional meeting and confirmed that they would accept the decision of the ICJ, which begins in The Hague on Monday, in the trial that Lima launched against Santiago, to listen to the pleas of both sides.
"We will follow and execute the judgment on the differences that we are currently bringing to this international court," Humala said together with his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile was, is and remains a country that adheres to international laws, seeks peaceful solutions to disputes, concludes agreements and submits to international courts," adds Piñera, and greeted Humala with a handshake in front of the flags of both countries.
Both presidents confirmed that they would submit to the ICJ after Colombia had brought an action against the Bogota Agreement following a decision on the maritime borders with Nicaragua, which considered it to be a serious mistake, in which it agreed to submit to the judgments of this international court.
The summit was attended by the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, which has been excluded from the Unasur since 2011 after the resignation of its president Fernando Lugo, did not attend the meeting.
The host President Ollanta Humala opened the talks in the morning and ended the summit meeting shortly after lunch in Lima.
The head of state read the final document in which it reported that 16 decisions were taken and that the lines of action for 31 projects between the South American countries were set for an investment of a total of 17 billion dollars.
On the decisions taken, he said that the countries of the Unasur will take "significant steps towards the goal of South American citizenship, to which we are extending the decisions on residence rights."
It announced that measures would be taken to "improve cooperation in the fight against insecurity in cities and against organised cross-border crime, as well as measures to improve access to medicines and the Internet at low prices in all areas of South America and to act jointly and efficiently in the event of natural disasters".
With the crisis in Europe, "economic consolidation (in Latin America) must not be triumphant, but should serve to expand our output and show our peoples a better future," Humala added.
"We have decided to give priority to a series of 31 emblematic projects aimed at improving the geographical links in South America, particularly in rural and border areas... and thus unite our countries and open up new economic forms," said the Peruvian President in a statement.
Among these projects would also be five Peruvian, located on the transverse axes of its territory from the coast to Brazil, and two of which would provide a better connection with Ecuador, although it did not give any further details.
The final document also referred to the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve for its resumption in the Union of South American Nations", from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain an integrated region for prosperity and peace and good neighbourly relations was another aspect highlighted at the summit.
In this sense, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before the start of his participation in the regional meeting that on Saturday in Mexico he expected a meeting with his counterpart of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, in order to treat the maritime conflict respectfully after a judgment of the ICJ called into question by Bogota.
"Perhaps I will meet President Daniel Ortega tomorrow (Saturday)," Santos said.
"We will review all these paths - they are not exclusive, and the agreement with Nicaragua also necessitates talks with Nicaragua," he underlined.
"I hope to be able to tell President Ortega that we will treat this matter as civilised and as respectful as possible," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega would meet in Mexico on Saturday, where they intend to attend the inauguration of the new president of that country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
As part of the summit, the defence ministers of the bloc met ahead of the summit to adopt the 2013 plan of action to strengthen dialogue and consensus on the defence of the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Surinam and Paraguay are members of UNASUR, even if the latter country is currently excluded.
Peru presided over the regional bloc.
"South America must learn how to integrate its citizens," says Rafael Correa
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, today confirmed that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal, with "South America actually learning something from Europe."
Correa, who participated in the 6th summit of the Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which took place in Lima, explained to the state television in Peru that Europeans "killed themselves in the Second World War and in other conflicts" and "are now practically a fatherland."
In this sense, he defended the project of creating a South American citizenship that drives the members of the Unasur.
"The free movement of citizens and workers in all South American countries must be achieved, as is already the case in the Andean Community; however, there are still reactionary sectors seeking a return to the past," he warned.
The President of Ecuador also endorsed the reorganization of the Organization of American States (OEA) under the pretext of reducing the influence of Anglo-Saxon states and taking into account those who signed the San José Convention on Human Rights.
Those who teach never commit themselves to anything, and in return we always sign everything to the South Americans.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is based in Washington and is funded by the United States," he said as an allusion to the political asylum granted by Ecuador to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian ∑.
Correa assured that he did not regret this decision because he did not betray his principles, but fulfilled his "deep democratic values and views on human rights".
He added that there had been "reasoned assumptions at the time that ∑ would be extradited to a third country and that his case would not be respected."
He also criticised the Swedish judiciary, which had asked him to interrogate him on his territory for an alleged sexual offence, while "Swedish jurisprudence allows this by means of a videoconference that could have been carried out via the Ecuadorian Embassy in London."
Correa said that there was a risk that the health and mental condition of ∑ would be affected.
"Since he has been in our embassy, I have not spoken to him, but the Ambassador has informed me that he has an easy problem with the lungs, but not a serious one," said the head of state of Ecuador.
There is, however, a danger that he would take physical and psychological damage because he was trapped in a narrow space and could not perform physical outdoors exercises.
"That would affect the health of every human being," he added.
Correa stated that the solution to the asylum granted to him in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London since the month of June was the granting of a free letter to travel to Ecuador, and that this would be in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe. He stressed that there had been talks with London to find a solution for the imprisoned founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not act with human rights, we do not use this word in this case, but there have been constant talks.
"The solution to this problem lies in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and the European legal authorities, because the lawyer of ∑, Baltazar Garzón, leads a series of proceedings at various European instances," he said.
And 'if Britain grants this licence tomorrow, I think it is done'.
And if Sweden interrogated Mr ∑ at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London or Skype, as Swedish justice allows and has been done in other cases, the problem is resolved.
Correa took the opportunity to confirm himself as a defender of press freedom and said that what he did not tolerate is "the mediocrity, the evil intention and the lie that invalidate freedom of expression."
"The biggest enemies of press freedom are not the bad and perverse politicians, but bad journalists who strive for profit and blackmail," he said.
In this sense, he congratulated himself that Ecuador is no longer dominated by such journalists "nor by bankers or hegemonic and petty-bourgeois countries", and anticipated that he would "deepen the revolution in a re-election to continue in this right direction."
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto against Paraguay in the Unasur, at least until his next elections, arguing that the organism "must remain hard and must not allow any opportunism and any coup d'état disguised as legal," because it "destroyed the legitimacy of democracy in Paraguay."
The President of Ecuador also considers the wish of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua the maritime borders between the two countries "absolutely justified" now and after the judgment of the International Court of Justice of The Hague, which was imminent in Nicaragua.
This judgment is not currently being implemented.
It is a problem between a South and a Central American state.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome in the pursuit of a common path.
They must be treated comprehensively so that they can be overcome and looked forward.
Likewise, he trusted in a good conclusion of the disputes over the maritime borders between Peru and Chile before the same court, saying that "it is right for Latin America to appeal to international authorities if both countries commit themselves to accept the judgment, even if it is very hard."
Regarding the possibility that he will stand as a candidate for the next presidential elections in Ecuador in order to achieve his third consecutive mandate, he stated that he saw this opportunity "with great optimism and joy, although sometimes it is very difficult."
Correa assured that if he lost the elections in February 2013, he would withdraw from political life.
Power has never interested me personally, but in such unfair circumstances as Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
"My political movement had the belief that it was I who guaranteed this likely victory, so I have to live up to this responsibility," he said.
If I were to win, it would be my last period as president, then I withdraw from public life.
This also applies if we lose.
"That is decided," he explained.
Correa also referred to the treatment of the health problems of the President of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, in Cuba.
I have just spoken to the Vice-President of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro, who told me that he went there for a planned, routine treatment and that he would be expected to return to Cuba after the election campaign.
"It does not mean a relapse in President Chávez's state of health," he commented.
The Ecuadorian leader today participated in Lima at the 6th Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which ended with the call for greater regional integration to ensure sustainable progress, equality and security.
Cause for a death because of AIDS is a too late detection today
Fabrizio was 21 years old when the result of the investigation was confirmed: HIV positive.
"It was as if a bomb hit," he says about the moment when he received the diagnosis that the doctor "tried to weaken" without noticeable success.
He hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness alone and began to inform himself about it; and this with such commitment that he just celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients of the HIV unit of the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), into which he came after several fights in 1994.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immune deficiency of HIV for 22 years, which was hard to imagine at the beginning of the 1990s, when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigmata.
At that time, even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye "because it led to a dead end."
At that time, AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today it is possible to survive this syndrome with quality of life.
However, many people still come to the clinic who know nothing about their disease and where the virus has already done damage and has exhausted their immune system, and who are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after AIDS appeared in the world, i.e. after the occurrence of the first reported cases, "the great success today means that the survival of a patient receiving treatment in good time and the survival of the general population are exactly the same," said the head of the HCG's HIV unit, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, saying that this information was supported in April this year by a respected scientific publication.
The specialist for infectious diseases and HIV / AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that since 2008, the scientists concluded that while AIDS was not a death sentence, the years of survival and quality of life depended on the degree of impairment of the immune system of persons at the beginning of the treatment, and that those who are not drug dependent had greater chances: up to 30 years with a count of 200 CD4 and 50 years with a count of 500 CD4.
Simply put, the above remarks mean that those who receive positive diagnosis of HIV at the age of 25 can "easily become 75 years old as long as they are under control", said the skilled person.
In order to be able to correctly classify this progress, it must be remembered that the life expectancy of Mexicans today is on average 76 years.
Even if mortality has decreased significantly in recent years (in Mexico, the number of people dying of AIDS has decreased from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (ONUSIDA annual report)), it is still true that 60% of patients registered in the national database have died since AIDS appeared.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and by May of this year, there are already 187 deaths; however, it is assured that there has been universal access to antiretroviral medicines since 2005.
- So why do people still die from it?
- In my opinion, the problem is not access to treatment.
This is my opinion, and so is in our hospital.
At least in the past 12 years we have had no supply problems with the drugs. The problem is that people come in a far more advanced state because they do not know their infection state, i.e. in very late stages of the disease.
He makes a striking statement: "Nine out of ten patients come to us if they already have an accompanying infection. In order to be able to influence global mortality, more early diagnoses are required, which is why all persons who need this must be offered massive detection tests."
The experts and officials of the Consejo Estatal de Prevención del Sida en Jalisco (Coesida) (State Committee on AIDS) and the patients like Fabrizio, who carried out his test at a private laboratory, are in agreement with this proposal, for the only reason that it had been done by a friend of him who, despite his young age, was already in the AIDS phase and even had the Kaposi -sarcoma (a cancerous tumor), which is one of the usual complications.
Everything is different when you know that you have AIDS.
Some think they will die and don't want to hear anything.
"If I already have to die, then I prefer to burst three times", they say in my case.
The change was towards improvement, I feed myself well, exercise and take the medication.
Today his parents only know that he had cancer.
I live a normal life, like everyone else.
"I work, do a lot, have an active but responsible sex life, I pay attention to my health and that of the other person," says Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimate details with MILENIO JALISCO in order to animate with his testimony those who are afraid today within the framework of the worldwide AIDS Day.
They should test if they belong to the risk group. The sooner they know whether they are HIV positive, the better, and if they already know the diagnosis, they should learn how to live responsibly like all people.
His news is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
There are big holes between health programmes and ordinary citizens, Ricardo Salazar, journalist from Guadalajara, who has taken up the cause of HIV, explains.
And the most important thing is prevention.
In the places "the distribution of condoms was actually increased; in the past they were given individually, now they give us packages with a hundred pieces, which is already good, but there are still people who do not have access to a condom," he said.
Young people are among the risk workers for new infections.
"Why do you need this?" is a widespread mockery of social workers, orientation personnel in schools, employees in pharmacies and in the health system who do not want to expose themselves to young people, the correspondent assured.
He suggested reorienting this inefficient distribution; the condoms should not only be behind the counter, but also in outputs in public toilets of facilities that are often visited by young people.
Promiscuity should not be promoted.
They should not be paid for the beer and motel, as Governor Emilio González replied to the question of whether pre-conservatives would be distributed under his administration.
"Sexuality does not look like this; it is best to bring the condoms closer to those who already do a sexual activity," he summarized.
Key data of Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The state is nationally 4th in new and cumulative AIDS cases, and 13th in terms of HIV.
92% of contagious cases occur via sexual intercourse, 6% via blood and 2% perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people live with HIV because there are 4 or 5 people who do not know each case.
After the United States Court of Appeal has upheld a ruling that does not recognise the restructuring of the liabilities of the Vitro Group achieved through a trade course in Mexico, an ominous precedent is created for each national company with branches in the neighbouring country that has payment problems.
So it could be said that the procedures for the survival of companies that allow Mexican laws do not apply in the country of stars and stripes in contradiction to international agreements.
In practice, the judgment received on 15 June by Judge Harlin Hale at the Bancarrotas Court in the northern district of Texas leads Mexican companies to be helpless in confiscating their property beyond the Bravo River.
However, the decision opens the door to the largest glass manufacturer in Mexico to appeal to the United States Supreme Court for three inconsistencies.
While the judge of the case points out that creditors must be subject to the bankruptcy law of the United States, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeal, based in New Orleans, says first that the main case is the trade course dealt with in Mexico.
The first point would mean that international cooperation in procedures for insolvency of cross-country companies is not known.
Indeed, for this purpose, the United Nations model law was created for the unification of international commercial law, with the American Law Institute being used as a mediator.
Secondly, the judgment stipulates that without the votes of the companies after recognition of the liabilities in the bankruptcy mass that Vitro ’ s branches had with their parent company, the majority required for the restructuring of the liabilities would not have been achieved.
However, this possibility is recognised by Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro is not the first case in which this scheme has been approved.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose liabilities among companies of the group were confirmed by the Instituto Federal de Concursos Mercantiles (Federal Institute for Trade Concourses).
It is also true that, after deduction of the votes of the branches, the creditors of Vitro, the creditors who complained to the courts of the United States against Vitro, i.e. the vultures, such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have achieved a majority.
The vote would have been 45 percent against 37 percent.
This is not taken into account by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, Vitro is to blame for his difficult situation as of 2008 in the context of the major economic crisis in the United States, which gave the country blows.
For this reason, the González Sada family objects to the same Court of Appeal, so that the vote takes place in plenary, that is, from all judges, because only three of them voted.
If this is not allowed, the Cerciorare shall lodge an objection requesting the review of the case by a higher instance, in this case by the United States Supreme Court.
The most serious thing about this case is that the court left aside a document sent by the Mexican government under the Figura amicus curiae (Friend of the Court), which describes the procedure carried out by Vitro in the framework of the Commercial Concourses Act, and in which it is pointed out that it had adhered strictly to the agreements signed by both countries in order to comply with Chapter 15 of the United States bankruptcy law.
It is also noted that the country has adhered to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules laid down for cases of cross-border insolvency that guarantee equal treatment for debtors and creditors.
Two-band carambole: a blow to vitro and the country.
General balance sheet
After the advertisements by the Mexican trade unions for air traffic against the former owner Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, accused of fraudulent administration, did not progress for several months, the Asociación Sindical de Pilotos Aviadores (union association of pilots) finally made progress.
The request made by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau has now filed criminal proceedings against the National Banking and Securities Commission, which is accused of obstructing the judiciary.
After that, the supervisory authority has systematically refused to inform the main administration of the Republic of a transaction carried out by the entrepreneur in order to withdraw 198 million pesos from Bank IXE ’ s fiduciary account F / 589 under the name Mexicana de Aviación.
These funds were used to purchase shares of Administradora Profesional de Hoteles (the professional hotel management).
As you know, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
Dragon Mart is surrounded
At a weekend meeting at a forum of the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, academics, entrepreneurs and general members of civil society have decided to create a broad front to oppose the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancún.
As you know, we are talking about a huge sales and distribution center in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean with products from the country beyond the wall, supplemented by a residential area for the employees of 150 companies.
In the run-up, the Canacintra (the National Chamber of Manufacturing Industry) has reached uniting the governors in the south-east to oppose the monumental institution that partially destroyed protected areas and is the mother of all industrial threats.
ACTA is dead
Because the government did not comply with a request from the Senate to explain under what conditions and circumstances the Mexican Ambassador to Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement known under the English acta, the matter has already been archived according to the Mexican Institute of Intellectual Property.
As you know, these measures were taken, although the Senate had not considered the possibility because it considered them to be a violation of freedom of expression in social networks.
Homex long term
In the quest to pay long-term liabilities without impairing short-term liabilities, the construction company Homex brings stock market certificates over 500 million pesos onto the market.
The issue is the first of four identical emissions to promise interest payments every 28 days.
Founding of Competival
Made up of NYCE, e-Quálity and Kernet, leading information technology companies, a group of companies was founded under the name Competival, whose objective is the service of the software cluster in Central and South America.
The corresponding investments are over $1.5 billion.
Héctor "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
The globetrotter of basketball, Héctor "Hetin" Reyes, was connected to the basket sport for more than 60 years and travelled the whole world.
Few in Puerto Rico have such a great intellectual collection of the history of the basketball of the country as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
Before being tied to the wheelchair by a stroke in 2008, Rexes was part of this sport for 6 years, whether as players of lower classes, players of the first national league, proxy and head of the BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or president of the basketball federation.
"For the rest of my life, I put on many hats in basketball, even several at the same time when I was president of the BSN, general manager of the national team and president of the association in the 90s," recalled Reyes during a visit of Primera Hora to his home in Bayamón, where he lives with Isabel, his loyal wife for more than 50 years.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes does not exaggerate with this statement.
The walls of his house are almost all decorated with photos and memories of his long career and testify them.
Bayamón in the heart
The most emotional memories are those that recall his time at the Vaqueros from the mid-1950s as a player until 1982, where he celebrated his 15th anniversary as co-director or managing director of the club.
"These were my best years I enjoyed the most because I was allowed to be part of eight Vaqueros championships since 1967 as Managing Director, Co-Managing Director or Trainer.
There were many fulfilling years, including the five consecutive championships from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to a 1981 championship, the year of Jerome Mincy ’ s debut at BSN.
From then on "Cuco" Ortiz took over, who was a very good administrator ", says Reyes.
I still know that Gene Bartow, who worked as a trainer and was employed at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), told me: "I have a very strong and 2 m tall player.
Do you want it? "
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico ever had.
Bartow then recommended the release specialist Raymond Gausse, who was one of our best throwers.
I still know, as he said, that if Mincy had enabled a championship for Bayamon, Gausse would provide another.
The mastery of the Vaqueros with Gausse was granted to him, but already from a distance, because he was already in the top position of the association in 1988.
At that time he preferred to enjoy his executions and those of Mincy in the national team.
I still know when we won the US for the first time at the pre-Olympic tournament in Mexico.
After that came the World Cup in 1990, in which we took fourth place, which should have been bronze if not this Canadian referee, who let us repeat the last turn for the second time, said Reyes.
Was this group of the World Cup the best national team you have ever seen in 1990?
She is among the best, as well as those who won against the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite is the team of the Pan-American Games 1991 in Cuba, where we won gold and offered the team of the USA a fight, as at the time when they won bronze against us in the World Cup.
In that team not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz) were present again, but also the young players (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not be there in 1990 because of a knee injury.
A team that was perhaps not the best in terms of personalities, but with which we won a gold medal and which gave us great pleasure, was that of the pre-Olympic tournament in Neuquén, Argentina in 1995.
With players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner as a substitute for the blocked players because of the events at the Pan American games in Mar del Plata, we won the gold medal against every forecast.
Who was the best player of Puerto Rico?
This was without doubt Piculín Ortiz.
Its numbers at the level of international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated this level as Piculín did.
And this without considering his career in the various leagues in which he has played.
Who was the best coach from Puerto Rico?
That is a difficult question.
We had a number of good coaches like Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
Of the boys I like the work of Leo Arill well.
What do you think is the best you have achieved in the association?
I was part of the most successful era of the national team from 1988 to 1995, which included the BSN at the beginning of the 90s up to 17 teams in one season.
What else can you do?
There are things that I would have introduced, such as the regionalisation of the lower categories.
That the guys in Ponce, for example, only play in their area and only meet teams from other corners of the island in the national playoffs.
Today the children make unnecessarily many journeys and games.
At least I see the result of the prescribed training and courses for coaches, table and arbitrators.
I am proud of that.
What are you doing today?
I like listening to music, watching videos of my time in YouTube, enjoying my grandchildren and now and then I go to a basketball game.
And of course I enjoy the company of my wife Isabel, who was always at my side.
Larry Hagman is dead
Larry Hagman was born on September 21, 1931 in Forth Worth (Texas) and became famous worldwide with his role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R". In the television series "Dallas", where he played a ruthless, insidious and manipulating businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the oil magnate J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of the greed of the 80s, is dead.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who came back this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas", died Friday afternoon due to cancer complications according to a family press release from The Associated Press by Warner Bros., producer of "Dallas".
"Larry was back in his beloved birthplace, Dallas, where he once again played the iconic role he liked most," said the family.
The family of Larry and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for the celebrations of Thanksgiving.
Linda Gray, who played the role of his wife in the original and subsequent series, was with Hagman when he died in Dallas Hospital, her journalist Jeffrey Lane said.
He made joy to all who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, funny, loving and talented, and I will miss him very much.
"He was an original person and lived life to the fullest," Gray explained in a message.
Hagman was diagnosed with cirrhosis in 1992, and he admitted that he had drunk a lot for years.
In 1995, a malignant tumor was detected in his liver, and he underwent transplantation.
In the years before "Dallas" Hagman became known on television as a nice guy in the years 1965 to 1970 with the sitcom "enchanting Jeannie" of the television station NBC.
There he played the astronaut Tony Nelson, whose life is turned upside down when he meets an attractive "jinn" (played by Barbara Eden) who will live with him at home.
He was also a performer of two comedies, which were broadcast only for a short time, such as e.g. The Good Life "(NBC, 1971) and" Here We Go Again "(ABC, 1973).
His cinematographic works included well-evaluated roles in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his masterful interpretation of the enchanting despicable J.R. that made Hagman a superstar.
The dramatic series of CBS on the Ewing and other characters in their surroundings was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The advertising slogan "Who shot at J.R.?", which was supposed to create expectation for an episode full of emotions, where the figure of Hagmann was almost killed, led to an international speculation, and millions of dollars were wagered in betting houses.
The series thus achieved a spectator record at that time.
When the answer was known in a chapter in November 1990, it was seen by an average of 41 million spectators who transformed "Dallas" into the second most widely seen entertainment program since the end of "MASH" in 1983, which had 50 million viewers.
It was Kristin, the sister-in-law of J.R. (interpreted by Mary Crosby) who had shot.
J.R. had weaned her and threatened to portray her as a prostitute if she did not leave the city, but others also had reasons for wanting to see him dead.
Hagman interpreted the role of Ewing as a corrupt, insatiable man with a charismatic smile: a sneaky businessman and unfaithful husband who sought to have his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray) instructed.
"I know what should stand on the tombstone of J.R.," Hagman said in 1988.
It should be called "Here rests the honourable citizen J.R. Ewing".
This is the only business he has not won.
Victoria Principal, co-actress of the original series, remembered Hagman on Friday as an "enormous personality on and outside the screen".
He is unforgettable and irreplaceable for millions of worshippers in the world and remains in our hearts, who were fortunate enough to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast a few months ago with great success in the TV channel TNT.
The recording of five chapters for the second season was completed, and a sixth chapter was just filmed, informed the station.
There was no immediate explanation from Warner or TNT about how Hagmann ’ s loss would be dealt with in the series.
Born in Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who played classical works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a teenager when she got Larry during her marriage with lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck on the stage in New York in the early 1950s, then served in the Air Force in England from 1952 to 1956.
There he met the young designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in the Californian city of Malibu, where many celebrities have their residence.
In 2001 he titled his memoirs "Hello Darlin: Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
"I didn't write anything about which I thought it might harm someone or affect him in any way," said the Associated Press at the time.
After the liver transplantation, he worked for liver donations and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist anxious patients.
"I advise them, give them courage, I meet them when their operations are imminent and after," he explained in 1996.
I would like to give them some consolation, such as "no fear, it is a bit uncomfortable the first time, but it will go you well".
He also campaigned against smoking and participated in several campaigns.
Beginning of the course, which studies the "End of the World"
Every week, students examine apocalyptic issues such as nuclear war, zombies, virus and germs, and global warming.
Every semester, when the religious professor decided to hold a course on the end of the world, he knew that he had an irresistible fishing hook: the end of the Mayan calendar's "long backward counting" on December 21, many people believed it meant the end of the world.
But Charmé had no idea what to expect in the following two months: the destructive hurricane Sandy, which some called "Deudarmaggedon", and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place from which the Christian theorists believe that the Apocalypse begins.
"I did not notice that this will be the most apocalyptic semester ever," said Charmé this week to the students at Rutgers University of Camden (New Jersey).
If someone analyzes what has happened in the world today, as if we were thirty days away from it, this would be a really good period.
And he recalls that the bad is good for those with apocalyptic mentality.
And he is not the only professor who offers courses on the "end of the world" this semester, which should actually be the last in history.
In Temple, the associate professor Barry Vacker gives the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World."
Every week, students examine apocalyptic issues such as nuclear war, zombies, virus and germs, and global warming.
"We analyse why these ideas spread over time," he said, as well as the way in which hypothetical scenarios are offered that lead to a certain human behavior.
For example, when nuclear material comes into the hands of terrorists, a war could break out.
This month the students analyzed films with apocalyptic content and examined how they could be compared to real life.
"I tried to inform the students about what is possible, probably, credible and impossible," said Vacker.
On the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, the professor of Latin American history Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an associate professor of art history and anthropology, formed a team to offer a course called "The End of the World".
“We don ’ t pick up in 2012 so that we can always keep the option of reorganizing the course in case the world doesn ’ t go down, ” Restall said.
Despite the "imminent decline", students have to study, create projects and take part in final exams.
In Penn State, the final exam is held on the eve of the Apocalypse, which is why students have no other chance than to "continue working until the night when the world is supposedly coming to an end," said Restall.
The courses were very popular.
"In two hours there were no more places" said Restall about his course for students with a high average, which filled with 35 students.
For weeks before the start of the semester, we received e-mails from students who asked whether places were still free.
The students, for their part, assure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"It's fascinating to see what people are doing to comfort themselves," said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student in Rutger's Camden for Religion and Sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey.
Apocalyptic sect or religious morality is actually just a question of consolation or lack of it.
The 25-year-old student Will Wekesa for psychology and nursing explains that he has seen all apocalyptic films.
"I have never heard of a lesson where it is taught," he said.
I enjoy it.
But none of the students surveyed - and less a professor - said they believed in the last date of December 21.
"Our first project dealt with the Mayan prophecy, and in a certain way we discredit it," said Julie Zeglen, student last year in Temple, 21 years old and from West Chester.
The Mayas never predicted the end of the world; it is just a key point in the calendar, said Restall.
He notes, however, that in Western society there is an apocalyptic fear that goes back several centuries when people responded to changes in their surroundings with the prediction of the end of the world.
The Internet has increased this speculation.
"People don't think that way elsewhere," he says.
This is mainly the case in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at the University of La Salle, who is teaching in the Philippines this year, quickly answers the question of whether he would know there a course about the "end of the world".
"The Philippines do not participate in the end of the world," he wrote as an indication of an exception to a higher authority.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall pointed out that over the years many days were spoken of by the last court, and said that if nothing happened on December 21, "people immediately think of a new date" or philosophized that December 21 was the beginning of a seven-year period, according to which the end of the world would come.
Students and professors take this date easily.
Several said they want to go to celebrations about "the end of the world".
"Maybe I call a few friends so we can laugh together," said Samira Ford, a 20 year old student for communications.
