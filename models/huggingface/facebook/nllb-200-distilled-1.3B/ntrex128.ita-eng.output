Members of the Welsh Assembly are worried about 'making themselves look like clowns'
Some Members of the Assembly are feeling dismay at the proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This proposal was the result of plans to change the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the Assembly from across the political spectrum are concerned that this may sound ridiculous.
A Labour Assembly member said his party was worried it might rhyme with Twp and Pwp".
For readers who don't live in Wales: in Welsh, twp means jerk and pwp means poop.
A member of the Plaid Assembly said that the group as a whole was not happy and suggested alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said he was open to the name change, but stressed that only a small verbal step separates MWP from Muppet (clown).
In this context, the Welsh letter W is pronounced similarly to the English Yorkshire pronunciation of the letter U.
The Assembly committee, which is currently drafting the names changes, said: 'The final decision on any descriptors of what the Assembly members will be called will obviously be a matter for debate by the members themselves.'
The Government of Wales Act 2017 granted the Welsh Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which showed broad support for the possibility of convening the Welsh Parliament.
As regards the title of Assembly Members, the Commission expressed its preference for Welsh Parliament Members or WMPs, but the MWP option received more support in a public consultation.
The MAs are apparently proposing alternative options, but the difficulties in reaching consensus could prove a headache for President Elin Jones, who is expected to present a legislative proposal on the changes within weeks.
The reform law will include further changes to the functioning of the Assembly, including regulations on the exclusion of MAs and the design of the committee system.
The MAs will get the final vote on their names during the legislative discussion.
Macedonians go to the polls for referendum on changing the country's name
On Sunday, voters will decide whether to change the name of their country to Republic of North Macedonia.
The popular vote was held in an attempt to end a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long said that the name of its northern neighbour represents a claim on its territory and has repeatedly opposed its EU and NATO accession applications.
President of Macedonia Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the referendum on the name change, said he would not consider the outcome of the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say the name change is simply the price to pay for joining the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's are going silent while the churches of Harlem are struggling.
"The elders I spoke to said that in the past there was a bar and a church on every corner", Adams said.
"None of them are here today".
He explained that the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
"People socialize differently today", he explained.
"Bars are no longer the neighborhood saloons people go to regularly".
As for the churches, he worries that the money from the sale of the assets will not last as long as the leaders expect, and that sooner or later they will go back to where they started".
Churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment buildings with condominiums filled with the kind of people who won't help the neighborhood's remaining shrines.
"The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings are white", he says, "and for that reason they will rush the time when these churches close completely because it is unlikely that many of the people who move into these apartments will become members of these churches".
Both churches were built by brotherhoods before Harlem became a black neighborhood - Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation left in the 1930s.
A black congregation that used to worship in a nearby church took over the building.
St. Martin's was purchased by a black congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott against retailers on 125th Street, one of Harlem's main shopping streets, who refused to hire or promote black people.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but as Father Johnson's parishioners planned its reconstruction, they also ordered the carillon.
The Reverend David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the carillon the "Bells of the Poor".
The expert who played the carillon in July called it differently: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also pointed out that it was the world's first carillon to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to a larger carillon at the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said St. Martin's didn't replace him.
What has been staged at St. Martin's over the past few months has been a complicated plot by architects and contractors, some introduced by lay church leaders, others by the Episcopal diocese.
The parish assembly, the governing body of the parish, made up of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July about their concerns that the diocese was trying to discharge costs on the parish assembly even though the latter had not been involved in hiring architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners have complained about a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark injures 13-year-old diving for lobster in California
Officials say a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy while diving for lobsters in California on Saturday, the opening day of lobster season.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard a boy scream and swam to him with a group of people to pull him out of the water.
Hammel thought at first it was just enthusiasm for catching a lobster but then he realized the boy was screaming "I've been bitten!"
I was bitten!'
His entire collarbone was torn, he said he noticed Hammel once he reached the boy.
"I shouted to everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" added Hammel.
The boy was flown by helicopter to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was hospitalized in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is not known.
Coast Guard Captain Larry Giles said during a news conference that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but that it was not considered a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper chest.
Authorities have banned access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigative and security purposes.
Giles said there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to boost its beauty business in the UK
Sainsbury's is challenging Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with department store beauty aisles assigned to skilled assistants.
As part of the major push towards the UK's £2.8bn beauty product market, which continues to grow as sales in the fashion and homewares sectors decline, larger beauty aisles will be tested in 11 stores across the country and adopted in more stores next year if successful.
Investment in beauty comes at a time when supermarkets are looking for new ways to use shelf space once used for televisions, microwaves and household goods.
Sainsbury's said it would double the size of its beauty product offering to 3,000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees ranges will take up more space with branded areas similar to those found in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its boutique makeup range to make most products vegan - a quality increasingly demanded by younger shoppers.
In addition, perfume retailer The Fragrance Shop will be testing the permits at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, South London and a second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later in the year.
Online shopping and a shift towards buying small amounts of food products daily from small neighborhood stores have forced supermarkets to do more to convince people to buy from them.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, said retail outlets will increasingly resemble department stores as the supermarket chain tries to resist discounts like Aldi and Lidl by offering more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury's has introduced Argos stores in hundreds of stores and has also introduced several Habitat stores since it bought the two chains about two years ago, and this strategy has boosted grocery sales and made acquisitions more profitable.
The supermarket's previous attempt to re-glaze its beauty and pharmaceutical departments ended in failure.
Sainsbury's tried a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s but the synergy ended in a dispute over the sharing of revenue from pharmaceutical outlets in supermarkets.
The new strategy was adopted after Sainsbury's sold its 281-store pharmaceutical business to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125 million three years ago.
Lloyds was expected to play a role in the programme, with the addition in four stores of an extensive range of luxury brands of skincare products, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Chief Commercial Officer at Sainsbury's, said: "We have transformed the look of our beauty department to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be available to offer advice.
Our range of brands has been developed to meet every need and the inviting environment and convenient locations make us an attractive destination for beauty products, in contrast to the old way of shopping".
Peter Jones 's furious after Holly Willoughby walks away from an £11 million deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones is furious after TV presenter Holly Willoughby pulled out of an £11 million contract with her trendy brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for his Truly brand of home furnishings and accessories.
The couple's business had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old This Morning host took to Instagram to announce her departure.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragons Den star Peter Jones furious after he retired from their lucrative trendy brand business at the last minute to focus on his new exceptional deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Some sources claim that Jones was "furious" when the TV golden girl admitted during a meeting held at the headquarters of her business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts - worth £1.5 million - did not leave her enough time to devote to their Truly brand of homewares and accessories.
The business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was estimated to double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at around £11 million.
As soon as Willoughby, 37, took to Instagram to announce his departure from Truly, Jones left Britain to head to one of his holiday homes.
According to one source, "Truly was undoubtedly Holly's top priority.
It had to be her long-term future that would commit her for the next 20 years.
His decision to quit left everyone involved utterly speechless.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, they were so close to launch.
There's a warehouse full of products at Marlow's headquarters, ready to go".
Experts believe the departure of the This Morning presenter, one of the UK's most profitable stars, could cost the company millions due to heavy investment in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and homewear and possible delays in launching the brand.
And it could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin were friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby co-founded Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined the company as president in March.
The couples spent their vacations together, and Jones owns a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become the M&S brand ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin as the host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night that he "does not wish to comment on his business dealings".
Harsh words and then we fell in love
He joked about the criticism he would receive from the media for making a comment that some would consider "unpresidential" and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in his voice imitating the news anchor.
"I gave up nothing".
He stressed that Kim is interested in a second meeting after the first in Singapore in June was hailed by Trump as a huge step toward denuclearization of North Korea.
But the negotiations for denuclearisation are at a standstill.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho addressed world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea had not observed an "equivalent response" from the US to North Korea's initial disarmament operations.
Instead, he stressed, the US is continuing to impose sanctions to keep the pressure on.
Trump has given a much more optimistic view of this speech.
"We are getting good results with North Korea", he said.
"We were about to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
Now we have this great relationship".
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had yielded positive results: an end to missile tests, the release of hostages and the repatriation of the last American troops.
And he defended his unusual strategy by describing his relationship with Kim.
"It's easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this crowded field, we would have about 200 people right here in front of us", Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake devastate island in Indonesia, killing hundreds
In the wake of the Lombok earthquake, for example, NGOs were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10% of Lombok's population had been displaced, a national emergency had not been declared, a prerequisite for international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have been very clear that they do not want international assistance, so it's a bit complicated", Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is organizing a team to go to Palu, it is not yet certain that the foreign staff will be able to work on the ground.
Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, said Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to decide whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the aid.
Given the constant earthquakes that are affecting Indonesia, the country remains terribly unprepared for the fury of nature.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not common on other coasts.
The apparent lack of a tsunami warning in Palu, although the warning was given, probably contributed to the loss of lives.
Under the best of conditions, moving between the many islands of Indonesia is tricky.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship docked in Lombok to assist earthquake victims is heading to Palu but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has made improving Indonesia's crumbling infrastructure the focus of his election campaign and poured money into roads and railways.
But funding shortfalls have hit Joko's administration as it prepares to run for re-election next year.
Joko also faces pressure from persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have embraced the more conservative branch of religion.
Over 1,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands displaced from their homes as a result of street fighting between Christian and Muslim gangs, who fight using machetes, bows and arrows and other crude weapons.
Look , Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool is tied against Chelsea .
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat to Chelsea with a 89th-minute point on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri as he was about 25 yards from Chelsea's goal, with his side down 1-0.
He touched the left ball before he hit the second pitch.
The attempt passed high above the door frame as it veered toward the upper right corner of the net.
The ball finally fell behind Kepa Arrizabalaga and bagged into the net.
"You just try to get in position, get to the ball and players like Shaq always play as far forward as possible, so I tried to create as much time as possible", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming and I touched him and I didn't think too much about it and I shot".
Chelsea won 1-0 in the first half after a 25-minute goal from Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The Blue's center forward passed Mateo Kovacic in the heel before splashing away near the halfway mark and shooting into Liverpool's half.
Kovacic made a quick pass to center field.
So he made a beautiful pass that brought Hazard into the area.
Hazard has overcome the defense and finished on the second pole with a left-handed goal over Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the Champions League group stage at 15:00 on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 15:00 on Thursday in London.
Indonesia tsunami death toll rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the country's disaster management agency said Sunday morning.
Several people were reported trapped in the rubble of collapsed buildings after the 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck the country on Friday, generating waves up to 6 meters high, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a news conference.
The city of Palu, with a population of over 380,000, was strewn with debris from collapsed buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been launched after a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7.55am with stab wounds at Grayson Mews in John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police are asking anyone who may have seen or heard anything in the area to contact them.
Detective Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is still in its early stages but I would like to appeal to anyone in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead who has seen or heard anything suspicious and urge them to contact us.
I would also like to appeal to anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something on dashcam, to contact us because they may have information of great importance to our investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead and was found inside a property.
This afternoon, some friends who claim to know the woman arrived at the scene to ask questions about the location of the discovery this morning.
Investigations are ongoing and police said they are currently notifying the victim's family.
A cab driver living in Grayson Mews just tried to get back to his apartment but was told by police that no one is allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he found out what had happened.
Residents have been told it will be hours before they are allowed back in.
A police officer told a man that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
A woman appeared on the scene in tears.
He keeps saying "it's terrible".
At 2 p.m. two police vans were inside the restricted area and another van was just outside.
Several agents were inside the demarcated area, controlling the apartment building.
Anyone with information about this is invited to contact @MerPolCC, call 101 or anonymously contact Crimestoppers at 0800 555 111 with the registration 247 dated September 30.
The statue of Cromwell in Parliament becomes the last monument to be hit by the wave of "history rewriting"
His removal would be poetic justice for his Taliban destruction of so many religious and cultural objects in England by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society called Crick's proposal a "craziness" and an "attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the light of the current debate over the removal of statues that the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster would become a target.
Iconiclation during the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor conducted by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent depiction of Cromwell is proof of 19th century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure many feel still deserves to be celebrated.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was considered by many, perhaps more so in the late nineteenth century than today, a defender of Parliament from outside pressures, in his case of course from the monarchy.
Whether this is an extremely accurate representation is the subject of an ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid-17th century defined the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is an identifiable figure who represents a part of that fracture.
His achievements as Lord Protector must be celebrated and commemorated".
Killer pig gets drunk and kills Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by his last name Yuan, was found dead with a severed artery, covered in blood near a pigsty in Liupanshui Market in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inject pigs with vaccines at a pig farm in Xining, Qinghai Province, China, May 30, 2005.
He reportedly traveled with his cousin from the neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and found the door to a nearby pigsty open.
He said there was a big male pig in the pigsty with blood on his face.
A forensic analysis confirmed that the 250-pound pig had eviscerated the farmer, according to the statements.
"My cousin's legs were covered in blood and bruised", said the cousin identified as Wu, as reported in the Guiyang Evening News.
CCTV footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market official told the Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking other people while police gather evidence at the crime scene.
Yuan's family and the market authorities are negotiating compensation for the farmer's death.
Although rare, cases of pig attacks on humans have been reported in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, causing serious injuries to the man.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig nailed a Welsh farmer to his tractor until his wife managed to drive the animal away.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive but that the taste of blood can act as a catalyst".
"They just want to play.
They're playful, very curious.... they don't want to hurt.
He said that all we had to do was show them the right amount of respect.
Hurricane Rosa's fallout will bring heavy rain to the southwestern United States.
As expected, Hurricane Rosa is losing strength as it moves over the colder waters of Mexico's northern coast.
However, Rosa will bring torrential rains to northern Mexico and the southwestern coast of the United States in the coming days.
Rosa recorded winds of up to 138 km/h, a Category 1 hurricane at 5am ET on Sunday and was located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a junk is forming over the Pacific Ocean and moving eastward toward the west coast of the U.S. As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula as a tropical storm, it will begin to push heavy tropical moisture northward into the southwestern part of the U.S.
Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain in some areas of Mexico on Monday.
So, tropical moisture in contact with the approaching debris will create heavy and extensive rainfall in the southwestern area in the coming days.
At the local level, 2 to 10 cm of rainfall can cause dangerous flash floods, debris flows and possible desert landslides.
Tropical humidity will cause rainfall rates of up to 2.5 to 7.5 centimeters per hour in some places, particularly in areas of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Rainfall of 2 to 10 inches is forecast in parts of the southwest, particularly much of Arizona.
It is possible for flash floods to occur with rapidly worsening conditions due to the widespread nature of tropical rains.
It is strongly discouraged to venture into the desert on foot in the presence of the threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rains could make river canyons flood, and thunderstorms will bring gusty winds and dust.
The approaching thunderstorm is expected to cause heavy rainfall locally along part of the Southern California coast.
Rainfall of more than 1 cm is possible, which could cause limited debris flows and slippery roads.
This would be the region's first rainfall in the wet season.
Some scattered tropical rain will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, before rains become more extensive late Monday and early Tuesday.
Heavy rain will fall on the Four Corners Tuesday and continue through Wednesday.
In October, there will be sharp temperature swings over the US as the Arctic cools, but the tropics will remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to large temperature variations over short distances.
An outstanding example of significant temperature differences in the central United States will be recorded on Sunday.
There will be a difference of almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the coming days, the residual heat of summer will try to rise and expand again.
A warm early October is forecast for much of the central and eastern United States, with temperatures reaching 26 degrees Celsius from the Southern Plains to areas in the northeast.
New York City will be in the midst of a high of 85 degrees Fahrenheit [26°C] on Tuesday, about 50 degrees Fahrenheit [12°C] above average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates a strong likelihood of above-average temperatures for the eastern U.S. through the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing.
More than 20 million people watched on six television networks Thursday the sweeping testimony by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual assault allegedly in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, the political impasse continues, with broadcasters interrupting regular programming for a last-minute breakthrough Friday: an agreement brokered by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford has informed the Senate Judiciary Committee that she is 100% certain that Kavanaugh groped her while drunk and tried to strip her during a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in a fiery testimony, said he was 100% certain that this did not happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people Nielsen listed on Friday followed the deposition.
The company was calculating the average audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for the other networks that broadcast it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has a hard time counting the viewers who watch the shows in the offices.
To put it in perspective, this is an audience similar to a football playoff game or the Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose opinion leaders strongly supported Kavanaugh's nomination, led all networks, averaging 5.69 million viewers during the day's hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC was the second network with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican's office issued a statement saying he would vote for Kavanaugh, Flake was filmed by CNN and CBS operators on Friday morning being insulted by protesters as he tried to take an elevator to a Justice Commission hearing.
He stood with his eyes down for several minutes as he was reprimanded and broadcast live on CNN.
"I'm right here in front of you", said one woman.
"Do you think I'm telling the truth to the country?
He was told, 'You have power while so many women are impotent.'"
Flake said his office had issued the statement and stated before the elevator closed that he would have more to say at the committee hearing.
All cable networks and broadcasters broadcast live a few hours later, when the Judiciary Committee voted to present Kavanaugh's nomination to the full Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he would only do so if he was sure the FBI would review the charges against the candidate over the next week, as requested by the minority Democrats.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Following a conversation with Coons and other senators afterwards, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice was important, because it was clear that the Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the inquiry.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "politicising" Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused critics of her programmes of letting the EU "play politics" with Britain's future and jeopardising national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK, September 29, 2018.
In another interview alongside the Prime Minister's on the front page, his former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson launched his attack on his so-called Chequers Brexit deal, saying that a proposal that Britain and the EU should collect their respective tariffs is "absolutely ridiculous".
Wayde Sims murder: police arrest suspect in the death of LSU player Dyteon Simpson
Police have arrested a suspect in the gunshot death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and taken to jail on charges of second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Authorities released a video of Sims and Simpson's fight, and police say Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses from the scene of the crime and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, CBS affiliate WAFB reports.
After questioning Simpson, police said the suspect admitted to accidentally shooting Wayde.
Bail has been set at $350,000, defense counsel said.
The East Baton Rouge medical examiner's office issued a preliminary report Friday, stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the neck.
The department has recognized the work of the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Task Force, the Police Science Lab, Southern University Police and local citizens who assisted in the investigation that led to the arrest.
The athletic director of LSU thanked the local law enforcement for their commitment and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-8 forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
Last season, the player averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, LSU coach Will Wade said the team is "shocked" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
"That's what you worry about all the time", Wade said.
Volcano splashes ash on Mexico City
Ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern neighborhoods of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity increased in the crater and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded in 24 hours.
The center was checking for multiple tremors.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash covering the windshields of cars in Mexico City neighborhoods like Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have detected increased activity at the volcano, which is located 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital, since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists on the eve of the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police and thousands of people joined demonstrations by opponents to mark the one-year anniversary of the controversial Catalan vote on secession.
A group of masked separatists, blocked by riot police, targeted police with eggs and spray paint, creating dark dust clouds on roads usually overflowing with tourists.
There were further clashes during the day with police using batons to contain the fighting.
For several hours, groups of independence-lovers chanting 'We will not forget, we will not forgive' clashed with unionist demonstrators shouting 'Long live Spain.'
Local media reported that 14 people had to be treated for minor injuries sustained during the demonstrations.
Tensions remain high in the independence-seeking region a year after the October 1 referendum was declared illegal by the Madrid government but recognized by Catalan separatists.
Voters had voted overwhelmingly for independence, although turnout was low, and Catalans opposed to secession largely boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop the referendum being held at seats across the region with violent clashes.
The separatist groups had camped out on Friday night to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place but had to follow an alternative route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who took part in the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer had any hope of Catalonia becoming independent.
"Last year was one of our best.
I saw my parents crying for the chance to vote, but now everything is blocked", she explained.
Despite a major but measured victory in last December's regional elections, Catalan independence parties have struggled to maintain momentum this year, with many of the movement's most prominent leaders in voluntary exile or in jail awaiting trial for their role in organising the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in support of the police with his phone, said the conflict was fueled by politicians from both factions.
"The situation is getting more tense", he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in prison awaiting trial since late last year, announced that he will run in the European Parliament elections next year.
'Candidating for the European elections is the best way to denounce the erosion of democratic values and repression by the Spanish government', he explained.
Londonderry: men arrested after car bombing
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after they drove their car into a house in Londonderry.
The accident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday, at approximately 7:30 BST.
Inspector Bob Blemmings said the damage was done to the gates and the building itself.
It's also possible that the car was hit with a crossbow at some point.
Menga's attack marks the Livingston's 1-0 win over the Rangers.
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston has been the winner.
Livingston's already promoted left Rangers stunned by relegating Steven Gerrard to his second defeat in 18 games as manager of Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's goal made the difference as Gary Holt's side were promoted to the second division with Hibernian.
Gerrard's side are therefore without a home Premiership victory this season and will face Hearts next Sunday, who are eight points behind them.
On Thursday, the Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna in the Europa League.
Meanwhile, Livingston continues its division winning streak, remaining unbeaten for six games, with coach Holt yet to see a loss since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
The Livingston is wasting opportunities against a few unimpressive guests .
Holt's team should have been ahead well before the goal, with their immediacy causing the Rangers a lot of trouble.
Scott Robinson broke through but dragged his action in front of the door mirror and Alan Lithgow was only able to kick out the door after he got in to meet Craig Halkett's headshot from the other side of the door.
The visitors were content to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could put the visitors in difficulty with kicks placed.
And that's how the crucial goal was achieved.
Rangers gave up a penalty kick and Livingston found an opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson managed to pass to Menga, who could score from the centre of the area.
Up to that point, the Rangers had dominated possession but the home team's defense had proved impenetrable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly didn't have to worry too much,
This pattern held throughout the second half, although Alfredo Morelos engaged Kelly in a parade.
Scott Pittman saw his goal attempt stopped by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow made a shot out of another Livingston playing pattern.
The crosses took place in the Livingston area and were continually neutralized, while two requests for discipline, after Halkett's confrontation with substitute Glenn Middleton and one for a hand foul, were rejected.
A phenomenal performance by Livingston - analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and result for the Livingston.
Up to the last player, they were exceptional, continuing to exceed expectations along this exceptional trajectory.
Their style of play and staff have changed very little since their return to the majors, but Holt has a lot of credit for the way he's been able to propel the team since his arrival.
She's had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was immense, leading a masterfully organized defense, while Menga put Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on the spot the entire game.
The Rangers, however, were uninspired.
Despite their excellent performances at times with Gerrard, in this case they fell well below those standards.
They missed the last pass - they only managed to penetrate the opponent's area once - and it can be considered a wake-up call for the Rangers, who are halfway down the table.
Erdogan met with mixed reactions in Cologne
There were smiles and blue skies on Saturday (September 29) during the breakfast meeting of the leaders of Turkey and Germany in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, aimed at easing relations between NATO allies.
They clashed over issues such as human rights, press freedom and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne for the inauguration of a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population group outside Turkey.
Police said they were acting on security grounds to prevent a crowd of 25,000 from gathering outside the mosque, but many supporters showed up nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, including many Kurds, have made their voices heard, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
The protests reflect dissent from a visitor who is considered a hero by some Turks in Germany and called a despot by others.
Cyclist killed in crash in Deptford
A cyclist has died in a collision with a car in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy Deptford street, in the southeastern area of the city, at approximately 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and an ambulance arrived at the scene, but the man died instantly.
The accident came months after another cyclist was killed by a road robber on Childers Street, about a mile from where the accident happened on Saturday.
Metropolitan Police said authorities are working to identify the man and inform his family.
Roads were blocked and buses diverted and motorists were advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six guards injured during a riot
Six prison guards were injured during a riot at the maximum security men's prison, the prison office said.
The riot broke out at the Long Lartin maximum security men's prison in Worcestershire at around 09:30 BST on Sunday and is still ongoing.
Specialist Tornado agents have been deployed to handle the riot, which involves eight inmates and is confined to one wing of the prison.
Officers were treated at the scene for minor facial injuries.
A prison spokesman said: "Specially trained prison staff have been deployed to contain an incident currently underway at Long Lartin Prison.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and all those responsible will be reported to the police and could face longer prison sentences".
Long Lartin is home to over 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison warden had to be hospitalized after an inmate attacked him.
And in October last year, riot police were called in to the prison to quell a violent riot in which staff were attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flash floods (which could benefit drought-stricken areas)
It's rare for a tropical depression to hit Arizona, but that's exactly what's likely to happen early next week when the last of Hurricane Rosa's forces cross the southwest desert, creating flash flood hazards.
The National Weather Service has already issued flash flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona as far south as eastern Nevada, southwestern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to head straight for Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching on Monday night in heavy rain.
The Phoenix National Weather Service tweeted that only 10 tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or tropical depression status within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border".
The latest National Hurricane Center models forecast rainfall between 5 and 10 centimeters, with isolated peaks of up to 15 centimeters in the Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Other areas of the southwestern zone, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin will receive 2.5 to 5 cm of precipitation, with isolated peaks of up to 10 cm.
For areas outside the risk of flash flooding, the rain brought by Rosa could be a blessing as the region is suffering from drought.
Although flooding is a very serious problem, some of this rainfall is likely to be positive as the southwestern area is currently experiencing a drought.
According to the Drought Monitoring Center, just over 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing a period of extreme drought, the second highest category, weather.com reported.
Initially, the path of Hurricane Rosa will be through the Baja California Peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, which still maintained hurricane strength Sunday morning with winds of up to 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and is moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm will collide with the colder waters of the Pacific, thus losing power.
So it's expected to make landfall in Mexico as a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
Rainfall in parts of Mexico could be intense, creating a high risk of flooding.
"An estimated two to six inches [7.5 to 15 cm] of rainfall is forecast from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, with a maximum of eight inches [25 cm]", weather.com reported.
Rosa will then move north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early morning hours of Tuesday with a tropical depression, then moving through Arizona and southern Utah late on Tuesday.
"The main risk posed by Rosa or its fallout is heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and the desert southwest of the United States", said the National Hurricane Center.
Such rains are expected to generate potentially lethal flash floods and debris flows into deserts, as well as landslides on mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton assault: four arrests for attempted murder.
Three teenage boys to a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The boy was found wounded in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton at approximately 0400 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to hospital, where he remains in "stable" condition.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset Police said.
Authorities are appealing to anyone who may have recorded the incident on a mobile phone.
Trump says Kavanaugh "suffered from the evil and anger" of the Democratic Party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "suffered from the evil and anger" of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, passionately and decisively denying Christine Blasey Ford's accusations of sexual assault against him decades ago when they were still teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing in defense of the prosecution.
The President said on Saturday that the American people were able to observe Kavanaugh's extraordinary quality and courage that day.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most seasoned legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an unparalleled record in public service", he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The President made indirect reference to Kavanaugh's nomination when he spoke about the importance of Republican turnout in the midterm elections.
"Five weeks to one of the most important elections of our lives.
I am not a candidate, but I am really working hard, he said.
"For this lot I am fighting hard for exceptional candidates".
Trump said Democrats are committed to "resisting and obstructing".
The first key procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior assistant to the GOP leadership told CNN.
Hundreds of people killed by Indonesia earthquake and tsunami, and death toll still rising
At least 384 people were killed, many washed away by giant waves that washed up on beaches, when a massive earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday, when waves up to 6 meters (18 feet) high hit the beach at dusk, wiping out numerous people, killing and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami followed a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat came yesterday, people were still busy with their activities on the beach and did not run away immediately, thus becoming victims", said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's BNPB disaster management agency in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, it swept away cars, logs, houses, hit everything on the mainland", Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami moved into the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 miles/hour) before hitting the coast.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people have been evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the disaster agency showed numerous destroyed buildings and shops, twisted and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
Aftershocks continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's strong earthquake was nearly 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geography of the city, which is at the end of a long, narrow bay, may have enhanced the size of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels collapsed.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings and he added that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that casualties and damage could be greater along the coast 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, closer to the epicenter.
Communications were completely paralyzed, with no information from Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are over 300,000 people living in the area, the Red Cross said, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse", he said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for not reporting that a tsunami had hit Palu, although authorities said the waves arrived at the time the alert was issued.
In an amateur video shared on social media, a man can be heard on the top floor of a building screaming in agitation to warn people on the street below of the coming tsunami.
A few minutes later a wall of water fell on the beach, sweeping away buildings and cars.
Reuters was not able to immediately authenticate the video.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a massive blackout that disrupted communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate relief efforts.
According to the authorities, the army has started sending cargo planes with aid from Jakarta and other cities, but the displaced people still need food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport has reopened for rescue only and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to over 800.
It's awful.
Although World Vision staff from Donggala managed to reach the city of Palu safely, where employees took shelter under a canvas in the backyard of their office, they encountered scenes of devastation along the way, Doseba said.
"They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses", he said.
It's awful.
Even as rescue teams began the difficult operation of starting rescue gear, there were some complaints that foreign rescue workers with extensive knowledge were prevented from traveling to Palu.
Indonesian regulations state that funding, supplies and staff from abroad can only begin to arrive if the disaster site has been declared a national disaster area.
And that has not happened yet.
"This is still a provincial-level disaster", said Aulia Arriani, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says, 'O.K., this is a national disaster,' we can accept international assistance, but the status has not yet been defined".
On the second night in Palu after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of the missing still held out hope that their loved ones would be part of the miracles that alleviate the sad stories of natural disasters.
A child was pulled from a drain on Saturday.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days with her mother's body beside her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games that ended this month in Indonesia.
Other people trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mandagi, were his students.
"As a veteran of the paragliding industry, I am carrying my emotional load", he said.
Gendon recounted how, in the hours following the news of the Roa Roa Hotel collapse in the paragliding community, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to Palu competitors, who were attending the festival on the beach.
His messages, however, stopped at a single gray check mark instead of two blue ones.
"I think it means that the messages have not been delivered", she said.
Thieves steal $26,750 from an ATM during a refill in Newport on the Levee.
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink operator who was refueling an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the vehicle was emptying an ATM at the amusement center and preparing to deliver more cash, Detective Dennis McCarthy said in a statement.
While he was busy, another man broke in behind Brink's employee and stole a bag of delivery money.
Witnesses identified several suspects fleeing the scene, according to the statement, but police did not specify how many people were involved.
Anyone with information regarding the identities of the perpetrators is requested to contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West is changing his name to Ye.
When he announced the name change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The person formally known as Kanye West".
West, 41, has been known as Ye for some time and used the nickname as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change came before her participation on Saturday Night Live, where she will present her new album, Yandhi.
She replaces singer Ariana Grande, who canceled her participation for "emotional reasons", the show's creator said.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has previously stated that the word has religious meaning to him.
"I believe 'ye' is the most used word in the Bible, and it means 'you,'" West said earlier this year, talking about the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
"So it's you, it's us, it's about us.
We went from Kanye, which means unique, to simply Ye -- the reflection of our goodness, our badness, our confusion, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are".
He's just one of several famous rappers who changed their names.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
A former West collaborator, JAY-Z, also changed his name with or without hyphens and uppercase letters.
Mexico's president-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed not to use the military against the civilian population.
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians, marking the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador pledged on Saturday in Tlatelolco Square to never use the army to repress the Mexican people.
Soldiers had fired on a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing 300 people at a time when leftist student movements were gaining ground throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by giving monthly student grants and opening more public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of training opportunities are driving young people into criminal gangs.
The US should double its funding for IA
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the US should double its research funding, says AI investor and operator Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments follow announcements by several US government groups about AI, although the US generally lacks a formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China presented its agenda last year: it aims to be the number one country in AI innovation by 2030.
"Doubling the budget for AI research would be a good start considering that all other countries are much behind the US and we need a new AI revolution", Lee said.
Doubling funding could double the chances of the next big AI success in the US, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's leading AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that beat the top-scoring American player in Otello and later was a manager at Microsoft Research and president of Google's Chinese division.
Lee recalled previous US government technology competitions such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge and asked when the next one would be held, so he could identify new visionaries.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to get government funding, Lee said.
"It's not China that is taking away academic leaders, it's the multinationals", Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired university luminaries to work on AI projects.
Lee said changes to immigration policy could help the US boost its AI efforts.
"I think green cards should be offered automatically to PhD students in AI", he explained.
China's State Council published its next-generation AI development plan in July 2017.
The National Natural Science Foundation of China provides funding to those working in academic institutions, similar to how the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute funds to US researchers, poor quality academic work is lower in China, Lee explained.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense created a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, with industrial and academic partners, and the White House announced the formation of a special AI Commission.
And this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it currently invests over $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, the US proposal to create a national AI security commission has been dormant for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change the country's name
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on a possible change of the country's name to Republic of North Macedonia, a move that would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that has blocked its EU and NATO membership applications.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that its neighbours' name constitutes a claim on its territory and has vetoed Macedonia's membership in NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents believe the change would damage the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has declared that he will not vote in the referendum and the boycott campaign has raised doubts about the possibility of turnout reaching the minimum 50% required for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum ballot is: 'Do you agree to join NATO and the EU and accept the agreement with Greece?'
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say it is the price to pay for Macedonia's admission to institutions such as the EU and NATO, one of the emerging countries from the collapse of the former Yugoslavia.
"I have come here today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the aegis of the European Union because that means a safer life for all of us", said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, enough members of parliament have said they will respect the outcome of the vote to make it final.
The name change would require a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The state election commission said there were no reports of irregularities until 1:00 p.m.
However, turnout was only 16%, compared to 34% in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66% of registered voters cast their ballots.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe", said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko voted in a referendum in Macedonia on the country's name change that would open the door to NATO and European Union membership in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
In front of the Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was setting up a small stage and arranging chairs in front of the curtains set up by those who want to boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to enter with our heads held high, not through the service door", Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China or Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration".
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20%.
"I believe the overwhelming majority will be in favour because more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO", Zaev said after voting.
He said that a "yes" would be "a confirmation of our future".
A poll published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Analysis reported that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum - a percentage below the required turnout.
Another poll conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV, showed that 57% of respondents planned to go to the polls on Sunday.
Of these 57%, 70% said they would vote yes.
For the referendum to be valid, the turnout must be 50% plus one vote.
A failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the policy of the pro-Western government since it took office in May last year.
Sergio Aguero of Manchester City scores a goal bypassing the entire defence of Brighton
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling took charge of Brighton's defence during the 2-0 win over Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made his 65th-minute goal look extremely easy.
The Argentine striker was given a midfield pass early in the action.
He moved between three Brighton defenders before catapulting into the open field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green jerseys.
He humiliated a defender before passing several others at the Brighton area boundary.
He then made a left turn, where he found Sterling.
The English striker used the first touch in the area to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right foot to beat Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a right-handed shot into the net.
"Aguero is having foot problems", City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about getting him to play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he scored at that moment".
But it was Sterling who initially led the Sky Blues to the lead in the Premier League battle.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep on Brighton's pitch.
He sent a nice, filter ball down the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a few steps before leading Sterling to the second pole.
The Sky Blues forward threw the ball into the net just before he left the field.
City will play Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at 12:55 on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play dirty against the Rockies .
With the Nationals out of the playoffs, there's no reason to force another start.
But the ever-competitive Scherzer hopes to pitch Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still playoff implications for the Rockies, who hold a one-game lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies have gained at least a rematch with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but they're still hoping to clinch their division title.
"Even if we play without a goal, at least we can be able to throw knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team playing will probably be at its highest level this year.
And why wouldn't I want to compete?"
The Nationals have yet to announce a starting pitcher for Sunday, but they're said to be inclined to let Scherzer pitch in similar situations.
Scherzer, who would be the starting pitcher for the 34th time, on Thursday performed a pitching session and would be the starting pitcher on his normal Sunday rest.
The Washington pitcher is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump at a rally in West Virginia
The President made indirect reference to the situation surrounding his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of Republican turnout in the midterm elections.
"Everything we've done is put on the line in November.
We're five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
It's one of the big, big -- I'm not a candidate but I'm really trying to do it, so I'm fighting for excellent candidates", he said.
Trump went on to say, "We're seeing this horrible bunch of radical Democrats, it's happening right now.
And they're determined to take back power by any means necessary, you can see the evil, the mean.
They don't care who they can hit, who they have to overpower in order to get power and control back, because that's what they want, power and control, and we're not going to give it to them".
The Democrats, he said, have given themselves the mission of resisting and obstructing.
"And it has been seen in the last four days", he said, calling the Democrats "angry, mean, mean and liars".
He referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee with Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein by name, sparking a loud whistle in the audience.
"Do you remember his answer?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, um, no, I'm waiting for a -- that was bad body language -- the worst body language I've ever seen".
The Labour Party is no longer very tolerant.
He doesn't tolerate people saying what they think.
When the Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, it wasn't a big surprise.
After all, I am the latest in a series of Labour MPs who have been told they are not welcome, and all because they have said what they think.
My colleague Joan Ryan was treated in a similar way because she was firmly opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure criticized me for expressing my disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironically all similar topics that Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders on.
The notice for the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday says that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
For most of my eight years as a local Labour Party MP, Friday night meetings have been exactly like this.
But today this is not the tone of many meetings and the promise of a 'better and more courteous' policy has long been forgotten, if ever remembered.
It has become increasingly obvious that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and every opinion is judged on whether it is acceptable or not to the party leadership.
This all started shortly after Jeremy became party leader, and colleagues with whom I had previously thought I shared a similar political view began to expect a change of direction from me and that I would take positions I would never accept, whether it was national security or the single European market.
When I speak in public - and it doesn't really matter what I say - they follow up with insults on social media calling for my resignation, denouncing the politics of the centre and telling me that I shouldn't be part of the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
I am certainly more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments to me tend to be political in nature.
I admire the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a barrage of sexist and racist insults every day but who do not allow themselves to be intimidated.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this policy era is the normalisation of insult levels.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer in a tolerant environment and with every motion of no confidence or change in the selection rules, the party shrinks.
Over the last two years I have been given a lot of advice, urging me to lower my head, not to express my opinions so openly and everything would be fine.
But that's not why I got into politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student, spurred on by the Thatcher government's carelessness that had left my high school classroom literally falling apart, I have tried to advocate for better public services for those who need them most, as a local councillor or government minister.
I never hid my political views, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been in any way disconcerted by my political positions and points of disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who pushed the motion on Friday, I would like to say that as the country is sliding towards a Brexit that will hurt our families, businesses and public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy talking about my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact the only message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my constituents, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of exclusion or political opportunity will stop me from acting in defense of what I believe to be your best interests.
Chris Leslie is the Member of Parliament for Nottingham East.
Ayr 38-17 Melrose: an undefeated Ayr climbs the leaderboard
Two late attempts may have somehow upset the final result, but there's no doubt Ayr deserved the win in this exceptionally entertaining match of Tennent's championship day.
They're now at the top of the standings, the only undefeated team out of ten.
In the end it was their superior defense, as well as their audacity, that pushed the home team and coach Peter Murchied had every reason to be pleased.
"We have been tested in our games so far and we are still unbeaten, so I must be happy", the coach said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "Ayr deserves credit, they took advantage of our opportunities better".
Grant Anderson's goal in the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, but brought lAyr into the lead, but a yellow card for Scottish player Rory Hughes, released by the Warriors for the game, allowed Melrose to make the numbers speak and Jason Baggot grabbed an unconverted goal.
Climo increased Ayr's distance with a penalty before, just in the middle of the half, he scored and then converted a goal by himself to bring Ayr to 17-5 at halftime.
But Melrose got off to a good start in the second half and Patrick Anderson's goal, converted by Baggot, cut the lead to five points.
There was then a long break due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was ruled out, and on the restart, Ayr jumped back into the lead thanks to a goal from Stafford McDowall converted by Climo.
Ayr's alternate captain Blair Macpherson was then given a yellow card and Melrose charged the man extra with an unconverted goal from Bruce Colvine, at the end of a moment of heavy pressure.
The home team came back and when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card for a no-ball contrast with Climo, from the penalty area, MacPherson scored a touchdown behind the Ayr's advancing match.
Climo converted, as he had done almost since the restart, after Rowe had picked up the kick from David Armstrong's area and sent flanker Gregor Henry to look for the home team's fifth goal.
Still Game star is looking for a new career in the restaurant business.
Ford Kieran, star of Still Game, decided to move into the hotel business after discovering he had been appointed manager of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, which he writes and stars in alongside his long-time partner Greg Hemphill.
The pair announced that the upcoming ninth series will also be the final one of the show and it seems that Kiernan is thinking about a life after Craiglang.
According to official report lists, he's the head of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment, although a source in the Scottish Sun made it clear that Kiernan wished to get involved in Glasgow's "prosperous restaurant business".
'The sea is ours': landlocked Bolivia hopes a court will reopen the way to the Pacific
Sailors patrol a seawall-covered naval headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings display an ocean blue flag.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon River are decorated with the motto: "The sea is rightfully ours.
It is our duty to recover it".
Across the landlocked Bolivia, the memory of the lost coastline now in Chile's hands after a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century is still alive, as is the desire to once again sail the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes may have reached their highest level in decades as Bolivia awaits the decision of the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the momentum, the spirit of unity and serenity and is obviously waiting for the result with a positive attitude", explained Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the International Court of Justice ruling on big screens across the country, hoping that the court in The Hague will take up Bolivia's claim that - after decades of intermittent dialogue - Chile is obliged to negotiate, giving Bolivia a sea outlet from the state's jurisdiction.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president - who is facing a controversial re-election battle next year - has a lot at stake in Monday's ruling.
"We are very close to our return to the Pacific Ocean", he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts feel that the court is unlikely to rule in favor of Bolivia and that little will change if it does.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no power to assign Chilean territory and has made it clear that it will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the International Court of Justice ruling comes just six months after the final arguments shows that the case was "not complicated", said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And far from advancing the Bolivian cause, the past four years may have delayed it.
"The problem of access to the sea has been monopolized by the current Bolivian administration", said Zárate.
Morale's belligerent rhetoric has dampened any remaining good intentions of Chile, he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations at some point, but it will be very difficult to keep the discussions going after what has happened.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making process was particularly rapid.
On Monday, Bolivia will have an extraordinary opportunity in relations with Chile and a chance to end 139 years of disagreements for mutual benefit, he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - one of Latin America's most popular presidents - is using the maritime issue as a political cover.
'Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean', he added.
"The verdict is an opportunity to see that we need to move on from the past".
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won 't happen without trust in the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has said his nation will never disarm unless it can trust Washington first.
He spoke to the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to keep the promises made during the Singapore summit between the two rival leaders.
His comments come as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears intent on restarting stalled diplomatic talks after meeting in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
He explains that it is an illusion that continued sanctions and US opposition to a declaration ending the Korean War will ever bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is wary of issuing the statement without Pyongyang first taking major disarmament action.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is willing to give up an arsenal that the country probably considers the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo is planning a visit to Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit between Kim and Trump.
The Paris fashion shows feature the latest trend in huge headdresses that will soon be in a high fashion store near you
If you want to expand your collection of headgear or to block out the sun completely, look no further.
Fashion designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a series of crazy oversize headgear for their spring-summer 2019 collection that have stunned the fashion world at Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats have been a hit on Instagram this summer, and these designers have posted their eye-catching creations on the catwalk.
Valentino's main piece was an exaggerated beige hat decorated with a wide feather-like border that submerged the models' heads.
Other oversized accessories included ornamented watermelons, a witch's hat, and even a pineapple - but they were not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of bizarre masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of these colorful masks feature sewn lips and look more like a Hannibal Lecter depiction than haute couture.
One creation looked like a wetsuit with a mask and goggles, while another looked like a melted ice cone.
And if you continue with the huge style statements, you're in luck.
Fashion observers predict that the huge hats could reach you on the streets of high fashion.
The outsize hats come in the wake of La Bomba, the straw hat with a three-foot-wide strap that has been seen on everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the very impractical hat that has flooded social media has sent another huge creation onto the catwalk: a straw beach bag almost as big as the costume model wearing it.
The burnt orange raffia bag, finished with raffia fringe and a white leather handle was the highlight of Jacquemus' La Riviera spring-summer 2019 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity designer Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: I predict these big hats and beach bags will hit high-end stores next summer, as the designer has made such an impact that it would be hard to ignore the demand for oversize accessories.
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Scottish independent schools maintain a curriculum of academic excellence and this continued in 2018 with another string of outstanding test scores, bolstered by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other collective endeavours.
With over 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), aim to provide the highest level of service to their students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare pupils for further higher education, their chosen careers and their place in the world as global citizens.
As a sector of education capable of developing and adopting a personalised school curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and in demand subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, the message will reach his brain.
If you speak to him in his native language, the message will reach his heart".
It is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely on English alone if we wish to build trusting relationships with people from other countries.
From the results of this year's exams, we can see that languages are at the top of the rankings, with the highest success rates in independent schools.
68% of the students who studied foreign languages got the highest marks.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72% of students scored highest on Chinese, while 72% of German, 69% of French and 63% of Spanish students scored highest.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are promoting foreign languages as a key skill for children and young people who will undoubtedly need it in the future.
Currently, languages, as a subject choice, are considered at the same level as STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) subjects in the curricula of independent institutions and elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 found that the reasons employees cited for difficulty filling jobs were in 17% of cases attributable to a lack of language skills.
For this reason, language skills are becoming increasingly essential to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more and more job opportunities requiring language skills, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career you choose, if you have learned a second language, you will have a real advantage in the future with a lifelong skill like this.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically put a multilingual person ahead of the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of over 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75% were unable to speak a foreign language at a level sufficient to sustain a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage, 15%.
This is why investing in language learning is so important for children today.
Knowledge of more languages, especially those of developing economies, will give children a better chance of finding a meaningful job.
In Scotland, each school will differ in the languages taught.
Several schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are deemed most important for the UK looking ahead to 2020, such as Mandarin Chinese or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests, there will always be a variety of languages to choose from in independent schools, with specialist language teaching staff.
Independent schools in Scotland are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills they need to succeed, whatever their future.
It cannot be denied that languages are still fundamental to the future of the country in a global trading system, and this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
You have to do it.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron will make his Lakers debut Sunday in San Diego .
The wait is almost over for fans who are waiting for LeBron James to make his first start with the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in Sunday's opening preseason game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it has yet to be determined how many minutes he will play.
"It's going to be more than one and less than 48", Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James will likely play for a limited number of minutes.
After practice earlier in the week, James was asked what his plans were for the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
"At this point in my career I don't need friendlies to prepare", he said.
The time of the rally is Trump's West Virginia YouTube channel.
President Donald Trump kicks off tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia with a flurry of rallies.
This is the first of five rallies planned for Trump next week, including stops at friendly locations like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote pending for his choice to fill the vacant Supreme Court seat, Trump will seek to build support for the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans risk losing control of Congress in the November election.
What time is Trump's rally and how can you follow it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7:00 pm ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia online or via live streaming on YouTube.
Trump will likely address this week's hearings of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, which have become tense over sexual assault allegations with an early Senate confirmation vote pending for a week while the FBI conducts investigations.
But the main purpose of this series of rallies is to help the Republicans who are facing the November election get some momentum.
So, President Trump's campaign said that these five rallies over the next week are aimed at "powering up volunteers and supporters as Republicans seek to protect and expand their majorities in the Senate and House", according to Reuters.
"Congressional oversight is so critical to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we move into the busiest campaign season", a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters, asking not to be identified.
Scheduled for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, tonight's rally could draw supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract media coverage from Pittsburgh, according to the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican Senate candidate from West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who is trailing in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come and try to give him a push in the polls", Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows courage to fight to keep hope alive until Sunday's singles
After three one-way sessions, Saturday afternoon's quartet might have been just what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging pendulum is a totally invented sporting concept in which the players believe so strongly and never as in races like this.
Where would the bike be now?
"They had a six-point lead and now they have four, so I would say we're saving some momentum", Jordan Spieth said as he walked away at the end of the day.
Europe is obviously four points ahead with 12 more at stake.
The Americans feel they have a little bit of a wind in their favor, as Spieth said, and they have a lot to be hopeful about, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who have been playing together all day and each boast three points out of four.
Spieth was ruthless from the tee to the green and he's setting an example.
The guttural shouts of celebration grew louder as the game went on, sinking a crucial putt to tie the score in Game Four, when he and Thomas were down two points to two.
His putt that won them the 15 hole game was greeted with a similar scream, the one that tells you he thinks the American team is not out of the race yet.
"You really have to worry about your game", Spieth said.
That's all any of these players can do right now.
18 holes to make a point.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the unquestioned version of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's weird but adorable couple is four out of four and can't do anything wrong.
"Moliwood" were the only couple not to bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the ninth hole on Friday morning.
That route, and the way their energy seems to flow to and from the noisy crowd, reinforces the certainty that they are the players to beat on Sunday, and there would be no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari to seal a possible European victory as the sun sets over Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
However, European glory talks are still premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson were quick to catch up with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning four-ball, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two double bogets on the first nine holes sunk the Spaniard and the Swede into a hole they could not even remotely climb out of.
Yet on Sundays, there's no one to help you out of your hole.
Fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to watch because of the interactions between the couples, the advice they give and don't give and the way the strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far and gained a significant advantage on the final day but this foursome session has shown that Team USA has the courage to fight, something that some, especially Stateside, have doubted.
Europe with a 10-6 lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will have a solid lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup after wrapping up Saturday's fourball and foursome games with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
The inspired pair of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two wins over a struggling Tiger Woods to bring the score so far at Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, in an attempt to retain the trophy they lost to Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an American team that was irregular in the morning fourball, winning 3-1.
The United States held its own in foursomes, winning two games, but they failed to make up the deficit.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points from 12 singles games on Sunday to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four straight points while he and Molinari, known as "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend are the second pair to win four points from their opening four games in Ryder Cup history.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, they worked superbly to beat a downed Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with an even sharper 5&4.
Woods, who was dragged to two games on Saturday, showed occasional flashes of genius but lost 19 of his 29 games in fourball and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, resting during the morning's fourball, returned to side partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes to beat 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - world number one and number three respectively.
Europe, however, did not achieve all the results it had hoped for on a pleasant, breezy day in the southwest of Paris.
Three-time major winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the American record with two points on Saturday.
They scored a gritty 2&1 win over Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter of Spain in the fourball and came back later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the foursome, having lost the opening two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team come back from a four-point gap to advance to the singles, although as a starter, Furyk's team only needs a draw to defend the trophy.
After being runners-up for two days, however, a counterattack on Sunday seems to be out of their reach.
North Korea absolutely refuses to unilaterally disarm without confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the UN on Saturday that the continued sanctions were heightening the country's distrust of the US, which would under such circumstances absolutely refuse to unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told the General Assembly of the World Organisation that North Korea had taken 'important goodwill measures' over the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site and committing to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
We do not see any compliant response from the US, however, he said.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no security in our national security, and under these circumstances we absolutely refuse to unilaterally disarm first".
Although Ri reused the complaint notes about Washington's resistance to denuclearisation in stages with which North Korea would be rewarded based on gradual actions, his statement was important because he did not reject unilateral denuclearisation altogether as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump during the first ever meeting between a sitting US president and a North Korean leader, held in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim pledged to work towards the "denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula", while Trump promised guarantees for North Korean security.
North Korea sought a formal agreement to end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States said Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed calls to ease tough international sanctions on North Korea.
"The US insists on the need to have denuclearisation first and increase the level of pressure with sanctions to achieve their purpose in a coercive way and even opposes declaration of end of war", Ri said.
"The idea that sanctions can bring us to our knees is an illusion for those who know nothing about us.
But the problem is that the continuation of sanctions is increasing our distrust".
Ri did not mention plans for a second meeting between Kim and Trump that the US leader had announced at the UN earlier this week.
The minister instead pointed to three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: "If the counterpart of this denuclearization issue were South Korea and not the US, denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not be dead at this point".
But even so, the tone of Ri's speech was markedly different from last year's speech at the UN General Assembly, when he said that North Korea's missiles were inevitably aimed at US soil after "evil President" Trump called Kim a "missile man" engaged in a suicide mission.
Before the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in embarking on the path of disarmament, but said much more still needed to be done and that sanctions would remain in place until North Korea denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no deadline, saying that "whether it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter".
China and Russia say the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: "Respect for Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and without exception until complete, final and assured denuclearisation is achieved".
The Security Council unanimously supported sanctions control North Korea in 2006 in an attempt to stifle funding for its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again the following month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times already this year, but the last trip didn't go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying progress had been made, but a few hours later North Korea accused him of making "gangster requests".
North Korea had pledged during a meeting this month with Moon to dismantle a missile site and a nuclear complex if the US took "compliant measures".
He said Kim had explained to him that the "compliant measures" he wanted were security guarantees that Trump had committed to in Singapore and actions toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on getting enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has encouraged all of its students to get more sleep in an attempt to counter the growing masculine culture of studying whole nights fueled by caffeine.
A university scholar found that students at the world's number one university often have no idea of the basic concepts of self-care.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He got the idea to start the course after a lecture he gave on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
Finally, a girl came up to me and said, "Why am I only being told this now, when I'm a senior?"
She said that no one had ever told her anything about the importance of sleep, which surprised me a lot, she told The Telegraph.
The course, which was taught for the first time this year, explains to students the essential concepts of how good sleep habits can help academic and athletic performance, as well as improve overall wellbeing.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and director general of the university's health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students were suffering from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive activities.
In one section there is an image of a dorm room, where students can select coffee cups, curtains, sneakers and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by lack of sleep, and the importance of an evening routine.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase their risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
A campus map with interactive icons then encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
We know that it won't change students' behavior immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know, just as you have a right to know the health effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes, added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of "pride" over "sleepless nights" still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students are making sleep deprivation a growing problem.
Getting enough and good quality sleep should be the secret weapon of students to fight stress, fatigue, anxiety, he explained, and even help prevent weight gain because lack of sleep puts the brain in a hunger mode, making people constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student enrolled in the department of chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler develop the course after attending one of his lectures last year during his first year at Harvard.
He explained that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to promote a course for the whole campus.
The next step, he hopes, will be to ask all graduate students to follow a similar curriculum before enrolling at this competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler advised students to set an alarm clock for when they should go to bed, as well as for when they should wake up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of blue light emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can tilt the circadian rhythm, leading to sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal knocks Gerrard's men down
The Rangers suffered another bout of depression away from home with Dolly Menga's goal relegating Steven Gerrard's disjointed team to a 1-0 loss at Livingston.
The Ibrox side were looking for their first home win since February's 4-1 triumph at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's side inflicted Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager leaving his side eight points behind the reigning Ladbrokes Premiership leaders, Hearts.
Menga scored seven minutes into the half and a Rangers lineup short of inspiration never seemed able to match.
While the Ranger now drop to sixth, Livingston climbs to third, and only behind Hibernian by goal difference.
And there could be more trouble coming for the Rangers after linebacker Calum Spence was treated for a head injury from an apparent object thrown from outside his home.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team, which quickly passed lAyr in the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, chose the usual formation that tore a point at Hearts last week and would have been satisfied with the way his well-prepared team strangled their opponents in every lap.
The Rangers may have dominated possession, but Livingston made better use of the balls at his disposal.
They could have scored just two minutes later when Menga's first-half pass sent Scott Pittman through to Allan McGregor's goal but the midfielder missed the opportunity.
A deep penalty kick from Keaghan Jacobs then found captain Craig Halkett but his teammate Alan Lithgow could only pull to the side on the second pole.
The Rangers have taken control but there seems to be more hope than conviction in their penalty area play.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt he should have been given a penalty after the 15th after a fight with Steven Lawless but referee Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian's requests.
The Rangers only managed to score twice in the first half but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was not bothered by Lassana Coulibaly's header and a soft Ovie Ejaria shot.
Although Livingston's opening goal in the 34th minute may have been unexpected, no one can deny that he deserved it even for his effort.
Once again the Rangers failed to manage a deep kick from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his composure in picking Menga for a clean sweep.
Gerrard acted during the half to replace Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the change had an almost immediate impact as the wing threw a ball to Morelos, but the exceptional Kelly threw himself from the goal line to block it.
But the Livingston continued to drag visitors into exactly the kind of game they love, with Lithgow and Halkett picking up one long ball after another.
Holt's team may have increased the gap in the final stages, but McGregor fought back to stop Jacobs before Lithgow pulled out of the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton made one final disciplinary request after a cross with Jacobs but Thomson denied it again.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our Sunday Morning almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today and counting continues... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that made the device known as the Geiger counter.
A landmark in science ever since, the Geiger counter has also become a mainstay of pop culture, when in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", played by those unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, used to detect radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you put these earphones on, you can actually feel the effects of the atoms released by radioactivity in minerals".
Evans: "Wait a minute, it's really exploding right now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New cancer vaccine can teach immune system to "see" malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" malignant cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells as part of the treatment.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory.
They can then see  a protein common to many types of cancer and then they are injected back into the tumor.
An experimental trial of this vaccine is showing promising results in patients with several types of cancer.
A woman who received the vaccine that teaches her immune system to recognize malignant cells saw her ovarian cancer disappear for over 18 months.
The method involves removing immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory so that they can see a protein common to many types of cancer, called HER2, and then those cells are injected again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine".
The HER2 protein "promotes the growth of several types of cancer", including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar procedure of extracting immune cells from patients to "teach" them how to target cancer cells has worked in the treatment of one type of leukemia.
Kanye West throws himself into a pro-Trump rant wearing a MAGA (Make America Great Again) hat after his appearance on SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was booed in the studio during an episode of Saturday Night Live after an unsuccessful performance during which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run in 2020.
After performing her third song of the night, called Ghost Town, during which she wore a MAGA hat, she began a furor against the Democrats and reiterated her support for Trump.
"I talk to white people a lot of times and they say, 'How can you like Trump, he's a racist!
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago, he explained.
SNL kicked off the show with a scene starring Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee against sexual assault charges brought by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not aired, the recording of West's flipside was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to tease West with the publication.
Also, West complained to the audience that he had a bad time backstage because of his headgear.
"I was bullied backstage.
They told me not to go out with that hat on.
I was bullied!
And so they told me I was an outcast", he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West went on, "You want to see the underwater place?" and he said, "I would wear Superman's cape because that means you can't tell me what to do.
Try to love".
His comments generated whistles from the audience at least twice and SNL cast members seemed embarrassed, Variety reported, with one person telling the magazine, "There was a deadly silence in the studio".
West was invited as a last-minute replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West stunned many with a performance of the song I Love It, disguised as a Perrier bottle.
West received support from the head of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest spirits: THANK YOU FOR HELPING THE MASS".
But the host of the show Karen Hunter tweeted that West was simply "what he is and that's just wonderful".
"But I have chosen NOT to reward anyone (by buying their music or their clothes or supporting their art) who I believe is embracing a vomit ideology that is harmful to my community.
It's free.
And so are we", he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying he was now the person previously known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to have changed his name and is following in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His friend rapper, Snoop Dogg, called himself Snoop Lion and of course the late music legend Prince, who had changed his name to a symbol and thus the artist formerly known as Prince.
Charge of attempted murder by stabbing in a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in an east Belfast restaurant on Friday.
The incident occurred in Ballyhackamore, according to police.
The accused is to appear in Belfast court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the prosecutor's office.
" Throne of Swords " star Kit Harington attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for his role as the warrior Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor attacked the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that such on-screen soles often make boys believe they have to be tough to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said she felt "something went wrong" and reflected on how to deal with the issue of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married the 31-year-old co-star of "Game of Thrones", admitted to being very concerned about this problem.
'I am personally concerned, very much at the moment - what was our mistake with masculinity?' he said.
'What have we taught men as they grew up in terms of the problem we see now?'
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for the rise in toxic masculinity due to its extremely masculine characters.
He continued: 'What is innate and what is taught?
What is it that is taught on TV, and on the streets, that makes boys think they have to be this particular way of being a man?
I think this is one of the great dilemmas of our time -- how can we change things?
Because obviously something went wrong with the young people.'
During the interview, he also admitted that he will not be playing any prequel or sequel to Game of Thrones once the series ends next summer, stating that he is "done with battlefields and horses".
Starting in November, Kit will play the lead role in Sam Shepard's revival of True West, the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he considers meeting his wife Rose the best thing that ever happened to Thrones.
I met my wife during this series, so she gave me my future family in this sense, and my life from now on, he explained.
Rose played Ygritte, the love interest of Jon Snow's character Kit, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at the Leslie family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens affected by HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected by these diseases, according to health authorities.
Some 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases are due to sexual transmission, which is a change from the past.
In some regions of China HIV has spread in the past as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
But the number of people infected with HIV in this way has dropped to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
Year after year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
HIV transmission through sexual contact is a pressing issue in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still widespread.
Because of the country's traditional values, some studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men eventually marry women.
Many of the transmission of diseases are caused by inadequate protection during sexual intercourse within such relationships.
In 2003, the Chinese government promised universal access to HIV medicines as part of its commitment to managing the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a staff member leaked the GOP senators' data, and speaks of "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories".
The US congresswoman denounced on Saturday the accusations against a member of her staff over the publication of personal information of three US Republican senators on lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
The Democratic congresswoman from Los Angeles said the statements were fueled by opinion leaders and far-right websites.
"Lies, lies and even despicable lies", Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information released would include home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information was posted online on Thursday, released by an anonymous Capitol insider during a panel hearing on sexual assault charges against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the posts was associated with Waters' office and released information about a member of Waters' staff.
"This baseless accusation is completely false and a complete lie", Waters continued.
"The member of my staff whose identity, personal information and security were compromised as a result of these false and biased allegations was in no way responsible for the leak of such information.
This baseless accusation is totally false and a complete lie".
Waters' statement quickly drew online criticism from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
This denial is furious, wrote Fleischer.
"That implies that you don't have the character to be a Congressman.
When someone is accused of something they didn't do, they shouldn't get angry.
It doesn't have to be provocative.
You must not question the prosecution's reasons.
He must remain calm and composed".
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' reaction to Democratic criticism to Judge Kavanaugh, who had been accused by critics of appearing too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running to remove Waters in the midterm elections, expressed his views on Twitter.
"Huge if confirmed", he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had alerted the relevant authorities and law enforcement of these biased statements.
We will ensure that those responsible are exposed, he continued and that they are held accountable for all their dangerous and harmful actions to all members of my staff".
Johnny English reviews hit again - the spy parody with a downsized Rowan Atkinson
It has become commonplace now to look for references to Brexit in every new British-themed film and this seems to apply to this revival of Johnny English's action comedy, which began in 2003 and was revived in 2011 with Johnny English: The Rebirth.
Will the veiled self-deprecating irony about how bad we suck be the nation's new export opportunity?
However, the incompetent Johnny English with his rubber face and his eyes out of his orbits has got his license to mess things up for the second time - and his name indicates more than anything that it is a comic creation developed for non-English-speaking movie-goers.
Obviously, it's the silly secret agent who, despite his bizarre claims of glamour, has a bit of Clouseau, a touch of Mr Bean and a pinch of that kind that contributed a single note to the theme of Glory Moments of the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
It is a character based initially on the mysterious international traveller and man that Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten TV ads for Barclaycard, who left the chaos behind.
There's a nice moment or two in this latest release by Johnny English.
I liked Johnny English approaching the helicopter wearing medieval armor and the propellers briefly rubbing against his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is evident, but humor seems rather understated and strangely superfluous, especially now that serious film brands like 007 and Mission Impossible now offer comedy as an ingredient.
The humor seems to be directed at children rather than adults, and to me Johnny English's crazy misadventures aren't as original and focused as Atkinson's gags in silent movies when he plays Mr. Bean.
The premise of the current situation is that Britain is in serious danger.
A computer hacker has infiltrated the top-secret Web of British spies, revealing the identities of all British agents on the ground, to the dismay of the agent in charge, a role unfortunately very small for Kevin Eldon.
She is the final straw for a self-righteous and tormented prime minister who is already suffering a political unpopularity meltdown: Emma Thompson does her best with this Theresa May-like character but there is not much to work on in the script.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that every single active spy has been compromised and she'll have to call back someone who's already retired.
And that means that the clumsy Johnny English, who now works as a school principal in a fancy establishment, but who also gives informal lessons on how to be an undercover agent: here you can enjoy some fun gags, when English offers a School of Rock spy class.
English is sent back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunites with his former suffering partner Bough, again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married, married to a submarine commander, a high society girl role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a bit of a waste.
So the Batman and Robin of disasters for Her Majesty's Secret Service are back in action, to meet Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatale, Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is falling dangerously into the web of the charismatic tech billionaire who claims to solve Britain's computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of ridiculous adventures: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a French restaurant; they unleash hell by sneaking onto Volta's luxury yacht and English creates sheer anarchy as he tries to use a virtual reality mask to become familiar with the interior of Volta's house.
All the scenes are certainly intended for the final sequence, but as polite and exuberant as it is, there's quite a bit of children's TV throughout the story.
It's all pretty modest.
And as with Johnny English's other films, I couldn't help but wonder: Couldn't the British film industry cast Rowan Atkinson in a role that did justice to her talent?
The Labour Party denies that it is working on a plan to make it possible for Britons to work four days a week but be paid for five
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a radical programme that would allow British citizens to work four days a week, while being paid for five.
The party would like company leaders to pass on the savings made by the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to workers by giving them an extra day off.
This would allow employees to enjoy a three-day weekend, while keeping the same pay.
Some sources said the idea would be compatible with the party's economic programme and plans to tilt the country in favour of workers.
The shift to a four-day workday was endorsed by the trade union congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party member told The Sunday Times: "By the end of the year, a policy review is expected to be announced".
It will not happen overnight, but a four-day workweek is an aspiration in line with the party's approach to rebalancing the economy in favour of workers, as well as its overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day workweek as part of the 2017 general election campaign.
However, this aspiration is not currently supported by the Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: A four-day workweek is not part of the party's policy and is not currently under discussion.
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour conference to detail his vision of a socialist economic revolution.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from "faceless executives" and "speculators" in utilities.
The shadow chancellor's plans also imply that current shareholders of water companies may not get their entire stake back, as the Labour government could implement deductions based on what it considers illegal behaviour.
It also confirmed plans to put employees on corporate boards and create equity funds to transfer 10 per cent of the net worth of private sector companies to employees, who end up pocketing annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell 60 Minutes if the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh might change their minds.
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his Supreme Court nomination by at least a week, and raises questions about whether the government agency's findings will influence any of the Republican senators in providing their support.
In an interview that airs Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if it was possible for the FBI to uncover something that would change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more forthcoming than his South Carolina counterpart.
"I mean, of course", Kennedy said.
I said on my way to the hearing, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after what happened, when the accusation came out, I said, "Did you do it?"
It was determined, determined, unequivocal.
Graham's vote, however, seems carved in the rock.
"I have clear ideas about Brett Kavanaugh and they could withstand a bomb-proof indictment", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett has strongly denied it", Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
And whoever you named couldn't prove it.
It's been 36 years.
I don't see anything new changing.
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event featuring a remarkable star-studded cast and with an equally remarkable mission: to end world poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people flock to Central Park's Great Lawn not only to enjoy performances like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness about the event's real purpose, which is to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To receive a free ticket to the event (unless you were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), the concert audience had to complete a series of tasks, or actions, such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, making a phone call, or any other meaningful way that helped raise awareness about their goal of eradicating poverty.
But, exactly, how successful has the Global Citizen Festival been now that 12 years remain to reach its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert really a genuine way to persuade people to request a call to action, or is it just another example of so-called clicktivism - people who feel they're really making a difference by simply signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen claims to have recorded more than 19 million actions from its supporters, working for a host of different purposes.
It states that these actions have helped to urge world leaders to announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which are expected to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In the first years of 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements arising from their actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been disbursed or used as funds.
The group estimates that hedge funds have so far directly impacted some 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and implementers committed to "helping children grow to their full potential", pledging $35 million to help eradicate malnutrition in Rwanda, after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens just like you, we can make social injustice or malnutrition a footnote in history, The Power of Nutrition ambassador Tracey Ullman told the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were implemented calling on the UK to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children through nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the FAQs on their website, which asked: What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?
Global Citizen responded: It will be a long and difficult journey - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of the performers at this year's event in New York, which will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The US could use the Navy to impose a blockade and hinder Russian energy exports - Home Secretary
Washington can, "if necessary", use its navy to prevent Russian energy sources from being available on the market, including in the Middle East, US Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke has revealed, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's involvement in Syria - particularly where it is operating at the invitation of the legitimate government - is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
I think the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to negotiate energy just like they do in Eastern Europe, the southern hub of Europe, he would say.
And according to officials, there are means and means to deal with it.
The US has the ability, thanks to the Navy, to ensure that waterways remain open and, if necessary, to implement a naval blockade, so that their energy is not put on the market, he said.
Zinke addressed the audience at an event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit organization that describes itself as the voice of energy consumers in the United States.
He compared Washington's strategies to negotiations with Russia and Iran, noting that they are, in fact, the same thing.
The economic option on Iran and Russia is, roughly speaking, leverage and replacement of fuels, he said, referring to Russia as not versatile, with an economy that depends on fossil fuels.
The statements were made because the Trump administration has been involved in a mission to boost its liquefied natural gas exports to Europe, and to replace Russia, which is by far the cheapest option for European consumers.
To that end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to pull out of Nord Stream 2, a "inappropriate" pipeline project that Trump says has made Berlin "a prisoner" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly pointed out that the Nord Stream 2, an $11 billion pipeline designed to double the capacity of the existing one to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin objects that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is driven simply by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a leverage tool and that consumers should be given the choice of suppliers, said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak following a meeting in Moscow in September with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry.
The US position was met with a negative reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US to stay out of the EU's energy policies and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
I see a major problem in the interference of a third country in our energy supply, said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will seriously consider running for president in 2020, says Massachusetts Senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday she will "seriously consider" running for president following the midterm elections.
At a town meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering running.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and that means putting a woman at the top", she said, according to The Hill.
After November 6th, I will seriously consider running for president.
During the town hall, Warren spoke out against President Donald Trump, saying he was "leading this country in the wrong direction".
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", she said.
Warren has been outspoken in her criticism of Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, whom he nominated to the Supreme Court.
On Friday, Warren tweeted: "It's only natural that we need an FBI investigation before the vote".
A poll released on Thursday, however, showed that a majority of Warren's own voters do not believe he should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of "likely" voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run, according to a Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
32 percent supported such a nomination.
The poll showed greater support for a candidacy from former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent in favor of a potential candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other high-profile Democratic names discussed for a potential 2020 candidacy include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he will make an official decision by January, as reported by The Associated Press.
Sarah Palin speaks about Track Palin's PTSD at the rally for Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after joining in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence Monday night.
"What my son is going through, what he is going through since he came back, I can relate to other families who are experiencing the effects of post-traumatic stress disorder and some of the injuries our soldiers come back with", he told an audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called her arrest "the elephant in the room" and said her son and other war veterans "come back a little different, hardened, wondering if there's that respect for which their fellow soldiers and pilots, and every other member of the military, have devoted themselves to this country".
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with assault and domestic violence on a woman, which interferes with a report of domestic violence and drug-related firearms possession, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 States and the District of Columbia support the challenge of new asylum policies
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting a legal battle against a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the District of Columbia filed an amicus brief in Washington on Friday in support of an asylum seeker who challenged the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions appeal that the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against federal policy was not disclosed.
She claimed that her partner and her violent gang members abused her, but US officials rejected her asylum request on July 20.
She was taken into custody in Texas.
Prosecutors supporting Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate large numbers of asylum seekers in the United States, as nations facing widespread problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
On Friday, District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law".
Federal law requires that all asylum applications be judged on the basis of the particular facts and circumstances of the application, and such a prohibition violates that principle, the amicus brief states.
In the brief, the prosecutors also argued that the policy of banning immigrants from entering the country harms the US economy, saying that they are highly likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary labor".
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence.
Asylum is available to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear due to race, religion, nationality, membership of certain social groups or political opinion, Sessions said on 11 June, as part of his policy announcement.
Kindergarten was never designed to alleviate every problem -- even all the serious problems -- that people face every day around the world.
Desperate recovery efforts in Palu as death toll doubles in search for survivors
For the survivors, the situation was becoming increasingly desperate.
"There is a lot of tension", said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, as she comforted her feverish baby at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
There's an ambulance carrying bodies at all times.
Clean water is scarce.
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, rummaging through their crumbling personal belongings, trying to recover whatever they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5-magnitude quake, were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a fractured shoulder and back, were resting outside Palu Military Hospital, where patients were being treated outside due to the continuous strong aftershocks.
Tears filled his eyes as he related how he felt when the violent earthquake shook the room he shared with his wife and daughter on the fifth floor of a hotel.
There was no time to save us.
"I was crushed by the rubble of the wall, I think", Haris told The Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
I heard my wife screaming for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're safe.
US Ambassador accuses China of "abusing power" with "advertising propaganda"
A week after a Chinese state newspaper ran a four-page ad in a US newspaper, touting the mutual benefits of US-China trade, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the US press to make propaganda.
President Donald Trump referred to the paid ad in the China Daily in the Des Moines Register - the best-selling newspaper in Iowa - on Wednesday after accusing China of trying to interfere in the November 6 US congressional elections, a charge China rejects.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the US election marked what US officials told Reuters was a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to pressure China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in an escalating trade war that has seen them adjust their tariffs to their respective imports.
China's retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade war were designed to hit exporters in states like Iowa, which support Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and US experts said.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in an op-ed in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, is now ramping up those bullies by running propaganda in our free newspapers.
In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is using America's cherished tradition of free speech and press by placing a paid ad in the Des Moines Register, Branstad wrote.
Conversely, in the street newspaper here in Beijing you will find few dissenting voices and you will not see any real reflection of the disparate opinions that the Chinese population may have about China's troubled economic trajectory, as the media are under the tight grip of the Chinese Communist Party, he wrote.
He added that one of China's most prominent newspapers has evaded an offer to publish his article, though he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans are alienating the female electorate ahead of the midterm elections with the Kavanaugh case, analysts warn.
With many leading Republicans supporting Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court and siding with him in dealing with various sexual harassment allegations, analysts have warned that there will be a backlash, especially from women, in the upcoming midterm elections.
Agitation in this regard has been extremely high, and many Republicans have already officially shown they want to proceed with a vote.
"You can't take this stuff back", Grant Reeher, a political science professor at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake's last-minute insistence on an FBI investigation would be enough to appease angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget tomorrow or November", said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, as reported by the Washington, D.C. newspaper on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is coming!" during their protest in the Senate chamber, when Republicans who control the Judiciary Committee chose to move forward with Kavanaugh's candidacy despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, as reported by Mic.
"Democrats' enthusiasm and motivation are skyrocketing", Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst, told the news website.
People say they were already high; it's true.
But they may be higher, especially among the undecided suburban electricians and young voters, between 18 and 29 years old, who often do not vote even though they dislike the president.
Even before Ford's public testimony, which provided details of his sexual harassment allegations against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts had speculated that a backlash might occur if Republicans went ahead with the confirmation.
"It's become a confusing whole for the GOP", said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, earlier this week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee vote, the final one or whether Kavanaugh will be benched, it's also about how the Republicans handled the situation and how they handled it", Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, told the news channel.
In any case, Americans seem to be somewhat divided over who to believe following the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a smaller percentage in favor of the latter.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believed Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they certainly or probably believed Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they believed Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following Flake's insistence, the FBI is currently conducting investigations into the allegations made by Ford, as well as at least one of the other accusers, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Last week, Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh assaulted her while drunk when she was 17.
Ramirez claims the Supreme Court nominee exposed her genitals at a Yale party in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to start a new Internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that is trying to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project from the tech legend, Inrupt, is a company that traces its origins to Berners-Lee's open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and what people can access and what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the underlying intent behind Inrupt is "world domination".
"We have to do it now", he said of the startup.
This is a historic moment.
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own online personal data store or POD.
It may include contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in one browser at the same time.
The uniqueness of the online personal data warehouse is that it is completely up to the user who can access what type of information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data".
The idea for Inrupt, according to John Bruce, CEO of the company, is to bring in the right resources, processes and skills to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some developers on staff hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology programmers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team will not tell Facebook and Google whether or not to introduce a complete change where their business models are completely disrupted overnight.
We're not asking for their permission.
In a Medium post published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial power and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Even after the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the Founder and Director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about this new era of the web", Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Clergyman of the Great War commemorated with the Victoria Cross
The only Church of England clergyman to be awarded a Victoria Cross during the First World War as a combatant was commemorated in his home town after 100 years.
Lieutenant Colonel, Reverend Bernard Vann, won the award on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, four days later he was killed by a sniper and never knew he had achieved Britain's highest level of military honour.
At a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, Saturday, his two nephews unveiled a plaque in his memory.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "magnificently symbolic" that the stone would be unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning feat.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Van led his battalion across the Saint-Quentin Canal through thick fog, under heavy field and machine gun fire.
Then he rushed toward the line of fire and with "greatest gallantry" advanced the line before running with a single-handed cannon and landing three of the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something I know I can never match and something that makes me more humble".
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid a wreath after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he felt really honored to have a role in the parade and added the value of a true hero is shown by the support he will get from so many people.
MMA fans stayed up all night watching Bellator 206 and instead got Peppa Pig.
Imagine, you've been up all night watching the famous Bellator 206 only to find yourself denied a view of the main event.
The San Jose show included 13 fights, including six on the main card, and was to be broadcast in the UK at night, live on Channel 5.
At 6am, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to clash, viewers in the UK were stunned when Peppa Pig appeared on screen.
Some have remained grounded after staying up until the early hours of the morning specifically for combat.
On Twitter, a fan described the switch to children's cartoons as "a sort of tasteless joke".
The government's policy is that at 6am that content is no longer appropriate, so it has had to switch to children's programming, said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the show.
Peppa the pig, yes.
Bellator chairman Scott Coker said they will work on programming to include UK viewers in the future.
"I think when I think about the replay, I think we can probably find a solution", Coker said.
But it is 6 a.m. on Sunday and we will not be able to find a solution before Sunday in our time zone, Monday in their time zone.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when he changed the schedule, there were a lot of messages coming in and no one was friendly.
We were trying to fix the problem, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't. It was a government problem.
I promise you, next time it won't happen.
We're going to limit it to five fights instead of six, as we normally do, and we've tried to get as much for the fans, and we just discussed that.
This is an unpleasant situation.
Tom Daley felt inferior because of his sexuality.
Olympic swimmer Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone else because of his sexuality - but that gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize until he was in high school that "not everyone is like me".
Speaking on the first episode of Radio 4's Desert Island Discs hosted by Lauren Laverne, she said she has been speaking out about gay rights to give others "hope".
He also stated that becoming a parent made him less concerned about winning the Olympics.
The longtime host of the show, Kirsty Young, took a number of months off for sickness.
Introducing himself as an outcast on Laverne's first program, Daley stated that he felt "less than" anyone else while growing up because "it was not socially acceptable that he liked both boys and girls".
She said, "Today, feeling less than, and feeling different, are the things that really gave me the strength and energy to be successful".
She wanted to prove herself, she said, so that no one would be disappointed if they found out about her sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a high-profile LGBT activist and used his face at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he made his voice heard because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without consequences and wanted to give others hope.
The three-time world champion said that falling in love with a man - American director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "took me by surprise".
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, last year, but said the age difference was never an issue.
When you go through so much at a young age - he went to his first Olympics when he was 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was hard to find someone his age who had experienced similar ups and downs.
The two became parents in June of a child named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "entire perspective" has changed.
If you had asked me last year, it was all about winning a gold medal, he said.
You know what, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.
His son shares the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father hadn't accepted that he was dying and that one of the last things he asked was if they had tickets to London 2012 already - because he wanted to be in the front row.
I couldn't tell him you wouldn't be around to be in the front row, Dad, he said.
"I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing and until he actually stopped and died, I hadn't yet realized he wasn't invincible", she said.
The following year Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics, winning bronze.
"I just knew it was what I had dreamed of all my life - swimming in front of a home crowd at the Olympics, there was no better feeling", she said.
This also inspired the choice of his first song - Proud by Heather Small - which had a special meaning for him in preparing for the Olympics and still makes his skin crawl.

Out of shape Mickelson benched in the Ryder Cup on Saturday .
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he'll have to get back in shape to avoid becoming an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, playing in the biennial event for a record 12th time, was benched by captain Jim Furyk for the fourballs and foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being the center of the action, as he often was for the United States, the five-time champion spent the day between cheerleading and working on his game in the range, hoping to correct what was bothering him.
Having never been the strongest driver even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old is not the ideal choice for the difficult Le Golf National, where the rough course regularly punishes wrong shots.
And if the course itself wasn't daunting enough, Mickelson, in Sunday's ninth match, faces the reigning British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their matches this week.
If the Americans, four points behind in their first 12 singles matches, start off with a hot start, Mickelson's match could prove absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his man, not that he could say much else.
He fully understood his role today, patted me on the shoulder, put his arm around me and said he would be ready for tomorrow, Furyk said.
He's got a lot of confidence.
He's a Hall of Famer and he's added so much to the teams in the past, and this week.
I probably didn't imagine playing two games.
I had imagined more, but this is the way it went and this is the way we thought it should go.
He wants to participate, just like everyone else.
Mickelson will break Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup games on Sunday.
It could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that never even remotely mirrored the heights of his personal best.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, although Furyk said his presence has brought intangible assets to the team.
He is funny, sarcastic, smart, likes to make fun of people, and is a great guy to have in the boardroom, she explained.
I also think the younger players enjoyed playing against him this week, which was fun to watch.
He did more than play
Europe's captain, Thomas Bjorn, knows that a good lead can quickly wear off.
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, knows from experience that a considerable lead in the individual matches on the final day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an awkward chase.
The Dane made his debut in the 1997 meeting in Valderrama where the team, captained by Seve Ballesteros, despite a five-point gap from the Americans, reached the finish line with a minimal advantage, winning 141⁄2-131⁄2.
I keep telling myself that we had a good lead in Valderrama, we had it in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama where we won, but by a short shot, said Bjorn (pictured) after watching the 2018 class win, Friday 5-3 and yesterday 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So history will prove to me and my team that it's not over.
We have to do our best tomorrow.
You gotta go out there and do it right.
It's not over until the dots are marked on the board.
Our goal is to try to win the trophy, and that's what we need to focus on.
I always focus on the 12 players on my team, but I know who's on the other side: the best golfers in the world.
Happy with the way his parents competed on that difficult golf course, Bjorn added: I would never have outdone myself.
Tomorrow's is a different challenge.
Tomorrow is the turn of the individual performances, which is another thing.
It's nice to be there with a teammate when things are going well, but when you're alone your golfing skills are put to the test.
This is the message we need to send to the players: tomorrow, you have to bring out the best in yourself.
Then you forget about your partner because he has to go there and bring out the best in himself.
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk will look for his players to perform individually rather than as a team, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas who collected three points out of four.
Furyk himself found himself on both sides of those big games of the final day, having been part of the winning team in Brookline before losing to the European Miracle of Medinah.
"I remember every word", he commented in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, led his players on the final day.
We have 12 big games tomorrow, but we want to start right now on the right foot like we did in Brookline and Medinah.
When the game starts to take a certain turn, the pressure builds up in the mid-game.
So we organize our training accordingly and we sort the kids in the way we see fit, because tomorrow we're going to try to do magic.
Thomas was given the task of leading the counterattack and facing Rory McIlroy in the top match with, in order, the other Europeans, Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, in the first half.
I chose thisorder because I think it covers the whole journey to the end, Bjorn said of his selection for the individual matches.
Germany's new warship has been delayed again.
According to local media, the last frigate of the German Navy was supposed to be commissioned in 2014 to replace the old Cold War-era military ships, but it will not be until at least next year due to faulty systems and soaring costs.
The commissioning of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the flagship of the new Baden-Württemberg-class frigates, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper citing a military spokesman.
The ship was due to join the Navy in 2014, but troubling issues after delivery have plagued the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the older Bremen-class ships.
They will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles as well as some hidden technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods, as the new frigates should be able to be deployed for up to two years away from national ports.
However, the continuing delays mean that the innovative warships, which are said to allow Germany to project its power overseas, will already be obsolete when they enter service, notes Die Zeit.
The ill-fated Type F-125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to the builder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media noted a number of crucial "software and hardware flaws" that made the ship unsuitable for a combat mission.
The software deficiencies were particularly important as the Baden-Württemberg-class ships will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, barely half the staff of the older Bremen-class ships.
In addition, it was found that the ship is decidedly overweight, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-tonne Rheinland-Pfalz is thought to be twice as heavy as similar ships used by the Germans in World War II.
Apart from the faulty hardware, the cost of the whole project (including crew training) is also becoming an important issue.
It appears to have reached 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars) from the initial 2.2 billion euros.
The problems of the new frigates are particularly important in the light of recent alarms about the reduction in German naval power.
At the beginning of the year, Hans-Peter Bartels, Parliamentary Commissioner for the Armed Forces, admitted that the Navy was in fact "short of ships to use".
The official said the issue has worsened considerably over time, as old unarmed ships have not been replaced by new ships.
His regret is that none of the Baden-Württemberg class frigates have been able to join the Navy.
The National Trust spies on the secret lives of bats
New research at a farm in the Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how bats use their eyesight to obtain food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed light on the behaviour of the only existing flying mammals and guide future conservation efforts.
The study by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will follow common and soprano bats, as well as brown earrings and Daubenton bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations around the property to track bat activity during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
An expert's analysis of the recorded sounds will determine the frequency of the bats' calls and the behavior of each species.
A habitat map and a report will then be produced to create a detailed scale-up of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, a conservation consultant for the NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas of the habitat are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as the creation of grasslands, and how best to maintain forests for bats and other related species.
The bat population in Scotland and the United Kingdom has declined dramatically over the past century.
Bats are at risk from construction and development work that affects trees and destroys their habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a threat, as can mosquito-sniffing paper and certain chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
Bats aren't really blind.
However, because of their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated eco-location technique to spot insects and obstacles in their path.
LNTS, which is responsible for the care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 acres of land in the country, takes bats very seriously.
Ten qualified experts regularly conduct investigations, inspect the three-pole and sometimes perform rescues.
The organisation has even established Scotland's first bat reserve exclusively at Threave Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
The manager of the estate, David Thompson, says the property is the ideal territory.
Here in Threave we have a large area for bats, he said.
We have the old buildings, many centuries-old trees and a good habitat.
But there's a lot about bats that we still don't know, so the work we're doing here and at other properties will help us understand more about their growth needs.
It stresses the importance of bat control before carrying out maintenance on the property as it is possible that the unintentional destruction of a single female litter can kill up to 400 females and young, possibly wiping out an entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass, disturb or destroy their hives.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scotland's head of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help.
He said: 'We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we don't know how their populations are doing.'
Ronaldo rejects rape charges as lawyers sue German weekly
Cristiano Ronaldo has labeled the rape allegations against him as fake news, stating that people want to advertise themselves with his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German weekly Der Spiegel that published the charges.
The Portuguese Juventus striker was accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
Der Spiegel also reported on Friday that the newspaper was accused of paying $375,000 to keep the story quiet.
In an Instagram video directed to his 142 million followers in the hours following the allegations, Ronaldo, 33, dismissed the statements as "fake news".
No, no, no, no, no, no. I'm not going to do this.
What they said today is false, says the five-time Ballon d'Or face down on the camera.
They want to advertise themselves through my name.
It's not unusual.
They want to be famous by using my name, but that's part of the game.
I'm happy and everything is fine, the footballer added with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they describe as "unacceptable reporting of suspects in the private sphere".
Christian Schertz, a lawyer, said the footballer would seek compensation for "moral damage to the extent that it corresponds to the gravity of the violation of privacy, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years".
The incident allegedly took place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Casino Resort in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly entered the footballer's room, where he subjected her to anal violence, according to statements filed in Clark County District Court, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo would have gotten down on one knee after the incident saying he was 99 percent a good guy disappointed by 1 percent.
The documents show that Ronaldo confirmed that the two had sexual intercourse, but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and hospital, where her injuries were photographed, but later agreed to a settlement because she felt "terrified of reprisals" and worried about the prospect of "being publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old is now trying to reverse the deal, claiming she is still traumatized by the alleged accident.
Ronaldo was about to move to Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the incident, and this summer he will join Italian side Juventus on a €100 million deal.
Brexit: UK will forever regret the loss of carmakers
The UK "may forever regret" losing its status as the world's leading car manufacturer following Brexit, said Industry Minister Greg Clark.
He also said he was 'concerned' by statements made by Toyota UK to the BBC about Britain's possible exit from the EU without a deal and the resulting temporary shutdown of production at its Burnaston plant near Derby.
"We need an agreement", said Minister Clark.
The Japanese carmaker claims that delays at the borders in the event of a no-deal Brexit could affect jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which makes the Toyota Auris and Avensis, produced around 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the EU.
"I believe that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production at our factory will stop", said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's general manager in Burnaston.
There is growing concern among other British carmakers about leaving the EU without an agreement on how crossborder trade works, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, claims that after Brexit it will close its Mini plants in Oxford for a month.
The main concern is the supply chain risks faced by manufacturers in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line is run on the basis of the just in time concept, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from British and European suppliers for cars on order.
If the UK leaves the EU on 29 March without a deal, there could be border disruptions that cause delays and shortages of parties.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day's worth of inventory in its Derbyshire plant, the company said, so production would be halted.
Minister Clark says Theresa May's plan for future relations with the EU is 'designed precisely to avoid these border disruptions'.
We need a deal.We want the best deal that will allow us to not only enjoy the current success but to seize this opportunity, he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
The proof, not only from Toyota but also from other car manufacturers, is that we absolutely must be able to continue what has been a very successful supply chain.
Toyota was unable to say how long production could be halted but, in the long run, warns that additional costs could reduce plant competitiveness and potentially jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the head of the plant's trade union delegates, says workers are very concerned: "In my experience, once jobs are reduced, they are not reinstated".
A government spokesman said: We have proposed a clear and credible plan for future relations with the EU.
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again, says the White House.
Donald Trump's high-risk meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be "postponed for a week" as the dispute over Judge Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller investigating Russian election interference, ties between Trump advisers and Russia, and the president's possible obstruction of justice.
The possibility that Trump could fire the deputy attorney general, thus jeopardizing Mueller's independence, has fueled Washington's gossip for months.
Later that month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was talking about wearing a bug to record conversations with Trump and trying to remove the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein has denied the news.
But last Monday, he went to the White House and there were rumors that he was going to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was at the United Nations in New York at the time, was announced for Wednesday.
Trump said he "would rather not" fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid overlap with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week of FBI questioning of Kavanaugh, further delaying the Senate's final vote.
On Sunday, Trump's spokeswoman Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News.
Asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said: "No date has been set, it could be this week, I guess it will be postponed another week considering everything that's going on with the Supreme Court.
But we'll see and I'll keep updating the press.
Some journalists may dispute this claim: Sanders has not held a press briefing at the White House since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the lack of briefings was not due to an aversion to TV reporters "showing off", though he did say: "I don't disagree with the fact that they show off".
He suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press might be more frequent.
The President holds more Question and Answer sessions than any President before him, he said, adding without citing evidence: We have checked the figures.
The briefings will still be there, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask the president of the United States questions directly, it's much better than talking to me".
We're trying to do it, like we've been doing for the last few weeks, and this will replace the press briefings and you can talk to the president of the United States.
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have proved his point by giving a free-wheeling, yet bizarre speech to a group of journalists.
The Minister for Health writes to European NHS workers in Scotland to express his concerns about Brexit
The Minister for Health has written to EU staff working at the NHS in Scotland to express the country's gratitude and wish them well to stay after Brexit.
Scottish MP Jeane Freeman sent a letter less than six months before the UK leaves the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to covering the costs of applying for settled status for EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
In his letter, Minister Freeman writes: Throughout the summer there have been continuous negotiations between the UK and the EU on Brexit, leading to the decisions in the autumn.
But the British Government has also prepared for a no-deal scenario.
I know this is a time of great concern for all of you.
I therefore wish to reiterate today my appreciation for the contribution made by all staff, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring in valuable experience and expertise that strengthens and improves the work of health services, benefiting patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is certainly your home and we strongly wish you to stay here.
Christion Abercrombie has been operated on with a head injury.
Tennessee State Tigers defensive back Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after sustaining a head injury in Saturday's game against the Vanderbilt Commodores in which the team lost 31-27, The Tennessean's Mike Organ reported.
Head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the accident that caused the injury occurred just before halftime.
"He approached the edge of the field and passed out", Reed said.
First responders and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen at the field edge, before putting him on a stretcher and taking him away for further examination.
A Tennessee State executive reported to Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had surgery at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.
Harris added that "we have no word yet on the type and extent of the damage" and that Tennessee State is trying to figure out when he was injured.
Abercrombie, a sophomore, is in his first season with Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
He had a total of five tackles before leaving the game, which brought his season total to 18 tackles.
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher stamp duty for buying property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher stamp duty on property purchases in the UK and the extra cash flow will be used to help the homeless, according to new Labour plans
The move will offset the success of Corbyn's initiative to attract young voters.
The increase in stamp duty will apply to taxpayers who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Treasury Department plans to raise up to £120 million a year to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher stamp duty on property purchases in the UK and the extra cash flow will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May announced today.
The move will be seen as an attempt to offset the success of Jeremy Corbyn's initiative to attract young voters with the promise of providing more affordable housing and higher incomes.
The increase in stamp duty will be applied to individuals and companies not paying taxes in the UK, and the additional resources will support the Government's initiative to combat homelessness.
The surcharge, which is in addition to the current stamp duty, including the high levels introduced two years ago on second homes and buy to lets, could be more than 3%.
The Treasury expects the exercise to raise up to £120 million a year.
An estimated 13% of new construction in London is being bought by non-UK residents, driving up prices and making it difficult for first-time home buyers to enter the housing market.
Many of the country's wealthiest areas, especially in the capital, have become "ghost towns" due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the state.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a cut in stamp duty to help younger people buy their first home.
He accused big construction companies of keeping property prices high by grabbing land without using it and encouraged Prime Minister May to give up quotas on affordable housing to fix Britain's "housing disaster".
Corbyn has announced a series of striking proposals for housing reform, including rent controls and the elimination of wrongful evictions.
He also wants to give the council more power over the construction of new buildings.
Prime Minister May said: Last year I said I would commit myself to restoring the British dream, which is that life should be better for new generations.
And that means restoring the housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it would not be fair if buying a house was as easy for non-UK residents and foreign companies as it is for UK resident workers.
For many people, the dream of owning a home has become too distant and the dignity of the homeless remains a reality.
Jack Ross: My highest aspiration is to lead Scotland
Sunderland's technical director Jack Ross says his "greatest aspiration" is to eventually become Scotland manager.
The 42-year-old Scot is drawn to the challenge of lifting the North East side who are currently third in League One, three points off the top.
He arrived at the Stadium of Light this summer after managing St Mirren in the Scottish Premiership last season.
I wanted to play for my country as a footballer.
I was in Serie B and that's it, Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound programme.
I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my father as a child and it's something I'll always remember.
However, this will only be possible if I succeed as a team manager.
Ross' predecessors at the helm of Sunderland were Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio. He was also a member of the Sunderland team that won the FA Cup in the 1960s.
The former Allowa Athletic manager says he feels no anxiety about following up on such important names in an equally important team, having previously turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"My success at the moment is measured by my ability to bring the team back to the Premier League".
Considering the structure and facilities of the club, we can say that it belongs without a doubt to the Premier League, he said.
It's not an easy task, but I believe I can only succeed if I can get the team back up.
Ross's managerial career began three years ago, following a spell as assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months as assistant manager at Hearts.
He then helped Alloa to save themselves from relegation to the third tier and led St Mirren from the brink of relegation to the Championship title the following season.
Ross claims to feel much more comfortable now than he did during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
It was probably a real turning point, he recalls about the direction of the allowance.
I really believed that the manager role was made for me, more than the player role.
It seems odd because I worked hard, I made a living, and I got some good results.
But playing can be hard.
There's a lot you have to deal with every week.
I still deal with it in terms of stress and work pressure, but the management seems good.
I've always wanted to direct and now I'm doing it, I feel much calmer than I've ever felt in my life.
You can hear the full interview on Sportsound on Saturday, September 30th, on Radio Scotland between 12:00 and 13:00 BST.
According to one study, the best time to drink a pint is 5:30 on a Saturday.
The summer heat wave has brought more revenue to struggling British pubs and more concern to catering services.
Data shows that pubs and bars saw a 2.7 percent increase in sales in July, while restaurant revenues fell 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin of business consultancy CGA put the data together and commented: The persistence of the sun and England's long stay at the World Cup meant that July followed a similar path to June, when pubs were up 2.8 percent, while restaurants were hit hardest.
The 1.8 per cent drop in June's restaurant sector worsened in July.
The pubs and bars where drinking is predominantly taking place were the strongest, with a more even increase than the decrease in restaurants.
The pubs where you eat have also suffered from the heat, though not as much as the restaurants.
It seems like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In pubs and bars, beverage sales rose 6.6 percent in the month, while food consumption fell 3 percent.
Paul Newman, Recreation and Leisure Industry Analyst at RSM, said: These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the main factor when it comes to retail sales.
It is not surprising that restaurants continue to struggle, although a 4.8 percent annual sales decline will be particularly burdensome in addition to continued cost pressures.
The long hot summer could not have come at a worse time for restaurant owners and only time will tell whether the more moderate temperatures we enjoyed in August will give us the necessary respite.
The overall growth in pub and restaurant sales, including new openings, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a decline in brand roll-outs.
The sales tracker company Coffer Peach Tracker for pubs, bars and restaurants in the UK, which aggregates and analyses performance data across 47 operating groups with combined turnover of over £9 billion, is the industry reference company.
One in five children has a secret social networking account that they hide from their parents
A survey reveals that one in five children, some as young as 11, has secret social networking accounts that he hides from parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in fake Instagram pages
The news has fueled fears that sexual content will be posted
20% of students said they had a "main" account to show their parents
One in five children, some as young as 11, create social networking accounts that are hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid growth in fake Instagram accounts, a reference to the photo-sharing site Instagram.
The news has reinforced fears that sexual content will be posted.
Twenty percent of students said they run a clean "main" account to show their parents, while keeping it private.
A mother who accidentally discovered her 13-year-old daughter's secret website found a teenager urging others to rape me.
Research by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) of private schools found that 40 percent of 11 to 18-year-olds have two accounts, and half of them admitted to having private accounts.
HMC director Mike Buchanan said: "It is alarming that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them".
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice for athletes" on the Scottish Athletics Council.
Eilidh Doyle was elected as a non-executive member of the Scottish Athletics Board at the national general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated athlete in athletics and President Ian Beattie described the appointment as a great opportunity for those running the sport to benefit from his extensive international experience over the past decade.
Eilidh is deeply respected in the Scottish, British and world athletics community and we are sure that Scotland Athletics could benefit enormously from bringing her on board, said Beattie.
Doyle said: "I look forward to acting as the voice of athletes and I hope I can contribute and help drive sport in Scotland".
The American, winner of the 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Games and four Olympic gold medals, and now a BBC commentator, has been unable to walk after a transient ischemic attack.
He tweeted: "A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time could tell if and to what extent I would recover.
It was exhausting work, but I recovered completely, learned to walk again, and today I move with agility!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!.
A milkmaid's ad compares cows and mothers and divides online opinion
A milk producer has divided the net with an advertisement comparing breastfeeding mothers to cows being milked.
To mark the launch of what is being described as the "world's first silent wearable baby bottle", consumer technology company Elvie has launched an ad in the form of a humorous music video to showcase the freedom of expression as a mother given by the new baby bottle.
Four real mothers dance in a cow barn on a track that includes songs like: "Yes, I pour milk but I don't have a thing" and "If you haven't noticed, these aren't breasts, these are my boobs".
The chorus goes on: "Take it out, take it out, feed the children, take it out, take it out, pour milk to my ladies".
However, the advertisement, posted on the company's Facebook page, caused controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has generated mixed reactions among viewers, many of whom claimed it highlights the horrors of the dairy industry.
An unfortunate decision to use cows to advertise the product.
Like us, they have to stay pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their young are stolen from them a few days after birth, someone wrote.
Elvie the milkmaid wears herself discreetly under a mommy bra
Another commented: Understandably traumatic for both mother and child.
But yes, why not use them to advertise a milk cart for mothers who will continue to keep their babies?
Another added: "It's really a pointless advertisement.
Others defended it and one woman even admitted to finding the song "funny".
"I think this is a brilliant idea.
If I was still breastfeeding, I'd like one.
When I used the milk cart, I felt like a cow.
Advertising is a little irreverent, but it's not far from reality.
This is a brilliant product", someone wrote.
Another person commented: "It's a funny ad for moms who use the bottle (often at work or in the bathroom) and feel like 'cows.'"
It is not intended to praise or judge the dairy industry".
At the end of the video, the actresses are shown dancing with a discreet pull-up bra.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the idea that many women who use the bottle feel like cows.
The Elvie milk pump, however, is completely silent, has no wires or tubes, and can be tucked into a breastplate giving women the freedom to move around, hold babies, and even go outside while they pump.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother, commented: "Elvie's milk thistle is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
By comparing women who use the milk pump to cows, we wanted to highlight all the challenges of this practice by demonstrating in a fun and easily recognizable way the incredible sense of freedom that the new milk pump can provide".
This isn't the first time Elvie the milkmaid has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, the mother of two showed up on the runway of designer Marta Jakubowski wearing this product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved into a tent city on the Texas border
The number of migrant children has increased exponentially even though monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, in part because the Trump administration's tough rhetoric and policy has made it harder to care for these children.
Most of those who took them in were usually illegal immigrants who now feared jeopardizing their ability to stay in the country by offering to do so.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential caregivers and other adult family members would be fingerprinted and the data passed on to immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, told Congress that the agency has arrested dozens of people who offered to take in unmarried children.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no criminal record.
"Nearly 80 percent of people who offer to take in children or are members of the families of these people are in the country illegally and most of them are criminal foreigners.
We are therefore continuing to hunt these people down", said Albence.
To try to process the children more quickly, officials have introduced new rules that some of them will have to appear in court within a month of detention, instead of the previous standard 60 days, according to those who work at the shelters.
Many will appear by video conference instead of in person to plead their case for legal status before an immigration judge.
Those deemed unfit to receive help will be quickly expelled.
The longer children remain in foster care, the more likely they are to suffer from anxiety and depression that cause violent tantrums or attempts to escape, according to those who work in the shelters and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months.
Supporters of this view say that the likelihood of this happening is even higher in a large facility like Tornillo's where, precisely because of its size, it is easier for children's distress signals to be ignored.
They add that moving children into the tent city without giving them time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to friends could exacerbate the trauma many are already facing.
Syria urges US, French and Turkish occupation forces to withdraw immediately
In his speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home even though the war is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces are illegally occupying Syrian soil under the pretext of fighting terrorism and "will be dealt with accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately without any conditions", he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed and millions displaced since 2011.
He reiterated that Damascus would continue to "fight this holy war until it has liberated all Syrian territories" from terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, who primarily train and support the Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in this war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said conditions were favourable for their return and accused "some Western countries" of "inciting unfounded fears" that drive refugees away from their homeland.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organisations to intervene to facilitate their return", he said.
"What should be a humanitarian issue is being politicized".
The United States and the European Union have warned that no reconstruction aid will be provided in Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in Idlib, the last major rebel stronghold, has created an opportunity for continued political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement has prevented a major attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the province, home to three million people.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement has "specific deadlines" and expressed hope that the military action will target jihadists, including fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked al-Nusra Front, who "will be eradicated".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene a new committee of government and opposition members soon to draft a draft constitution for post-war Syria and prepare the way for elections.
Moualem set out the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that the group's work should be limited to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution" without any interference.
Why Trump is going to win a second term
According to this logic, Trump will be re-elected in 2020 unless, as many liberal viewers may hope, his presidency ends prematurely due to impeachment or scandal.
In what will undoubtedly be "the most dramatic end of a presidency ever!"
At the moment, there's no sign of a decline in viewership.
Since 2014, first-night ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News averages 2.4 million viewers on first night, up sharply from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has surpassed network ratings to reach 3.5 million viewers on prime-time news nights.
"It's a fire that people are drawn to because it's not something that can be explained", says Neal Baer, showrunner of the ABC television series "Designated Survivor", which tells the story of a cabinet member who suddenly becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an experienced writer of brilliant comedies and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
Remember a cab ride in Boston before the 2016 election?
The driver told her she was going to vote for Trump.
She asked him why.
He said, "Because it makes me laugh".
So chaos is a source of fun.
Of course, unlike any other television show, the plot of Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can be reunited and the health of the global economy.
But not watching the news is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it goes far beyond our duty as informed citizens to find ourselves following for the sixth consecutive hour a panel of experts discussing Bob Woodward's in-depth research for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich skin jacket ("a garment full of rags", The Washington Post commented), and the implications of Stormy Daniels' disgusting descriptions of Trump's anatomical parts.
I, for one, will never be able to watch Super Mario without thinking about it.
"Part of the reason what he does feels like a reality show is that there's news every night", says Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and author of "Pawn Stars", about the casting and daily plot developments of Trump's show (in contrast to the N.F.L. praising Kim Jong-un).
You can't miss an episode, or you'll be left behind.
This week I went to visit Mike Fleiss on the North Shore of Kauai, and even though it was a sunny day with almost 30 degrees, he was locked in his house watching MSNBC and recording CNN.
He couldn't get away from the TV, not while Brett Kavanaugh was facing the Senate Judiciary Committee and the uncertain future of the Supreme Court.
Fleiss commented: "I remember when we used to do all these absurd programmes and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization.'
"I thought it was a joke, but they were right".

Foreign cash inflows in the run-up to the closest midterm elections
It's no surprise that the 17th District is seeing a cash flow from a congressional district realignment that has resulted in two incumbents now running for the same seat.
The recent redefinition of the Pittsburgh suburban district brings on Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in a special election held last spring.
Lamb is running against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents Pennsylvania's old 12th district which overlaps with the new 17th.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts' electoral college had been unconstitutionally rigged in favor of the Republicans.
The 17th District race has sparked a campaign characterized by fierce opposition between the financial branches of the two major parties, namely the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after a landslide victory in the March special election for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
That seat had been held by a Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political opinion polls have given the Democrats a slight advantage.
The U.S. thought about penalizing El Salvador for supporting China, then changed their mind.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little resistance from Washington.
In June 2017, a rather cordial meeting took place between the President of Panama Juan Carlos Varela and President Trump who also had a hotel in Panama until the partners forced the Trump Organization's leadership team to leave.
State Department officials decided to bring back the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama following the "recent decision not to recognize Taiwan anymore", State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But the decision to impose sanctions was only taken against El Salvador, which in 2017 received about $140 million in U.S. aid for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts in financial aid and visa restrictions, would be of concern to the Central American country with a high rate of unemployment and homicide.
After a series of internal meetings, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to hold a similar meeting last year that was seen as a step forward in an effort to stop migrants from heading to the United States.
But in mid-September senior officials made clear that they intended to proceed with the conference, thereby definitively waiving any sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence has been assigned to chair the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, demonstrating the importance the administration attaches to this meeting, diplomats say.
And the three American envoys returned safely to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without receiving any further reprimands or punishments from Washington.
A Bolton spokesman at the White House declined to comment on details of the debate described by three US officials and two diplomats who agreed to speak anonymously about internal decisions.
Their story was confirmed by an outside analyst close to the administration who remained anonymous.
Study the history
In a report he will release, special counsel Robert Mueller could accuse Trump of obstruction of justice, a charge that now appears to have ample evidence.
According to reports, Mueller's investigation is intended to shed light on Trump's possible collusion with Russia during the presidential campaign.
If Congress were to pass to the Democrats, Trump would have to answer these charges in front of voters and perhaps a jury of his peers just as he prepares to run again.
There are many unknowns and I do not mean to say that Trump's fall is inevitable, as is that of his European counterparts.
On both sides of the Atlantic we will have to make choices that will determine how long the fight may last.
In 1938, German officials were ready to stage a coup against Hitler if the Western powers stopped him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We have failed to do so by losing the opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The course of history revolves around these turning points where the relentless march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans are facing a number of challenges right now.
What if Trump decided to fire Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein's position has been complicated since this very newspaper reported that last year he secretly suggested wiretapping Trump, questioning his ability to hold the office of president.
Rosenstein claims the story in The Times is not true.
"How will we react if the new FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or impartial or if it is upheld in the Supreme Court despite credible charges of attempted rape and perjury?
And most importantly, in the midterm elections, will we vote for a Congress that holds Trump accountable for his actions?
If we do not pass these tests, democracy will have to prepare for a long winter.
But the lesson I learned in Prague makes me think we can do it.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy.
She survived, moved to America, and 60 years later, she sent me to light the Sabbath candles with the swastika.
With such a legacy, I can only be optimistic about the future".
Norman Eisen, Senior Fellow at the Brookings Institution, is the president of the Washington-based organization Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics and the author of "The Last Palace: Europe's Turbulent Century in Five Lives and One Legendary House".
Graham Dorrans of the Rangers is optimistic about the Rapid Vienna game.
Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday knowing that a win over Austria, after a convincing draw against Villarreal in Spain, would give them a good chance to qualify for Group G of the Europa League.
Although midfielder Graham Dorrans played his first game of the season due to a knee injury in the 2-2 draw with Villarreal, he believes that this result can allow Rangers to do great things.
"For us it was a positive result because Villarreal is a good team", said the 31-year-old.
"We went into the game confident of doing well and took home a point.
Perhaps we could have won in extremis but, all in all, the draw is a fair result.
They were better in the first half, while in the second half we played better.
As for Thursday, it will be another great European evening.
We hope to get the three points but it will be a difficult match because our opponents have achieved a good result in the last game.
Last year was definitely difficult because of my injuries and the changes at the club level but now the feeling is positive.
The team is in good shape, the boys are having fun and the preparation is going well.
So we can forget about the problems of last season and think about the future".
Women are concerned about the cost of long-term care
Although the respondents have clear ideas about what kind of care they would like to receive, few have addressed the subject in the family.
About half of those surveyed by Nationwide say they have discussed the cost of long-term care with their spouse.
Only 10 percent say they have talked to their children about it.
According to Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide, "people want a family member to take care of them, but they don't have that conversation".
That's where to start.
Talk it over with your mate and children. You cannot prepare your family to assist you if you do not communicate your wishes in advance.
If you have a counselor, decide with him and your family where and how you want to receive care, as these factors can be costly.
Get a financial adviser involved - he can advise you on how to pay for the expenses you will face.
The choice of long-term care financing may include a traditional insurance policy or a hybrid life insurance policy with redemption value to cover these costs or continue to pay for insurance money as long as you are able to do so.
Prepare all necessary paperwork to avoid legal battles when you die.
Appoint a health care advocate so that someone you trust can oversee your medical care and make sure that professionals meet your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Consider also the possibility of a power of attorney for your finances.
You can choose a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and to make sure that your bills are paid if you are unable to do so.

Man shot multiple times with a air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot multiple times with a shotgun while walking home from a night out.
The victim, a man in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Police officers described the shooting, which occurred around 02:30 BST, as a "random act".
The victim didn't see his attacker.
His life is not in danger, and police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
Officials say at least 384 people have died in a massive earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday.
Communications are down and rescue officials have not been able to get any information from Donggala Regency, an area north of Palu that is near the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude quake.
After the disaster, more than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala on Sulawesi Island:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi Island and with a population of about 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
When it was hit by the earthquake and tsunami, the city was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
Donggala is a regency that stretches along more than 300 km (180 mi) of coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi island.
The regency, an administrative region dependent on a province, had about 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main sources of livelihood for the economy of Central Sulawesi Province and especially the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also an important activity in the province, but is mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by several tsunamis in the past 100 years, according to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
Another tsunami hit the western area of Donggala in 1996 killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Ring of Fire, and earthquakes are frequent.
Here are some of the strongest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: On 26 December a very strong earthquake on the western coast of Aceh province in northern Sumatra caused a tsunami that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, including more than half of Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra between late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on Nias Island off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake hits southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that lashes the southern coast killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-magnitude earthquake struck near the city of Padang, capital of West Sumatra province.
The death toll was over 1,100.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra, causing a 10-meter tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A mild earthquake struck Pidie Jaya regency in Aceh causing destruction and panic among people who remembered the devastation of the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
In this case there was no tsunami but more than 100 people died under the rubble.
2018: A strong earthquake hit the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia killing more than 500 people, most of them in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily stranded thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's eldest son has been arrested on domestic violence charges.
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska Governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
According to a report issued Saturday by Alaska State Troopers, Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstruction of justice and resisting arrest.
According to the report, when an acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, he ripped the phone out of her hand.
Palin was transferred to the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and his bail was set at $500, according to KTUU.
According to the network, he appeared in court on Saturday and pleaded "certainly innocent".
Palin faces three counts of first-degree assault, which carries a maximum sentence of one year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with a second-degree misdemeanor punishable by one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time Palin's been accused of criminal activity.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
The mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged assault.
The case is currently under review by the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, obstruction of justice and possession of a weapon while intoxicated in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of punching her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 for linking her son's violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) from her time in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake and tsunami: Hundreds dead
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electricity and communications networks are down and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck off Central Sulawesi, which is northeast of Indonesia's capital Jakarta.
Social media is now circulating videos showing the moment of impact.
When the tsunami hit the coast, hundreds of people had gathered for a beach party in the city of Palu.
Federal prosecutors are seeking extraordinary capital punishment for suspects in the New York City terror attacks.
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the perpetrator of the terrorist attack that killed eight people - a rare death sentence that has not been carried out for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, is accused of using a Home Depot rental van to crash into a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, hitting pedestrians and cyclists in October.
Under the conditions for the Southern District of New York's death penalty request, to justify the death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and equally "intentionally" inflicted serious bodily harm.
According to the court document, both of these charges can lead to the death penalty.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Saipov on 22 counts that included eight counts of felony murder, typically used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and one count of assault and destruction of vehicles.
The attack required "real planning and premeditation", prosecutors said, describing Saipov's manner as "heinous, cruel and depraved".
The preliminary notification states that "Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused damage, offence and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco".
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
It's been ten years since the Southern District of New York prosecuted the last death penalty case.
The man on trial, Khalid Barnes, was charged with the murder of two drug dealers but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The death penalty was last carried out in New York in 1953 in the federal case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, husband and wife charged with conspiracy through espionage and indicted for passing information to the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs both died in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no signs of remorse in the days and months following the attack.
Police say he told investigators he was proud of what he did.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that he decided to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
He also asked the police to hang the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
He pleaded not guilty to all 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said he was "obviously disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty rather than accept a guilty plea and a life sentence without the possibility of parole will only prolong the trauma of these events for all those involved", Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had earlier pleaded with prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP says Nigel Farage must lead Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage today vowed to "mobilize the people's army" during a protest at the Tory conference.
When one of Theresa May's party MPs suggested that he should handle the negotiations with the European Union, the former UK Independence Party leader said politicians needed to "feel the pressure" from Eurosceptics.
In March, Conservative MP Peter Bone said in Birmingham that the UK "would already be out of Europe" if Farage was the Brexit Secretary.
But the challenges May faces in trying to reconcile the positions of her deeply divided party were highlighted by pro-Remain Tories who took part in a separate anti-Brexit protest in London.
The Prime Minister is trying to implement the Chequers Plan amid attacks from Brexit supporters, those who want to stay in Europe and the European Union.
Allies insist on continuing the attempt to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the strong collective reaction, and forcing Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between what May proposes and "chaos".
At the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull, Bone said he wanted to abandon the Chequers Plan.
He suggested that the task of conducting negotiations with Brussels should be entrusted to Farage.
"We would be out of Europe by now", he said.
Member of Parliament Wellingborough added: "I am for Brexit but we must abandon the Chequers Plan".
Explaining his reasons for his opposition to the European Union, he said: "We did not fight world wars to be servile.
We want to be able to enforce our laws in our country".
Bone rejected the view that public opinion would change after the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their mind and want to stay in Europe is completely false".
Tory Brexit MP Andrea Jenkyns also joined the march and told reporters: "I'm just telling the prime minister to listen to the people.
The Chequers Plan is not popular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for it and it does not enjoy the favour of our party and our activists who are out in the streets hunting for votes to allow us to be elected.
Forget the Chequers Plan and start listening".
In a forceful message to May, he added: "Prime Ministers can keep their seats when they keep their promises".
At the rally, Farage said politicians should be able to "feel the pressure" if they were going to betray the decision made with the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class", he said.
"They are trying to betray Brexit and we are here today to tell them we will not let them".
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to feel the pressure on our political class that is about to betray Brexit.
We intend to mobilise the people's army of this country that voted for Brexit and we will not stop until we become an independent, self-reliant and proud United Kingdom".
Meanwhile, pro-Remain protesters marched through the streets of Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A small number of activists have pushed the Tories against Brexit banners since the group was formed this weekend.
The Labour Party mocked the Tories for the security problems they had with a party app at the opening of the conference.
"These are the people who say they can install the IT systems and all the technology for the Canada plus plus agreement, for frictionless borders and for borderless trade in Ireland", he added.
It's all a sham.
A good Brexit does not exist", he concluded.
Warren is seriously considering running for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will seriously consider running for president after the November election.
According to the Boston Globe, the Democratic senator from Massachusetts spoke about her future Saturday at a town hall in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was co-chair of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
The possibility that he could challenge Trump in 2020 had been in the air for some time.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with voters in the form of a town meeting since Trump took office.
A participant asked her if she intended to run for president.
Warren responded that it was time for "women to go to Washington to fix the government and that means a woman to hold the highest office".
Arrested for the murder of LSU Sims player
Baton Rouge, Louisiana police said Saturday they have arrested a suspect in the murder of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at 11:00 on ETNews.
On Friday, he posted a video of the murder asking for help identifying a man visible in the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus early Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims reported a gunshot wound to the head that resulted in his death", Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told 247Sports.
Wayde stepped in to defend a friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being at the scene with a gun and to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and is being held in custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A 6-foot-2 junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims played in 32 games last season, starting 10 of them, averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton moves closer to world title after victory over Sebastian Vettel thanks to team orders
When Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of teammate Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was immediately apparent that the Mercedes team's orders would have a major impact on the race.
From pole, Bottas starts well leaving Hamilton to defend against Vettel's attacks in the first two laps.
Vettel stops first in the pits leaving Hamilton in the traffic at the back of the pack, a move that could be decisive.
The Mercedes stopped the next lap and returned to the track behind Vettel, but Hamilton overtook him after some wheel-to-wheel action in which the Ferrari driver tried to prevent him from passing inside, risking to end up outside after a double shift to defend himself in the third corner.
Max Verstappen starts from the back row of the grid but by the end of lap one he's already seventh on the day of his 21st birthday.
He then led the race for most of the race without stopping at the pits for a tyre change and attempted to finish quickly to overtake Kimi Raikkonen and take fourth place.
In the end, however, he has to pit stop at the 44th lap and in the remaining 8 laps he is unable to increase the pace and overtake Raikkonen, who comes fourth.
"It's a tough day because Valtteri worked really hard all weekend and he was really nice to let me pass.
The team did an outstanding job to take first and second place", said Hamilton.
A bad example of body language.
At a rally on Saturday, President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein for insisting that she had not disclosed the contents of Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of attempted rape.
During a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are "mean, bad and liars".
"What can happen and what's happening in the last few days in the Senate where people are angry, mean, mean and lying", he said.
"When there are obvious signs that the news is going to get out and the people in charge say, 'Oh no, it wasn't me.
I could never do that".
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you break the news?
Remember his answer-- did you reveal the contents of the document?
Oh, no, I'm not going to.
I didn't".
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
We revealed it...No, we didn't", she added imitating the senator.
The letter in which Ford accuses Kavanaugh was sent to Feinstein in July and the contents were leaked in early September, but Feinstein denies that the indiscretion was leaked from her office.
"I didn't hide Professor Ford's accusations, but I didn't reveal her story", Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
"He asked me to keep the information confidential, and I did".
But his denial is not credible to the president, who commented during the rally on Saturday night: "I tell you, this is just a bad example of body language.
Maybe he didn't, but this is the worst example of body language I've ever seen".
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court nominee, who has been accused of attempted sexual assault by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats are using these charges for their own purposes.
"They are trying to regain power by any means necessary.
They don't care who they harm, who they have to go over to take back power and control", the president said, as reported by Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee .
The Dundee Stars recovered from Friday's Elite League defeat to the Belfast Giants by winning the return leg 5-3 on Saturday in Dundee.
The Giants jumped out to a two-goal lead on shots by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie led the home team to a tie before Dwyer returned the Giants to the lead.
Francois Bouchard scored the equaliser for Dundee before two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen declared their victory.
It was the third defeat of the Elite League season for Adam Keefe's men who on Friday night in Belfast had bounced back and won the game against Dundee by 2-1.
The two teams have met four times this season, and the Giants have won their first three games.
Dwyer scored the first goal at 3:35 on an assist from Kendall McFaull, while Beauvillier doubled in four minutes on an assist from David Rutherford.
In what was a rather lively first half, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt provided the equalising assist to Cownie at 15:16.
Dwyer decreed the lead for the Giants by scoring the second goal of the night late in the first half.
The home team fought back and Bouchard won the tie after a strategic maneuver at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran contributed to Nielsen's action which led Dundee to the lead for the first time in the match at the end of the second half and decreed his team's victory by scoring the fifth goal mid-last period.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play their next home game in Milton Keynes on Friday.
Flight controller dies to allow hundreds of passengers to escape the earthquake
In Indonesia a flight controller will be hailed as a hero after he died allowing a plane carrying hundreds of people to take off and save them.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing as a powerful earthquake struck Sulawesi island on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue to hit the area and many are trapped under rubble in the town of Palu.
But even though his colleagues fled for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung remained in his seat in the control tower of Palu's Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport, which was swaying fearfully.
He wanted to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway, could take off safely.
He then jumped from the control tower when he thought it was going to collapse.
He died later in hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, Australian broadcaster ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to transport him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"This is really sad news for us", he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands and the National Disaster Response Agency says access to Donggala, Sigi and Boutong cities is restricted.
"The death toll is set to rise because many bodies are still under the rubble and many others have been unreachable", said agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves up to 20 feet high have devastated Palu, where a mass burial will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are carrying aid and food.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance is carrying bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
Supermarkets are being looted everywhere".
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is doing everything it can to help the survivors, but we don't know what they will find.
The situation is already tragic, but it could be much worse".
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's army men: "I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all evacuation activities.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
During the year, Indonesia had already been hit by earthquakes in Lombok, where 550 people had died.
Air Niugini now says one is missing after the lagoon crash
The airline that flew the plane that crashed into the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, after saying that all 47 people on board including passengers and crew were rescued, now claims that one is missing.
According to Air Niugini's news update on Saturday afternoon, a passenger is missing from the call.
The airline confirmed it is in contact with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for further details on the passenger, such as age or nationality.
Local boats were able to rescue the other passengers and crew after the crash occurred as the plane was attempting to land at Chuuk Island airport.
According to official sources, seven people were taken to hospital on Friday.
The airline says six passengers were taken to hospital on Saturday and are all in stable condition.
What caused the accident and the exact sequence of events are still unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy claim that the plane crashed into the lagoon because it missed the runway.
Some witnesses say the plane went off the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane came to a very low altitude.
"And it was really lucky", Jaynes said.
Jaynes then explained that he and others walked through the life-giving water to the plane's emergency exits.
He added that flight attendants panicked and screamed and that he was hit lightly in the head.
According to the U.S. Navy, some sailors who were working nearby to fix a pier also provided rescue by using a dinghy to carry people to shore before the plane sank into about 100 feet (30 m) of water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network indicates that over the past two decades 111 people have died in crashes involving PNG-registered airlines, but none of these have involved Air Niugini.
Analyst reenacts the night of the burnt woman
The prosecution's evidence in the retrial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014 concluded Saturday.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used cell phone data to reconstruct the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night she died.
According to The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett claimed to have recovered location data from several cell phones that prove that, contrary to what she claimed, Tellis was with Chambers the night she was killed.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers during the time he claims to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police spoke to Sanford.
Sanford appeared in court Saturday and testified that he was out of town that day.
When asked by the prosecutor if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, he confirmed that he was "lying because my truck was in Nashville".
Another inconsistency is the fact that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers for two weeks when she died.
Cell phone records indicate they've only known each other a week.
Rowlett explained that after Chambers died, Tellis deleted Chambers's texts, calls and contact information from her phone.
"He erased her from his life", Hale said.
The defense will begin its closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge expects the verdict to be passed to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
A hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative perception of the genre by putting positive messages into their songs.
The Bristol-based group The High Breed argues that hip-hop has strayed from its origins when it spread political messages and exposed social problems.
They want to go back to the roots and make a conscious hip-hop genre again.
Artists like the Fugees and Common have recently returned to the UK thanks to figures like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
New York nanny sues couple for firing her with "racist" text
A nanny in New York City sued a couple for discriminatory dismissal after mistakenly receiving a text message in which the mother complained about being "another black person".
The couple denies being racist by comparing the request to a real "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed her disappointment when she discovered that the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, who arrived for her first day of work in 2016, was black.
"NOOOOOOOOOOOO Another black woman", wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman in a message to her husband.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Miss Maurice, twice.
After realizing the mistake, the "embarrassed" Plasco-Flaxman fired Ms. Maurice, saying she was unhappy with their previous nanny, an African-American, and that she was expecting a Filipino, according to The New York Post.
He paid Miss Maurice for the day's work and sent her home in a taxi.
Maurice sued the couple and, because she was fired, she is seeking a beauty compensation of $350 a day for the six months of full-time work she was initially hired to do, even though she was not under contract.
"I want them to understand that they can't behave like this", he told the Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination".
The couple responded to the accusation of racism by saying that firing Maurice was the only thing to do as they feared they could not trust her after offending her.
"My wife texted me something she didn't mean.
She's not a racist.
We are not racist people", her husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
"Would you entrust your children to someone to whom you were rude, even if by mistake?
Your newborn?
I guess not".
Comparing the request to a real "extortion", Plasco said his wife had given birth just two months ago and was in a "very difficult situation".
"You can't get rough with a person like that.
It is not very nice behavior", the financial adviser added.
While the legal case is still ongoing, the court of public opinion immediately denounced the spouses on social media, sharply criticizing them for their behavior and logic.
A letter reveals that Paddington's publisher was afraid that readers would not appreciate a talking bear.
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, born shortly after the book was accepted, comments on the letter: "It's not easy to put yourself in the shoes of someone who read the book for the first time before it was published.
It's fun now that we know the huge success of Paddington".
Saying that his father, who worked as a cameraman at the BBC before writing the children's book inspired by a teddy bear, would not have reacted well to the rejection of his work, he adds that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was a bit "sad" after his death last year.
Regarding Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family", she adds that her father was modestly proud of her success.
"He was a quiet man, not a conceited one", he says.
"But Paddington was so real to him that he acted like when you have a child who achieves something, you're proud of it even if it's not your doing.
I think he interpreted Paddington's success that way.
Although it was a figment of his imagination, he credited Paddington himself".
I had to say goodbye on the phone to my dying daughter.
On landing, the daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
"Nad called me several times to tell me that the situation was really serious and that our daughter would not make it", says Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then she called to tell me that she was going to die in a few minutes and that I had to say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The effect of the medicines the doctors had given her to keep her heart pumping was slowly fading.
She died a little earlier and that was the end.
I had to sit and wait knowing all this was going on.
I couldn't complain, scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to hold back".
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, grieving over the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers unaware of what was happening to her.
"No one knew", he says.
"All the time I did was cry my head down.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane, I felt an incredible sense of solidarity with Nad.
I thought she needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her".
Tickets from two grieving women to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women whose loved ones have committed suicide strive to prevent others from doing the same.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted on a bridge in Wales postcards with motivational messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he started suffering from depression and killed himself at 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day", she says.
Davis, 45, of Lydney, says that her son was a promising chef with an infectious smile.
"Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said it lit up every room she walked into".
But before he died, he quit his job because depression had brought him "into a really dark place".
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found him after he took his own life.
Davis says, "I'm still afraid that a chain effect is happening".
He created the cards "to let people know that there is someone they can turn to to talk, even if it is a friend.
They don't have to isolate themselves, they have to talk".
Humphreys, who has been friends with Davies for years, lost Mark, her partner of 15 years, not long after his mother died.
"You never mentioned that he was down or depressed", she says.
"A couple of days before Christmas we noticed that his attitude had changed.
"Christmas Day hit rock bottom, and when the children opened their presents, he avoided looking them in the eye".
He says that his death was a huge trauma that they had to process: "It tore the family apart.
He tore us apart.
But we had to go ahead and fight".

Brett Kavanaugh's future is uncertain, and the FBI has begun an investigation.
"I think if we can proceed as you have asked, which is with a limited investigation in time and scope, we can reach an agreement", Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was "losing its cool" because of the blockade by entrenched supporters.
Why don't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI investigating?
Their reluctance is due to the timing.
With only five weeks left until the midterm elections on November 6th, if the Republicans get a negative result as expected, they will be greatly weakened in their bid to elect the man they have chosen for the Supreme Court.
George W. Bush called the senators and pressured them to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI completes its report?
It will be voted on in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It's still unclear if Kavanaugh will be able to get at least 50 Senate votes, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the deadlock and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
North Korean political refugees "decline" with Kim
A South Korean lawmaker says the number of North Koreans seeking political asylum in South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South Korean Unification Ministry, says that the number of refugees was 1,127 last year, compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park explains that the main reasons are tougher border controls between North Korea and China and higher tariffs on those who smuggle these people out.
Pyongyang has not made any public statements.
The vast majority of North Korean refugees are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most escape through China, whose border with North Korea is longer and easier to cross than the heavily guarded Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers them illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still technically at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
The two countries have already met in Pyongyang this month to discuss the stalled denuclearisation negotiations.
This follows the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed in broad terms to work together to rid the Korean Peninsula of nuclear weapons.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho criticized the US sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"Without trust in the United States we cannot be sure of our national security and under such circumstances there is no possibility that we will proceed to unilateral disarmament first", Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he's not fit to be on the Supreme Court.
Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi calls Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he is not qualified to hold the office.
Pelosi made the comments Saturday in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I think if a woman had acted the same way, they would have called her hysterical", Pelosi said of Kavanaugh's testimony Thursday before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Kavanaugh has visibly emotionally denied the allegation that he sexually harassed Professor Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
At the beginning of his speech, Kavanaugh was overcome with emotion, almost screaming and his throat clenched with tears as he talked about his family and high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the committee's Democrats who called the charges against him an "absurd and coordinated smear campaign" organized by liberals angry because Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi believes Kavanaugh's testimony proves he can't get on the Supreme Court because he's shown a bias against Democrats.
"I think he's been self-excluding with his statements and the way he's been talking about the Clintons and the Democrats", he said.
Pelosi then raised an objection when asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if he was confirmed and if the Democrats reached a majority in the House.
"I think if you don't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, not only are you not fit for the Supreme Court, but you're not fit for the court you're presiding over now", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she is concerned about Kavanaugh's potential decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, because he is considered a conservative judge.
At his confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh evaded questions about his intentions to overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
Pelosi said, "You can't send a hysterical, biased person to the Supreme Court and expect this decision to be taken positively".
And women have to use it.
It's a fair rant, months and years of tantrums that he can't get out of without crying.
"We cry when we're angry", Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's weird, do you?"
And she continued, "I was helped a lot by a woman who was a manager somewhere, and she told me that she cried when she was angry, but she had developed a technique where when she got angry and started crying, she would say to the person she was talking to, "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
But I'm mad".
And so it went on.
I thought his idea was brilliant".
Tears are tolerated as an outpouring of anger in part because they are basically not understood.
One of the clearest memories I have of a previous job in a male-dominated office is when I once started crying in a fit of rage, and an older woman, a manager I had always been slightly terrified of, grabbed me by the collarbone and dragged me down the stairs.
"Don't ever let anyone see you cry", she said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they're happy because they've got you".
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, partnered with Gary Hart in his presidential race.
In 1987, when Hart's extramarital affair was discovered on a boat called Monkey Business and she had to drop out of the race, Schroeder, very disappointed, thought there was no reason why she should not try to run for president herself.
"It was not a well-thought-out decision", he told me, laughing about it 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and we certainly didn't need another one.
Some called them "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".
With the campaign already in an advanced stage, Schroeder was behind schedule with fundraising and vowed she would not run unless she raised $2 million.
It was a lost cause at first.
She found that some of the supporters who had given male candidates $1,000 would only give her $250.
"Do they think I can get a discount?" she asked.
When she gave the speech announcing that she would not launch an official campaign, she was so overwhelmed with emotions (gratitude for the people who had supported her, disappointment with the system that made it harder to find money and voters than representatives and anger at the sexual discrimination she was a victim of), that she was moved.
"I looked like I was having a nervous breakdown", recalled Schroeder, thinking of the press reaction.
"Some might have thought that Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking about what they would write on my tombstone.
Maybe "She cried a lot".
How the US-China trade war could benefit Beijing
The opening blows of the US-China trade war have been loud, and while the battle is far from over, experts say a confrontation between the two countries could be beneficial to Beijing in the long run.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, has already issued the first warning this year by imposing taxes on major Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation came this week with new tariffs on goods worth over $200 billion, meaning that half of all goods from China will be taxed.
Beijing has responded each time with similar measures, recently imposing tariffs of five to 10 percent on $60 billion of American goods.
China has promised to respond to the US one blow at a time and it is unlikely that the world's second largest economy will back down anytime soon.
For Washington to back down, it would have to give in to its demands, but publicly bowing to the US would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Experts believe, however, that if Beijing plays its cards right, the pressures of the trade war with the US can have a positive effect on China in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision by Washington or Beijing could create the initial conditions for economic collapse in either country is actually far more dangerous than has been recognized so far", says Abigail Grace, an Asia researcher at the Center for New American Security.
Syria is "ready" for refugees to return, says foreign minister
Syria says it is ready for the return of refugees and is seeking help to rebuild the country devastated by more than seven years of war.
Speaking before the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country were improving.
"Today the situation in the territory is more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism", he said.
The government continues to recover areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normalcy.
Now all the conditions are in place for the voluntary return of refugees to the country who have been forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
According to the UN estimate, more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in Syria are in need of humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would gladly accept assistance in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he stressed that he would not accept any conditional or conditional aid from those countries that supported the insurgency.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating Team USA with a final score of 17.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The U.S. has lost six straight on European soil and hasn't won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the trophy when the Danish team of captain Thomas Bjorn scored the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
US Champion Phil Mickelson, who has struggled for most of the tournament, threw his tee shot into the water on the 16th hole of the par 3 giving Francesco Molinari the win.
The Italian golfer has distinguished himself in all his turns by becoming one of only four players to record a 5-0-0 since the tournament with the current formula was first played in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was defeated by a score of 5&4 by the lower ranked Danish player Thorbjorn Olesen of the European team.
The world's best player, Dustin Johnson, has surrendered for 2&1 to England's Ian Poulter who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
A veteran Ryder Cup player, Sergio Garcia of Spain, who played eight matches, became the most successful European player in the history of the tournament with 25.5 points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a rough year.
I'm grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy I won the cup back.
It is a team win and I am happy to have contributed", said an excited Garcia after the European victory.
He passes the baton to his compatriot John Ram who beat US golf legend Tiger Woods by 2&1 in the singles on Sunday.
"If I think about growing up watching his matches, I'm really very proud to have beaten Tiger Woods", said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods has lost all four of his matches in France and now his Ryder Cup totals are 13 wins, 21 losses and 3 draws.
A strange statistic when you consider he's one of the greatest players of all time having won 14 major titles, second only to Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA has spent the entire weekend trying to find fairways, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who have played top-level golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk said after his team's disappointing performance: "I'm proud of these guys because they fought.
At some point this morning we put pressure on Team Europe.
We threw this opportunity away.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players did very well.
I'm gonna work with the PGA of America and the Ryder Cup committee and we're gonna move forward.
I'm fond of these 12 boys and proud to be their captain.
We put our best foot forward.
But they played better than us".
Red tide update: concentration is decreasing in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota.
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows a general decline in red tide concentrations in parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, spotted flowering conditions, suggesting a decrease in concentration, are evident in areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties.
The red tide bloom extends for about 130 miles of coastline from northern Pinellas County to southern Lee County.
The spots are about 10 miles off the coast of Hillsborough County but in fewer areas than last week.
Red tide was also observed in Pasco County.
Last week, there was a mean concentration in Pinellas County or off its coast, a low to high concentration off Hillsborough County, a bottom to high concentration in Manatee County, a bottom to high concentration in Sarasota County or off its coast, a bottom to medium concentration in Charlotte County, a bottom to high concentration in Lee County or off its coast, and a low concentration in Collier County.
Respiratory irritation cases continue to be reported in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties.
While last week there were no reported cases in northwest Florida.
