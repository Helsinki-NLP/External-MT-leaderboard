He also said that the country is losing the necessary educational resources in engineering, medicine and accounting services because the educated people who receive free education leave the country not only because of themselves, but also because they are thinking about the country.

Many people have complained about this, but they do not seem to think about the alternative or to have a solution.
The only real solution is that if I do what I believe in, people will follow suit.

It's been going on for six months now, and it's getting used to it.
I am now very satisfied mentally".

The Election Commission has reduced the disqualification period of Chief Minister of Sikkim, who was convicted of corruption, from six years to one year and one month.
This has removed the ban on contesting the Daman Secondary Election.
Sikkim Assembly elections were held in conjunction with Lok Sabha elections.
Sikkim Grantigarhi Morcha won the election by a landslide.
The party's leader, Bremsing Damong, took over as Chief Minister.
But in a corruption case, in 2016, a lower court sentenced Tamang to prison.
He was jailed for this conviction by the Supreme Court.
The controversy erupted as a result of Tamang's election as a person who had been sentenced to prison for corruption could not contest elections for six years.
Daman is currently contesting the Sikkim Assembly by-election.
With the support of BJP, Tamang is running in Sikkim.
Meanwhile, Daman had sent a letter to the Election Commission, pointing to various legal provisions, demanding that the six-year ban on him from running for office be lifted.
The Election Commission, which has considered the letter, has announced that the period of suspension for Tamang will be reduced to one year and one month.
This does not prevent Daman from running for re-election.
The BJP can now start its politics in other states including Tamil Nadu using the offer given to Daman.
The election commission and the reports that are executed by the BJP may be issued at full capacity.

There are revolutionary movements before and after Bhagat Singh.
But it is not merely a compliment that Bhagat Singh and his comrades have given a new evolution and clear ideology to Indian politics through revolutionary movements.
We can still see a common opinion among the people that revolutionaries are just fools and ignorant of human life.
The Bhagathsinga period gives us a sense of their humanity, clear thinking and ability.
After the bombing of the assembly in April 1929, the name of the Bhagat Singh spread to India.
He was only introduced to the public in 1930 after a brief delay in Tamil Nadu.
But within a year of his debut, his fame spread rapidly to all corners of Tamil Nadu.
This is the most amazing news in history, that no leader born in North Nadu, including Gandhi, has ever spread in Tamil Nadu in such a short time.
It was because of them that Father Pariah was born.
The week after Bhatt Singh was killed, an editorial titled Bhatt Singh appeared in Republic Weekly.
The editorial praised the many characteristic interests of Bhagath Singh and offered some commentary on the political situation of the day.
Some excerpts from the editorial are:
"In fact, if Bhagat Singh was convinced that all his policies were right and that his example was the right way to implement them, we would say that if he decided that he should certainly follow his example and that he would not be a lucky man if he had not followed his example.
So let's call him a real man.
It is our strong belief that the Bhagat Singh policy is what India really needs.
If Mr. Bhagath Singh had not been executed and died, this victory would have been unlikely.
And we would say that if Gandhi had not been hanged, there would still be a movement for him.
Why did a mother who could be useful to show the Indian people the path of true equality and peace to the world, who would have to be a very sick and dying, even if she had to be a very sick and dying gray?
We commend Bhagath Singh with all our heart, with all our hands, saying that he is a great achiever who cannot be reached by anyone else by ordinary means".
This is what Father Periyar said in the editorial of the Republic.

I was shocked to hear that he was arrested for this, and he said that it is difficult for any 6-year-old to understand and explain this.

These are being implemented with the aim of human resource development in the education sector, the Ministry of Education said in a press release today.

John Keller, NASA's Deputy Director of the EROC Project, said: "The LROC Orbiter passed the South Pole of the Earth on 17th.
The company sent pictures taken in the dark.
The probe revealed that the Vikram lander crashed into the ground.
However, the exact landing location of the Vikram lander was not located.
LROC R Peter will pass through the South Pole again on 14th of next month.

There was no need to build more dams.
If necessary, the artist who was then the Chief Minister would have given permission to do so, and he would have set aside funds and accelerated the work.
Therefore, there is no way for Epapadi to blame the Union government for maintaining Kaveri's well-being.
I ask, how many barracks have you built in Kaveri in the last eight years of the A.T.M.C. rule?
Another question: We have built more than 40 dams in Tamil Nadu during the Damouk rule.
Can you point to a single commission as the dam built under the recent A.D.M.C. regimes?
Don't lie to me.
If the Leader of the Opposition has any response to his allegation, please inform the sources that we are building or planning to build barrages in other places.
Instead, I am obliged to point out that to speak outside the fact that no barrier was built in Kaveri under the DMK regime, it can be beautiful if it is desired by a private ladder, to the post of Chief Minister that he holds, it is neither a civilized act nor beauty", Durayamurugan said.

The deadline for linking Aadhaar with the PAN number has been extended till December 31.
This is the seventh time that the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDD) has extended the deadline for Pan-Aadhaar connectivity.
The Union Government had already extended this period for six months from 31 March to 30 September.
This period has now been extended for another 3 months.
The UIDAI is issuing a 12-digit identification number, Aadhaar number, to each Indian citizen.

Meanwhile, when filing the Income Tax Account, it is sufficient to specify Aadhaar instead of PAN number, as announced in the Union Budget on 5th July.
Today, the DMAK leader, M. K. Stalin visited the underground excavation sites that showcase the Vaibhav culture of Tamil.
The results of the excavation revealed that the biographical system of the Association's literature was the life of the Tamils who lived in blood and flesh and not in fiction.
Urban civilization on the banks of the Ganges in the north began in the 6th century BC.
But the Tamils lived a high urban life on the southern banks of the Vaibha River in the 6th century BC; the Tamils lived a very rich life as well as being the best in literacy, and the evidence of the excavations has proved scientifically.
The results of the bottom-up survey have created a position for revising and writing the history of the Indian subcontinent.
The underground excavation site is visited by a large number of people who are proud of every Tamil.
Recently, we visited the downstream excavation site by Seeman, the Chief Coordinator of the Tamil Party.
He was followed by Damoh leader M. K. Stalin who visited the excavations.
He was accompanied by a large number of leading executives of the CPM MPS Venkatesan and DMU.
In this regard, Stalin posted a video of his visit on his Twitter page entitled "When I visited the underground that made Tamil civilization more than 2600 years old known to the world".
Trump has asked the President of Ukraine to be questioned!
The White House confirmed that the reports that Donald Trump had asked the President of Ukraine by phone to conduct an investigation against Joe Biden, a potential Democratic presidential candidate, were true.
The Democratic Party has proposed a disqualification resolution in the House of Representatives against Trump, saying it was wrong to press foreign countries to investigate the US president.
Six committees have been set up and an inquiry into the President's actions has been launched in this regard by the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi.
In this regard, Trump spoke to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on the phone on July 25, so conduct an investigation", Trump said.
The White House officially released a statement yesterday on the talks between the two presidents.
So it is accepted that this conversation took place.
Meanwhile, Donald Trump, speaking to reporters outside the UN meeting, said the request was made in a friendly manner.
He said that no pressure was put on the President of Ukraine.
But one thing to note is that the US government abruptly suspended some $400 million in financial aid to Ukraine.
After some time, the fund was allocated.
The Democrats are closing this with the same comment that Trump made to the President.
So this incident is beginning to make a storm in American politics.

The 70 skeletal samples discovered in the study have been sent to Deacon College, a postgraduate and research institution for scientific analysis.
The species of the turtle were classified by nature and were identified by turtle, deer, goat, wild boar, gallows and gulls.
The study also examined the use of cattle, goats and goats as a food source, as well as the presence of cuts in some animal models such as cattle, goats, and wild boar.
The results of this analysis showed that the people of the Sangakkala society who were primarily agricultural were also involved in livestock raising.
Samples of brick-shaped roof tiles and earthenware-based ceramic tiles have been sent to the Valur Technical University for analysis.
Each of these minerals, including silicon, lead, iron, aluminum, and magnesium, are found in the study.

Is the BJP taking over the established caste politics in Tamil Nadu?
It is said that in Tamil Nadu, if somehow the copper cannot be cleaned and bloomed, the BJP will eventually take over the caste politics.
When Modi was Prime Minister for the first time, Tamil Nadu was in a situation where it was necessary to leave the tamarisk behind and look at the dust.
After this, for the second time, during the last MP election, Amitabh Shah said, "You don't know what to do.
However, only the soil was able to clog all five seats.
The whole country is beating the BJP but the wave of opposition is still going on in Tamil Nadu.
It is, after all, the issue of Tamil, Kashmir, Hindi, one nation, one language.
And this is all combined and still in the process of being seen.
This is why the BJP leadership is so angry with the Tamil Nadu BJP executives and is said to be the reason why the state leadership is still too difficult to appoint.
This is one side, but the BJP is planning to root out the BJP in Tamil Nadu by the next legislative elections.
It seems that the BJP leadership has come to a conclusion through live field report, intelligence report and so on.
Accordingly, the opinion among the society that both Dravida parties, whether they are Aam Aadmi Party or DMCA, do not give enough importance to the Nadar people, the Vaniyar people and the Devendra people is not enough.
It is said that the Dravida parties are also regretted.
This is the situation that the BJP has been trying to implement.
He has decided to honour a position in a way that honors or promotes the particular race of the society.
The appointment of Tamil Nadu Govt. of Telangana is one such thing.
Similarly, the BJP government is also reportedly giving importance to senior officials at ISRO.
It is true that if BJP acts in this way to honor every ethnic group, it will bring pride and happiness to the people of that ethnic group.
And, in any case, the same thing that is not funny, this caste will be funny to the BJP in politics.
At the same time, while Tamil Nadu is already becoming a landmark in caste politics, it is not clear whether these BJP activities will become like pouring more oil on a burning fire.
It is true that if the caste fire started to burn, even the cluster of tamarinds that are now flourishing in Tamil Nadu would have been burned by the same fire!

Youth are the most affected by road accidents and awareness raising programmes like this should be conducted in schools and colleges to prevent this.
Everyone should follow the traffic rules to save their lives, not to impose fines.
Students must wear a helmet when driving in two-wheeled vehicles and never use a cell phone when driving.
Driving vehicles should be done after proper knowledge of road rules.
Drivers should have adequate cooperation with traffic police.
If every college administration keeps track of students following the rules of the road, it can save precious lives of students.
The future of the country is in the hands of the youths and it is an essential duty of the traffic police and the public to protect them.

The reason for this is the Centre's firm conviction that Jammu and Kashmir is India's domestic affair.
Political observers say that Modi has not spoken a word about Jammu and Kashmir, as Pakistan wants it to become an international issue.
This has given the message to the world that Kashmir is India's domestic affair.
